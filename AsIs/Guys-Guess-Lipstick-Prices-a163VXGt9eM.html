guessing the prices sticks for your lips
would stick guys I hate lipstick
I think lipstick is gone sometimes it
gets on your teeth sometimes it comes
off and hands it doesn't like all these
different things I don't know that much
it's made out of like insects and like
rhino horns or something that's like
serial killer dude are we talking about
it's not true that's like closer to like
a bottle of Tabasco sauce what's up that
is not a stick this is bug blood for
sure I don't know what I'm doing Oh
relax I do that trick did I tell you it
was surprisingly easy to apply this
seems like a good way to put lipstick on
your lip got him so mad
I feel like I might still be away all
right so we'll do the cup test oh I am
parched that I feel that rose geeked all
over that try kiss one of these baby
boys first any of them except for Eugene
no only kiss Keith I'm gonna say that
this little Jabra cost seven dollars Wow
$35 for dnews I was gonna say for u-238
Oh soon okay this one looks really fancy
that does look fancy that's like a fancy
box and a classic twist up yeah was that
mean I'm the one in the only Tyrone
Fendi really get it on there
shut up Shane I'm ported to god it he's
a good-looking baby boy why are you
quivering I'm not quivering I just have
shaky hands
he's quite okay so you look like you
know what you're doing you've said
you've done this before that guy's yeah
I gotta say I don't like it oh this is
one of those like $50 let's do
sixteen dollars $80 I'm go to $32 $42
you makes movies and lipstick it's weird
to be this close to your lips are you a
funny one that's how Kylie's nothing
yeah
what I don't have a face for lipstick
I'm just gonna come to terms with it
about how am I looking
not good oh I think this is cheap I'm
gonna say $6.99 $22 21 $94 to the
lipstick 99 cents and stuff is probably
straight up cause you're gonna die in
seven days this definitely looks like a
genital oh yeah that smells like a
Jenner
I don't know how generous what the heck
how do you guys eat the corners
we're just jam it in there how's it feel
hmm oh it's smooth oh wow adding oh wow
look at that
now let's dry it feels like it's clay
straight-up clay looks like a little
anus on my face it does look like little
and yet Elena's on your face buddy what
wouldn't be the first time nothing
68 48 I'm gonna go speak $39.99 $40
that's a really cool trick that does so
I'm gonna put it a 1517 dollars in that
cool party trick that's definitely worth
it to me frankly I think this is my
favorite I think that also may come from
you just doing a good job applying it
I'm for it this is something that I like
I feel like I could invest in it's cool
to me oh I probably hate lipstick even
more now before I was just like well
there must be something about it it must
be some sort of hype now I don't have
that benefited out anymore
you look like trash but you look awful
and look at me 99-cent smile over here
but worth a million dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
