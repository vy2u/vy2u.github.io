through the hole then nibble around it
stopping to suck and once in a while it
seems like a lot of work
sounds interesting because you're
supposed to eat the donut but you can't
eat too much of it because then it will
fall off the penis there's actually a
doughnut I thought it was a metaphor I
want to say that the grossest thing I've
ever heard it's like breakfast in bed in
a way sprinkle a little pepper under his
nose right before he climaxes sneezing
can feel similar to an orgasm and
amplify the feel-good effect so that
means that you have pepper by your bed
now this one I'm not I'm not for also
the timing of it has got to be a little
weird orgasms do not feel like sneezing
I'm not that coordinated I'm releasing a
lot of nasty congestion well maybe it is
similar jiggle the balls back and forth
with your hand like you're shaking dice
in a cup I love the word jiggle I like
that for all the cramps players out
there this won't work it's like clown
juggling and training or something cut
that is the worst tip anyone could give
anybody move my penis all around like an
old-school Atari joystick up down side
to side in a circle and if you do the
Konami code I get 30 lives the penis is
not a game it's a penis I think that's
just gonna be very boring much like
Atari that will cause internal bleeding
why is everyone so mad at penises like
what's going on
yeah mostly just have two steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
