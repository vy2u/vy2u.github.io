a spa I've never done a mani or patty or
I don't facial my sister used to paint
my nails whether I'd asked her to or not
uh but is the first spa experience I I
do have a couple concerns about the
waxing I'm surprised how many steps go
into this I thought it was gonna like
you know clip your fingers give me a
thumbs up and on my way she dripped some
goo on my hands feels really good I
really I'm really enjoying this actually
a record yeah I don't know why I have
not done this before this is terrific
uh Alicia's being very gentlemen I
appreciate it's like a massage and more
for my feet I assume my feet get washed
in the shower you know yeah I was a
little water runs right past it there's
so many problems with my feet I I
couldn't begin to imagine what she's
doing to it next that feels delicious
belzoni think she might have put honey
between my toes I'm not really sure why
doesn't really make any sense why she
would do that but you know there's been
a lot of things going on today that I
haven't quite understood like all this
like this mismanagement of my body is
because I didn't know my body well
enough today
now I'm so much wiser it's impossible to
not smile while she does this cuz it
just it's just so nice I'm so happy
right now she extracted which at home I
just call that popping zits of all the
things I've been doing here I could
easily see myself paying to come back
and
again it's so ah what it just keeps this
is nice I don't know why everybody it
doesn't have these every day everybody
oh whoa oh cool we're waxing already
good oh no this is gonna be nothing but
Pleasant ah the AH my question like is
this worth it but hmm no it's fine
that feels fine I feel I'm fine actually
I think that feels fine was it done
nope not even close I would never expect
a woman to do this so for women to say
that it's expected I'm not from me
okay that's hot I got this horrible
realization that this upsetting feeling
that I'm having right here some people
get everywhere I was surprised by how
fun it was this is absolutely worth the
money yeah I'll react differently when
my girlfriend tells me she's going to
the spa because I no longer believe
that's a chore I might do the waxing
again just as a kind of a personal
challenge next time my wife tells me
she's going to go to the spa
I'm going to ask if I can come too and I
don't think she's gonna like that
I think she uses that as her own
personal time and she's going to get
pretty annoyed when I'm nipping at her
heels asking if I can tag along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
