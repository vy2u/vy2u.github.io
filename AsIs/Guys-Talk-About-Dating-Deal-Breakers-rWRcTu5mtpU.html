really shallow impressive for you if
they haven't seen Star Wars it's just
like nope nope sorry if you start
picking on the stuff that I like if the
other person says that they think video
games are for kids
I'll probably just pay for the check and
just walk out people that are like too
into or into it all even reality
television I just don't get it I think
you can have different tastes then the
person that you're dating as long as you
respect each other you don't need to
break up because I like country music
and I like dubstep as long as we're
talking like top 40 contemporary country
you're at the bottom of the barrel under
stagecoach in it bad fashion choices I
think it's a big red flag for me when
someone thinks they look really nice in
something when they don't that mean yeah
yeah that's kind of mean I don't date
for and I'm like oh he's hot oh he's
fine for not so much I have dated a
couple girls are taller than me I'm okay
with it
a small deal-breaker for me it's not
having nice teeth because I had to go
through you know a few years to get this
beautiful teeth thank you no I don't
care about her oh I care so much about
hygiene there you know in here like a
little like oh look a little I see no I
can't deal with spacers but that's what
they're called cages oh God what do you
do with your ears in the future you fool
like if a guy has a small dick it's like
a what if his heart is big if I see a
girl who has problems or is gonna drag
the X along baggage baggage also problem
when they physically bring baggage to
the date I was with someone very briefly
who loved cocaine the things that you
have to go through when you're with
somebody who really likes okay it's the
biggest pain yes I mean how how you
compete with cocaine you can't compete
with cocaine sure drinking drive some
some fun but like when you have an
obsession oh you're not going to work
now because you you're doing too many
drugs it's an issue also if you hate
gays that's no good you have a lot of
other problems if you're racist or
homophobic I would say no to a racist I
mean if they're hot I'm saying I really
hate when people try to tell me about my
own
before I say anything about it don't
tell me how much you know about kimchi
well they're not nice they're friends
it's a good indicator of how they'll be
within the relationship I'm a very
social person so I like somebody that is
just as social I have a few tests that I
do with guys when I'm dating them I'll
have dinner with what your friends and
I'll take him along with me and then I
will excuse myself to the restroom if
they're not talking and they're not
conversing with somebody it's a good
turn-off
I don't like people who are constantly
on their cell phones like this do not
keep your cell phone on the table during
a date I don't like if a girl expects me
to pay for every single meal I'm not a
millionaire a sugar daddy yeah I'm not a
sugar daddy
I can't even sugar myself something I've
experienced out on the field is that
something I'm calling emotional
catfishing girls are looking so smiley
in their photos and then I've been on a
date with them and they're just
completely detached it can be a little
vulnerable so don't like I let people
touch my belly do you know what that is
I don't testing to see if my belly
strong what yes not I don't think I have
that many deal-breakers at the end of
the day you're not gonna find someone
that you may doubt the things that I
think that I may not like in someone I'm
hoping to be proven wrong except for the
reality TV one everybody needs a little
bit of love that's what I think wish you
have small dick unless you have a small
dick deal-breaker
that's a deal that's a deal back to deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
