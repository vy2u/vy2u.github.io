okay I mean unless you want him I think
that would have a big decision would
make mutually yeah we'll talk about that
me my team we're having a conversation
about how guys act with their best
friends and girls act with their best
friends and sort of the differences and
similarities we noticed that there's
like a big difference between just the
way friends talk to each other and
validate their friendship where girls
will say I love you to their best
friends frequently it's all my close
girlfriends I love them pretty much all
the time like every time that I talk to
my friends I tell them that I love them
all the time probably every time we get
off the phone or are done talking or
texting or they say something funny I am
always like I love you always like hug
them and say I love them just you know
cuz I mean it and guys never say it or
only say it when they're drunk so it's
just interesting I wanted to talk to you
guys about like what whether they should
I guess I do think it's weird to say I
love you to your guy friend because I've
never said I love you to any of my guy
friends I don't know why that's
uncomfortable but it is guys don't like
that kind of thing I think it was just
kind of always understood like you know
we're bros love each other no way I feel
like I'd be alienating my other guy
friends if I only said I love you to one
of them you know it's a it's not
something that I sit there saying I wish
I could say I love you to this guy but
it's it's just not normal you know I
don't have that problem it just doesn't
doesn't doesn't come out I do think it's
important and kind of saying that makes
me realize that I don't do it enough and
then we decided to actually I bring
groups of best friends in and have them
say I love you to each other yeah so we
met at a party through a mutual friend
and I think he looked close to me so you
know he laughed at my jokes I laughed at
his jokes we understood each other and
that was kind of every day after work he
calls me on his way home and we talk
about her days you guys talk about your
day
every day we kind of do actually like a
a handshake I love you then what you're
gonna do I love you you're making it
awkward okay I love you man
I love you yeah I love you too man I do
thanks
it's kind of like buddy-buddy but we
kind of joke a lot about how we kind of
go on mandates a lot
so getting Froyo is one of our big
bonding things I know it should be
drinking beer and like trying to get
girls but we're really bad at both of
those things so it's like all the things
you'd probably do by yourself you just
do with that with that buddy I love you
Shawn oh thank you Nate mmm I feel like
I don't tell you enough but I I love you
as a friend you've been one of my best
friends in LA so just want to let you
know I love you man I like her you had
to qualify it you know you've got a lot
of great friends elsewhere all right all
right Phil and I have been friends since
college
well he's really open-minded he's funny
uh Phil is one of those guys for me who
it's like I just want to hang out with
him and you know I don't we don't need
to do anything in particular we don't
need to go get brunch
you just hang out with Phil do we just
jump right into it and uh say - you go
first
all right I love you Phil I love you
soon
well alright oh holy I think we're so
comfortable with an hour part this'll be
an everyday occurrence yes it's it's
easier now we can say it again thank you
I love you I love you I love you and
then as I was making the video it just
seems like it's wrong for me to shoot
and talk to all these guys about this
but I'm actually do it so I decided to
call my good friend band so I'm gonna do
it - yeah I regret doing this you never
read it I'm happy to be here alright
well let's just do it
yeah all right then I love you I love
you too man here we can hug hug it out
yeah I think the hug was more awkward
than the I love you
how are you that yeah take that Hector
normativity yeah we got no problem we
got no problem with it we're the new
21st century American males oh no I mean
it's I don't know it's not natural
I guess cuz I don't love me no I love
you I love you man
I love you it's just I don't know the
stools this is lights I mean there's so
many reasons as to why this is the
natural</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
