associate it with women I hear the word
modeling straight away and I look at me
and I just sort of think no that's not
something I would ever do or you know it
would be capable of doing I have no idea
what I've got myself into what comes to
my mind when I hear that men want to do
pinup I think it's awesome like why not
when I pick a pinup I think of course
it's big hair red lips so I'm interested
to see how that all is gonna translate
into me a little bit scared little bit
nervous but a bit of excitement too when
I think of have a only thing of women or
men also do it they do um and I think
that's the really beautiful thing about
this particular genre I feel like there
are no boundaries because I'm quite
lanky and long uh will that translate
that's gonna work to your advantage as
well for your style I think you're gonna
love it
all right I'm excited I can't wait to
see what I get funded I can't waterfall
oh my goodness
when I was a kid we'd get our face
painted but since then I have never
really enjoyed having makeup put on my
face but it's really quite light and not
that extreme so it doesn't feel like
it's gonna be too crazy I'm feeling much
more excited now I have my makeup done
and I'm probably looking a bit more
decent and camera-ready so yeah bring on
the costume I am feeling things I've
never felt before my life it sort of
feels like there are alien life-forms on
my head right now but I'm gonna do it
I've never worn makeup before the
closest I've come to this is like a
Halloween costume as a kid I'm really
into the pampering here used to this
nervous okay we'll go for it oh my oh
wow I sort of just looked like a madame
tussauds version of myself oh wow the
makeup is great let's go to the wild
west it's a good look I could deal with
it
I feel fierce like I feel I feel like
I'm something I look pretty hot I felt
great about myself felt confident I just
assumed this kind of totally nutcase
character that I would probably never so
set myself with and actually just leave
some of my hangups
maybe daily hangups and just be someone
else at the beginning of this I very
much thought 50s pinup I thought that
would sort of something I put on the
Shelf associating it with women but now
what I've learned throughout today's
process is that it's really not gender
specific at all something in me was just
like let it go just do it just just go
with it
I felt excited I felt satisfied I felt
attractive
I felt handsome I've often thought that
makeup seems like such an effort for
people to do even if they feel happy
with that but seeing the results I was
like it does make a difference I don't
think it's something I'll do on a
day-to-day basis but I can see why
people do it for themselves my
perspective a pinup of conventional
femininity of makeup of hair is totally
changed after today I realized that a
lot of things that we use to define
gender is actually just a pose to close
its hair as things I can totally change
even before I saw myself in the mirror
just when we were doing hair and makeup
I felt myself sort of changing knowing
that I was being transformed to a woman
I thought I'd look into the mirror and
see myself as demure or sexy but I
actually looked into the mirror and saw
myself as like powerful and dominant and
fierce it really just comes down to how
you want to express yourself from
dressing as a sailor all the way to
the very feminine side that we've seen
and they're all quite acceptable and
enjoyable and they all look great
everyone should feel sexy at least once
in their life clothes hair makeup
they're not really for other people
they're for you so you can choose how
you want to define them in any way men
love to be someone else
just as much as women do men love to get
into costume and and you know assume a
role and I think don't knock it till you
try it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
