eye oh wow what the did I just do
I grew up in the 90s but didn't know
much about nineties makeup when I hear
90s makeup I think of Britney Spears and
everything that she's wears crystals and
jewels on your face stuff on your face
Oh a lot of shiny stuff
it seems like no one knew their color
and like their neck and face are always
different colors in the nineties
sometimes looks like poop to me on it
I feel like I look like Little Richard I
look beautiful for the 90s but I look
like I'm from like a zombie movie I'm
gonna do purple because yeah it says I'm
fine yeah that's what I was brown lips
white face pale white face dead I think
in the 90s they made everyone's eyelids
colorful and then our time they just
made it ones hair that color like I'm
mixing a tea to make up with ninetieth
makeup and it's between like kiss and
clueless just one of my eyes look good
this side is just perfection
Cheers okay I feel like the 90s were
like the golden years before the world
turned it don't I'll do that when you're
out but I'll lipstick my lips are the
same color as my jacket you gotta have a
fake mole I feel like those are popular
yeah like Cindy Crawford every single
addition I do I look scarier I'm not
putting jewels on my face you gotta keep
it straight
no I look dead you are I'm dead he's
dead
we're out
I'm gonna do say I look hot I feel sexy
I I think I know what I'm doing I think
I nailed the 90s look to a tee I don't
look like anyone I saw in the 90s I'm
like stress just looking at myself I'm
like not that upset about how I look I
feel like I need to take a shower
I'm actually not happy with how not
glittery this is I didn't want to do
this for 10 minutes 10 minutes and I
know girls who do this for an hour and
god bless you for doing it I was a woman
doing this on the day-to-day you better
get real good real quick I need a darker
position you look like a bad drag queen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
