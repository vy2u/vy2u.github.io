guys look weird with chokers on I'm
wearing chokers for whole damn day today
this is such a 90s trend I really hope
that I can pull it off I am so afraid to
put on a necklace
I remember high school days to wear a
lot is to be cool with hot / sexy
everyone should wear whatever they're
comfortable wearing regardless of who it
is designed for this one looks like a
bikini bottom it was like my
ex-girlfriend song this looks like
lingerie like this is something I would
hope my girlfriend would wear for me on
Valentine's Day
imagine went on a date with this it was
so baby haha now this is my choker yeah
we could share one share we could say I
got like a choker with a dangle
situation right these two just kind of
like hang low is that how this one works
there's some chokers that was definitely
not where I'm not gonna walk around with
love on my damn neck love love this one
holy crap I love love I want to wear
this one feel like this is the classic
choker yeah this is gonna be the one I'm
picking this look like some dominatrix
stuff yo here put a muzzle on a dog and
they look at you like they feel betrayed
by you
no no how about dog feels when I put a
muzzle on
you look like a little sex toy man this
is dangerous because ladies are just
gonna be like come here Cody come on we
could just pull you around the office
like I don't like it I don't like it I'm
used to typically I look he was like the
all-american boy and I certainly don't
be a choker on and all of anymore
I just walked past the valet attendant
who are pretty tough guys and they said
what's up brother and I felt very
insecure about this choker on my throat
so I blew a big old snot rocket to make
myself seem more manly
I'm getting vibes of like a little puppy
but then also like BDSM and I've never
seen those two so close together
every time somebody walked by I'm hiding
one thing that I learned is that like
fashion and one of the things is just
about like how confident you are so if
you feel confident in it and you exude
that then people aren't gonna bat an eye
they're gonna be like oh why didn't I
think about her I'm madly I'm less
knotted on you than I was on that on you
it looks like alternative with different
fun edgy like being edgy yeah
own it like that use edging it out a
little bit like he is a very like
all-american boy I could like model for
Abercrombie but this is a little bit
like a model for urban outfitters or
hospital no not hot topic series BDSM I
would wear it but not in public probably
in the bedroom
I've been avoiding walking out of here
and actually this guy without his choker
I just caught him right now waiting his
neck not a second off I took it off for
one minute I've been avoiding walking
out of here I've been in the second
floor all day oh oh what about wearing
it all day did you not get I've been
wearing this all day and these guys
ain't working it I deserve a raise
down to show any the new look it's kind
of cool because you have your tattoo
poking through I definitely would never
want you to wear it ever again not gonna
be wearing it we go to dinner later okay
I don't like it
it looks cool on you and coming from
someone who wear sugars all the time
like I think it looks cute
I think I prefer about chokers if you
really want to wear them we can find one
that maybe doesn't say love across it
with love you of all people with with I
love love I just don't love your choker
thank you well here we are at the
darkest restaurant possible I'm pretty
sure Annie picked it so no one else
could see my choker I walked in honestly
slightly embarrassed I wanted the time
to take it off there were two guys
standing in the corner that were kind of
like looking and smiling I wanted to say
like oh it's a joke for a video but I
just had this quick realization right I
don't care men shouldn't care people
deal with this every day where they want
to wear something but they're afraid
that they're going to be judged Rakesh
so I just had dinner with my
girlfriend's father and I felt very
insecure about my choker I wanted him to
like me and I found myself hiding my
throat because I didn't want him to look
at me
he liked to no matter what he likes my
personality but I definitely felt
insecure this is something I got to work
on so I made it through the day it's
definitely not something that I would
ever want to do again it's not really my
style but I still think it was a good
lesson and just trying not to care about
what other people think getting out of
my comfort zone and other guys wanted to
do this I say go for it
wearing the choker all day it was weird
the attention I was getting I think was
getting more attached because this
choker knows that give it more sexual
than anything the person that motivated
me the most Chantal one thing that I
found is like if we weren't socialized
to care then we wouldn't care so just
don't care you know you know what I'm
saying you know what I'm saying
oh I mean every time I talk I can feel
my love bouncing this doesn't feel right
