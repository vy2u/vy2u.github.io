whoa and that's what you normally do
don't you you go like this and you're
like oh I'm really a lady yeah by the
end of the day it'll feel like I don't
to my head into a vat of lard I get a
lot of dandruff if I don't shampoo it
often have you ever heard anything about
dry shampoo so all I know about dry
shampoo is that it's dry in the shampoo
so with dry shampoo it absorbs all the
oil and he accesses what that you have
and kind of refreshes the way you look
we're gonna see as a challenge to see
how long you can extend your blowout
without washing your hair are you ready
for this
yep okay let's do it what you do by a
shampooing is that you remove the
natural oil which is good to do not
every day so because you're doing it
twice a day it's over producing now
you're doing your all-around curls are
not lasting as long right so you're also
feeling that your stuff is dry by
dandruff so what we did was we put a
curl cream in with some oil and kind of
give it hydration so what you're gonna
do is you're gonna hold it in you're
gonna spray really quickly hold spray
really quick a little bit here put it
together and then just kind of pushes
you into the stuff so what I mean by
judge is kind of move the product around
kind of like that mm-hmm it's like a
magnet for oil any like debris any extra
like lies that you're telling people
yeah they'll just pick that right
up yeah I know it feels like it's full
of secrets I use way too much because my
hair was white
I just got a haircut as you can see on
the sides and nothing was touched in the
top I'm looking fresh this is definitely
the least gross my head is felt after a
workout shower time I feel like I should
be scolding somebody for stealing my pie
starting to get a little bit worried
though because I'm starting to see a
little bit of the dandruff and then just
go like this see it's white oh my god
alright heading out for the night my
hair is pretty much still intact you can
still see a little bit of the flakiness
coming out but I'm pretty happy like I
don't have any itching is after walking
all around downtown and taking the train
and not showering for both these days I
really thought that it was gonna build
up into like a cake it's still really
dry I'm not very happy right now isn't
how my hair looks it looks okay it's
kind of crazy but it feels like I'm
wearing a hat made of blue well it's
safe to say that I failed the style
challenge I played with my hair for like
ten more minutes doesn't look to that
and they have mostly one the dry shampoo
challenge in that I used it and my hair
does not feel a little terrible even
though it is a little bit nasty right
now my takeaway from this week is just
to cut back on the shampooing I'll
probably be watching my hair maybe like
once every two or three days and there's
just less products more profitable
