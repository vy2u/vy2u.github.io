didn't know holiday makeup was a thing
you know what they say about glitter

rose petals the purpose of foundation is
to cover up your past yeah you know if
you had a rough year you didn't have
such a good Halloween just bet it cover

of my apartment

look very healthy I'm sorry I do girls
use their fingers make up like a bit of
warping did you cut your nose like oh no
you kind of draw people in with your
shimmer like a Christmas tree a wise
woman said the eyes are the nipples of
the face what I've learned it looks good
to leave it alone
I did this I good this eye looks like I
got hit with a softball it felt like the
hands of a surgeon okay look at this eye
look but don't look at this oh yes that
whole like ariana grande Lake I feel
like her eyelid is so big when I blend
my eyes is my whole eyes turns purple
eyebrows are sisters not twins so in
this case I guess my eyes are cousins

moisturizer on my hands makeup probs I'm
gonna feels like I'm putting Elmer's
glue on my eye my kinda looks like a

burning is it because this makeup is
fire eyeliner cute scary music oh drunk

far

hoping when I put in my fake eyelashes

straitjacket it's the holidays people
