and I'm here to show some men some poll tricks. 
I've seen pole dancing before... I won't say how.
I'm certain I'm not strong enough.
I'm two hundred and fifty pounds and I have to move that up and down a pole and that's bad news for everybody...
do you guys have any experience on the pole.
*laughing* no...
Roll down partition. 
holding yourself up. Hold that for 5 seconds. 
Don't slide. 
Oh my god. Wait this is like from Mulan. 
Be a man! 
Use those muscles!
*screaming*
Elbow in. 
So you're jumping. I want you to be like a sail even glide.  
That's what I... That's what I'm missing technique. 
you better work. 
I need a second... I need a second.
Bend it just a little bit. Boom!
Get up, pick up that leg!
I'm flying!
Oh that was it! 
This is where that good upper body strength comes in. 
What if we have zero of that.
You know we're going to work on that. 
No strength. 
Keith you look like you're about to poo. 
I feel similarly. 
I can't do that. Take her down! Take her down! OH YEAH! 
Nothing says come over ladies like a bruise on your arm. 
The most important part is getting your butt over your head... Here, Like that. 
That's where I'll die. 
*screaming*
So keep your legs straight.
Press over your legs. 
*laughing* Great job! Woooo! 
*hooahh ooooh*
Roll up, yeah that was good. That was good, but extend your legs for both of you guys. 
That rainbow yeah. 
It looks so wrong but it feels so right. 
I would good bank on you. 
Thank you. 
*screams* oh my god! YES! 
That was awesome you guys! How do you feel? 
Oh, sexy. 
You guys are hardcore. 
I had a long history of climbing trees as a child and I think that helped a little bit today. 
Uh today I learned that I am fat and weak. 
No it was really fun. It's almost impossible. 
I didn't break my neck... I thought that was going to happen. 
So much credit given to people that do this for a living. 
You're like the Albus Dumbledore of pole dancing, thank you. </div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
