galaxy do Barry took a huge
previously Kelsey Stella guys here first
time she gave me some really really
great curls I get to style sissy's hair
after she did this I have a lot of hair
I'm comfortable with dealing with a lot
of hair but this is gonna be a little
more of a challenge I have two younger
sisters and the most I've ever really
done is braid but we're not gonna be
braiding today thank God so you're gonna
put my hair not so we're going to be
braiding today I'm gonna make you look
really cute I'm gonna make it look like
lemonade what if I mean I'm thinking
about our good friend and colleague
curly I give him credit for trying to do
this how do you usually part your hair
you do it down the middle or do you do
it to the side I do it doesn't matter
we're gonna do it down the middle
she's very hard if this is the hardest
part I'm really worried about the rest
I'm a fast learner
I actually I believe that this on my
hair is already dry I feel like a fairy
just on me I really like an 80s
prom yay what I can see and I'm already
mad cuz I know it's dumb did I just dump
all the glitter hold on oh yeah making
me into a craft project breeze you're
here are you just doing three different
section I'm gonna give them not I'm
gonna give you the brie and like the
curl here
what do you think that that dryer he's
gonna make it open place maybe we need a
hair gel make sure that the glitter is
like really stuck in there how do you
end it you use a hair tie what if I
don't have one I feel like one of those
old women in the movies that like runs
out in their nightgown and curlers let's
add white you were freaking out about
that might have been too much huh don't
go wait for this you have to like
lightly touch it with your fingers I'm
not gonna touch this thing need like
clips this might help for do you see how
much hair is in this freaking brush make
sure that this is really close to the
your hair your head right pull the top a
little bit how's that I just have so
many we're taking a little bit like miss
Frizzle okay
yeah that's kind of cute we're gonna do
like a glitter bread oh
good rule of thumb is kind of like
halfway up the hair if you want it to be
look okay well I would be comfortable
wearing my hair like that but this isn't
your hand no one thing he's good at guys
I have a date after work today of it
he's gonna be like you don't look like
your tinder profile it's really hard to
do men's or women's hair a lot of
respect for hairdressers oh no no that's
disgusting there's so much gel in it
yeah what was pretty good is this it
yeah I don't think it doesn't know at
least you haven't burnt my hair yet I'm
really proud of your braids you did a
good job
Oh glitter tips skin it it's like a new
thing I'm ready to show me my first date
look not the worst thing I've ever seen
you could have just picked one of these
things did a better job on me than I did
on you Oh God
look at this this is gonna be the worst
shower of my life I would do it again it
didn't go as bad as it could've as a guy
I'm only used to having just a small
amount of hair it definitely took more
effort to get all the product in there
yellow Apple hair every girl wants to
hear
and you're in public</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
