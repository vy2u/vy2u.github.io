I'm about to put on some kind of
hellscape on to my face that's supposed
to really just seep in and then rip out
all the stuff in your pores sometimes I
take care of my skin no I don't I really
don't my skin is very sensitive I never
shaved my face because as soon as I
shaved my face I immediately break out
even if it is painful that sounds really
satisfying knowing that all that crap is
getting removed I want to see what the
product looks like the help or cleanup
mask Hots in another language what does
it say help or I'm really into the
packaging it's a pig that's sucking
black heads into its fish pigs do not
have four so this doesn't make sense
there's a in a weird box this doesn't
rip out your hair huh
I can't put in my eyebrows don't
whatever's sticky hmm that is a terrible
sensation I don't really like the way
that feels scream ah face baby got a
cure that's good oh my god it's starting
to change the temperature of my face
this actually feels going but there's
own unit mm-hmm I'm gonna look sexy in a
couple of minutes you're gonna move yeah
that's the only exposed skin and I
really can't get to actually I kind of
like this look does it take on wrinkles
mannequin Oh getting old man do I look
like a scarecrow hi I'm a scarecrow now
I'm just gonna wait for 20 minutes and
peel it off I feel like I just went to
the dentist in my entire face is no my
skin feels so stiff and the fact that
it's in my hair is gonna be really
tricky and it's gonna be really painful
it's all dry ready to go ready to peel
baby holy Sh
oh boy holy
me I'm gonna be an excellent at the end
of this okay any pain oh I'm crying I'm
crying I'm crying ah this is wonderful
I feel pretty what if I lose my eyebrow
I'm freaking out right now
oh right there oh I'm sweating like a
horse oh wow
feel free it was a very painful mask not
a pleasant process it's very aggressive
oh I think I pulled out a bunch of my
moustache hairs eyebrow looks intact
tree like I made it
this entire area on my face right now is
red and it's quite sore I'm definitely
not have a rash there the rest of the
day
what is that how was that even in my
face we got some blackheads in there
some whiteheads oh yeah we got some
beard hairs I think at the bottom there
my face is twitching as painful as that
was it was extremely invigorating
pulling that thing off my face so I
would definitely do it again that look
younger I feel younger I'm glad I was
able to say that I survived the most
painful face mask but I don't feel more
beautiful I don't feel more attractive
props to all the girls who do this kind
of stuff regularly it's very important
get your face clean my mom says to get
it money Oh Juanito I want the hot on it
which means if you want to look good you
got to struggle to paint it's worth it
baby at the end of the day I don't think
it's worth it honestly you could wear a
mask every day and if someone loves you
for your personality keep that person in
your life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
