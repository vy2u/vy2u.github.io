for two weeks I am about to do the
pregnancy diet for two weeks which is
about one-twentieth of actual pregnancy
my fiance's pregnant so I know a ton
about the pregnancy diet
I think she'll definitely appreciate me
doing this for a couple weeks I'm
excited to feel not pregnant but healthy
I do want kids I think that'd be fun I
think that it would be very fulfilling
part of my life don't want kids it's
terrible but I empathize with those who
are with children
whoa their rules okay you're being
frightened sucks man that's a bummer I
like my deli meats I like my hot dogs oh
the expensive stuff you have a good no
right okay so it's got to be like
scrambled spongy eggs I don't think
it'll be that hard because it's not like
I eat a ton of sushi oh that's pretty
bad what a day I need coffee though
look who's eating uh what is that call
again a sandwich it's cold cuts Nicole
well I'm not pregnant you're pregnant
look cool look we can't equal cuts I am
at a drive-through I have gone there a
lot I've never done a diet where I
couldn't eat certain things so I just
don't know what I can eat it's driving
me crazy I'm on day three of a pregnancy
diet do you have any idea how I feel
well I'm on month seven yeah no it's
only like 50 times but I gotta say the
first bit is the worst
so I wasn't sure if pepperoni counted on
the pregnancy diet so I went to ask our
resident pregnancy expert Kate and she
said it was all good so breakfast fast
food lunch fast food dinner fast food
maybe it's going pretty good
until last night we had to work really
late on the crew and yeah end up having
a couple of drinks with the crew you
know trying to keep that camaraderie
going
just because your baby isn't real it
doesn't mean you can't it up hi
guys how how's the pregnancy diet going
uh when people come into me and newly
pregnant so interesting to me how people
don't seem to think so much about what
they're putting in their bodies until
they're making a baby has the old adage
is true you are what you eat I had a
hard time not drinking because you know
like daddy loves some whiskey sour
there's a huge difference between
consuming alcohol on a regular basis
which I don't advocate and I don't think
it's safe and like having a glass of
champagne at your best friend's wedding
the issue is we don't really know what
the threshold of safety for alcohol
exposure in a pregnancy is and there is
this thing called fetal alcohol syndrome
which is a very real and very serious
problem so cutting out things has been
difficult for the diet but adding things
is what I found even more difficult so
one of the things we definitely should
be eating it's increasing whole foods
that are real foods that are not
processed fruits vegetables whole grains
for me to be my grandparents for you
guys to be your great grandparents but
they recognize what your eating is food
because if not don't eat it it's the
worst thing you can do all the worst
thing you can eat the worst thing you
could eat on a regular basis probably
lots and lots of animal products I'm not
a vegan I'm just gonna yeah yeah and
lots and lots of sugar
what's worse having one whiskey sour or
six pop-tarts
Wow I'm kind of gonna be a big hippie
about it and say have the whiskey sour
ah the thing I took away from this is a
take everything in moderation almost
everything I don't folks again
no moderation there it was baby diet not
that bad I mean okay how do you feel
about the baby day I think you've been
doing a bad job whatever one of the
things they say to do on the pregnancy
diet is to drink a lot more water which
I have done and so far I've noticed that
I pee with the frequency of a pregnant
woman and see the baby you always have
to pee what's for lunch Sofia uh
Japanese raps
we don't know if you can eat them or not
I think the answer is no yeah I guess I
don't you lunch today cuz I'm pregnant
I'm realizing how much deli meat I eat
and how many of my normal lunches I
can't have anymore
I am dramatically changing the way in
which I order sandwiches it's been way
rougher than I thought I failed I feel
really bad about it the two weeks for
fine but it was great you know having
that solidarity with kid K definitely
appreciate it I couldn't eat any of the
things I normally eat it was the
addition of the healthier stuff that's
where I found a lot of trouble I was
struggling my caffeine and I wanted more
all the time the way that I deal with my
stress by by taking a quick drink after
work
what do you do when you're pregnant when
you're stressed out no I'm not glad that
I'm not pregnant I wish I can do like
hey just give me the baby for a while
chicks are really strong man you guys
put up with a lot of so cute right
yeah
good morning two little feet
yeah oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
