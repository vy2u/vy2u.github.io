that Philly's not a state right it makes
it kind of is it feels like it dude I
got really drunk last night and I i
frickin my voice is gone I sang karaoke
did I tell you this no all right here's
a fun fun little fact just to tell you
about the area that I'm in right now I
go and I think I go to sing karaoke
everyone's there it's Christmas Eve and
a bunch of you more at the bar like a
ton of people me and my friend Tina a
guy go to sing karaoke okay Dana a guy
yeah because it could be a guy or girl's
name so he's saying the girls part and I
sing my part of Kid Rock and Sheryl
Crow's picture Kid Rock is trash but you
are trash I know I know I know but this
isn't even the best part of the story
oh really so there's something better
than Madison there's something even
 better so then as her singing I
start I start saying the guys part
because I wanted to do the part where he
goes I was off to try and kill away you
know but I couldn't sing it because my
voice was so bad but I'm singing the
guys part right in the beginning and
these guys at the bar got so mad at me
they kept coming up and I kept going
like while I was singing they were like
hey that's the guys part oh hey
that's the guy's brother was the guy's
freaking no it's the guys part nerds I
didn't put your room Callie Tucker
living back in 2000 Leigh
am i right dude we're wearing kind of
matching Christmas pajamas Christmas
pajamas because their moose is on it
wait is most Meese I think the plural of
moose is me yes moose it's moose yeah
yeah my sister shaking her head wait
that sounds like so fun cuz normally
what we do in my town is we also go out
to the bar but I didn't get to do that
cuz I'm thick but you you rage
the last night I kept bothering you
being like Kate okay are you ready for
the podcast is a podcast and you were
like I gotta go to church I gotta go to
my grandma's house I'm drunk I
said yeah that's in my parents
bed that was insane I got home I got in
my pajamas I wash my face and everything
I then went to say goodnight mind you
they were sleeping it was 2:00 a.m. they
were sleeping and I crawled in bed to
say goodnight which is weird and I just
passed out and then I woke up this
morning and I was just like oh is
it I think they like no I drink but I
don't they don't really drink they don't
drink so like it was weird
it's like weirder than waking up in a
random person's bed it's like waking up
and your parents had been yeah it was
terrible they're still in it that's
 confusing for a
what did we learn from that don't sleep
in your parents bed over the age of 20
say like 13 actually yeah anyways did
you get anything good for Christmas uh
yeah these pants nice a cool pair of
boots some earrings oh yeah how
about you my like big gift this year was
laser hair removal
so really want to get my butthole
lasered could you get your vagina lizard
to I'm getting it all
I'm getting my legs my armpits but what
I'm gonna be like three little eel I
want to be a slippery little snake and I
want to swim in my way sex is slippery
little eels
okay she oh I just want to slip right
off these silky sheets you'll fly
through water
speaking about silky sheets Kate did you
come
yeah no no I have a little note here in
our notes that I'm supposed to bring up
this vais article that I made and I just
wanted to talk to you about it or Jesus
sorry I'm on a lot of medicines
a vice article that I read a user named
@l underscore greenberg sent it to me so
thanks girl
it was an article that literally came
out yesterday and I was like
 about advice columnists
who made her friend come she's a 28 year
old has never come in her whole life
never orgasm and she was like it's gonna
be my duty to get her to orgasm in seven
days and she did it in six I mean she
didn't physically do it to her friend
but she like guided her through it yeah
that doesn't that doesn't intrigue you
no that's way too intimate but like it's
not much different from what we're doing
here but like one thing that her friend
did cuz her friend grew up extremely
religious and like sheltered and she was
like I'm just really uncomfortable with
my sexual it was like us I was I was a
little freaked out into how similar the
story was but hey I'm nothing if not
relatable yeah you're not the only one
is what I'm trying to say but like her
friend was like I can't watch for and I
don't like porn I can't get into it is
our friend was like why don't you read
erotic fan Thanks
that's what I read why are you screaming
wait you are doing that what
ones are you reading
I just Google erotic stories you don't
even have like a preference like her
friend's preference was um angels
 her she wanted angel sex like
spirit sex and oh my god now it's
the thing that like made her friend come
after 28 years so have you masturbated
in your childhood bedroom no not yet not
yet so you're saying there's a chance
I mean it's a long week who knows what
will happen when do you get back to LA
anywho until the third Jesus Christ I
can't do this anymore okay I'm having
withdraws dude you're having withdraws
yeah
[Laughter]
where are you after now I'm having
withdrawals yeah I get it I hear you
buddy hey listen I hear you so um I was
just I was just gonna address the thing
there comment from
last week oh yeah let's talk about that
we might as well last week's podcast we
had on KC coop and we talked about sex
work and it being kind of like a
feminist choice and someone responded to
us on was it Twitter yeah Twitter yeah
Jordan said I have loved every episode
with this last one
wreaked of white privilege billing sex
work as feminist choice is great but not
the common experience especially for
women of color
totally true true see 100 percent
correct we could only speak of our
experiences for sure and we up by
not being more informed other people's
experiences so we do deeply apologize
for that and thank you yeah for calling
us out on our cuz we're gonna make
mistakes we're gonna up and yeah
something Casey had talked about was
that she started stripping after she had
like quote-unquote bottom doubt on her
addictions we just thought that was a
super interesting specific point of view
obviously not the majority we just
thought like wow what a opposite
experience to what people would normally
associate with stripping but we should
have a hundred percent covered the fact
that that yeah it didn't even occur to
us to do that so it wasn't even like it
doesn't matter what our is what our
intentions were it just the fact is we
are and we're gonna try a better and if
we do tell us man cuz we want to
make sure that we don't ever not include
such a marginalized group again and we
probably what we're gonna out
that's what we do this is the power to
restock up so you don't have to write or
just like talk about something as being
the the whole experience you know what I
mean like instead of it being very hyper
specific to one person and yeah we just
can't have someone speak for the whole
majority of stripping yeah um another
thing we wanted to do for this episode
because it oh girl that was almost puke
oh Jesus Christ
I'm also gonna be slowly getting drunker
and drunker throughout this episode cuz
oh it is really certain to me now and
it's pretty much the only thing carrying
me through this podcast because it's
Christmas and this is gonna be coming
out on the
day before New Year's Eve two days
before whatever okay look we wanted to
do a fun thing for New Year's where we
do a year review guys the lows the good
the bad the slippery the slobber and
Glee the slap yes
yeah pre okay okay nice great and I
wrote down questions for each other that
were great shove I'm foamy I know you
have to do this you have to do this and
I'm being a problem but quick thing
about the panties with uh oh you piece
of Kelsey
don't do this I mean do it but
don't act like you weren't here
when I said it so I wasn't paying
attention
well that whose fault is that mine that
was an asshole move but hilarious that
Kelsey thought whoever made the mutton
one made the most money got to keep
their money and then the loser had to
donate their that is literally what I
said like two separate times that the
winner gets to keep their money cuz they
sold their panties and that's a funny
thing and you should get rewarded for
that but what is dirty desert has to
 donate they're half the charity
but but when we started this we said we
would do this for a charity so we would
I don't know Kate yes hey why do you
want to you why don't you pedal back
take a couple steps back and go and
retrace your steps and listen today I so
buddy said we quickly said the loser
would donate the money to charity that
is horrible
hormones what I goddamn said I'm
sticking to it
but no we're not sticking to it turns
out we're both gonna donate now yes
Jesus Christ
alright fine so we're both gonna donate
the proceeds what charity are we still
gonna do the California wildfires we
could do that I'm donating my half to
wildfire relief I'm gonna I'm gonna look
into what I'm gonna donate my poor great
alright back to our year interview now
that we deterred Kate and I are gonna go
back and forth and ask each other one
question about the year of 2017 that was
the trash fire we're gonna try and bring
some light into it some
laughs here we go starting off with a
softball they're gonna get harder as
they go on what it would HQ are you dude
if you're not listen this is an
aside if you're not playing HQ
pause this goddamn podcast and go
download it and use my code Kelsey
Darragh and give me a free life okay
moving on euro ho or you could use the
best Kate ever Kate never won well is
your most favorite project you worked on
this year I think my favorite project
was adult not just this podcast
like I really like this podcast but also
we were still doing a bunch of episodes
in the beginning of this year we had a
scripted series that kind of sparked
this podcast yeah what's your favorite
you wrote all those and they were really
funny it was so much fun but if you're
not watching those episodes which you
should go back and watch all those you
should watch unfortunately Ashley which
Kate wrote the whole season on BuzzFeed
violet in here you're like a supporting
character and Quinta verse everything on
Facebook watch I am
it's a busy year oh wow do you think
should we go tit for tat questios tit
for tit e best unexpected surprise 2017
yeah um not having to take plan B no
wait wait wait I did that I did that a
few times this podcast this was such a
dumb little like experiment we were
gonna do and then if yakun worked it has
skyrocketed and now we have a weird
responsibility to help people out
up in life anymore and I just love it I
worked on Christmas and record on
Christmas and I just love doing this
with you next question you're cut I'm
 tipsy right now oh okay the
reason why I asked this question is
because you my queen have gotten into
the world of beauty and style more this
year than I think I've ever seen you in
a couple years I have known you thank
you consistent paychecks and I started
seeing you'd walk in you have your face
all be and you have your little
leather skirts on like on a
like who the dis who the just
walking in here so my question to you is
what was the most favorite beauty
product you discovered this year I just
started using this like face oil which I
can't remember what it's called
sorry it's really nice and it's for like
acne I have a dual air in every way I'm
a fourteen year old boy like that and
every right hundred percent yeah I don't
know how to come well they probably know
you talk about 14 year old boy okay wait
you don't want to talk about 14 year old
boys coming I just want to make sure we
got that I'm leaving okay okay really
really like it so that's my favorite
like you know skincare thing but then
highlighter I'm all about highlighter
baby Oh finally Oh would you have a
favorite highlight one you gave me that
feels like chocolate oh that would be
the Too Faced palette that's a good one
I'm proud of you coat you killing you
crush in the beauty game thanks dude
you're welcome okay what's the worst
thing that happened to you this year oh
um I mean I was gonna talk about
something sad but I will get to that one
I think later so instead of doing a sad
one for the worst thing that happened to
me I figured I would tell you the worst
thing that was funny that happen to me
and I never thought I would ever tell
this story ever in my life ever
but it it's Christmas
here's your present here from Kelsey two
of the listeners I my pants well I
wasn't wearing pants I was wearing a
dress I had your it stick it on a a big
important meeting at the e network in
Studio City which if you live in
Hollywood you know you have to take a
big long highway to get to this one
little town that's like five seconds
away but you have to be get on this big
highway so on my way home I had just
done this big meeting my adrenaline my
sister's like covering her face dying
laughing
she knows what's about to happen I was
wearing a dress and I was on the leather
seats of my Cadillac and I felt what you
know we all know we've all been
there to be the rumble in the bubble of
what you're gonna your pants like
there's no yeah there's no like this
morning it was an explosion yeah there
was no like air safety ratio like what
was gonna come out of my body next
if I breathe too hard was gonna be
so I was on the highway stuck in traffic
and I called my sister cuz I knew it was
coming and I just couldn't I couldn't
get off the highway I was stuck in
bumper-to-bumper LA traffic I called her
and I was like Megan I need you to just
talk to me right now just talk
to me and she's like what's going on
what's going on I was like I'm about to
 my pants just top tell me a
story I just need to be distracted and
so she starts talking to me and she's
like it's gonna be okay it's gonna be
okay it was not okay
long story short I didn't have anything
in my car except for a jean jacket and
so she said well put the jean jacket
under you and so at least you're not
 in the car so I put the jean
jacket underneath me and the next time I
mean I was sweating profusely I'm
screaming at the top of my lungs I
screaming at no one I'm crying these
tears coming out of my eyes and I take
one little tiny breath out and as soon
as I breathe out my entire bowels just
disembodied themselves onto this jean
jacket I mean it was like literally half
of my weight it was incredible I should
also mention I had sushi and Taco Bell
for lunch that's right I had two lunches
that day and then I had to sit in it
for five more minutes until I could go
up the highway where the jean jacket
said so my jean jacket was a really
expensive nice Calvin Klein jacket that
said boss ass bitch on the back so I
literally into my boss ass this
jacket oh it's so good and I refused to
throw it away because it was expensive
and it's my favorite jacket Calvin Klein
and I asked them to replace it and they
did Calvin Klein baby you could in
his JAC give you another one okay your
turn getting a little harder here Wow
since you asked such a personal question
it's time for me to ask such a personal
question like what was the best vacation
you took this year
you gave a personal answer and the best
vacation I took here's a here's a fun
fact I actually don't have vacation
money so I didn't really take a vacation
so I'm going to say the best mental
vacation I took was how you perscribed
oh hey ladies if you work hey I'm still
on vacation what do you think about it I
took two trips this morning you know
what I'm saying you have two bills
that's a good answer coat hilarious your
next query Quest is what's your biggest
learning experience
oh man that I do not miss hangovers baby
I don't miss um being sober for the last
bit of this year was the best thing ever
oh man do you know how great not puking
is you how great is getting up and going
to a farmers market for no
goddamn reason it's okay it's price
quite nice um okay did you okay yeah so
your next one is boom baby of 2017 what
was your drunkest night and what
happened okay putting my head down folks
this is bad my drunkest night was was I
there no wow it was when we finished
shooting it was when you started sober
November and I texted you and said I had
to follow my own path Wow beep left turn
I was after we finished shooting
unfortunately Ashley hi we all went out
and me and two of the girls we went out
and we were like ok everyone meet us
here so we were we were just gonna go
for a drink so three martinis later
everyone else gets there and they were
just drinking a drink it apparently I
try to get everyone to sleep over my
house extra rooms dude I was like go get
your cat you get your dog and come over
I have enough blankets we're all
sleeping over and I don't have enough
blankets like I know I have like four
yeah one of them is mine and I'm not
giving it up but then I woke up the next
morning to my entire outfit that looked
like I melted
the entire outfit head-to-toe is just on
the floor
I didn't you know and I didn't renew it
was screaming out of my asshole thank
God we have another we can now be fully
on the same page it feels like your butt
is sneezing but anyway so then I wake up
I was like today did I stop at the
liquor store last night
yep I stopped and I got myself not
liquor
I got cigarettes and a pack of happy
hippo oh no no no no no I threw out the
cigarettes I didn't even smoke it in my
threw ml and then I ate two happy bull
 I know your ass
drunkenly smoked a cigarette maybe one
I don't remember there's literally no
way of knowing that's not my biggest
regret
amen I that was my question for you two
all right well yeah okay
my biggest regret without a doubt was
hooking up with someone I shouldn't have
hooked up with we should have hooked up
um this person may or may not be someone
oh you can sorry yeah it may or may not
have been someone I dated you know I
dart about I know who you talking about
I should not have done that it didn't it
didn't make me feel good it wasn't even
good there was zero well no that's not
true I felt way good after it cuz I was
like hat bitch you still want this
but in every other aspect of the
situation it was not good so that was my
biggest regret I if I could take that
back
man what'd they say on Instagram you
throw your trash out for a reason you
wouldn't bring the trash back in your
home not even recycling you doubt on
accident nope didn't for sure no Kate
okay my last question for you is what is
your biggest regret
my biggest good
not way boy did you it all
this year no you didn't ones this
year
no girl kills we got I don't know how
many more ways I could say this should
we just Jimmy are you sure we
should just do it yes it's do it no
never
1 million years first sure don't need
better be that adamant about it but cool
no no
Kelsey it would be an actual travesty we
do a video about this oh yeah you write
it we did but I got like we just need to
get you leg dude I can't be you
but what if just for like a minute just
to say that you did get laid in 2007 I
guess I won't even be it'll be next year
Wow holy yeah yeah we have a clean
slate to work with yeah heavy and I say
that every year I'm like this is the
year and then here I am you know every
now and then a blind squirrel finds an
acorn every now and then right
isn't that a saying like you'll know I
don't know last question from you
best sex god damn it I hate this
question here's the thing is I'll answer
it because I have a lot of shitty sex
this year I did a lot of hoenn where I
was drinking too and I like was worried
about other people getting theirs but
I'd have to say and I'm only saying this
one cuz it's the most recent in my
memory that like feels really great is
the person I'm having sex with now my
 buddy who's also my neighbor
because I don't care if he comes I don't
give a because guess what he's my
neighbor so if like tonight neighbors
don't have to come tomorrow
hashtag neighbors don't have to come
good and I think our sex communication
style is just good like we're not afraid
to be like do this do that because
that's just it's like it's a buddy
you know yeah anyways that was our 2017
and review Kate what's your what's your
new year's resolution for 2018
oh don't have
nice me neither I don't like me listens
yeah there's too much pressure
associated with making resolutions and
then you beat yourself up if you don't
do it yeah so I'm just gonna chill
should we get to the main
event of the season the holiday
extravaganza the reason why we are here
yeah bitch do you want to intro our
bitches coming to you live from my
bedroom
Kristen Bannerman well she's
Taiwanese lot I copped a lot of her dial
she's great and she's got a great voice
she's very caring she's a very good
friend very driven she's fiercely
protective what the do you want
from me this is my sister from hey mr.
standing at five foot two the opposite
of me she is short
she is brunette she is tan she is not
the center of attention she hates
attention actually she's quite shy when
you first meet her and everyone loves
her because when people meet me they go
wow what a bitch compared to Megan
hey make it really like she had to get
pretty drunk to just be able to this is
like the full bottle how much attention
Oh quite a lot wait so how far an age
are you guys three and a half years
three and a half years we're two now who
added that are you guys very similar I
feel you guys are similar in
personalities yeah we're pretty similar
she's nicer than me it's true so was
this one I have to ask because our
viewers are gonna obviously ask and I
feel like I'm just gonna be the the
messenger so don't shoot the messenger
okay oh boy have you ever came yeah do
you know that your sister has never came
I mean oh now I know now from listening
to the podcast yes so sex is just like
not a thing that you guys super talk or
like masturbation I guess god no no yeah
what do you think what do you want for
her what are your wishes for her life I
just want her to do what she's happy and
comfortable with like if she's into
something and it's a good thing for her
then great if it's not something that
she doesn't feel like entertaining at
that moment then that's great too
whatever she wants to do it's a woman
that's also I'm wondering and what is
that because I feel like you have no
boundaries here right like that's the
one oh by the way to do my sister and I
sound alike because when we let me close
my eyes okay because on the phone like
when her boyfriend's used to call the
house I used to pick up and talk to them
because world multiple boyfriend's my
sister was like I said way different
than me in high school I was I wasn't
caught until like my junior year and
Megan was hot in like seventh grade so
she got laid all the time and I was
known all throughout high school
inspired by our teachers they would call
me Megan Dara's little sister like no
one actually knew my name until she
graduated
um that's false no it's not what's why
is it because um
he always threw parties over at my
parents house well yeah because I was
ugly so I had to be popular somehow cuz
there's no way you're ugly here do you
want to see trouble look at me that's my
sister's prom picture look at those
pants no way that's lucky you're not
pants on
yeah Kate you understand what it's like
to be following in the shadow of a hot
woman yep so uh Meghan do you live at
home if you live in Florida no where do
you live Lorna yeah I live right down
the street from home and actually I got
an award at my 10-year high school
reunion for being the closest to live
two high school still jesus what a
 accolade I still live right down
the street from my parents but she owns
at home like she's very comfortable I
own that home but dang she she likes
being like she I was like I needed to
get the out of here immediately
like how long into like growing up did I
say I needed to get the out of here
immediately yes I left really early on
but like she and that's something I've
learned growing up is like I would
always be like why don't you come visit
me like let's go on vacation let's go do
this and she's like no bitch I like
where I live I like my job I like my
friends like she likes her life and I
think I was just so unhappy with my life
for so long that I would like try and
make her like went to Auburn to get out
of here well yeah it's a small school in
the south but like you also though
didn't think I was ever gonna make yeah
okay so here's the thing so I was trying
to be the realist right so I'm like okay
it's getting to that time where she's
getting to that age where I'm like all
right she's getting those sad and
depressed and it's like her head
up her legs and so she wasn't getting
like any like real work and I'm like
okay when in somebody's life when it's
your dreams in Hollywood when is it time
to just give it up and like go and get
like a real job
because I'm
trying to be real here I don't want her
to be like you know like keep going
through this depression and all this
 the fact that he's making Kelsey
sad and depressed like it was affecting
her in a negative way I'm like you need
to feel wanted you need to feel needed
you'd have accountability yeah I need to
have a schedule and I didn't want her to
get that but I was trying to get her to
be like real and be like okay why don't
you just go get another no go look for
another job and then she got the butt

like a dick you know you were and like I
still owe you like dying it like it's
okay if you don't make it no but like I
still don't think I meant no not even
not even close like hey I'm sure you
feel the same way like we we get paid to
do what we love and we still feel like
feelings yes having you just now believe
in me means more than my own believing
in you sure but Kate like you
talk about like I don't know Kristen
talk about like what do you think it's
like for Kate to be a writer in
Hollywood and be like making
entire shows and seasons of shows like
are you so proud of her I think it's
amazing I think it's awesome I want her
to keep writing for a whole bunch of
people I want her to write more for
herself - can I throw that out there now
yeah but like it's awesome to watch her
company was just gonna hate this she's
gonna hate this so much like coming home
and then we're like seeing friends from
a hundred years ago and she just like
comes and she just runs the room when
she's in that's all true but it's not in
like a credit to her kind of way it's
like are you sure cuz that's it I know I
know it's just good it's just a natural
thing people get excited that she's
there and to see her and everyone's just
really happy for her everyone's so nice
so modest
stop being at the Irish Catholic
upbringing oh yeah so we went to church
last night yeah how was that my like
about church yeah we we went to church
it 3 2 3 2 2 3 days a week every week
for like 1518
yeah 18 years for a few days look out of
here yeah Wednesday night Sunday morning
Sunday night and then Megan was the
piebald Manor yeah cuz that's too
much church that she know much too much
shape odd to church camp one year in her
pastor our youth pastor somehow
got ahold of it I turned it on and see
what I was listening to and the song
that came on was Avant when we make love
and I was like 12 years old in the
church camp and he thought I was a devil
and I didn't get my iPod a little mp3
players away a year later at church and
then how was the ho yeah finally when
when she finally got a car we would skip
Church and we were like we would drive
separate from our parents and we'd be
like okay we're going to church and then
right before you get to the church you
can take a like a left onto the take a
lesson we'd go to the big girls don't
 it get me like this and
then we come back and meet the hi know
cuz then I couldn't go to church after
what everyone was talking about her
I had to fight I couldn't
be friends with any of those bits of
course yeah you not to do that yeah
stand up from my bitch right look how I
turned out yeah do you have any stories
of childhood no not like that
[Laughter]
we didn't hang out that much we know
yeah I guess three and a half is still
yeah yeah cuz I always tried I tried but
I was annoying yeah we do know so it was
did you guys go to high school together
no she graduated when I was in eighth
grade I said you never had to do the
high school good so did you guys always
get along like what was your biggest
fight ever
oh they were just daily it was everyday
everyday every day we fight like
wait hard like we would be like we've
slapped each other like stupid hold each
other's hair it we were a mess yeah how
old though like up until she left for
college yeah
until about seven or eight years I feel
like I moved away
did you guys sit when would you say you
guys became like homies I don't know I
don't know I think once we this is gonna
be super morbid I think it was once like
people died let you just by our hand you
missile injury was an accident but then
I had to finish the job dig the hole or
bury the wrong guy you know it's covered
in cement now No
yeah I think it was just when we were
like oh yeah like one nice really big
loss we have your first like really big
losses like a grandparent passing away
and that yes that's a really tough thing
so I think everything just kind of
shifted they were like oh this is real
yeah real sad now did you guys ever talk
about like boyfriend's with each other
or I guess in this case did did Kate
ever like what was the coming-out
experience like or was it was great it
was great
I just adore nature that they're coming
I like your abacus I said because I was
doing that dating show and I like
texture and I was like hey just a heads
up I just gave her a heads up and then
she just responded back with with you do
you what a little dancer it was the
desert
what's more supportive than truly
nothing that's all I got our one ask for
support
yeah like because your age was just far
enough apart when like maybe Kate was
going through puberty and you were
dating like it was never really an age
to talk about like love in fact here's
the difference when she went through
high school she had people interested in
her yeah no yes I love your great boobs
[Laughter]

all right let's let's read it and then
Megan and Kristin can help us answer it
are you drunk
yeah okay we took a nap it's ass hey
guys I love the podcast it gets me
through long drives so something I'd
love to hear you guys talk about our
high school reunions are they worth
going to I was invited with mine but I'm
not sure how I feel about it one part of
me wants to go and see all the people I
lost touch with and reminisce but the
other part of me is like what that's
what social media is for did you guys go
to yours or having informal ones what
are your thoughts sorry I won't do it
wait so nothing you've been to yours
nope no Megan you went to yours I got
stuck on a boat what they
tricked us and we all been on this boat
cruise and it took us around Tampa Bay
and we were stuck on there for three
hours so we didn't know did you booze
yeah like how long into John immediately
that's an 8-week person why that's where
I won Mike my thing for living the
closer to high school I didn't go to
mind I didn't I don't know I just didn't
I didn't feel like it it wasn't that I
had a bad time it wasn't that I like
lost touch with a bunch of people I was
just like I like I kind of know what
this is gonna be we're about to go eat
bitter by nature Oh super
so we're just like yeah this will be
good
yeah Muppets Oh like the Statler and
we'll do
wait so you and Chris did you say don't
go I mean it's it's your experience in
high school was great and you want to
see people then go it's awesome that
that was mentioned in the question I
know for me that if I had just come home
night before Thanksgiving and went to
the same bar where our reunion was going
to be I would have seen all of those
same people and not have had to pay $45
yeah go to the after-party
that's it yeah I did you go to yours I
have no one yet - I was coming up next
year I like I would have gone if I were
home but I could not justify buying the
300 400 dollar plane ticket I don't I
don't like anybody that much and also
like there's something about my mind
I'll be invited to my next year and I
have no idea if I'm gonna go out
honestly haven't given it any thought
but like something I'm thinking of
immediately is like I hey I don't talk
to anybody anybody yeah Michael
genuinely nobody maybe like a couple of
the dudes I still hang out with cuz I
was a I was one of those chicks
that hung out with a bunch of dudes and
the other thing is just like I don't
know that I'd want to go to a
party by myself like maybe if I was
allowed to bring a plus-one or
significant other but like I just don't
think I'd want to go and like have to be
like it's me remember the girl from TV
productions class who had like a few
friends and had a hot older sister I did
something that sounds like a fun time
also I feel like the only real reason
this is my this was my only reason to go
to the I didn't want to actually
reconnect with anyone I didn't care
about friendships I don't care about any
of that I wanted to see if I could hook
up with someone that I wanted to hook up
with in high school
 yes okay I feel like that's mine
completely I'm gonna that's fun yeah she
called that set going I thought so
that's why I was gonna go but then I
really couldn't I just couldn't justify
it like if you're good if you would just
buy if you'd be wasting much money to
just like I'm gonna do this one thing
maybe reconsider but if you have the
money and you have the energy and
stamina to go and you have a goal you
have to do your research
yeah like if you want to go to and just
go brag about yourself and show
out girl go get your shine on if not
then you can just leave yeah unless
you're on about yeah unless you're on a
boat in which case about planning ahead
maybe bring a little flap bring a flask
and Iraq and bring both yeah I don't
know why they cost so much though go to
the high school reunions how much it was
your pay to go to yours yep how much was
it 80 bucks
oh I got a t-shirt oh I don't know that
I trust those bitches that are like
organized organizing yeah I think
they're pocketing it yeah I don't I
don't trust any of those bitches that
are organizing that like what do
