basically just gonna be the
conversations we have with each other
but now we're gonna be broadcasting it
to thousands hopefully millions of
people yeah we should introduce
ourselves I'm Kelsey I'm a producer at
BuzzFeed I'm Kate and I am a writer at
BuzzFeed and we've been friends for over
yeah well over here but we we talk about
a lot of deep yeah we do there's no
filters between us nope
so we figured why not just broadcast
this through the world you use us to
 up and you guys come maybe learn
something there you go boom Shakalaka
guys the first the theme of this episode
yeah because we are coming up on the
fall we are coming up on what is called
cuffing season do you know what it is
it's where you start to like lock people
down so that you have a partner for the
winter right I have been if you could
buy a ticket to cuffing season I've been
like front-of-the-line pass every single
year and it's never worked
hmmm we're actually quite we're doing
quite the opposite of cuffing season yes
which is the theme of today's show which
is November slash location so what is a
hoe keishon okay location is where you
go to a different location where you
don't owe anybody anything you won't be
there for a long time and you get to
just be the best version of yourself cuz
you don't have to back anything up right
and that is where you just really let
out your inner huh yeah just let it and
there's no judgement you're going to
this place to do this then yeah so so
I've been personally pretty obsessed
with trying to find the perfect area -
okay hmmm a great Christmas cake I got
it I forget silence is on podcast don't
work but I think so I was thinking about
like different places there's also it's
interesting different looks do better in
different places right not necessarily
across the board but there are like I
don't necessary I have a feeling that I
don't do great in Los Angeles cause it's
so densely populated with Beautiful's
traditionally like what you're told
Beauty is yeah
I know you get mad no this is an
annoying thing I mean I'm sure people
out there can relate where you have that
one friend who never looks at like the
beautiful things about herself and
instead just likes to I don't know what
to do how do i how do I handle you when
you do this to yourself find me someone
who wants to take me down town town
pound town once it take my pants well
that's the Wow sorry no but what you're
saying it's true like it it is different
in every part of the world I mean in
every city is a different version of how
you can ho Kate yeah
and later in the episode where our
friend are the third to our get
tears frederico ransom also known as
Freddy from lady Lysa known as shreddy
when she's on her board oh nice yeah
she's gonna be joining us talking about
she doesn't know exactly what we're
throwing her way we just asked like hey
girl will you come be the first guest on
our podcast she was like yeah I guess
but we have been trying to hope we've
been trying to plan a home page in the
three of us and we are having a hard
time it is true that there are just
certain places where it's a little bit
easier for other people than it is for
other people
looks like going to a gay bar when
you're straight it's like you know
you're not gonna there yeah me
being bisexual which is great that I can
pretty much anywhere yes me being a
horrible prude means is just it is hard
for me and I think that's why the
podcast is gonna be great because I have
had a lot of different experiences in
the sexual world I barely say it's hard
to say um but the way that I came up
with the theme for this episode was I
had screenshotted heartbreak the way I
came the way I invented this podcast
episode so I had screenshotted a text
between the three of us Kate
Freddie and myself that we talk on
pretty much every day hmm and tweeted it
and I didn't realize that the name of
the group chat was also very much public
and I got a lot of tweets back saying
why is your group text named ho keishon
yeah so I thought it let's just
break it down for everyone so that they
can understand the essentials how to do
it how not to
in some cases and like I think it's you
know we're gonna talk about the
different ways that you have to
responsibly help I have is it is a thing
that isn't necessarily fair and I don't
necessarily think should be the mmm
woman's responsibility but it kind of
just is they got a lot of things in the
world aren't fair so this is just one of
those thanks to sometimes three to tango
everyone has to keep their oh my god
genitals face what I just thought about
a threesome I had a dream about wait I
had a dream about a threesome last night
and you were in it like as the sex as a
third yeah it's like it's you're sorry
you just made me anxiety burnt safe in
my dream it was you me and this other
guy and this is like the first that I've
ever hearing Kate used to talk sexually
about me this is incredible wow what a
great contest okay so I miss dream and
we were in a bookstore nerd I know no
I'm writing this like loft bed of a
bookstore and it was you me and this guy
I think like I don't know if we know the
guy but we were like you come up to me
very baseless yeah pretty much
and he was just like he was like we had
a good build to him though and you were
you go up to me you're like Kate he
wants to have a threesome with us we
gotta go do this and I was like okay and
so that's why I forced you and have you
just like you want to do it and I was
like I don't say no a lot so even in my
dream I can't your set boundaries so it
was just there like yeah and so I go up
and you take it yeah I look good naked
yeah alright here's the thing he goes
this is how little I know about six
things that even in my dream I couldn't
like even in my wildest dreams I
couldn't figure out a threesome oh my
god okay YouTube like I said we would
sit next to each other he goes and you
to bend over and I'll just take turns
about boom boom and penis going in the
other just I mean that is I got the rest
in a different and it that's definitely
a right left there's no wrong way to
threesome well when he said that here's
the next thing that happened I just go
okay cool I've run to the bathroom and I
ran in the bathroom na I took so long
going to the bathroom he's and I ended
up
like a supermarket what and then when I
came back you were pissed you're like
well we already had sex but we had to
just have sex though - damn it came and
I was like I'm sorry I'll have sex now
I mean like it's too late this is just
further proof that you need to hold more
because you were having wild vivid fever
sex dreams about other people having sex
in me going shopping I went to mind you
I would stuck in a grocery sounds like a
dream come true it sounds like my actual
Friday night you're like this new
chocolate that's the other thing that we
should mention is that Freddie and I are
like on a mission right now to hope and
Kate just got a new cat who I'm sure she
will constantly repeat Peterman his name
is Pete Peterman Peter Peter
Peter man and she uses it as a
legitimate excuse as to why she can't
come home with anything attention sure I
don't know if like maybe you don't know
that he's like a cat and cats are okay
to be alone at times but I feel like
it's becoming a little bit of an excuse
like oh I just want to stay home and
watch Pete which is fine but I think I
want to give him the childhood I never
had I should say step one of occasional
or ho member I know is commitment to the
commitment to the ho and also ho member
what a great what a great thing for the
month of November you and your friends
could can dedicate yourself to hoenn
true Movember you're right I got it I
gotta focus more on the I'm probably not
here's the other I don't know if I'm
gonna be good at hoeing I get like
really invested and I had am sure I just
sold a story now let's do it okay I had
so I did this dating show that none of
you watched and when I went to Portland
I ended up meeting someone on tinder
that didn't want to date on camera and
but we kept talking and I was like I
could not believe the way he wooed me on
tinder like truly I was I've never been
so sorry woud have never been wooed
before and I was being and then what
about him woud you cuz honestly to me it
just seemed like he had a good sense of
humor and that
what made you oh my god I was putty in
it hey he did he had a good sense of
humor but he was like quick with stuff
and guys so often are sort of like
what's up cool cool cool I work in
Marina del Rey what do you do and he was
just like witty and we were talking
about stuff and I just had a personality
personality and he wasn't from LA it was
beautiful and then and then we like we
were talking for a while whatever then
we like texting like back and forth you
came back to LA yes it was a lot I
didn't I didn't meet up with him there
and enough time yeah and then we were
talking for a while and then it sort of
faded out and then the one day I was a
little I had a couple glasses of wine
and I was like we do I'm gonna do and I
was like mmm
I want attention so I texted him and I
was like I feel like we're growing apart
I thought it was funny
every time I tell it to someone's I was
like maybe a better line yeah if you
could see my face podcast listeners it
was like mmm great good that was good
line anyway he texts me back I mean yeah
you live in LA it's like okay I put that
little the gif of Homer Simpson backing
up into the bush and then I said I
totally lied and was just like um I
guess this is a bad time to tell you
that I'm going to be in Portland so you
made up of a false truth I lied I lied
that you were gonna go to Portland but
here's the thing that you were going to
be weren't like it was he his response
made what I said it decided whether or
not what I said was true or false okay
what do you respond with he was like oh
cool when and that's what if you're
liking we're in love yeah I was like Oh
November because November hmmm and I was
like okay it'll be in November when it
was like cool so then we start talking
and then we start like I don't think it
was sexting no wasn't it was sexting
I've ever had but he was really cool and
he was talking cuz I don't have a lot of
sex so I don't know a lot of things that
I kind of want someone to be like
understanding of that so that I don't
like freak out in the in the moment
everything was cool long story short I
went right ahead and asked for a dick
pic Wow bold cuz I thought it would be
fun and he sent it and I didn't know it
was that was the most bold thing I've
ever heard
you do yeah you were like I straight-up
asked for a dick pic yeah you said you
wanted to see it yeah and he was like
whoa BAM and he sent it real quick and
then you sent back this is my favorite
part
oh he sent back oh that's a good-looking
dick then you said oh no he wasn't a
hugging emoji yeah wait that's so I'm
sure he didn't feel great about that but
I also said oh that's a nice-looking
dick yeah anyway long story short he
stopped talking to me I know I don't
think I'm shortly after but what was
coming days after what did we learn from
this whole lesson was that basically lie
a little bit you got a lot a little bit
cuz I've been like oh here's my dick pic
can't wait to see you what are the dates
are coming where are you staying what
are the date you're coming then it would
have been like oh he's like super into
you and you could have been like it's I
I'd fly to Portland for the day yeah I
mean otherwise you're not worth it
I was planning on flying there for the
take and it just he like it was a it was
a for sure thing I was gonna go so we
should say step two and hope hoe member
location is that plans can get derailed
but that shouldn't stop you
sponsored or please Podcast yes yeah we
would like it to be we would like to
have advertisers on the show
what so we thought why not practice and
so we asked our other writer friend
Garrett to write a fake advertisement
for us yeah so that we could cold read
it right now yeah and so that we could
just this is how we would do it if
someone was paying us mm-hmm so let's
throw it to the ad are you unable to
tell the difference between a tomato and
a ball of dirt do you find yourself
drinking mid to your gasoline when you
thought you were sipping orange juice
have you lost a bunch of teeth trying to
bite into a giant rock thinking
it was a fresh but bottle I don't
know we're never gonna get his father
have you lost a bunch of teeth trying to
bite to a giant rock thinking he
was a fresh ball of mozzarella
mozzarella he just forgot that oh you're
like me then you have absolutely no idea
how to feed yourself what his food what
does it look like what on earth is a
grocery store well our friends over at
brown apron have the solution for those
of us elderly baffled by what a loaf of
bread looks like or how to purchase a
kid Brown even will ship a hundred
percent certified food straight to your
door that's right no more of those
embarrassing trips to the store fumbling
around like a newborn horse desperately
trying to figure out what items are food

the ground Plus each brown apron cape
comes with a simple recipes to follow to
make the food taste better because none
of us know how to use a Internet

little far too long way too long bottom

she said it and get 25% off the first
time you make your Mayer carry your

your tube dumb didn't know what a
scallion is or how to find recipes on
recipe machine so use brownies so use
brown apron guys that was a terrible
run-through but we don't have time to
think about it because our first guest
Freddy is here Freddy come to the pod
you're gonna sit
between us this is live to tape so we're
rolling and there's no stopping just
have to this is broken so we're just
gonna she did guys if ready you're here
oh my god tell us who you are cuz people
know who you are you know I am born and
raised in Virginia oh my god I love to
shop oh my god you're one sick I'm a
producer busby you are our good friend
and we roped you into being the first
guinea pig gasp you were like a hundred
percent down like you didn't even ask me
what it was about you're like what do
you want me to say so Freddie has no
idea well okay this is a thing if this
podcast is anything like a group chat
like I'm ready and ready for that's
exactly what I said that this is how I
came to I I came up with the theme for
this week which is location ho member
mm-hmm so what better person to bring in
than the the third of our group yes
beautiful Craig and so we were just
going over the story you are very versed
in the story of that kid was just
finishing up about the dick-pic mm-hmm
what were your what are your thoughts on
dick pics you know I haven't really
received a myriad of dick pics in my in
my time
you're pretty private to I feel like you
don't put your out there I don't
but I also haven't really received dick
pics I think honestly the people that
I've been involved with in any kind of
way that's like sexual or romantic or
intimate they've never they just come
over mm-hmm
no need for that no let's let's cut to
the chase what if they were like talking
to someone and
you were into them uh-huh your identify
straight yes so what if a guy texted you
and was like just out of nowhere sent a
dick pic um I just out of nowhere yeah
no not really down for that I'm like
what are you left but you were talking
about this event the other night where
it was a thing in Los Angeles where it
was the history of dick pics and how
unwanted and unsolicited they are but I
think a great fix to all of this is if
men would just ask I also think it
should be like kind of cool if we ask
for one yeah sure you should because
like why not yes
ageless dating is all online
everything's online flirting's online
texting is a thing like why not I really
feel like I should go into some sort of
like I should start like bargaining with
people or something like maybe go try to
like buy some cards or something because
he asked me first for nude and I started
laughing and I was like barking up the
wrong tree he asked you for a new you
ask me for a new forgot this friend I
got a dick pic out of it and sent him a
picture of my actual cat I didn't know I
was yeah I told him I wasn't going to
seven was like I'm gonna comfortable do
yeah I know your boundaries and it was
like wait but if I asked if I wanted one
would you have send it and he was like I
mean if you wanted it but I'm not gonna
impose and I said I want to see it see
that's that's a nice exchange yeah
things mind you he unfollowed me on
Instagram for no reason we did not get
to that part of the story like we we
have in case we have not yet cracked
it's a mystery
back to shock remain unsolved but Fred
what we were talking about like what a
ho member occasion would look like we go
out with like intention to her right but
like it doesn't happen so often that
like we just go out so then if it
actually does happen
I'm almost sometimes like it's like the
second point we brought up was that like
hoeing can absolutely get derailed like
there have been times where we have been
like we're putting our best
fuck-me pumps on we're checking up guys
always say like old girls need to show
up and prove that that is so not true
I'm not up to literally anything I do
outside of the
with the hope hopefully can I can't we
do this right now yeah and it never
happens yeah you have to put a smaller
burden and we struggle like what is it
are we not approachable are we too
intimidating you're some language I
think that would be doing as much if I
was just like hey yeah and it's like it
feels like if you're not used if that's
not something that you do it feels like
you're doing too much but people that's
people's norm that's like a lot of
people's norm I'm just like just saying
how it is and like moving forward and
like I will say like I did it pretty
sexually liberal I like my parents both
worked seven days a week
I grew up for the nanny so not a lot of
supervision I was able to like hang out
with that crew I grew up in Florida for
fucksake so like I got it all out of the
way pretty early like my first serious
relationship was also my first threesome
with my best friend and like that to me
became north like that was a missionary
yeah yeah yeah so I feel like even
though I grew up very sexually open I it
is the hardest thing for me to do to
approach someone in a bar or like just
go up to that is so wild to me because
this is Kelsey Darragh people shy you're
like you are like you are like gung-ho
and everything you do yeah but it's
something about like when you see
someone in a bar and you're like I'm
into them it's every insecurity ever
coming out like what if I go up to talk
to them and they're like get the
out of my face you're ugly or like there
are plenty of people who are like
attractive that you're just sort of like
I understand that you're attractive but
it's just you're not my type and I'm not
necessarily attracted to you and that
could happen when you go up and approach
someone they're sort of like I'm not
really into it
but you sort of take there and maybe you
don't I do if they're like not into it
then I'm like oh it's because of all of
these reasons that I'm already insecure
about yeah I saw them it was like
absolutely not yeah no way I'm trying to
think of a time when we've all been out
together about like I've never
approached I think we really get
approached well I did slide in a
oh yeah so I split in two so I found the
guy on bumble we matched but he didn't
answer me in 24 hours so I
he had his Instagram in his bio I slid
into his DMS and it was literally that
what'd you say I said what did I say oh
I said I kind of like what you guys I
said like this is me sliding into your
DNA and then he was like he was like
laughing about he was like in like
what's up like what'd he do and then I
was like um and then I mentioned
something about like hanging I don't
know if I even said anything about
hanging out but I think I was I think I
said like I think he may have been like
how'd you find me Bob I was like oh we
matched on bumble and he was like oh see
yeah I'm not really interested I'm
flattered though are you talking was it
because you have like followers or like
that's where it gets tricky because it's
like you know the intention up Friday
you literally said I'm flight actual
sliding that means that I have a mission
here another I love one time I was
trying to sign into a guy's dance and I
asked the group shot the occasion group
chat guys what's something I should say
to slide into someone's dead egos going
to Whole Foods you want anything and me
Freddie live from Aziz Ansari yes we
live Freddie I was like a couple blocks
away from each other and I thought she
was asking if I wanted anything she was
like oh pasta no that's a no that's not
what I meant but Beach I did have to
break it to her that was not an original
joke it was from masters night and she
didn't know that no no I oh I said the
way that I son into this guy's dams I
slid in and said how would someone let's
hypothetically let's say I'd want to
slide into someone's DMS how would I do
it asking for a friend and then he sent
something he's sent like a clapping
emoji back or something and then I sent
him a literal slide emoji they tested it
out on Kate everybody you send this like
gift
yeah a gift gift you ready yeah yeah
yeah and I
sent it to Kate to be like is do you
understand what this means yeah so
that's the other thing about how wait
that was a great entryway test it on
your friends I don't know I run this
 I run every goddamn sexual detail
by these two here's
something though okay so it sort of ties
into that a little bit it's a little bit
more serious than what we've been
talking about but it's along the whole
lines so for the people listening that
don't know recently Harvey wine
Weinstein yeah yeah it came out that he
was like years years and years of
placement harassing all of these women
and like it's so interesting because
sometimes it's like portrayed like rape
is very or like you know sexual
harassment is very like outward like I
am yes but the way he did it if you hear
the audio it's just like he says like
don't ruin your friendship with you for
five minutes it's only five minutes
mm-hmm I'm like you get to this place
where you're now in danger or whatever
and he does he did like super lure
people in he like oh the meeting was
changed our hotel room or whatever but
that's something that like when it comes
to hoeing this is like a genuine fear
that I have which is like going to a
place and then you don't really get the
opportunity to reserve your right to
change your mind so like you're afraid
of getting stuck in a situation yeah I
just don't want to put my or being in
like view of like going home with
someone and not knowing like who else is
in their apartment yeah do they have
like a bunch of other like a roommates
how do I get home from here if I don't
have enough juice and they all did a lot
of times like I don't want to you know
one pehoe group of like everyman into
this group of you know like predatory
men but it is also interesting that so
many men are like shocked by this and
like sometimes people just don't know
and it's I just not saying that a woman
shouldn't go and explore mm-hmm but for
me I personally don't always feel like
the worst thing possible will happen I
know that's not always the case I mean
even when you were like when we were all
at that that guy's house that you were
talking to right and I like there were
all those other guys in there so we were
at his party and it was me Fred and
Kelsey and just like a bun
of other guys none of who were like
talking to us or really seemed all that
it was just boring white guy but
everyone was drinking and we didn't
really know them so Fred and I are like
well we're not gonna leave healthy here
she was like hooking up with the guy and
we weren't gonna leave her there yes
that's a good that's a good like also at
to add to the hope member occasion list
is like you do have to save ho you have
to do it safely and you have to like
watch out for your friends because
that's what I loved even though they
both were like we have zero interest in
anyone here like we will stay until
morning yeah wanted us to and I was like
oh my god no I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine
but there is something about that
security knowing that like if I did need
to bail you guys were there for me and I
didn't have to it wasn't my
responsibility you know like there is
something to a buffer to having friends
out that's like Oh someone's who needs
to go home where like she stayed at my
place or I have to drop her off or like
whatever it is that's a great point and
also like safety hoing being that like
sometimes your friends will make sure
you're not too like up to do
something you don't want to do like
friends can be there to give you like a
condom or a dental dam or whatever it is
like speaking of holes we spare
gentlemen yeah yeah like oh you got a
home safe yeah I do I do think there are
still so many people that it's sort of
like oh you identify as a ho that means
that there's no respect involved so like
you could feel when someone doesn't
respect you and you could be like okay I
don't think that this is necessarily a
place of a safe place that I want to
really go to and I would love for that
to change but that's sort of weird -
it's sort of like yeah I would like for
things to change but this is just sort
of how things all right no we have to
play by the rules of the game that's
happening it's it's hard to be like
confident but also have your guard up
like because then you come off as like a
bitch or whatever or like if you're too
vulnerable then you're like emotional
and so it's like how do you find a
balance and I don't think it's about you
changing who you are how you hoe it's
about finding someone that knows
how ya like I know this is so pretty to
be like to talk about hoeing so yeah we
find someone who is so interesting
because I feel like there are a lot of
different definitions of hoeing like for
me it may not even necessarily be like
actively going on you than saying like
oh let's go home yeah it's just being
open to the idea that if I do not to
feel bad about it yes yeah you know in
any any way this you it's like it's
taking away like waking up in the next
day and feeling like oh my gosh like
especially like I'm not sure how you
guys grew up but like especially like
body count is such a thing like
especially for women and it's like body
count
it's like it's basically just how many
people you've had sex with okay so
that's what you say like it's like oh
like if someone's talking about like a
hoe it's like oh her numbers are higher
or like a body count is so high like I
would never her like that kind of
thing so it's like I always grew up yeah
and it's like how do how do they know
you know you know but it's like it's
always been such a scary thing it's like
a got to keep it low like if I pass this
amount of if I pass this number then
like I'm a terrible person you know what
I mean there's no one no one will want
me if I pass this Wow that's how that
makes you a less someone who like grew
up so steadily watching her body count
and then now like do you feel like you
have more power over does it feel like
it still has power over you does it feel
liberating does it feel scary how does
it feel for someone who like maybe cuz
I'm definitely not in I can't identify
with that obviously but I can't identify
with like religion right like people my
I grow very Baptist and then being like
if you sleep with people before you
married you're going to hell or whatever
but like yeah to me it was really
liberating and empowering to be able to
decide like Oh numbers don't
matter
in fact I keep a list on my phone every
single person I've ever had excellent
and I look at it sometimes and I feel
like really good about oh this is like a
recent thing like not maybe like within
the last few months that I really feel
like wow like I first of all I don't
really keep count like I kind of that's
how bad it was that I think that's how
stressed I was
about body count I would just try to
forget no you know what I mean yeah I
would just be like exactly so I would
just be like like I would never keep a
list I would just kind of be like no no
maybe around this like I would count
yeah exactly exactly so it's like I'm
just like taking that back and like sort
of in a space where it's just like I
like will be 30 in a couple of years
like I just want to like live my best
life and not feel bad about it whatever
that means to me you know oh yeah I feel
like when I do I remember being in
college and like there is this a kid
that I ended up like hooking up with and
I always thought he was so cute like so
freakin cute this is a whole other story
we don't have to get into it it's the
guy with the gold bond situation well
tell that on the next podcast long story
short the good part of that night where
I didn't burn his dick is he I was so
self-conscious like so self-conscious
cuz I feel like I grew up in a I was
super Catholic and it was also like
women are supposed to look this way like
fit like super thin and so I always just
couldn't stand like my boobs and my hips
and I just like really girl I know I
know and then and so I was like really
self-conscious so I kept pulling like
the covers up over me and I feel like
the way I stand it say it is going to
stay on corny but he was just like stop
doing that you're beautiful
warning oh well I was like I know but
then he was like he didn't ask to have
sex that was another thing he was like
not asking to have sex and I just kept
saying like we're not having sex
we're not having sex and he finally he
was like I'm I'm not asking if you want
to great but I'm not like I feel
pressure yeah but I was still like I had
to say that because it really didn't
feel like my body was my own and like I
wasn't allowed to like this thing and I
felt so guilty for having a body mhm I
felt like it was just it was I had too
much of it and that's why like no one
should be near it because it was bad
like it wasn't bad and what we were
doing was wrong
and all those sort of stuff and I just
so like wouldn't let him near us so
that's like another thing that's like
pretty hard to get past because it would
have been that would have been a good
time to do it well the thing about your
wanting to do it like yeah you know
there's no nothing
there's no good feelings that come out
of like forcing yourself to do something
you're not ready for and like hoeing
doesn't mean hornish means going
out and owning what could happen what
you want to do having complete control
over the situation like I don't even
it's it's not there's really no like
actual definition it's really just what
everyone who wants to participate or
doesn't it makes of it you know it's
just like just like do you girl and on
that no no you have to get back to work
