mm-hmm oh is this the winner yes
should we just read it yeah okay the
winner from Rachel Kirk underscore when
you when you learn during your first
Brazilian wax that it's also your waxers
first resilient wax hashtag chocolate
AHA chef contest at adult jet hilari and
also
yeah good lord god I've never gotten a
waxing before except for a lady like
video they had me get like come on as a
guest and we waxed ourselves and I
couldn't even do it I like I hate for
the woman who actually time I didn't
meet you see here's the thing is that
she used that blue stuff oh there is not
a paper yeah it's not like wax on paper
so you don't get I guess like maybe her
hands were like sweaty or something but
she she went to like rip it out and her
hand slipped so she went three two and
then she went to rip it but she's oh so
it was like a quick pull but not a pull
out and then she went back to pull it
again and I went whoa it was like I just
threw my arm up and she caught it like
an egg as though she had been catching
hand-catching hands for it dude I've
been getting a laser eye getting laser
hair removal and I've left a little like
can I call it a Hitler patch no okay um
I have left a little square patch that
looks like a German no oh no I've left a
small landing strip that also resembles
no - let it go okay
there's just I left a patch but let me
tell you I've only gone into four
sessions and I don't think I need to go
to any more and you know what
surprisingly the laser doesn't really
hurt on the badge
it hurts way more on the legs and on the
back or maybe I just got a tough
that sweet sweet leatherpuss gotta let
the post Oh
seems like prayers but with it whatever
like if I'm three um yeah I don't
actually I haven't done anything to my
pubic hair in a really long time she's
just growing honestly I was like your
fluffy my friend was saying the other
day that she's actually pissed cuz she
did laser when it was cool to be like a
bare naked mole rat on your vag and so
she got everything lasered off and she
was like now she's pissed because she
was like now it's cool to have pubic
hair again like it's like women me and
like feminists I mean none of like yeah
all that's cool like don't feel
pressured to do whatever I just it's
been winter
and I'm not trying I'm not having pubic
hair I know but like I want to trim it
like I've been it's literally something
that's been on my to-do list
trim it and like shave it down a little
bit but what I really want to do I don't
even know this is possible why I want to
do conditioning I want it like soft
there there are facials what yeah
I think we did a video about it where
you going someone like deep conditions
your puss just do it at home get a deep
conditioner lather that bitch up ever so
give her a nice hot towel Oh
treat treat her like an old type my
barber Canada's own the skin itself is
soft yeah but I want the hair to be so
just to maybe start conditioning every
time I don't know though cuz I feel like
pubic hairs is a different texture as
you get older too like I've seen some
older puss but the hair is really soft
and then I want to say younger puss but
I don't want to I want to establish that
it's over 18 younger puss yeah and it's
hot it's like coarse coarser yeah it
feels like horse if we have any doctor
doctors that listen to this can you
confirm that your puss hair gets softer
as you get older doctors or vaginal
hairdressers if you could please reach
out and tell me how to deep condition
must my ratty pubes that would be much
appreciated thank you so much oh I don't
mean to be a bother
no speaking of vaginas I started birth
control again I don't know my upside it
we talked about it and it's why did you
want to be on it again because well okay
so I wanted to be off of it cuz I wanted
to get my body cleansed out of all the
hormones and that's amazing my sex drive
was insane and it was very heavy given
all this and I started getting cystic
acne and I was in a couple BuzzFeed
videos about it trying to find a cure
and I went on all bactine and
doxycycline and all these antibiotics
and still never cleared up and I finally
just said it I'm in a relationship
now where I'm having a lot of sex yeah
and I'd rather also get rid of this acne
so it just seemed like the right time to
go back on it and we have this whole
conversation about it and so what I did
decide update was I went back on
playing there's a plane everyone hold on
there is a plane there is a it's
purchased I went on for I think it's
called projection it's the estrogen free
pill though it's not gonna affect my
mood as much as like normal birth
control would that's good but I will say
having to take up remembering to take a
pill every day is a pain in the ass I
just couldn't go through with the IUD I
heard you two more stories from you
don't take medicine anymore no I'm off
everything off my internet presence off
the only thing I have is my valium for
when I travel which brings us to the
subject of today's episode we had a lot
of you guys write in about this and we
kind of had covered it in in previous
episodes but I think it now is a good
time just because of what happened to me
this weekend but talking about
introducing your mental illness slash
talking about your mental health with a
significant other slash new person slash
friend slash job just how do you
approach it depending on different
person in your life yeah this happened
to me this weekend I already told Kate
about this but I went to Disney with my
boyfriend and another couple and got
food poisoning so we got there like 8:00
a.m. and by like don't tell him what it
was oh it was a combination of like we
got shrimp gumbo and the other one that
I had on a hot day a Monte Cristo
sandwich at 10 a.m. which if you don't
know what Monte Cristo is it is Swiss
cheese turkey ham deep fried no bread
just deep double deep fried with
powdered sugar on top and berry compote
as a side so I had that and then is
berry compote it's like Jay oh my oh I
might even be saying it wrong it might
be computed someone tweeted at us how to
pronounce it
so we were standing in line for a ride
and I got really claustrophobic all of a
sudden and I think it was a combination
of the food poisoning kicking in where
you know that feeling when you just your
whole body has a layer of sweat over it
for no ryu know it's about to happen you
know it's about to happen and i said i
feel like what's the Pigpen from the
Charlie Brown it just feels like all of
a sudden all of the sweat and like
Doni fate is just radiating off of
that's what started happen and I started
to have a panic attack like my I started
to disassociate things didn't feel real
I totally started to freak out and I
turned around and my my boyfriend he was
on his phone playing chess or something
and I like looked at him and I was like
I need you right now and he like was
like woah what's wrong I said I'm gonna
throw up he's like no you're not okay
you're gonna be okay and I was like oh
good and like my mouth started watering
and I literally had to jump the line in
the bushes because that Disney they'd do
that thing where they make those
lines just absolutely insane architect
wise like the layout of those lines is
just absurd mm-hm
and I ran to the bathroom and
immediately just vom for like a good
solid ten minutes and started
my brains out how did you maneuver that
I took 30 seconds once I got into the
bathroom and said what's more important
 my pants or puking on the floor
and so I chose to sit first uh-huh and
then I couldn't so I turned around
and puked with my pants down mhm and
then I turned back around and
didn't have they should have garbage
cans yeah they do but they have garbage
cans that you have to open the flap
stick my head into the flap and puke
anyways that happened and I felt a lot I
mean I didn't feel great but I felt a
lot better once I got all of that
really out of me but yet the residual
like anxiety was still there and I you
know the my boyfriend and the other
couple had already gotten on the ride
and so I started FaceTime with my mom
and I was just like I'm freaking out
like I'm I'm in the middle of a panic
attack and I don't know what you do and
I was able to come down from it I was
able to logic my way out of it which is
not how I normally do things normally I
have to take a valium and kind of wait
for it to pass but I was able to logic
my way out of it being like okay you
felt claustrophobic is that line
you had food poisoning you literally
just expelled a demon out of your
asshole in mouth of course your body is
like like strangers I was in the upside
down in the back
and like of course my body was freaking
out feeling all of those feelings at
once
but anyone who has panic attacks knows
that like after you have one you still
have this like adrenaline and you know
negative feelings and so after my
boyfriend got off ride the DJ was like
okay you need water you need bread you
need to do this we need to do that and I
kept being like no no I don't feel like
I just need you to like hold my hand and
I just need you to like be with me he's
like you need to chug this water eat
this bread eat this bread and I was like
my stomach hurts I don't eat that and he
kept telling me what I needed to do and
so after the day was done we left early
cuz I didn't feel good I like we like
sat down in my room and I was like okay
I love you and thank you for like being
there for me and you did so great but
here's how I need you next time I'm
going through a panic attack to like
help me because it is really scary
sometimes you're like I want someone to
hold me and then the next second you're
like I don't want to be touched anything
you're like I need someone to tell me
it's okay and then I need someone to not
even acknowledge as it's happening so
yeah I told him like you just need to
listen to what I need and I know that's
hard because when you're in the middle
of a panic attack you don't really know
how to express what you need and so it's
almost like you're expecting someone to
have this superpower to know what you
need in that moment and so I think it
was good because that was the first time
I had had like a full-blown panic attack
in front of him and it also just
happened to be coupled with and
vomit mm-hmm but I don't know like what
what has been your experience with
dealing with people for the first time
when you're kind of introducing
something new about yourself that you
normally don't tell it to the world I
mean I'm very new to even like telling
people I feel like you have a pretty
good handle on what it is that you're
feeling and experience and so sometimes
and you you kind of I've noticed like
you own it without necessarily
apologizing mmm it's good
yeah got me so it's difficult to talk to
someone and be like hey this is why I do
this well also knowing that it's not
like could you let me off the hook for
when I up because that's been like
my experience with it is that with an
eating disorder I will stay homes
time's or cancel plans or lash out for
no reason and I mean my friends sort of
grew up I've had it for a very long time
so my friends who grew up with me were
kind of they are you know empathetic
towards it but they're also like hey man
this has been the way it is for a long
time you don't get to just bail because
of this thing and they're right and yeah
so I think it's but in talking to new
people about it I don't know I've had it
I've had mixed mixed reviews you ever
just like drop I feel like it's way
easier to drop in and also we got a
comment once sorry I'm like trying to do
two thoughts at once but we got a
comment once that was saying like why
don't you guys talk more about then just
anxiety and depression like why can't
you talk about other mental illnesses
and I don't have other mental illnesses
that I know of right now I've been
misdiagnosed with a few so I think it's
only appropriate that we do talk about
these things when we have guests on who
can yeah yeah we could get yes yeah but
just so talking about yes going back to
anxiety I think it's easier and I hate
to say this because I know that's not
the truth for everyone but I think it's
easier to slip in the word anxiety into
conversations because people don't know
like there's so many levels of
debilitating anxiety where's when I
think of like eating disorders I think
of like one type of specific feeling in
person and you know no there's not a
spectrum like you either have it or you
don't whereas no one talks about it
right for the most part they don't talk
about it like socially so I'll say it
sometimes I just feel like the weird
thing about telling someone oh I have an
eating disorder is my assumption that
they're gonna look me up and down and be
like no you don't know why that's the
 eating disorder man oh so
they'll be like yeah but you're not skin
and bone so no if it's not anorexia it's
not an eating disorder you know oh do
you make yourself throw up no you just
binge eat okay so you're just a your fat
lazy person you know what I mean so it
is with eating disorders I feel like
it's a little bit it's a little bit
harder also because I think a lot of
people have disordered eating
and it's just sort of like the norm like
there is kind of a spectrum to it in a
weird way like you can have like certain
triggers and again tell me if I'm wrong
so I know nothing about this but like it
seems like you can have like a mental
illness around food but not necessarily
have like an eating disorder does that
make sense like I'm sure you could have
you know weird relationships with food
and body image without it being an
eating disorder but I think that that's
a symptom of something else and so even
with eating disorders it's not really
about the food it's about yourself worth
and hiding and boundaries and all of
this other stuff so yeah I think that's
a that's probably one of the biggest
challenges getting to know someone and
being like here's a boundary yeah that's
hard I mean yeah so you've been thinking
about like the firt like how do you even
approach that conversation
cuz I've had men specifically I don't
know like you know because men aren't
allowed to like feel feelings in our
society but I've had men specifically
tell me that like I don't I don't really
have panic disorder like I don't I'm not
really depressed like I'm just going
through something you know this was back
before it was a little bit easier to
talk about these things in public but
you know the first time I talked about
it with the DJ was when we were drunk
and I was like this is a perfect time to
bring this up because you know what
we're both really drunk and we're both
being vulnerable and I feel like you
know as drunk man's words are sober
man's thoughts and like let me just like
get it out of the way and so I opened
with like yeah I went to rehab once for
like mental health because I had really
bad panic disorders and then he kind of
opened up about his mental health and we
were able to have a dialogue about it
but there have been times where I've
talked to you know like a employer who
didn't understand it who would be like
well what do you mean you like everybody
sees because well anxiety yeah I mean
like art like older people like older
generations didn't really have this
dialogue or these this vocabulary to be
like I'm sorry
you're anxious I don't care my dad was
in the mines you don't think he was
anxious you don't think he had weird
image issues no he had a hard time yeah
so I definitely think there's like that
you know lift yourself up by your
bootstraps and get over it type of
mentality but I all but I think there's
there should be a common ground it
always feels like when there's when
things are one way we pull it so far the
extreme the other way that it kind of
has to bounce back and find its middle
and I definitely think that like I
shouldn't be so for example if I bail on
some I like was stayed home from
someone's birthday party because I was
like I can't do it today I'm so sorry
and just because so here's the here's an
important thing to remember is that just
because she knows like the girl who I
bailed on and just because she knows
what I'm going through and everything
doesn't mean that I'm safe from her
being upset yeah and I don't think she
was upset but she if she was she didn't
tell me that's a really good that's like
a pretty good friend do you think no cuz
like I think it is because she no I
think it's good to know be like alright
they're going through something and
that's cool if it continues and it's
like a constant thing when it's like
yeah man maybe maybe step but like I I
agree and then there's the part that
anxiety part of me that's like no if I'm
having a panic attack I would skip going
to like a like I wouldn't skip
like my best friend's wedding if I had a
panic attacks like I wouldn't be able to
it's not something that I could just
like come down from right that and that
is OK for you to do but that doesn't
mean that they don't get to feel a
certain way about it but then so like
how do we balance that like how do we
balance when when is it too much when do
you become the friend that bails on
everything because of like your you know
what I mean I mean if you are than you
are you know what I mean like I think
that's I think that's what's frustrating
I think that's why people kind of have a
hard time talking or like accepting
mental health stuff I feel like older
generations have a hard time talking
about it because it does it's so easy
for it to be misconstrued as an excuse
right I like snow flaky like has a
mental problem yeah I mean what's Kevin
Love just came out with that article
about having panic attacks you see yeah
Kevin look at the basketball player know
if you look him up he's very attractive
okay I think he's good at basketball
we're Quentin and I did a video about
basketball if moms did the oh that was
so halftime report check it out I play
Kevin love's mom would love but I think
that like you know we should talk about
or what's his article beau he had a
panic attack during a game and he Angela
you he got really sick and or like you
felt really sick and Stephanie was like
he couldn't really want like move yeah
and so his coach was like I don't know I
can't remember it verbatim but he had to
go into the locker room and lay on the
ground and like no one knew what was
happening and he went to the doctor he's
like what happened they're like
everything's fine he's like then what
the happened to me sort of Sex in
the City where miranda has to go to the
emergency room yeah and then when Carrie
gets there she's like I just had a panic
attack it's fine yeah it's no big deal
but that was so ahead of its time like
yeah to have like the working female
woman character a panic attack in the
middle of a day and like have to miss
work and stuff but I also think that a
lot of you know we should notice these
things you know what I mean like we
should and acknowledge it if you had a
panic attack when something happened I'd
be like oh like if you say I was getting
married yeah and you were like oh man
I'm coming I'm having a panic attack I'd
be like yeah yeah no I wouldn't say
get the up I'd just be like okay I
got wouldn't make you get it unless you
had like a ring and I would be like all
right I'm sending someone to come get
the ring man and then make sure you're
okay yeah but I think that that's like
important to is that I think think
there's more yeah I think there's a lot
more empathy that you could have for
other people if you yourself could
recognize when things are like hard
mm-hmm for you and when you know you
might be having a panic attack
and then sometimes panic attacks happen
when you're not sending the right
boundaries yeah I mean they can be they
you know there is this mental health
there's all sorts of freaking stuff just
like physical health you I'd the other
day I stepped down on my hip wrong and
on my knee it was my knee I was like
what the just happened to remember
yeah and then you just have a shitty
knee no now it's fine I like I walked
through it man I don't know I was I'm
getting off topic I want to talk to you
a little bit about like how to tell your
friends well
just hop it doesn't matter who it is
because I feel like there is this idea
that you have to be like kind of
confident about it and be like very
secure in it and being like hey I'm
gonna sit you down and explain to you
exactly what it is and it kind of
loosely goes with the idea I've heard
some some I've seen some that went
back and forth on Twitter about when
people say like you have to love
yourself before you can love anyone else
and people being like nope of people
being like that's not true you can
absolutely hate parts of yourselves and
not be okay and still love somebody else
and I think that goes along with this
conversation like the first time I had
to tell someone about that stuff I was
not confident I did not feel good about
it I was not it's not something I loved
about myself and you know I still peer
with the word love it about myself
because that makes it sound like I'm
romanticizing it but I do think that I
am Who I am because of all of the hard
times I've been able to realize I can
get through despite my anxiety but being
able to sit someone down and actually go
through the conversation and feel
confident and sometimes showing your
vulnerability and it is really scary
because a lot of people are
undereducated about a lot of this stuff
so sometimes you know the best you can
do is just tell someone hey sometimes
things don't feel real or like sometimes
I feel like I'm gonna die and it's
really scary and I don't understand it
but I need you to understand that that's
the most I can tell you about it yeah
makes any sense like I don't know if
that's the same way with the IDI but for
me I've done I've had so many of these
things happened and I've had this
for so many years that I'm able to kind
of scientifically explain it to some
people No mm-hmm but when I first
started I had zero confidence in telling
people about it but I think it was more
important that they knew mm-hmm so that
when it did happen inevitably mmm it
wasn't like a weird thing like what the
 it just happened to her like she's
left set orally yeah just ran out of the
room or why is she facetiming up with
her mom for an hour in the middle of the
day yeah I don't know if there's any
tips we can give people that like don't
fully feel confident about it or love
themselves or like are in a new
relationship on it
expectedly and now feel like it's the
right time to talk about it I mean you
might be able to speak better to the
anxiety and depression aspect of it I
would say to anyone who is currently
struggling with an eating disorder we
all know that it's not really about the
food or about the you know your body or
whatever that's what it definitely feels
like but it's not really about that I
would say that it is a voice that's very
loud and it's like you're listening to
headphones and the whole world is going
on outside and you think everyone's
listening to what you're listening to
but you're the only one at that moment
wearing these headphones so like I could
look at a situation I could look at a
situation when my eating disorder voice
is really talking I hear something very
different than what other people are
saying so I think that that is like I
remember I got into a fight with a
friend when she was like oh I thought
that person was you and when I looked at
that person I was like you think
I look like that person which is so mean
to both that person and that person's
fine look but in my head it was just
like that person's not like in my I was
like you're not thin enough to me and
whatever so it's and we got in a big
fight of it was like this whole thing
but I think that that is something to
keep in mind when you know - when
reacting to what other people are saying
and when getting close to other people
it's important to just know okay this is
how I react to something and this is
this is what I hear and then you know
sometimes if you're in a relationship a
close relationship the other person
should know and that's the other thing
we should talk about is if if the person
you're talking to whether it be a
co-worker an employer a lover a
significant other a friend if they
aren't willing to acknowledge your truth
as real and valid then I would suggest
you just have to find out what's right
for you you know you can't change
someone but or a situation really oh you
can talking about yeah
okay I definitely think that they're
like when it comes to co-workers and
employers I definitely think that there
it's a bit more of a gray area than it
is you need to make money you know you
need to make everyone's as lucky as we
are yeah we have a very open but there I
mean if I worked we're like I don't know
any one of my family works and I was
just like can you please not use that
dialogue I don't know if it would go
over quite as well I think that people
would be like um it just depends so you
also have to worry about like if you
were to say that would they look at you
different would they think you're like
incompetent would they not trust you
with certain projects because they would
be afraid you'd bail or have too much
anxiety yeah those are all what-ifs I
would still just speak your truth and
let what happens happen I'm trying to
hide it yeah I definitely think that
there there was a time when I felt that
and I don't know if this is true or no
this is how I felt when I felt that
talking about my eating disorder talking
about you know the symptoms of it or
what happens was I was using it as an
excuse so everyone is on their own time
right everyone's going they're doing the
best they can at the time that they can
and I'll talk to like my therapist from
about this and I'll just feel like it's
just the same thing over and over I'm
never gonna do this thing because of
this thing what am I gonna just do it
and I definitely think there's a weird
gray area but it's not an absolute
there's a great area of okay this is how
I feel and it's because of this but I
want this really really badly so I'm
gonna deal with all of these feelings
while I go and try to get this for
example to put it into like something
that makes a little bit more sense I
want to be with someone right I don't
know if I'm necessarily ready to to
really be like physically close with
someone or that intimate with someone
but I want to be and before before I
even got into therapy I was I was like
yeah I definitely want to be with
someone but I had no idea how much work
I actually had to do and it is work
that's the worst part
you go to therapy and then you have to
work on during the week and I'm
like oh god can't you just push a button
yeah we can't so yeah I definitely think
that there so if there if it feels like
it's so overwhelming with a certain
person or a certain situation where
you're like this is you're not getting
it you're not getting what I'm going
through you you might be in a situation
that's not right for you right now yeah
yeah I agree yeah
and to like we're it's changing you know
like it the society is changing we're
really lucky but I think you you know
yourself the best you know yourself
better than anyone even if you don't
fully understand like what is happening
to you your strongest armor and weapon
is your voice and I think being able to
go to therapy and talk openly and like
being honest because I have a book that
talks about anxiety and depression and
it lists thoughts like common anxiety
thoughts that I thought I was the only
person in the world who had them
so I think if you can be honest with
yourself and be as honest as you can
with a fair why are you laughing
sorry I just thought of something this I
just whenever we talk about mental
health we start this is whatever we
start giving advice oh yeah we don't
have it together at all like that's what
that is why I'm laughing is that we're
like oh yeah let's talk about this
vulnerable thing let's tell people that
they could be vulnerable let's actually
just tell people what to do instead of
let's actually talk about it so I'm
gonna kind of go back to if that's cool
with you I flip on my retainer in time
oh god hurts so I'm gonna go back to
what you were saying with Lady Jaye and
what were like what did you do when you
spoke to him about it like did he have
questions what were you feeling did you
want to just like not really talk to him
about it yeah in the moment
I wanted him to just know what I needed
mhm it was and that's why I had to wait
until it passed and I just kind of had
to deal with him trying to literally
shove pieces of bread into my mouth
because he thought that's what I needed
to feel better and I happy always
thought you were hungover right yeah
well not even that but just I hadn't
eaten all day and the only thing I had
eaten what's that Monte Cristo
and he was like you need to put
something in your stomach which was
probably true but mentally I was like I
need like I'll just deal with this now
and I kind of went into that
fight-or-flight thing where I had the
choice to stay and kind of deal with my
feelings or I was like I want to leave
and so I stayed for as long as I could
before I was like I need to leave
because I don't like feel mentally right
God you don't want to do that Disney's
on earth we were with another couple and
I felt really badly so were you trying
to talk yourself out of the feelings
yeah feeling yeah absolutely being like
stay you bitch like yeah
dealt with anxiety attacked in public
all the time this isn't gonna be the one
that kills you or makes you go
crazy cuz it never will but it
wasn't until I got home and you know I
did take a valium and I took a nap and
when I woke up I told him like okay
here's what I need and what he responded
with was like I was just trying to help
like I went and he went in the fixer
mode it was like he wanted he felt like
he was doing everything he could and I
wasn't doing enough to try feel and try
filled tried to feel better hmm that's
interesting because it feels like no
because I think that you know we started
this being like what's the dialogue you
have with other people but it does sound
like there is still a dialogue inside of
you with yourself that is very
judgmental and very yeah and sort of
that's why so I I wonder how much of it
has to do with I want him to know and I
want to trust what my instincts are
without beating myself up and that's why
the first time we even had a discussion
about it which like if you know you hang
out with me you would never guess any of
this is happening so that's why
when the first time we even talked about
it I had to be nice and tipsy cuz I was
like I'm just gonna put it out
there and if he runs but that's his
 loss because I'm pretty great
even with
this but yours do you think that
people are fooled by that by what by
that like bravado of being like I'm cool
like you wouldn't notice if you just met
you that any guys going on I've read
comments and the videos that I've been
in where people have said she doesn't
really have this thing or she has no
clue what real anxiety disorder is like
or she does she's to out going to have
this thing and I'm like huh that anyone
can have this right and I think
my point is is that you can be outgoing
and still have something like
debilitating about your you know
whatever insert mental illness here but
I don't think it needs to be as
debilitating for other people to deal to
love you or like you either yeah for
sure I think it's kind of I mean I think
that I maybe not honestly cuz I think
that you do have this like this provide
I do the same thing so maybe I'm
projecting unto you I don't know
but I know that if I'm feeling super
insecure I'll drink a lot and then I'll
be loud and showy I'll be like here's
where I'm comfortable I'm bleeding
loudly putting on your putting loud and
showy do you do you say like what like
 it I don't care I don't care no no
I see I don't mean it I was like it
out Carrie thinking I mean I I was
saying in that specific instance like
I'm just gonna put all my flaws out
there for him to either take these no no
I know how you were after I'm talking
about like right before we were like
people wouldn't know because I'm usually
like blah blah blah this is am I you
know what I mean I I guess yeah I
guessed here to that point then like I I
genuinely think when a stranger meets
mean they don't assume I have anxiety
based on how I'm able to present myself
in a social setting mm-hmm I definitely
think yeah maybe someone who hasn't put
the work in but I definitely think
anyone who has been there yeah like if
they're a friend a friend or someone
who's been like
yeah Oh interesting that's how I feel
about it because because right now
you're alert you're being more
vulnerable with someone and having these
conversations and whatever so you might
not once I think that once it's it's
kind of like tapping your foot in the in
the water right once you get used to it
you might not be so guarded because I
feel like that is part your this is what
I'm dealing with a lot too I'm like what
part is my personality and what part is
a is a armor and so I wonder if because
if you're sort of dealing with things
that aren't necessarily the same but
they're similar your own experiences I
wonder how much of that is armor yeah
and how much of that is your person I
definitely think you're like you know
low very loud I think it was I think it
was something Hannah Hart said our
friend Hannah she was on the podcast
before talking about mental health but
she was saying it's important to have
these like small awkward conversations
because we forget that they are they
forget that they are just going to be
short awkward small conversations yeah
like it could feel like the biggest deal
but they're so important and they're so
fleeting then we we have to remember not
to beat ourselves up about things after
interactions have happened which I know
is not the case for like the majority of
the world right but it is one of those
things that I think it's Erica's told me
once that we think people are thinking
about us all the time and they're
actually not like as soon as you're done
having that weird interaction with a
co-worker unless there really is
something behind that they're probably
never thinking about that conversation
again make it so socially worked up that
I think it's again it's one of those
things where even though it might feel
awkward and uncomfortable and you might
not be a hundred percent confident in
having the conversation with these
people it's better to have it than to
not have it what I agree 100% I'm just
noticing a pattern what I don't mean to
psychoanalyze you know every time we
talk about something then it gets and
vulnerable I do the same thing the only
reason I'm able to call it out but I did
do it I did have a conversation with
yeah I know but then it went right back
to here's the advice I think I think
it's because of work
hurry it out I know I know I'm just
noticed I do the same thing look at me
I'm literally calling out your flaws I
haven't opened up a single bit on this
episode really yeah yeah yeah okay
I just saw that really long
vomiting story in the beginning with him
like it was moron yeah we are doing a
shorter episode so I do want to find us
it wrap around without to the good stuff
yeah just like we do avoidance avoidance
um I don't know maybe one episode we
could call in to people like you calling
the DJ you could call in a friend and we
could have asked them how they really
thought the first time we told them
about our things felt to them yeah and
how they took it and and how how we can
help other people have these same
conversations yeah that's good I think
that if we're gonna ensure we end on a
little bit of I guess advice as though
we didn't give enough preach advice in
the beginning I think that what the main
thing I'm learning through all of this
so this isn't really advice it's just
what I'm learning is that I thought I
was very different in my experiences and
that they were I would like judge them
kind of being like oh you know stick it
out you or like something like
that I would judge those sorts of things
and it turns it turns out everyone has
those moments and it doesn't mean that
your moments aren't important it just
means that the stuff that you are
desperately trying to hide from the
world that I've been desperately trying
to hide has actually been this stuff
that gets me closest to other people and
it's the time when I feel the least
alone is when I'm able to open up and
have someone else be like no granted
sometimes people will be like yeah that
happens cuz they're not ready to talk to
you about it about you know their stuff
maybe they never will be who knows but I
think what's been really wonderful is
when I do open up do not want having
them be like me too and then they have
this like little moment you're like oh
this is maturity this is growing up this
is what it means like to have adult
relationships people would you say adult
 I think this is adult yeah
we hope that was somewhat helpful again
will always circle back to mental health
