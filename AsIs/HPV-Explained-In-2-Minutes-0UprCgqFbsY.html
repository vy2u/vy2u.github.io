never heard of HPV no what is that my
acronyms aren't really coming to me
right human papilloma virus yeah and
what do you know about it
well I'm a man not much not good its STD
uh that's all that Rena I should
probably know what HPV is I'm a little
embarrassed I don't know what that means
but uh I'm making a video to show you
yes so whether you've heard about HPV
before or not it's probably something
you should know about
according to the CDC 79 million
Americans currently have HPV making it
the most popular STI in the game but
what exactly is it HPV stands for human
papilloma virus which is really a group
of over 150 related viruses most strains
aren't a big deal you could contract HPV
show no symptoms in your body could
clear it entirely on its own but other
strains are more serious and can lead to
things like genital warts and certain
types of cancer that's where doctors
come in for female bodied people it's
important to get regular Pap tests so
you can see if anything abnormal is
going on with your cervical cells if you
do have an abnormal pap you might be one
of the many millions of people with HPV
but don't freak out your healthcare
provider will let you know what if
anything you need to do from their male
body people can have HPV too but there
is currently no way to test those types
of bodies for it so unless you have
genital warts or another type of symptom
you may never know if you have HPV so
that leaves us in sort of a confusing
place if you have oral anal or vaginal
sex you could contract HPV because it's
spread through genital to genital
contact yep I am talking about naked dry
humping what should you do to protect
yourself first and foremost regardless
of your gender you should talk to your
doctor about the HPV vaccines they
prevent some of the higher risk strains
also use protection condoms help but
since they don't usually cover your
entire genitals they can't protect you
completely most importantly if you have
HPV tell your partner look I know it's
not the sexiest subject but it's
essential that we talk about it to
protect ourselves and our favorite
people to get naked
