about having sex while having alopecia
specifically having sex when you are
wearing a wig and or bald so just
recently I shaved my head because my
alopecia was making me feel pretty
powerless and thanks to finding such
supportive people around me I was
reminded to stay thankful and be
confident and I was just truly happy
with my decision the one thing that I
was apprehensive about was having sex
with a wig and or balls but I felt so
silly that it bothered me and so I
figured you know what if you're strong
you should just be good to go so we
start hooking up just two days after
shaving my head and oh my god is this
wig making me feel awkward in reality I
just hadn't gotten acclimated to it yet
but I was so aware of it and it felt so
weird and then I decided to just
impulsively take it off hey babe I like
the things coming off so much like my
father than addressing and constantly
forever so I think it was going to take
it off I was not ready for that either I
was so uncomfortable I then tried to act
like I was fine and push him to talk
about in what ways did he feel weird
Cory explain that obviously he finds me
beautiful you know that I think that
you're beautiful like you know even with
the shaved head like you know I think
you're sexy
right yeah but that there was this
temporary initial feeling it all just
happened
and so the bald head thing was a little
emotional and so it makes me want to you
know like cuddle you and comfort you
more than you know like a verage you it
ended in a pretty awkward experience I
think that at first it might feel
awkward for you or for them but the
important thing is to just not push it
and just be patient and let yourself
acclimate a little bit it's not that the
concern is stupid but it will get better
and what's funny is that now this is not
a big deal at all the funny thing is so
just like a week later we both got
really thoughtful with right you get
also scheme
are you just needed to talk about it
beforehand we just needed to talk about
it when we weren't naked you're gonna
have a serious conversation don't do it
naked so if we had to learn the hard way
now I love having sex with wigs now now
it's like I have like different types of
sex that's right that's the way it's
almost like you can request the style of
sex that you want your head a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
