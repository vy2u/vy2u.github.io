four women to be sexually assaulted in
college I'm so independent and strong
but here I am feeling like a statistic
I regret not reporting my sexual assault
to my campus police officers now I get
to see the man who did it every day
getting away with it since I was
sexually assaulted I have no motivation
for anything graduating college has been
my dream since I was eight no I just
don't care anymore just another thing he
took from me I moved an hour away to a
new college for a new start I was
sexually assaulted by a friend in the
first two months I was sexually
assaulted by my roommate in college my
best friend knows he's still friends
with her I'm a gay guy in college and if
he wants to go I was sexually assaulted
by another guy I haven't told anyone
I'm scared he'll do it again I was
sexually assaulted at college nobody
believes me not even my own parents
believe me I was sexually assaulted in
college I thought I was able to make
peace with it but last night I had a
dream I was raped again now I can't stop
shaking and crying I'm going to be sick
I was sexually assaulted while under the
influence by someone I trusted during my
first semester of college because I
haven't found the right way to cope I
even isolate myself or have sex too fast
I can't tell my mom that I was sexually
assaulted here in college because she
has enough to worry about back home 700
miles away after I was sexually
assaulted in college my boyfriend at the
time cheated on me because he said he
should get to sleep with someone else -
I was sexually assaulted in college 4
years ago I still get panicked at times
when I'm near men I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
