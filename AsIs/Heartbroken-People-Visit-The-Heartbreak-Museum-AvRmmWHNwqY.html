and romantic the way that like I've
dreamed about it but I loved him and I
like just wanted that to be enough so
badly Museum of broken relationships is
an exhibit revolving around the
artifacts of our broken relationships
they're the kind of things that you
don't want to throw away you're too
attached to to donate not a lot of
monetary value here but like the types
of things that you would probably save
in a fire I ended it and it was really
really hard I think it's the most
heartbroken I've ever been literally he
said I guess I'm just shallow about
bodies you immediately feel like you're
worthless there was a period where it
was getting really bad he was like
actually not calling me every name in
the book I felt like my soul ship in a
way that I've only felt in deaths I
would like to be okay with being
heartbroken this is toothpaste they used
thing of toothpaste the boyfriend always
used the same type of toothpaste and
then once the partner got to the end of
his toothpaste that was like the end of
the relationship after he was gone the
dog collar light apparently they used to
put it on their dogs used to wander off
in the night they broke up and the woman
took the dog and she was too emotionally
wrecked to take care of a puppy I got a
puppy when I first got divorced she sort
of saved me I guess she really liked
meat smokers so he gave it to her and
then when they broke up she put it on
this porch and it just sat there at
first everything is always so new and
bright and shiny like
meanwhile this is so exciting and then
one is over it just dies at 6:40 a.m.
what the heck am i doing you look so
cute
you were sleeping love love so I left
you know that was very typical of him in
the beginning but it was all the ruse
and I could see that now this is this
shirt that was worn on the day her
husband told her their marriage was over
it's a sweet shirt and she felt like she
was going out to a nice lunch and then
her whole life was going to change I
don't remember what I was wearing when
my husband told me what had happened I'm
glad I don't I'm glad I don't have a
blue chiffon top that's an example of
what not to do for a guy silicone breast
implants especially for a four-year
relationship
I'd rather try and fail whereas you
would prefer to hold back and maintain
it didn't work and then it really all
started to crumble that's kind of how I
feel like it not that he wasn't all-in
maybe I wasn't it's just a salad spinner
it's collapsible this is a melted phone
and it reminds me of one of the
instances where he was like screaming at
me in the car
and I started recording him on my phone
he's like what are you doing and I said
I'm recording you and he grabbed the
phone opened the car door and smashed it
I think twice on the asphalt I think a
lot of time you want to believe and
something even though when you know it's
maybe not the way you would like it to
be it's helpful to know that you're like
not alone of course but also that like
you can have a sense of humor it's
better to embrace the silly than just
sort of like bottle it up and voila
there are just so many items that seem
insignificant but on the whole they sort
of sum up an entire relationship a
natural thing for people is to want to
connect other people's pain to their own
it's those little tiny details that make
my relationship so unique to me and
that's the true for everybody the people
just do they distance you from who
you're close to so you don't really have
an out having an outlet is freedom
