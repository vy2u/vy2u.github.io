artist then I'll be the first one my
name is Andrea Tomlin and I'm a makeup
artist who happens to be colorblind the
type of colorblindness that I have is
called Deuter anomaly and it is a
red-green weakness so I tend to confuse
red green orange and brown colors I've
kind of always known that there was
something different about me as a child
I was definitely bullied I really tried
to be like everyone else and try to wear
certain matching colors I could never
quite grasp why everybody else was
looking a certain way and they didn't
look at me the same way I joined the
airforce when I was 18 and I was
diagnosed with color blindness after we
did our color blind tests and they did
tell me that I would never be a pilot
when I left the military I went into
wedding planning and unfortunately a lot
of the makeup artists never showed up so
I had to learn how to do makeup I came
to DC and I got hired as a manager at
Sephora I was terrified I accepted the
job and I really loved how they taught
me a lot about color theory one day I
was talking to one of my trainers and he
was talking a little bit about the color
balance that I had for eyeshadows that I
was wearing I was really trying to put a
lot of colors on and they weren't quite
meshing I told him I said you know I'm
colorblind and he was like what you're
colorblind
tell me how that relates to what you do
here so that I can help you I went home
and cried because I was so happy that I
wasn't made front of no one was judging
me and everything from that point was
how do I grow how do I work with what I
already have and make it what I want it
to be I started really telling people
hey listen I'm a makeup artist and I'm
colorblind and now the reaction that I
get is like wow you're colorblind I
never knew that I'm really grateful for
all the people that were supporting me
in my life the people that were teasing
me I'll do your makeup the colors that I
typically tend to either confuse or I
can't see all of the hues are reds and
greens when I open up an eyeshadow
palette or if I look at a lip palette
sometimes I see five colors when there's
really 12 when it comes to Reds I could
sit there and look at a red or several
Reds and do
best to figure it out but I can't make
myself see something that's not there
I'm very good at seeing Purple's so I
know about color theory I'll add blue to
turn it purple and when I mix it with
several of the lipsticks I see which
one's darker and which one's lighter I
see which one's going to be brighter
more bold and I also see which one's
going to be deeper the one that turned
purple is a true red the one in the
center is turning brownish so that's
going to be closer to an orange and then
this one is a little bit deeper but not
quite a purple and not quite a brown so
that's gonna be more of like a
terracotta salmon that type of color
when it comes to eye shadows and when it
comes to green it's a little bit
different because green is already a
secondary color I rely a lot on textures
so I have a lot of matte greens I have a
lot of shimmers and I tend to not put
the two together if there's a customer
or a client that really wants a matte
monochromatic green eyeshadow I rely
more on my knowledge of brushes and I
will diffuse it and make it look like
it's several different colors of green
when it's really just one eyeshadow I'll
use my camera filter on my cellphone
I'll definitely put it to a color that I
can see I switch to several different
filters I take a picture and cycle
through the different filters if the
foundation match that I've done matches
in all of the filters then it's a good
match but if it's often one or two of
the filters I know that I need to change
the shade we kind of collaborate and we
really make it a project that we're both
invested in people are already nervous
about getting their makeup done so just
involving them having fun having them
relaxed and just telling them listen
it's just makeup everything that I do is
really customized for the person that's
sitting down in front of me I don't
consider colorblindness to really be an
obstacle that can't be overcome it is
definitely something that's going to be
more of a challenge but it's not
something that you have to say is going
to limit you from being in the cosmetic
industry I am self-taught I never went
to cosmetology school I wish I had but
that's okay I literally kind of jumped
in it going into Sephora with zero
makeup background I'm like set up for
failure right there
whenever I punched out and went home
homework to do I made sure that I
studied what our products were what's
gonna give me the best color payoff what
I'm gonna put on a deeper complexion
customer what I'm gonna put on somebody
that's a lighter complexion what am I
gonna put on somebody that's red what am
I gonna put on somebody with a yellow
undertone I had to sit and figure out
how am I gonna blend these colors that I
don't see I literally put on makeup
every single day every single day
because it's not just me doing makeup
it's not me being vain it's not because
I can't go out without makeup on it's
because this is my craft this is the art
form and I have to practice I would like
to have a cosmetics line that is super
pigmented so even people like me can see
the colors I would like to have some
type of product that doesn't have to be
one solid color and you can play with it
and turn it into something else I'm
excited that it's not the same beauty
industry as it was 50 years ago or ten
years ago or even five years ago or
three years ago
it's including so many more people it's
just showing people the more creative
you are the more free you are don't
worry about if this person is gonna be
upset or this person is happier this
person said it is your life and if you
don't start embracing the differences
that you have and really just going for
it later in life you're gonna say I
really wish I could have done that just
stay positive there's always a rainbow
and there's always a pot of gold at the
end of it even if you can't see all the
colors of the rainbow so you might have
noticed fold leaves now as is but don't
worry you'll still get all the same
