very confident in this and now I'm like
freaking out on dropping things okay and
we have to come up with a complete
wardrobe for New Year's Eve yes New
Year's is just right around the corner
and we want to look good but we got a
ball on a budget and Sheila is here
Sheila's always great it's just she
loves to be comfortable I'm gonna get
you out of that I'm gonna back into your
dress okay this year my goal is to make
sure that you have a New Year's kick
with this outfit twist the one thing
we're gonna do here is that we're gonna
pick one non clothing item to
incorporate into the look to make it a
full glam avant-garde like really unique
we'll see what we can do in 10 minutes
with twenty dollars ten minutes you
didn't tell me that the ten minute start
now
yes we got to go bye all right where are
we going
I love flannels does this look too much
like a lumberjack so I need to make it
like glitzy this is it like for a small
child okay there's so many pants for men
the 16w what does that mean this is a
skirt that you like she look aware you
think he'll like this it's two bucks
mm-hmm you know what I also love this I
don't know if it matches but I'm gonna
put Sheila in something crazy oh yes I
kind of want him to wear this without a
shirt I don't know how much time I have
and I'm afraid I'm gonna screw this up I
still haven't found like the look I want
this is very New Year's but it also
reminds me of a leprechaun oh this is
the one this is the one I need to find
shoes and a jacket Sheila loves to be
relaxed so this is very New Year's it
says it's lit two minutes
leather I'm freaking out cuz I probably
second I have to find an item um but the
accessory that we're gonna use that's
not an clothing item is gonna be a good
snack because it's New Years Eve and
he's gonna be hungry
idea like as a cute avant-garde belt or
something like a sash yes so eight bucks
399 and $5.99 and the chocolate 129 so
the little shimmery top s 399 the bottom
is $6.99 I believe and then we have the
shoes for 399 I don't know how to do
math that is for 4 that's 8 plus 6 mix I
don't know how to do math there will be
some math over here and then this is
also a $5 higher necklace so I'm picking
up spinning about 17 ish dollars I
barely made it
19:27 for this whole outfit and you get
chocolate I can't wait to see right in
this outfit though okay we're done we're
done I'm very confident in my look I got
you a nice top a nice high-low skirt and
the coin is it it's your accessory yeah
we're like a sash what is this that you
have here it's little slides they say
it's legs I know you like to be
comfortable what did you get me I got
you chocolate in your pocket good look
how awesome is that I notice there is no
shirt no shirt a little skin it's all
under 20 bucks see all of this was under
it was seventies I did a little better
there I'm so excited for this job we'll
see how this let's go the thing is I
love it I know I have a lot going on
this is a whole lot of chocolate out
here we're like this like I think it's
not even there like I just like
the great conversation starter lay that
I still say I win I love the shoes with
the outfit I just love this tie it's my
favorite thing you love it so much why
don't you wear the today I would totally
rock attire we're gonna take the best
Instagram pic we can with this and then
let our peer society and see which
outfit they like the best
I'm gonna
ooh well they're both really great
already because they both come from
bargain shopping and I'm a big fan of
bargain shopping this is interesting is
that like a cooler who if you put me at
a tire I'm so done the sandals stay lit
and aren't we all
from here up I'm getting like weird
costume party from here down I'm like oh
maybe it's the mid summer I feel like
this outfit is very classic this is spot
on this is great he's topless is me
topless a chocolate bar you can have as
a midnight snack if you don't have
anybody smooch food
I think Sheila definitely won with
Ryan's life I personally would go with
this look hello
hands-down Sheila won I like Sheila
style on Ryan the best though Ryan has
one hell of an imagination looks like
you lost whatever the thing is it's not
my fault that people can't see my vision
I'm visionary tires happen good effort</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
