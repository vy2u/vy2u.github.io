of course not um I just I thought we
should talk you know or check-in before
we you know just so don't get sad yeah
yeah that's a really good idea yeah uh
you start okay well I like you a lot
Maya but I don't think I'm ready for a
relationship right now well that's
ridiculous we already in a relationship
uh just not a monogamous one but every
connection that you have with someone is
a relationship true I guess what I'm
trying to say is that I'm not really
ready for a monogamous relationship
what do you mean ready uh well just put
work and you know things are I don't
think that I will ever be ready for
monogamy what I don't believe in a
monogamous lifestyle I've tried it
before and it just doesn't work for me
oh nice no but I mean if that's what
you're most comfortable with and we
probably shouldn't sleep together
because we don't want the same things
there's some kind of trick like a mind
trick get me to commit yeah
after years of self-reflection and
experimentation I've formed this very
specific life philosophy for the sole
purpose of forcing some guy into a
exclusive relationship yeah I'm sorry I
I should just go why because I just
thought you know you're you're pissed
why would I be pissed I don't know okay
first rule of date Club if I'm pissed
I'm gonna tell you come here let's
figure this thing out
do you enjoy spending time with me yes
are you attracted to me obviously are
you comfortable with me seeing other
people you see is this a hypothetical
question are you actually seeing other
people I'm seeing some other people sure
like how many there's that many no it's
just not that easy of a question to
answer because it changes all the time
like you know my friend Jesse yeah that
girl you always work out with yeah well
Jesse's actually a guy and sometimes we
hang out after but other than that it's
um just some friends here and there uh
and my best friend from high school but
what about you I mean we haven't been
seeing each other for that long there
must be some other girls floating around
I mean I don't know I there was like
this one girl who I was sort of chatting
with online oh that's awesome what was
she like I don't know um we actually
never met up that's too bad
so are you still online no no why I've
met some really great people online like
I met this guy Paul hi Maya and Dave hey
Maya oh and Raul hey Maya
that's what's so great about it
everybody offers you something different
what do i what do I offer you hmm
so far companionship a little bit of
sexual tension
are you finding that guy from your
office the one that always writes on
your facebook ball Oh Ryan oh no way
he has a girlfriend you guys are so cute
so they're monogamous that's against the
rules
but there are rules of course there are
rules do you think I just hump anything
that moves regardless of the situation
well my guts telling me yes but your
tones telling me no you are um
not what the hot you were who did you
think I was I don't know um normal not a
 whoa whoa whoa whoa you said that
not me
yeah but when I say it I don't think of
it as a bad thing
but it's not a bad thing it's definitely
not a bad thing I know of course you
know um it's just isn't it a little bit
unusual don't you get jealous sometimes
but then you talk about it or you move
on it's just all about figuring out what
you can and can't handle
like ooh right now could you handle a
back rub to help you relax I think so oh
wow uh you're really good at that what
else could you handle stuff can you
handle this
yeah can you handle this yeah
handle me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
