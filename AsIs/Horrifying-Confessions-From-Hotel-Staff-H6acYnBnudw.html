you having sex I'm a maid at a hotel yes

front desk at a hotel when guests are
rude to me I accidently charge their
credit card three or four times for
their stay I work at a hotel and I steal
whatever I can for my health I work at a
hotel front desk when guests give me
postcards to send and money for stamps I
keep the money
read the postcards then throw them out I
will rot in hell I used to be a
housekeeper at a top-rated international
hotel every night I would get myself off
sometimes even in the room I steal
spoons from my hotel job because I hate
it so much I currently own 169 different
spoons I work at a hotel and if you are
rude to me I'd be activate your key card
just to inconvenience you
I work at a hotel and I cropped us the
front desk daily then blame it on the
guests works every time
I'm a hotel maid I've sometimes pissed
and the glasses by the sink dry them and
leave them there I work at a hotel we
don't change the blankets only the
sheets and pillowcases I work at the
front desk of a hotel I'm drinking on
the job so I walked in on a bunch of
people doing meth and coke in my hotel

fire extinguisher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
