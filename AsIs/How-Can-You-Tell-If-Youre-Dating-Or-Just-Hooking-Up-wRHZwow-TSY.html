century dating is very hard and I'm not
good at it I think there's a lot of
nebula sness in those first months that
you're seeing each other I confuse the
hell out of some people and I've been
confused myself you know you kind of you
hang out and you'll sleep together a
little bit there's like hang out yeah we
just like go get some food and hang outs
like we do something after that food and
then like suddenly you're planning a
lunch thing so many people are just
scared of commitment it's a very forward
about making him call it a date because
I don't have the energy to be like oh
what's happening especially as a woman
to other women because women will just
like oh my god yeah let's go to dinner I
love it and you're like no this is a
date if I do like them and I want it to
be romantic then I will let them pay it
turns out guys will pay for girls
dinners even if they don't want them to
be their girlfriend there are ways to
tell if this person is actually into you
or if this person just like seeing you
naked you know when you're dating when
you miss the person and that person
misses you when you're planning brunches
sharing an HBO GO account when you can
sing Taylor Swift in front of them
other things like farting I feel like I
can't fart in front of my girlfriend
because I want to keep her around you
guys speak more than you have sex if you
say I love you at the moment of sexual
climax when you and that person sleep in
the same bed and sex doesn't happen
rather than like there's an opportunity
to have sex I have to take this
opportunity being comfortable and
silence is okay and I'm like okay I'm
dating this guy if you're doing stuff
here in the daylight where you get to
drive somewhere for more than an hour oh
my god put a ring on it already if you
have that question in your head like am
i dating this person it is time to have
that conversation the worst thing that
can happen is you get a no and then you
move on to the next hottie if you want
to date someone I don't think you should
settle for hanging out with them hoping
one day they'll fall in love with you
cuz you're awesome why are we wasting
our time with these dumb mind games
we're all figuring it out so everyone
take a deep breath and relax
peace and love guys love's out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
