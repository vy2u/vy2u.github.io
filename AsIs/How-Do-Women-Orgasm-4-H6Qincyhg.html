the female orgasm is something that
powerful and strong and all over your
body you know orgasm is like wonderfully
mysterious and when I do make a girl
orgasm I feel like I did my job
the female orgasm can be a mysterious
thing even if you've had orgasms and
know a lot about your own body you
probably still have questions well my
name is Hillary and I'm here to ask
those questions
we're here with Vanessa a sex therapist
who is video chatting with us from San
Francisco let's start at the beginning
what is a female orgasm female orgasm is
basically just experiencing the apex of
sexual pleasure so there's some sort of
threshold that gets crossed where sexual
interactions become you know not just
feeling good but all of a sudden it
feels like an explosion I'm here a sex
nerd Sondra and she is going to help us
figure out everything we need to know
about female orgasm everything there are
a few types of female orgasm that we
yeah can you tell me about them okay
well there's the classic clitoral orgasm
we think of as the external vulva area
orgasm oh my god there's the internal
vaginal orgasm some people think of it
as a g-spot orgasm but even internally
you can separate them into different
types of orgasm look the science is
confusing it's not really clear but it
doesn't really matter about having you
know a g-spot orgasm versus a clitoral
orgasm but you want to pay attention to
is what actually feels good in your body
I want to make it clear that no orgasm
is better or worse than any other orgasm
and it's wrong to assume that the proper
orgasm is when you're having intercourse
intercourse is not necessarily how most
female body people have orgasms only 30%
of women can orgasm from penetration
alone for the other approximately 70% of
women it's just physiologically
not possible here's a big one that I've
been getting a lot of questions about
when a man comes it's very clear it's
very obvious we know
what ejaculation looks like from a man
yes what does it mean for a woman to
come what does it mean well if you look
at porn it's a lot of yelling I don't
think you have to ejaculate anything in
order to come so for you are coming and
orgasm and sort of it's yeah same thing
right I think it can mean different
things for different women some you
women use it in the context of just that
their orgasming some women actually do
squirt when they orgasm so there is a
propulsion of fluid just like there is
with men and we have a lot of questions
about that yes people tend to have a lot
of questions before eating so literally
every single person I spoke to about
this video was like let's figure out
what's going on with squirting all right
what is it squirting is the propulsion
of fluid outside of a woman's body while
she's orgasming usually it happens at
the same time as she's orgasming but
some women can do it separate from the
actual orgasm okay so there was a lot of
science recently talking about how when
you have a lot of gushing the female
ejaculation it's actually coming from
the bladder and it's urine I don't care
generally what does lead to squirting is
stimulation of the g-spot so the g-spot
is located inside the vagina
toward the belly button two or three
inches although for some people they can
feel it near the opening and sometimes
even toward the very back of the vagina
it feels pretty dense and spongy
definitely harder to the touch than
other areas of your vaginal canal you
spend some time there there's a chance
you could squirt is what you're saying
you could so the g-spot usually responds
to pretty intense stimulation so even if
you're really sensitive in other areas
of your genitals you really want to push
down on your g-spot you won't do the
come-hither motion and pull forward see
if it feels good it feels good follow
that pleasure keep on doing that
rhythmically pull forward pull forward
really massage that spot you might feel
initially the sensation that you have to
urinate a lot of women report that so
they'll get scared and they'll stop
doing expect think they're gonna pee all
over themselves and maybe they are maybe
they are we're quite sure it's okay if
you are um so you want to just keep
going from there you're not gonna just
uncontrollably start urinating
everywhere it is a normal sensation that
goes along with the g-spot a lot of of
people with vaginas have trouble orgasm
because they back away from the
crescendo like the it's going forward
and they're like no I got to I got to
rein it in cuz they think either I mean
when I was younger I thought I would pee
clickers like it was July guys like
what's gonna happen I think just you
gotta just like go full force go for it
go for the up go go towards the people
there's really no right or wrong it's
mainly keep that stimulation move
through it if you get really sensitive
chill out for a second and then go right
back into it as in most things that you
and I have spoken about there aren't a
ton of rules the absolute best way to
learn how to orgasm is to start a
regular masturbation practice what's a
regular masturbation process like how
so frequently we talk usually when I'm
coaching women I suggest that they try
to make time for it at least twice a
week if you have the time and the
interest in doing it more that's great I
would say that you don't have to
masturbate but doing so can really help
you get to know your body which can also
help you communicate to someone else how
to touch you cuz if you don't know your
body you can't help anyone else get to
know your body no and you are a
snowflake most women are pretty
surprised to learn that on average of
woman's orgasm takes 20 minutes to get
there of course that's an average so
there are women who take much shorter
amounts of time and much longer amounts
of time but that's pretty standard and
to give you comparison the average man
will orgasm in under 3 minutes so
there's a pretty big discrepancy there
the first orgasm I ever had it took 3
hours
all of our bodies are different we're
capable of different things really all
that it comes down to is just finding
the type of stimulation that works for
you so instead of feeling guilty or
deficient or like there's something
wrong with you direct all that attention
to figuring out what you actually like
what does feel good in your body really
expand how you can experience pleasure
in your own body and you'll be the boss
of all orgasms well I hope that after
today everybody can be the boss of their
own orgasms and like is there some sort
of Richter scale of orgasms is there
like a rating system for intensity of
orgasms that we don't know about I have
never heard of that I want that to be a
thing now
like everything you just changed the
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
