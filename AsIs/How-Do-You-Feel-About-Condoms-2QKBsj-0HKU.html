doesn't feel good for me and they assume
that like the woman doesn't feel a
difference either I know it's different
I also know that having a baby would
really really suck right now yeah I buy
condoms do you buy condom I buy condom I
don't want to say it's his
responsibility alone maybe it's better
to just be like if you're the person
that knows about what works best on your
body you should buy the condom I would
say it's more on the guy I think safe
sex is both people's responsibility but
what do you ever say it's a guy's
responsibility to buy birth control
are they cool yeah yeah I think condoms
are cool yeah yeah super cool they
aren't necessarily cool but you kind of
have to have them in your life and
that's just the way it is they've got
like there's like expansion packs for
condoms you can get like flavors
y'all get like cool colors necessary
evil
I like anything that comes in like neon
so oh no condoms is the word yeah you
might dance with the devil a bit you
might take a little take a little risk
that's stupid you know stupid and I
regret it and it's always something that
you regret it you don't have the Korean
baby ah you know I'm out of eggs let's
just bake it without eggs like you can't
you can't make the cake without eggs
like it's cool if you're out of them
let's go get some if you're about to
slam dunk a basketball into it oh my god
no freeze frame and say timeout let's
take a timeout it's like a five minute
privately freeze frame that's like teen
yards are so popular whoever's doing it
there should be no stigma attached to
not wanting STDs or babies it's true
can I get a preach preach the way I see
it is like this let's say you and a
friend are going skydiving you bring
your parachute but you have an extra one
just in case the other friend forgets
there's other friend forgets parachute
