do that's how I do it
recently there's been a lot of questions
online about how you're supposed to
actually put on your brush I don't know
there was a debate
I thought everyone just clasped it in
the front upside down and spun it around
like idea so I decided to walk around
the office and ask people how they put
on their bra Freddie yes hi how would
you say you normally put on your bra
just like everybody else
normally upside-down way and then pull
up the straps would you mind showing us
sure this upside down much easier to
class but it's in the front and you can
see it turn it back around move arms
through and up and over like overalls
cuffs are in the front and then I clasp
it back
you gotta fold this back so you know
you're hitting the right hooks this
click clip here we go see to be honest I
put my Brawn differently depending on if
there's company in my bed or not this is
how I felt like I saw a girl stupid in
movies they're talking and they'll be
like they're like listening and they're
smiling and they're like uh-huh yeah and
they're kind of like that but this
secretly takes forever do you
want to try the other way where you
what's what is the other way I'm so bad
at clasp ringer from the back okay I'll
try put Mars inverse yeah okay and then
you reach around yourself and do it in
the back she's got one I have one out of
three it's just like why why would I do
this in the morning this is like science
how do people do this I mean especially
when you get a new bra maybe I can
understand if it's like a you know a bra
that you've been wearing for a while you
guys have become besties you kind of
know where the hooks
i i salute people who are able to put on
their bra without looking that's
impressive
put the cups in the back here yeah it's
already feels silly I see why you do it
cuz I can see everything yeah then you
flip it around my whole life is for the
live till then like that was a whole
extra step I bet I like this way I think
I'm gonna stick with the way I do it I
mean you do you that's fine I don't
think I'll do this this feels weird to
me I don't know why it's like shaking
hands with the other hand and who taught
you to put your bra on probably my mom
my mom me my mama probably my mom oh
definitely my mom taught me I guess I
saw my mom doing it vh1
your mom doesn't do the same way that
you do I've never seen my mom put on a
bra or they're also pretty
self-explanatory
I mean we thought they were
self-explanatory but now everyone has a
different method women are mysteries so
I guess the question is mom's what's up
with bras you tell us cuz we don't know
there are two main ways thirty ways to
do it put it on like this match it to
worried boobs oh that this is good to
good bet because it scoops your boobs
when you do it right scoops scoops them
boobies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
