get to be honest about what's going on
inside of you because it it can destroy
you to just keep it all in I was just
always so worried about hurting the
people that I loved and disappointing my
parents I was shaking and I was I
couldn't say it right away the words
could not come out of my mouth he asked
me if I was dating anyone and I said
yeah and he said oh that's great what's
his name and I said Kate my parents came
out to visit and we were staying at the
hotel at Disneyland and it's you know
the happiest place on earth so I thought
what what better place to break the news
my mother innately burst into tears I
did well would it be better if I was out
drugs and she said well these drugs can
be fixed I actually came out from my
whole town I'm from a town of about
4,000 people a little mountain town in
Wyoming we're about to walk out right
and I like peek into the auditorium and
it is full and I strut it out like with
my date on arm and then they called our
names and we got a standing ovation
I do remember looking over at my date
and being like that one okay like that
was fine I'm a junior in high school I
came out when I was a sophomore in high
school but not only am i gay I was just
like in love probably and just like like
a little crush and just like it's so
weird how it translated into hate like
so easily so I decided to tell my mom I
wrote her a letter she didn't talk to me
for like three months
you had your chances what I told my mom
I said you had your chance to live your
life now this is my life and that is
what I told her and said if you don't
want to be a part of that then that's
your loss from there it was just months
and months and months of them slowly
getting used to it and I prayed for my
mom I prayed for that she would come
around you know that she would change
the way she thought and she did
eventually um it has now been eleven and
a half years that Jason and I have been
together my parents just helped us buy
our first house six months ago
are you happy are you happy she just
makes that's all she makes sure of and
I'm really really thankful for that if I
could tell my closet itself something
from my out self I would say to not wait
until someone else drives you to do it
that you should do it for you
don't let anyone force you into it you
have you have to do it when you're ready
there's nothing wrong with you when it's
ready to happen I feel like it'll happen
it's worth it in the end
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
