jeans jeans jeans shoes I feel like I've
run through so many different pairs of
jeans in my life I feel like I'm gonna
know yeah I feel like I'm just gonna be
like yeah these suck next I might be
good at this no yeah I've never no one's
ever asked me to is before usually you
put them on your body think I'll be good
at guessing I love The Price is Right
and I'm a big shopper have a shopping
problem I've owned both like shitty
jeans and nice jeans so what you like
I'm gonna do really well today
ooh I like these these are kind of nice
I got it I'm kind of into them I'm gonna
say that they are $70 $80 I don't know
$50 50 I'm gonna go with 43 Melissa 85
they're like $70 oh damn closer this
does not seem like a strong crotch this
should be $40 okay I know these are
cheaper exactly what these are I have a
pair of these because I am so cheap they
feel a little bit cheap and I feel like
jegging they're stretchy and a lot of
times expensive jeans will be like
dubiously stretchy I mean these are
cheap yeah I think he's our chief - I'm
gonna go with 43 135 $23 from forever
2015 EIN $30 $40 no I'm saying like
$19.99
Oh what the are you serious
oh let me see if denim how's the crotch
crotch cast sturdy sturdy crotch
it's like boxy hole cut that's kind of
tragic nothing draws attention to you
like a dark blue square on your thigh
say these are about $80 not a bean - all
I know is that I'm bad at this game
so $60 and watch would be ten seventy
five dollars $45 Oh bad okay all right
you got clothes
I think we did decently well I'm still
upset about Joe but other than that I
feel like I know my brands pretty well
but does that mean that they're worth
what they're what they are all of my
jeans ripped after about a year to a
year and a half of use no matter how
much I paid for them so I'm just
thinking like what what is the point
what do you pay for it should matter
more to you maybe where they come from
if they're coming from a place where the
workers are poorly treated or maybe it
amazing you know the country that you
live
and so maybe that's what you should be
thinking about more rather than how much
the cost oh why did I guess I know if
your girlfriend worthless I would say
nothing I would say she looks awesome in
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
