and still safely eat it I think I can
still use my makeup a couple months
after its expired today I'm finding out
if I'm using expired makeup I am I do no
makeup expires what makeups also so
expensive y'all for some reason I just
think makeup is just so magical but it
doesn't expire I'm still don't wanna
throw it away it's a piece of me I
believe over half my makeup products
that I use are expired I think a handful
of my products are expired
it's probably the reason why I've been
getting so much acne is that I never
change any of my makeup out is it filled
with bacteria and germs or just realize
how scary this could be num now I'm
freaked out carry on we're gonna do this
let's do it this is so gross that a nice
little hair on it this has got to be
like year-and-a-half old maybe a month
and a half ago I got this in November
hell yeah it's still good what nice the
pump got me it saved me something about
this whole deal with the trapped air
makes me think this has a less of a
lifespan than the Foundation's about six
months ago
I've had this erase paste by benefit for
two years
thank god damn it I should have gotten
rid of that like he's like mom skill
blush blush blush maybe about three
months ago maybe like a year year and a
half
wash for a year this is perfect yes I
replaced my mascara a lot because it
gets really clumpy this is maybe about
two months old I know this one I've had
for a year and a half
this one I've had for six months and
this one I just bought
you knew it open it three months so
that's it away I'm surprised my
eyelashes haven't fallen off oh it's a
little dirty I've had this for
definitely a year and a half maybe two
years probably got this a year ago I'm
not rolling this away
yeah it doesn't do its thing anymore
it's not pigmented it smells a little
bit
I probably got this two months ago I
think this has been in my bag for maybe
here and a half two years feel like you
use it before it's expired oh I've had
this a year to have to ha I probably got
this close to six months ago wanna say a
year says who depending on use that
might be way past iteration I think you
buy lifters every few months it makes
sense that you know if we're gonna be so
hyper vigilant about expiration dates
when it comes to our food we definitely
show you when it comes to our skin
products I bet my skin would be a lot
clearer had I paid attention to the
expiration dates I know that my makeup
is probably expired the know you should
really throw that away including
it's good to know that my actual makeup
makeup hasn't expired so I don't have to
like buy new but the rest of it at
least I don't have to like go out and
buy a whole new set of makeup if I see a
little number with this little jar
opening symbol that's the number of
months it can live after it's open this
is like a monitoring teach like darling
don't use past this date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
