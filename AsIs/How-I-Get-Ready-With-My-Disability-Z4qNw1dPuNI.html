they're not good and all your makeup is
just not good
hi my name is Marta Michelle and you
guys are gonna get ready with me it
might be a little different than what
you're used to because I have
arthrogryposis basically I have a lack
of muscle and a stiffness of joints so I
do have a rough time getting dressed or
putting on my makeup or brushing my hair
but I've just adapted and I figured out
how to do it for myself instead of a
primer I use a moisturizer so this is a
Clinique moisturizer you can see that
I'm lifting my arms differently than the
average person I lift my right arm with
my left I can't do it the other way
around so I unscrew that and again my
hands are a little stiff and the joints
so it's a little hard to unscrew some
things and I definitely have to pay
attention to that when I go and I buy my
makeup so I just apply this under my
eyes I mean a little line on my nose
you know the whole Kardashian thing I
love makeup this is Sephora and they
make a spray freaking pan of makeup I'm
gonna actually spray this onto my face
and I might get it in my hair so don't
judge me if I do it in doing my makeup
is honestly like a workout because I'm
using every muscle I have to lift my
arms and I see I use my head sometimes
and I just hold the brush still and it's
kind of like a dance the next thing that
I use as I do my own version of contour
which I call it non tour cuz it's not a
it's just a lot of bronzer this is
called master highlight by maybe it's
Maybelline and I do a lot because I'm in
a later blend this all in I do a lot so
the next thing I do is I take my bare
minerals matte powder and I just put
that all over my face the next thing I
do is I take the best thing again made
ever for disabled people this is blush
in a bottle from Sephora so I definitely
need a counter tops because you have to
shake this
I can't do this movement comfortably
without a counter under way all right
but if I don't have a counter here I do
lift my arm like this and then I should
get like this but it's a little more
tiresome and I don't really prefer doing
it boy I just spray it and it's gonna
make a dot and I just kind of rub that
into the apple of my cheek and there you
go a little little plumberry I don't
know if that means this is the same
thing I used before the Maybelline and I
just go into the crevices of the eyes
and I definitely just move the brush
like a rainbow and then this is what
people laugh at me for doing I call
under the eye when I get to the left eye
it's a little harder because I'm
reaching so I have to put both elbows on
the counter and I lean in and I kind of
go over the rainbow and I just kind of
move my head more so the left is
definitely harder than the right side
but I think I do a pretty darn good job
so next I'm gonna be doing my eyebrows
which is the hardest part next to
eyeliner especially for me so I use the
Anastasia or uh Nastasia which everybody
uses that's why I do my makeup in the
sink because no matter what I drop it's
just there I am gonna make every makeup
artist so mad right now because I put so
much of this on here and then I pray to
the eyebrow gods let me do a good job
and I take my hands and I rest it on my
left hand and then I have to tilt and it
looks like it's gonna be so much and
it's cuz it is I wish I knew how to do
this when I was in high school because
marna did not know how to do makeup in
high school she had big brows
caterpillar brows I'll tell you and I
kind of just draw on like fake hairs and
I blend so it looks like I have eyebrows
here I just got to do a quick shout-out
to my father right now who gave me be
weirded eyebrows they're shaped like
little caterpillar rainbows they just
like go across and does it really ever
match
no but do I act like it does yes I'm
gonna name you Susan feel good season
okay and there you go Marta's got brows
no they're more like cousins rather than
twins but I mean Susan and Jeff look
real good
this is eyeliner and it's yellow I
bought it because I was doing a photo
shoot and the woman told me be colorful
I wear a lot of black and I'm like okay
I'll be colorful with my yellow I'll in
it
well Who am I marna and I love yellow
eyeliner now it's my best friend and I
just kind of swiftly apply it look at
that oh man I just I feel so cute
Pierce flex I got this in my Ipsy bag I
love eyeliner pen this one's really hard
for me to open - not gonna lie you know
what we're gonna get real handicapped
with this guys I'm gonna be vulnerable
for you you want to know how I gonna
open this ah okay we're into both hands
okay Nick cause buddy hands and then I
did it we got this open and then I just
swooped it's a little bigger than I
wanted it be so now I just got to commit
to this size and get a little thicker
and you just gotta be brave I take the
Great Lash mascara and I definitely
pride myself on being one of those
people who just doesn't have to go I'm
definitely excited that I know how to do
makeup now and it's not perfect it's
never gonna be perfect but if I look in
the mirror and I feel like I look
gorgeous
I'm fine with it I take my favorite in
the world lipstick the logo is gone
Frick Frick and frack so it's called
friggin flax I like to do the inside of
my lip first and then I go to the corner
and I sweep down so I'm just gonna blend
one more time
after I apply all the eyeliner and the
lipstick and stuff
I think it looks pretty good and then I
apply my favorite highlighter this is a
tight urban decay yeah naked like my
motto with everything else I don't care
what people say
I'm gonna wear a ton of it I pat it on
oh look at that glow doe and then do
this side next I'm gonna do my hair so I
brush it all forwards I can't lift my
arms up
obviously it's so curling my hair I do
it very different I use this little guy
it's so old it's a Conair instant and it
still got to clamp it it's kind of grab
piece of hair with the clamp and Oaks
and I turn it and I kind of just hope
for the best
really honestly and I don't have to do
this a couple of times I just grab big
pieces and it's never gonna be a perfect
curl I kind of brush it here first and
then I get on the top of my head and I
brush it all through because the back is
definitely someplace I can't curl it and
I try to find like that keep curled so
and I use you as usual I feel so pretty
I feel like this is my luck people say
we've got some Marilyn Monroe hair how
do you do it I'm like I have no idea how
I do it I just shows you guys that is me
and my morning routine of makeup and
hair and I hope you guys like what I did
I love it
next I'm going to show you guys my
wardrobe and how I put on some pieces of
clothing okay guys so we're in my closet
I wear a lot of dresses loose-fitting
stuff I like
high-waist jeans or leggings that's my
jam a nice crop top oh my god I love
crop tops and flannel I really like
labels
I am only four foot being in a
wheelchair it's a little different to
wear clothes that are on trend and
sometimes I have to like really modify
the clothing myself so there's a safety
pin up here and it's in the neckline of
this shirt so I do it for a lot of the
callers so my mom suggested I cut a slit
up the back and what that does is it
loosens the whole tummy area but it's
still relatively tight up on the bosoms
so you're still feeling
but also feeling super comfy and then
you have this cute little like peekaboo
in the back pregnancy jeans are nothing
to be ashamed of why do you only have to
wear them when you're pregnant
jeans dig into the sides of you and with
this little extra piece that stretches
for the pregnant belly it makes it a lot
easier and a lot more comfortable my
feet are very small so high heels and
wedges don't come in my size so ii feel
like more adult and chic i'll put on
like a nice cute ankle boot and I can
get those like anywhere like they make
really cute kids ankle boots no days so
I have three of my favorites right here
I have this really cute Soto sue it's
open on the sides it's got the cute
buckle the two teal which again I feel
super adults normally when I put my
jacket I'll and I make sure not to have
lipstick on but that's okay so what I do
is I bend down and I bite the collar of
the jacket alright so I know I'm going I
find a hole oh my gosh there's one hand
I kinda just throw it and I get it
hooked on the back of my chair and then
I grab that and then I kind of just
wiggle into it and I make funny
movements and I do this in public so I
know that you saw a lot of things done
differently today and I hope that it
will make you want to try out putting
your makeup on different or brushing
your hair different or putting on a
jacket differently because maybe you'll
find the way it works for you because I
found a way it works for me
so you might have noticed bold leaves
now as is but don't worry you'll still
get all the same awesome content you
used to plus even more new great stuff
