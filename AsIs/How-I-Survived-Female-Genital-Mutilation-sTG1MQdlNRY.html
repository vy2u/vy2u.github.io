and my mom watching me and that was when
I really realized that I was going to be
mutilated
name is Orion Marais I'm originally from
Somalia
growing up in Somalia no one ever talked
about it
I heard rumors that you know my
classmates were calling me the girl with
three legs they wouldn't play with me
they said I was not I was untouchable
somehow I asked questions to my mom why
are they calling me the girl with three
legs she said well it's time to get your
gift and I didn't understand what kind
of a gift so I thought it was a dress
early in the morning we stopped in this
house it was a long and dark hallway I
never forget that I can't explain but
you just feel it something is not right
I asked my mom were you taking me and
she said it's your time to become a
woman
I just ran away and the last thing I
remember was just a hand grabbing my
neck and pulling me back I woke up tied
to our surgical table
I remember those rough fingers pulling
things a place that no one ever touched
me before especially a man
I was brought back home and it was a
festivity of my family and my classmates
and my relatives were all there to
welcome me and say all we proud of you
today you became a woman and you have to
remember they have to tie your legs
together for 14 days within four hours
you have to use the bathroom somehow I
refused because I felt like this is my
only control I have my body
most women survivors who had this never
questioned why are we doing this I
remember my own pain when this happened
to me why are we continuing this the
Cleary's is seen as like planet penis
and clean and proper somehow it's
uncontrollable for women's urges so
they'll be running after men if I don't
take my child to perform this and have
this done I'm not being a good mother to
prepare my child I try to heal myself
but how can you heal here so I said the
better thing I could do is just to speak
up I came here made a documentary about
this issue to help refugees who are
coming here show the world how horrible
this act is and that the world should
come and hold our hands to help us end
it
I could change what happened to me for
someone else
that's what survivor means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
