nervous I would keep foundation for like
two years but I'm pretty sure maybe it
doesn't last more than a year I'm gonna
say six months since it comes in like
large quantities it probably lasts for a
long time two years a year my faces this
is why I have pimples eyeliner okay I'm
gonna assume it doesn't last as long
because it's close to your eyes I would
say six months three months
I wouldn't go over a year with okay I
feel like mayonnaise lasts like a year
why can't I liner last at least to never
share islander girls I shadow I've had
my eye shadow I bought this when I was a
junior in college I would say two years
like five years six months a year to two
years
yes I totally guessed that one to two
years why am I so far off on all of
these I would say lipstick is probably
the least sanitary lipstick has to
expire quickly that's dirty it's all up
in your mouth three years three to six
months six months I think lipstick
expires after six months he was like
shoving the same thing on your lips for
two years
well YUM facial powder I think it's
similar to a shadow in a sense one to
two years as well powder I would say I
would have for like ten years I'm gonna
say a year two to three years I'm sorry
no one can afford it to buy a new powder
every one to two years that lasts
forever
ballin on a budget the same mascara
mascara mascara that's got a lot of
bacteria growing up in it it was it
looks gross this cannot last long I feel
like there's a lot of bacteria in that
little brush put it in out I don't know
six months I would say you should change
it like after like three to six months
it's got to be a year tops
too
wait you can't afford that like it's
very easy to get a sigh or like a
infection in your eyes I feel like you
want to keep it fresh cuz your eyes at
the wind just your soul my eyelashes are
gonna fall out I'm nervous all natural
makeup I would think all that will make
it would actually not last long Whole
Foods is dumping out their organic foods
right and left four months six months
like three to four months
okay I'm right in the middle perfume or
cologne okay this has got to be forever
almost because I feel like they still
find the perfume from like the Titanic
percent is forever this is perfume and
this straight up looks like it came from
a Antoinette oh I'd say 30 years a year
is your never expires 50 years what
that's amazing
oh my gosh I really feel like it's like
cool the way your grandfather's Cologne
if you didn't run it by other your
perfume for ages and years you probably
smell like so I should definitely
get rid of my eyeshadow um I don't know
if you guys can see how much is in here
though like there's no way I'm getting
rid of this I know there's like some old
things in here oh yeah my glossy a lip
tint or whatever lipstick it looks older
than me okay I need to throw away tubes
and tubes and tubes of chapstick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
