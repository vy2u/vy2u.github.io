to lay down some ground rules all right
rule number one let's have some fun
little number two there are no rules
except rule number one ah
Bru my favorite you know I took
Italian for one year in high school I
can help you out if you need some
translation waiter I'm gonna have the
New York Strip on the rare side a medium
rare but I don't want any the size they
come with it so can I have the size that
come with the roast lamb and a side of
berries and the lady will have the stuff
show
she didn't write any of that down that
she's gonna screw it up got us a little
Jamie tonight's gonna be lit
yes that is a fine Pinot Grigio you're
gonna love it
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are
heavy he's nervous but on the surface he
looks calm and ready there's vomit on
his sweater already mom's spaghetti he's
dropping bombs but you keep on
forgetting what he wrote down the words
they over now God my mom is such a bitch
yes finally her food is coming thank you
very much miss oh hey I'm sorry would
you mind taking a photo of me not into
cats and dogs do just not appeal to me
one iota if I wanted to me to hump my
leg I get a roommate two things all of
my exes have in common they're all crazy
and I'm still in touch with all of them
that's funny how do you like your meal
my friend taught me this if you fold a
$20 bill just so you can see the towers
burning my feminist side wants to vote
for Hillary but my rational side knows
she's too emotional all I was saying is
that if I had the same team of writers
that Beyonce has I would be twice as
good as her
yeah thank you miss
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
