I can struggling with acne for ten years
of my life growing up with an acne
problem was extremely hard on me I was
bullied I was insecure and I felt alone
when society views something that you
have that is out of your control as a
flaw you can feel really helpless
I wasn't secure myself because I felt
inadequate I felt like I wasn't good
enough and I felt like I could not hide
what was on my face I wanted to be the
confident girl and for me I found
confidence when I found cosmetics and I
realized that I didn't have to walk
around and feel like people were staring
at me I didn't have to suffer in silence
I didn't have to suffer at all
I discovered that by spending a few
minutes before leaving the house putting
on a little bit of makeup I could alter
the entire course of my day and how I
would feel about myself all day which
led into every other facet of my life to
me makeup is important because it
empowers people in this life we should
do anything that makes us feel happy
confident and beautiful and that is
exactly how wearing makeup makes me feel
so how can that be a bad thing it
enables us to enhance and highlight the
aspects of ourselves that we are proud
of it also enables us to mask and
disguise the parts of ourselves that
were not so comfortable with I wear
makeup because it makes me feel good it
enables me to not spend my entire day
worrying about my acne and worrying a
lot of people I love
I don't think that makeup is there so
that women can trick other people into
thinking that they're an entirely
different person it is there to enhance
our natural features and to make us feel
good about ourselves that is what this
life is all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
