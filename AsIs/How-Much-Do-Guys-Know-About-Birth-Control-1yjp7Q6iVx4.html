is about it I'm gonna guess that not
that many guys know that much about
birth control at least hormonal birth
control just because it's usually women
who have to deal with this so we're
gonna hit the streets of Hollywood today
to see what guys actually know about
birth control thank you for talking to
us about birth control today oh no
problem I'm gonna ask you a personal
question
how much do you think you know about
birth control ah
I'm more than most but less than some
more than I'd like to
cuz I've had too many close calls you
know absolutely nothing all right here's
the first question if you are trying to
get a daily hormonal birth control pill
what do you need don't you need to be
like 18 pill prescription yes yeah you
need a prescription yeah that is that's
what you're getting it from like online
like a creepy Chinese website or
something like that you may be able to
find it on the black market without a
prescription that's true if you were
employing the rhythm method of birth
control what does that mean maintain a
certain stroke speed a velocity you do
what's called a Cusco IV to your pills
or some cycle nothing to that phone
it basically means pulling out not to be
crass I think it's about timing it with
the menstrual cycle and everything like
that and making sure that when the
female is ovulating that you're not
procreating ding ding ding yes thank you
I'd like to thank my fifth grade a PE
and health teacher ready for the next
one
what does IUD stand for you got me again
no idea no guesses not one don't know do
you know what an IUD is no internal
uterus damage I don't know what it
stands for but I think it's implantation
yeah it's inserted I would yeah enter
uterine device so it's the thing that
goes up into your cervix and prevents
you from getting pregnant that is almost
exactly correct it's intrauterine device
it's not like the ring that's actually a
different thing but the ring is a thing
close enough
all right ready for the next question Oh
two common types of IUDs are the marina
and the Paragard the Marine is made of
plastic
what is the Paragard maker hopefully not
metal or yes metal good intentions I
don't know copper it's copper would you
shove something copper inside of you no
the implant a small mastic sized rod
which releases hormones is placed inside
what body part to prevent pregnancy I'll
go for uterus for 500 filling is a
loaded question that it is not the
vagina it's not the vagina you're right
then I don't know I feel like I've seen
my friends have it up here it is
actually in your arm you're right okay
one last question no right or wrong
answer would you take hormonal male
birth control if it was available yeah
why not as long as there's no crazy side
effects yeah because female birth
control really kind of messes with your
system and I have all a sympathy for
girls that don't want to take it for
those reasons sure yeah absolutely
I think I don't to be fair you know
spread the love spread the hormonal
imbalances do you feel like you learned
anything today absolutely yeah
I thought you're gonna school me and you
kind of did so the results were kind of
mixed some guys knew way more than I
thought they would and I was totally
impressed ask me about sponges let's go
I'll talk about sponges I watched
Seinfeld and some guys were mystified by
it the entire thing I mean your area is
probably different from her period
I got you check it one guy was so
nervous he literally ran away in the
middle of being interviewed do you guys
don't use anything at all
oh well she's on the pill she's on the
pill so you guys do use birth control
yes you don't use birth control you
don't want to do it why not too much but
it seems like most guys would be open to
the idea of taking a male hormonal birth
control which is pretty cool cause I
feel like it's time for us to share that
wait you know it takes two to tango so
might as well both put on our tango
shoes you know you're both inches he
needs to change shoes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
