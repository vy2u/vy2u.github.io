I'd run it over is that okay
how much do you period how much do i
period let's find out if these kisses
were the days of my period I would be
three it's typically three days I'm on
my period this many days don't want to
be around me on the first day I'm very
needy I want a massage I get on
Pinterest and I just look at
inspirational quotes at my desk and I
cry my least favorite day is like
low-key six and seven like it's not even
like fun and I'm like oh I'm on my
period I've cramps like why the is
that still happening can we just take a
moment of silence for all the beautiful
underwear loss during your period this
is gonna make me look real gross but the
truth hurts and they're all coming down
so there's not even enough panties here
to signify how many I go through a year
I feel like it's at least one every time
I don't throw away the panties sometimes
that are just like the period panties
your and I mean like I just I Know Who I
am
realistically I probably period like
that much a month but it feels like I
period a condition yeah I think I
believe about this much every month more
maybe maybe this whole thing period
that's so silly
it's just like chaos there's like pain
over here
so obviously the ovaries or the eyes
pain over here because guess what they
cry little Aggies it literally feels
like there's people walking around with
cleats on oh good
but how much does an average box of
tampons class and then I'll probably
somewhere in there like grown a pair of
pants I go through like one of those
little cartons of might off about a
month plus moisturizer plus panties plus
migraine medicine it's forty one dollars
a mom comes to $60 oh my god
well it's $500 a year I spend seven
hundred and twenty dollars on my period
every year I was twelve when I started
my period I'm 25 now so 500 dollars a
year times what thirteen years one
thousand four hundred and forty dollars
on my uterus are you kidding four
thousand six hundred and seventy five
dollars all right
luckily my mom was paying for Moses's
for most of my childhood life so what
could i buy with forty six hundred
dollars I would do anything that could
have gone on like a little vacay I could
have gotten a new camera lens could
probably got a cat how am I gonna have a
kid I don't know how I'm gonna fornicate
I'm a period I guess it's literally the
cost of being a woman
sorry to interrupt but I just got my
frickin period freaking shoot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
