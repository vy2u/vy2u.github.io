like yeah not this on mom won't say yes
takes a long time to find clothes that
will be acceptable for my parents so I'm
looking for something more flowy at the
bottom rather than a body fit dress for
the neck part I would like to be high
enough so feeling squeezed would be more
appropriate for me every store I went to
everything was like yeah I can't wear
this one physics when a strapless I
can't wear that one because that one has
like a gigantic slate I can't wear that
one view that one neckline goes all the
way down I can try that one because
there's like mesh that and like it was
very hard to find on the rack and like
the view of it and then when you take it
out yeah
a lot of Muslims girls how to modify the
dresses that they buy just to make it
more appropriate like
like that people try ordered the other
one the good colors that work with like
our skin tone are like maybe maybe blue
Varun and like emerald cryy and
everything else is like it could be a
hit or miss but those colors like always
a good a lot of the time like if they
have like a little cap sleeve it'll look
too much like a kid's dress you'll seem
like they just like it took like a dress
that little kids would wear would shirt
sleeves and they like added I get to it
and I like as you got more modest it
seemed like something that little kid
would weird or something like an old oh
yeah I would wear so it's hard to find
like guys buzzing for like teeth
then I wanted to find the red one that
was nice and this is like I didn't see
this on the floor not stomach enthuses
but I'm doing it I'm digging this room
so this is the dress I chopped like the
first dress I ever tried on and I'm
gonna get this one too I'm it's a sign
fun
yeah I'm really liking this dress it's
very unique I never thought I would be
wearing a floral skirt it's not an
actual Jessica skirt and we made it work
we have under I don't we were worried at
first that it'd be too revealing but
this doctor looks so good yeah I think
we did a good job fixing it hello the
fire as long as you know who you are and
you know your beliefs you'll do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
