light I have no concept of the color I
just want to state I have no sight so
beauty for me now means real simple
things I mean just the simple things
just opening my eyes in the morning and
listening to the birds outside my window
chirping it's a it's a feeling that I'm
alive to me beauty is character
personality the way people carry their
self basically it's just the way the
person is you know and some people could
be very pretty and beautiful inside just
by the way they carry themselves or help
are concerned about my situation that I
think beauty is experience so an
experience I mean by that as you know
the smell of warm baked cookies the the
warm breeze against your skin the feel
of grass underneath your feet when
you're walking in the in the front yard
going to the beach and sitting by the
shore to me its beauty and just
imagining what the ocean looked like
right now and what the sky looked like
that's beauty for me at times it could
be overwhelming because when you blind
your life is consist of nothing but
feelings every day it's a feeling I feel
that losing my sight has been a blessing
which means I don't care what
nationality somebody is I don't care how
tall somebody is I don't care how how
big or small they are a person is
beautiful because they are true to
themselves I have three babies 12 and 9
and my daughter just turned 3 and to me
they're all beautiful and I don't even
know what they look like they're
beautiful in sight they're they're me
you know they're
for me beauty for me is calm beauty for
me is peace I don't really need my eyes
to enjoy beauty that that's beauty for
me but it's also people being and doing
what is what is right and what is good
and caring about each other
beauty is an experience of living and
you know finding finding joy I feel like
joy is the most beautiful thing in the
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
