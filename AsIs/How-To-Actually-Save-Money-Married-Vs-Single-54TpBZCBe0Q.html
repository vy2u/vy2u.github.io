actually don't know where I am
I don't know if I'm doing well or not
because Ned I don't have a budget that's
all hi I'm Ned and I'm married I'm
Kelsey and I'm very single you've
submitted relationship questions we are
not qualified to answer them when you're
married you share your bank account that
bounced out most people do you have to
be really communicative about who's
spending money on what like what is an
appropriate amount to spend on something
is day night get yourself a desert and
you budget for date night 500 $600 a
month no I just think I spent 300 - the
other night what was so what is the
benefit of having two incomes when
you're married without children you're
what's called a dink it stands for
double income no children
you get tax benefits because if someone
makes a little more and someone makes a
little less you get to meet that in the
middle and ultimately have a lower tax
bracket literally I lend more in this
two minutes and I ever learned in all
the years I went to school feel like you
could give me some great advice sure
about what my bank account looks like
how this segment was my bank account
look like okay all right you wanted
these above my region especially wow you
spent $300 at dinner I don't think I've
ever spent $300 on both of us $800 hotel
rooms where did you go he's messing
hundred dollars in a bar you went to
Bubblegum's cake
I love Bubba Gump but like that's a lot
of money to spend at Bubba Gump and I
spent $200 on my therapist and what's
that that's a $300 Amazon wish list
order
I got a Roomba so you have enough money
to pay off your credit card bill
so clearly you're doing some element of
budgeting I don't know how to go like
I should stop now I have no off button
okay we're gonna make a budget right now
what I don't know though one thing that
my mom always said is pay yourself first
which means before you put in any other
expenses put how much you want to save
how much should I want to save well
there's two types of savings the
retirement savings and if you want to
save for like a trip right let's say
$200 okay
rent we already know what that is how
much do you think you want to spend at
restaurants mmm do I want to sing yeah
not more than 500 really but that that
doesn't seem realistic based on your
current spending pattern let's start
with seven I can't see how it is okay
yeah bills like you know these I usually
just say $100 okay kinda nice you have a
car payment nope I paid off my car Oh
what about shopping and makeup oh that's
the thing that people you did the makeup
video us let's call this your bid up in
lady taxes I would say shopping once
makeup yeah at least 200 a month so I
spend probably like $400 a month on
groceries my soul
where are you shopping the king's palace
we cooked in at home a lot so how much
do you spend on groceries 155 I'll put a
hundred that's crazy
we'll just put other things coming
you're alive yeah me and my wife drink
wine at home so our alcohol budget is
like 100 so then I should definitely say
like at least 350 for my cool 400 sounds
good that is the sum of all your
expenses and so you say to yourself okay
I need to make that much income to be
able to pay for all my expenses I can't
believe how much
learned through I got touchy through you
in five minutes I'm gonna keep living my
life on budget if you have negative
budget that means you have to readjust
your categories can you make sure you
save this under way Kelsey needs to
start living</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
