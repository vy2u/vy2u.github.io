Rise and shine! Rise and shine!
Get up! It's gonna be an awesome day!
- How do you have so much energy?
- Awesome Day. Awesome Day.
Awesome day. Awesome day.
Get up cuz we're going to have.
Good morning! Okay.
Don't worry. I have the
whole day planned out.
We're going to be late.
We're going to be late.
- No. We're going to be early.
- Oh wait, hold on.
- [Blonde Woman] What?
OK.
- Let me try like that.
OK.
- Is that to your liking?
- [Brunette] No.
OK. So we have 10 minutes to relax.
And then 15 minutes to eat and I think
it's probably going to
take us about five minutes
to get back to our desks.

- Oh my God what are we going to do?
- We're going to have to take it over.
- It has to be perfect.
We'll get this. Don't worry.
- [Blonde] I'm hungry face.
- I know. As soon as we take
a perfect picture you can eat.
(lively music)
Okay, now you're just too happy.
