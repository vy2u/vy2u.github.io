fork we're going to cut it with the
knife and then we bring the food into
our mouth fork tines down that way are
you with me I can't see what's going on
fifty people are impressive but how many
of us regular plebeian folk even know
the first thing about fancy dinners and
manners and I'm going to be hosting
my first ever adult dinner party so I
basically just need to know what the
 I'm doing should I stop cussing
yeah I was just gonna say I think that
we can get more crafty with our lingo
it's gonna sound lazy frankly oh can
someone learn how to be fancier is it
just something you're born into manners
are something we learn and you can
acquire them anywhere anyhow being that
you're the hostess you want to do
everything impeccably ladies always
enter and exit the chair from the right
side what if you are gender
non-conforming you know that's a soup
spoon yeah and we always work from the
outside going in toward our plate okay
we're not gonna you're gonna lick that
and do the whole thing okay the next
course we have is our salad course which
would be the smaller knife and fork I'm
not serving salad at my dinner party
nobody in the history of ever like salad
because you're lying if you say you do I
love you I am so know why let me just
say this is about the amount of alcohol
I drink and put that okay you might want
to think about nursing one drink you're
gonna drink one drink if I'm gonna be
the host it might be your duty with the
white you are holding it correctly
you're holding by the stem and here's
why what yeah can I guess yes cuz your
hand would warm up the white wine okay
I tell you it's working it's work
who's gonna learn anything yes so but
you're you know it's just again common
sense so if you put our hand here and
that's warm wine it'll be interesting
it's already warm so technically if you
wanted to you could hold it there but
champagne oh my gosh okay Kelsey party
I'm from Florida if that explain okay
totally let me just tell you explains
everything you can hold the red at the
bowl okay
even though these are more squarish like
at the bottom beautiful and you're
really cupping that oh I'm going to come
in here and we are going and getting
intimate here I like we're going to some
index fingers extended not beyond the
design don't go because you're don't go
beyond the design my nails are trash the
vineyard napkin for your fancy party and
you wipe your mouth in the secret
interior right-hand compartment there's
something called the Welcome toast do
you welcome to us or close to us well
you want to welcome your guests are you
supposed to and okay great question
you can if everybody's talking if you if
everyone silent obviously don't need to
do it but you want to find a clean
utensil and preferably a knife I got to
tell you this is like the first time at
anyone's ever taught me this etiquette
started a it's really easy and quick
it's not like overwhelming yeah it's
likely you could do this once and you'd
learn it for lifetime exactly so now
we're gonna teach me how to greet and
bye-bye my guests yes in a sense okay
you'll open the door you'll greet your
guests you'll welcome them inside will
turn on your accent house and as they
come through you may want to settle them
so do they have a coat is there anything
of that nature that you take my murder

in the coat exactly exactly so then
