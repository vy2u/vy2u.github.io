less cut me a check pay less cash me
outside how about there it's this really
interesting dynamic right up walking
into a store that says women men and
children and I'm not a child I'm not a
man I'm not a woman so where do I go I
felt like the women's section had a lot
of pieces I were over processed so many
ruffles for me it just wasn't working
out the first thing we actually went to
was beacons closet that one was really
cool I had great vibes a lot of the
clothes felt very cared to an edgier
look I found a couple pieces I really
liked how are you doing I'm trying to
find my size
Doreen did you find as much I'm gonna
keep on looking I'll be back I think
that it's a matter of being patient but
keep your eyes open for things that
attract you and go to them it's so
interesting I'm not sure what I could do
with it but I'll I'm gonna hold on to it
I found a vest that's gonna bring me
right back to Fresh Prince of bel-air
so I'm knowing that I can't get shoes
here because all the shoes are gonna be
too small for me I love these though but
they're all gonna be too small one of
the biggest issues that I face when I'm
looking for heels or any sort of
feminine shoe there's no real options
and the options that are there kind of
ugly however I actually really like
going to pay less which is a cheap
option they're very affordable prices
they go all the way up to 13 size 13
which is great for you know trans Femmes
or non-binary Femmes who are looking for
larger shoe sizes because there are
fewer people with my size feet the cute
shoes are often like ready and available
I've been waiting for my whole life to
have a pair of heeled sneakers so this
is a huge moment but it was actually
really nice to see Ian finding some
shoes at Payless
but you don't tell me in these hey hey
what you don't tell me in these you
ain't gonna tell me nothing I next went
to a department store I'm actually going
to start at the $40 in under I'll go to
the clearance sections a lot before I
look at full price items sometimes they
have items that are just about to go out
of season that I
save for the next seasons so I'm at
Nordstrom Rack right now and I'm finding
a lot more things here than the previous
turf store we were at they actually have
some of the sizes that would actually
fit me it was a little bit easier for me
to find some pieces for myself so I was
able to find a button-down tie actually
tie clip and some shoes for
under 150 dollars I am wearing Fresh
Prince of bel-air right now love the
patterns here love the colors in it not
gonna lie my girlfriend just might steal
this vest so alright so I got most of
this outfit from Nordstrom Rack I tied
the whole outfit together by adding on a
vest that I already had I'm feeling real
collegiate right now teacher s I really
enjoy wearing things that are colorful I
like it to be reflective of how I'm
feeling and I'm walking to the world
this is definitely something to wear in
winter but it's gonna be a fun kind of a
summer spring kind of dress and I really
feel the confident and beautiful in it
it's been quite a day
I love the additional perspective and it
was nice to see you kind of being your
element
I loved that you liked a lot of color
you liked a lot of things that were
different going back to the men's
section and sort of like seeing it
through a different lens and like being
able to appreciate it something I don't
often do it was really great to like
come together and just like get to
experience clothes ads clothes which is
what they should be typically it's all
about really what you feel is right for
you and what you like to wear and I
think kind of seeing that with you was
just an extraordinary experience not
gonna lie oh it was not gonna lie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
