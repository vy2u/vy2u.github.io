brag but some of us get them as much as
once month on Facebook it's a totally
normal experience but IRL what a weird
concept well that's not how historical
friends squads were assembled Jesus and
all his disciple Bros the three
musketeers the non Miranda members have
sex in the city all of them famous run
squads all formed with grace and
smoothness I certainly don't have either
of those things but let's be honest
neither does Miranda is it possible for
me to infiltrate a group of friends and
become part of the squad to better
acquaint myself with the inner workings
of squad life I talked to some of the
most successful squad members I know in
addition to a random squad I've known on
the street what friendship qualities are
essential to be in a squad part of being
a squad is supporting each other here we
all watch these other back and watch
these other toes and watch these other
fingernails that's the squad so who are
each of you in a spot I'm the weird
silly one probably Zack is the cute one
I'm the beautiful one and Eugene was the
gorgeous one when you embark yeah I'm
the cool guy
yummy I'm the short guy in the door guy
and I'm the watcher they call me slim
honor Who I am
well I think that having the different
qualities of squad members helps balance
everybody else out how many people can
be in a squad like how many is too many
there's only two minutes when y'all
dysfunctional I'd say no more than seven
seven what do you guys do when you hang
out like what does this quad exactly do
one of the activities brunch camping
yeah hi yaki do you have any advice for
someone just like say I don't know a
friend of mine who's trying to get into
a quad it can do gifts is always nice
all you gotta do is throw a football
just find another person throw a
football with them oh and you'll become
friends what squad do you want to be in
yeah they're an existing squad that you
wish you are part of I would love to be
in ladylike
it's wavy white lady light its lady leg
we're playing looks like it's a good
squad but they already have a pretty
fleshed out role system there hey you
know what keys he's not the least
bit ladylike
for me hi I'm capable I could be the
missing piece of the beautiful inspiring
ladylike jigsaw puzzle luckily I could
use this video as an excuse to extract
all the juicy Intel I needed what kind
of qualities as a friend you have to
have to be in a squad I feel like I'll
be friends with anyone who laughs at my
jokes yeah it was like they were giving
me the recipe to the secret sauce the
secret lady sauce but nope that's not
bad how many people is the appropriate
number to have in a squad how many is
too many seven and up seven oh seven
good half yeah okay
I'd say no more than seven oh okay fine
Keith was right unfuck Keith looks like
a activity squads do together what kind
of things
guacamole yeah that's a cool necklace I
just noticed thank you
clearly I had my work cut out for me but
snacks easy surely I could find some
guacamole at the low stock convenience
store half a block away do you guys sell
guacamole oh oh sorry little McNally I
freakin kidding me no that's not it
where is guacamole sold USSF Baca moly
right but the store didn't have any but
if you mix all the things we got
together it's basically guacamole we got
lime and chips salsa verde chips bean
dip nacho cheese dip green onion dip and
this captain with my shoddy snacks
locked and loaded it was time to focus
on me what can I personally offer
ladylike I must have some redeeming
qualities I mean I was part of a squad
doing my wild youth in Florida hi my
friend maybe a former squad member could
shed some light on the matter okay so
we're doing a video about squads and
there's a
group of girls here at BuzzFeed called
ladylike they go drag racing and they
get to try all the new beauty products
and it's something I've always wanted to
be a part of what are the ladybugs or
lady but what something waiting like
they're the coolest people here we had a
mini squad in high school yeah we were
called the rock stars who did it consist
up it was me and you Sydney mo low ski
and Nick do you remember the story
behind why his name was a skater no he
said it's because his his mom said that
he looked like a mosquito now as an
adult I don't know what's happened but I
really don't have a lot of close friends
anymore like especially female friends
it's weird how it's change I think that
also is just a part of growing up do you
think I have any qualities or do you
even remember any qualities about me
that would make me perfect for like a
squad out here you a pretty makeup savvy
yeah
and you were um you were definitely a
bit of like a tomboy like sports and
 so you definitely would be like
cool to go like go car racing or yeah
yeah you were you were also fairly
involved in sports too
yeah then I got really into pot you're
making a really good case for me well
you could be like the adventurous one
yeah I think that just describes me as
an adult so yeah I think you could I
think you could fit that thanks Darla
was right
I am squad worthy when I'm not
barricaded in my apartment like a
homeless Shannon I'm absolutely makeup
savvy and adventurous with a renewed
sense of confidence I figured it was
time to test the waters and work my
makeup savvy magic on the ladylike
set up a hidden camera at their desert
almost for another video for a time once
they've no idea that we were doing this
um I'm gonna go try and use my end
McCarley
it's a tactic to going and maybe like
start planting the seeds with them
pickle is my my joint
hello how are you my friend good how are
you oh yeah we're doing the thing this
week oh yeah yeah they're that
newsletter yeah oh my gosh I was I meant
to come back up and tell you guys
Freddie have you guys ever seen Rite
Aid's make up section yeah but one day
dude I just went over there and it's
like they have their own like goddamn
line oh yeah it was crazy I was like
it's nice makeup
we still need to eat together soon so I
have no clue how that went
clearly there was no more time for
half-measures if I truly wanted in on
the squad I'd have to go all out
kayaking is always nice so it's time to
take all the things I've learned
football the snacks my adventurous
can-do attitude and put all of it out
there for them luckily they happen to be
filming a ladylike video that week it
was my time to show them what life could
be like with a little slice of Kelsey
okay so I know what they like I know
they don't like I just I need to like
spruce myself up a little bit to match
them I mean like you think I I could be
in it right
see I'm gonna be in ladylike by the end
of the day
we're about to crash ladylike shoot see
if they'll let me the other squad
they're doing this makes Olympics in
there so got pigs on a football got my
snacks I don't see how they could say
now hey sorry
certainly hey guys hey what's oh good
catch
Thanks um I was thinking about like all
the stuff we talked about yesterday
about like the squads and so I just I
thought I could like be in this like I
just you know I feel like you need a
wild child in your squad and so I just
figured that maybe I have guacamole
stuff well it's not cuacamole exactly
but yeah yeah yeah maybe a little tight
but hey Freddie I I feel like I would
sit easily well and ladylike that is
very sweet yeah
the ladies accepted me with open arms
but in my heart of hearts I felt I
hadn't earned it setting up hidden
cameras is no way to make friends if I
wanted an authentic squad experience I'd
have to do it right
and so I did what I always do stood
around awkwardly with my pants off and
then ran away I'll text you guys
releaving yeah they literally couldn't
have been like nicer about it you know I
mean I'm gonna take these Spanx out now
so maybe worming your way into a squad
isn't the best way to go about it just
like a facebook friend request you can't
force someone to accept you it just has
to happen organically hey are you guys
just sitting around eating cheesy snacks
yeah yeah can I sit with you yeah I'm
tells me by the way
squads come and go and even if you're
between squads at the moment like me
embrace yourself learn to love your
independence after all it's better to be
squad less than being Miranda oh gosh
she was the worst Tom although I mean
she really did have her together
more than any other one I mean Carrie
was just jumping around she had no idea
who she was Sam was just you know yeah I
guess we can't say anything about Sam
and her sexuality because we need to
sexually liberated but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
