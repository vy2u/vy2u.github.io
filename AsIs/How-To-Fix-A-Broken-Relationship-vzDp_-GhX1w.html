hiking we were fun what do you think
changed it's like when you lose weight
you don't notice it happening and then
one day you look in the mirror and
you're a totally different person how
does that make you feel I hate that I'm
not who I used to be neither of us are I
come home to John and I'm frustrated
that I'm frustrated
I feel like anger is Who I am now
when I try and talk to John about it he
just shuts down John is in the room
please address him John
what are you feeling
are you mad that we're here may I ask
have you tried resetting resetting a
clean restart of course we've tried
resetting as the first thing we did can
we try it again here in this office
always looking to work it's more
complicated than that all I can do is
offer proven strategies just because one
doesn't work the first time doesn't mean
you should stop trying it
fine
you too
you
you
see you next week I think right from
here I love you Jenna can I be jumping
all right please come in hey are you
good thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
