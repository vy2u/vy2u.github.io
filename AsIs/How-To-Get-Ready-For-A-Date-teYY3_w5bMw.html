but pretend it's you you're getting
ready for a date this is your outfit
this is your hair we look perfectly fine
so of course you hate it here are some
helpful tips first make sure to take
your hair down and put it up again as
you're getting ready approximately 37
times step to try and jewelry you hate
and haven't worn in months
maybe you've changed maybe you like it
now you look great except you hate that
dress try spicing it up red sexy but
casual perfect step 3 completely lose
your that's good that's good just
let it out realize you're about to meet
somebody for a drink at a bar with the
hope that he'll be different from
everybody else realize that dating is a
complete and utter waste of time even if
you do find somebody you like you'll
date for a while and then the only two
options are breaking up or getting
married and you are completely terrified
of both but dying alone is too cliche so
what other option do you really have
just get up try changing your hair just
one last time your new outfit is better
you like it you look good you don't need
that necklace this is what you're
working with so just accept it and move
on step 5 time for makeup remember that
your trash person who never learned how
to put on makeup good but who still
feels like they need to use it look in
the mirror and decide that you're pretty
and you deserve love step 6
calm down relax have some tea consider
how many people have actually been
murdered by a stranger on the internet
maybe just text a few people to let them
know where we're going
yep that's still what you look like
realize that none of it really matters
so you might as well try to have fun
step 7
manage to successfully overcome the
crushing existential dread get up and go
be a person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
