months and the nuts old 60 miles east of
Los Angeles there's a city called Loma
Linda National Geographic described as
one of the healthiest in the world where
the average citizen lives six to seven
years longer than the national average
one thing that makes Loma Linda unique
is the disproportionately large number
of seventh-day Adventists who live there
this is how they describe the secrets of
their longevity in my particular
religion we emphasize health I try to
eat a vegetable diet pol I became a
vegetarian in 1960 I've lived on a
vegetarian diet all my life and it's a
small tile my parents did also and they
made a remark to me that runs like this
Carol your greatest earthly blessing is
your health take care of it we are
having our sixth annual Senior Olympics
triathlon
I'm Dorsey joy I was 87 years old in
January and since no one I have done
like to walk in our neighborhood we try
to get in
miles that's not a lot of pictures but
we try to do it consistently this is the
walking and exercising community well I
think happiness is a is a decision it's
not a circumstance so you have to just
decide to be happy there's a real
satisfaction in knowing that you've
helped somebody else in some way you can
kind of forget yourself and concentrate
on them when you make others happy you
are happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
