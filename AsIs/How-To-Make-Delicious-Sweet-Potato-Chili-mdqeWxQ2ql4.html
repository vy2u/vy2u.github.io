yeah
here we have all the ingredients for our
sweet potato chili if you guys want to
cut up the sweet potatoes you're just
gonna chop them like into squares so I'm
gonna hand her an onion the onion just
needs to be diced up the recipe also
calls for three cloves of garlic so you
just chop that up like as small as
possible now that all the veggies are
chopped basically the next thing to do
is grab the and here it is work
that's a good question you plug it in
and then there's like a knob on the
front that you can do low higher warm
the first thing we're gonna put in the
crock pot is the ground turkey oh I love
ground turkey and now we're gonna dump
the onions in the garlic in just like
this yeah just like it's just like a
magical hole that you like toast and now
we're gonna put in all the spices 2
tablespoons of chili powder so this is
the key cooking is all about spices for
me cooking is all about hot sauce
Frank's hot sauce is my favorite oh
that's my favorite too I love Franks
this is cumin 1 teaspoon of this 1/2 a
teaspoon of dried oregano
I like loosely follow the spice
instructions a lot of that stuff is just
to taste like I'm not even gonna measure
the salt I'm just gonna kind of do that
so now we're gonna like break up the
turkey and kind of mix it all together
and make sure the spices kind of get
evenly distributed looks like spam what
cain loves spam so when he says it looks
like spam he means it looks good so
forever note there it doesn't look like
spam at all potatoes yes and you put
cheese to make it like that's what the
tomato sauces yeah so we're gonna dump
in this whole thing of tomato sauce what
yes
ooh I love tomato sauce I love ketchup I
love marinara sauce I'm the same
but what's tomato paste it's just like
sticker tomato sauce but it's used a lot
in cooking and you eat this with rice no
but that's just because I don't eat rice
I just eat it just like chili yeah and
then we're just gonna kind of like I mix
this a little bit so now we just close
it up and we're gonna put this one on I
and then hopefully in the six hours it
will be done your sweet potato chili is
done all right let's open it it smells
really good okay hot steam in your face
it's like a crock-pot facial
it smells crazy good it smells good
let's have a bite
