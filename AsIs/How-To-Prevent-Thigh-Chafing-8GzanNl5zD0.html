to live our best thick five life and so
we owe it to these people and these
products and these companies to go out
there and live our best thick fat life
am i right I am right what's up y'all
it's Dasia here still thick still loving
it but what I still don't love is chump
so I'm back testing four new different
products to see which one is gonna help
me turn my chub-rub
y'all ready cuz I'm ready my thighs
haven't been ready okay so me and my
friend Jade are gonna hike today and I'm
going to be using the degree deodorant
this was Phan recommended and I've
actually I've been really curious about
trying deodorant for a while now so I've
used it as deodorant and it's very nice
and like slick under my armpit so I'll
see how it works I'm out in the good old
nature of Washington I have to say for
me I gave it a 2 out of 5 so we made it
to the top of the hike I definitely feel
like the deodorant has kind of like
fully rubbed off it wasn't too
uncomfortable but like at the same time
like I don't know if this would be my
go-to it was about an hour hike so at
most you're getting like 30 to 45
minutes of wear before you have to
reapply again yeah I don't hate it but
I'm also like I'm not in love with it
either I think it's a really good hat
because everyone carries deodorant on
them my suggestion would be to use this
if you had nothing else but if I had an
option or a choice I would probably get
something else I will say though
snuggles balm
today I have dance class so I'm gonna be
using at the Gold Bond to see how that
helps me out it also came from
recommended go bond in me dirty last
summer but that was the powder and it
wasn't the powders intended purpose but
this is literally it's like intended for
thigh chafing okay so I just put the
goal phone on and it's very reminiscent
of the deodorant it feels smooth when
you rub it but then when it's on your
legs it almost feels like it makes them
stinkier you got to the point in dance
class where I kind of has to like pull
down my shorts a little bit just because
this irritated it so badly but it's so
weird because you touch it and it feels
so smooth and I can see why the person
recommended it I see you girl I don't
know I think maybe I have the type of
skin in between my thighs that just like
this and this just didn't they were not
friends yeah I'm up--it I was gonna say
point five of the star but I'll give it
one star it's something that I feel like
other people should try for themselves
the magic that is silky underwear y'all
like silky underwear made me re-evaluate
my relationship to powders first of all
let's talk about this smell okay oh I
got a read y'all this product
description sophisticated Jasmine
scented powder with added cocoa butter
leaving it soft smooth and seriously
sexy like can we talk about that
alliteration for a second like my inner
English nerd is going wild so I tried
this I was working out at unfortunately
five I am you know thick girl Fitness
life
that's just how we live when you first
put it on like it really rubs together
nicely on your thighs like I can't get
over how soft this powder is it's
interesting because I've tried other
powders before it I don't really like
them but this powder was really nice
like it definitely left your thighs
feeling very silky so that they could
glide together but as I was going
through the workout and understandably
so like with the sweat the sweat
absorbed all the powder so if I end of
it my thighs weren't completely
irritated and I would definitely reap
outer as I would go along but it didn't
matter my sweat soaked it all up but I
think if you're just out there living a
thick girl best life like this
definitely were
but I wouldn't use it for physical
activity so that being said I gave it
3.5 stars just because you know you
can't use it for everything but honestly
I might even I think maybe I'd give it
up or maybe give me things for some I'm
having a really hard time scoring this
one I mean if I listen you got
aromatherapy up in here you got by
therapy up in here like this bottle
screams I got you girl I think I'll give
it a 3.75 okay you know what there we go
new score I will definitely use it again
so today I'm doing the by society anti
chafing shorts I really like these
they're super comfortable I've tried a
variety of shorts throughout my life and
one of the things that I've never really
liked about shorts is how they make you
kind of feel like a sausage just because
it feels like they want your body to
mold to the shorts rather than the
shorts molding to you which is how it
should be in life a society like they
found the formula this material that
they use it's so soft and so like
breathable like you put them on and it
molds to you it's all about you with
these shorts
the material is super soft and I didn't
know I could breathe through my clothing
until leash snorts I will say my one
fear about wearing by chafing shorts is
that sometimes it can like roll up and
so then your thighs end up getting
exposed I didn't have that problem at
all I was down at Santa Monica here and
I was walking around all day and they
stayed put I don't really have anything
negative to say about these just because
it was such a pleasant experience
and then the only thing that they're
really missing for me as a smell like I
just wish they had a scent oh my god
okay so if we line the short leg
literally take these and then just line
the inside like dust the inside with the
powder yeah somebody needs to call me
that's all I'm saying yeah yeah I love
these shorts these shorts are everything
one of the things that I love about this
experience is that you know there are
people that want us to live our best big
five life and so we owe it to these
people and these products and these
companies to go out there and live our
best big bad life am i right I am right
yes so with that let me know what
products you use what you like what
doesn't work for you what does post some
pictures I love seeing women or people
honestly just live in the best thick fat
life and I'll catch y'all next time be
thick be fabulous beep amazing that's
all I got
i'ma just keep rambling at this point
but y'all adieu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
