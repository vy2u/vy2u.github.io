Margo died and black is not my color how
am I expected to stand out with
everyone's wearing black you know that
dress you wore when you stole Sloane's
boyfriend wear that
oh wait no Margo always liked red I will
not be caught dead matching someone
that's well did just bring a backup
outfit you can change her when nobody's
looking right because she won't have any
say in that next up say a few heartfelt
works try it okay Margo is my best
friend something so many people here
would die for in a way if she did good
however smiling is frowned upon so many
rules you have to cry louder than anyone
however you don't want your makeup to
run so your tears can't be real
obvi yeah
ugly cries are for ugly people still a
little ugly that needs some work
whatever now your social networking I
was thinking of doing live updates for
my followers if you want to maximize
comments and shares do a selfie with the
casket right because authenticity is my
greatest social media asset what show me
your selfie pose
that's Marco this is my good size and
this is my other good side make sure to
block that dead girl's face otherwise
that's just plain tacky
oh yeah corpse face like the worst photo
bomb ever this thing is gonna be such a
downer wait you know what I'll bring my
uppers you got it it's on you to put the
fun in funeral you aren't going to be on
time are you now I'm gonna go make a
Bloody Mary Bloody Marco no but like
seriously there was so much blood when
they found her gross
they are just gonna die when they see me
dying on Margo special day the ultimate
attention-getter why didn't I think of
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
