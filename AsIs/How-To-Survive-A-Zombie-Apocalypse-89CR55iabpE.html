and if you're watching this you probably
are - some of you might be looking at
these guys chowing down like pigs and
thinking there's got to be a better way
well there is it's a little something I
call morgue to table you really want to
kill it as a zombie you have to go
beyond the obvious think outside the box
mmm this brain was so fresh that really
all it needed was a quick poach with
some forage herbs oh and don't forget to
lock your doors and hide your brains
some days you're just gonna look like
crap because you're dead but every
zombie is beautiful in their own way
flaws and all he used to react to these
brutal acts of zombies God did not
create zombies if anything what they
need to do is eat my neighbor okay
seriously the media will try to kill
yourself esteem they will try to make
you feel stupid ugly and less them but
remember they are the monsters not you
wait
zombies are always in imminent danger so
we have to be able to protect ourselves
against all kinds of weapons you're
gonna want to watch out for crossbows
and crowbars trident and ninja stars
hammers broomsticks golf balls and
frying pans explosives corrosive sauce
Shetty's and shotguns and remember
Fighting's not the answer in this world
you get back what you put out
zombie shouldn't hide their emotions
just because they look a little fog lees
be happy
flirty delirious bummed annoyed paranoid
emo pensive perverted patriotic sassy in
a girl band sexy as hell and super sweet
when I was a human I didn't always act
on things the way
would have I probably should have ran
that day I probably should have tried to
stab more zombies with my stapler but I
don't have any regrets and you shouldn't
either because being a walker isn't that
bad look I don't have all the answers
everyone's experience being undead is
different and you'll have to figure some
things out on your own but I hope this
helps success is a zombie is ultimately
up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
