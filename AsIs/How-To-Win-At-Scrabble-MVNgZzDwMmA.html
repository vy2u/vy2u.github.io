taxidermy for ducks haha what hook it up
how to win at Scrabble be cool when
picking your initial tiles for Scrabble
there's both a right and a wrong way
Stephanie for example is showing us how
not to react when you pull nothing but
fouls see this as an opportunity rather
than a liability David has picked a
blank tile and everyone knows this is
called being a moron
I'm gonna destroying too much haha
pretty soon booooo-whoo the ostensible
reason for scrabble is fun but sometimes
that fun can lead to disaster when
making a humorous comment you Matt Jette
win isn't a word right twinjet is a word
make sure you're not revealing your hand
yeah think about what is left on your
rack the letters you play are just as
important as the letters
you don't play while it might seem like
a good idea to play your high scoring
letters every round this player is
saving Q W and V for the opportune
moment short words too little plays are
among the most effective in all of
Scrabble the Greek alphabet and the
musical scale for example is a wealth of
two letter words
dou R a me Fah Soh lah T aren't just an
opportunity to show off your singing
skills they are all official Scrabble
words the best offense is a good defense
take care not to play a word that begins
or ends just a couple spaces away from a
double or triple word space don't mind
if I do
triple words school what your opponent
could add to your word and earn double
or triple the points you initially
received I hope
friends oh god I'm gonna lose you don't
always need a you to play a queue
 here ah the queue was the most
misunderstood of the Scrabble letters
I'm just gonna act like that's okay is
that French
really well there are certain words that
can take advantage of the secret weapon
cue without the elusive you such as
ear khadi is that word finished
hey what you're doing right now is
you're just pretending to have knowledge
I'm not as if like you can't do
something
Knopf not how it's spelled cocked that's
a sad place that you don't want to go
corn ma Turlock it's a gluten-free and
kind of bread and drink like the rapper
of course convincing your opponents that
these are actual words can be a
challenge it's a word words that are
jerk moves there are certain words that
are strategically amazing or will lead
to hatred from all those around you
these words include quicks a tree tomb
aw aw
and finally simmer gee merchants I'm
Ritchie's night of words
look it up folks maybe like use your
brain once in a while do we have a
dictionary ah crap he's right now over
40 points yes hooked up alright haha
nope nope don't use these words unless
absolutely necessary it will save your
friendships maybe even your life honey
what David you want to come back to the
table No
way in conclusion scrabble is a game you
should enjoy so remember to have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
