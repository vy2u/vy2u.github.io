sorry how'd she do it it's a long story
I have an open bar tab
you
the best I happen I'm sorry I did what's
up at least you guys weren't together
for that long three months really
straight couple times really weird
thought I was like two weeks or
something right well may got a lot of
work to do right what yeah I'm going to
show you how to win that breakup okay
step one clean up
you guys were Facebook official aren't
you of course gross okay never do that
again okay so now we're just gonna hide
your relationship status here um change
it to single well I mean people should
know what I'm going through can't just
hide all the negative parts about our
lives and project all the positive parts
Chris its Facebook that's what people do
I guess you're right just a friend her
completely know that's admitting defeat
we're going for higher ground here
you're just going to you know unfollow
her so that you don't have to see all
her weird Sh in your newsfeed I mean
what about all our pictures together and
I tripped at Cleveland am I supposed to
delete that no Chris again that's
admitting defeat plus you know you may
want them in 10 years when you want to
bring physical copies for say you think
Facebook will be around 10 years you
know I was thinking about that like I
were just gonna like be robots oh yeah
really I was watching a documentary
about technological singularity reduce
all the photos of you guys together put
them in an album change the privacy it's
only you can see them how do you know
all this
oh they're more blot relationships
she just tweeted a quote about the
change unfollow her that's a sub tweet
what you know like when she mentioned D
without mentioning you yeah and she
attributed a to Kanye this is a Brady
Bunch episode no so what about Instagram
instagrams a little trickier at the
front line of your battleground so if
you deleted all the pictures you guys
have together that's it you told her did
not supposed to look for selfies of her
and her friends at the beach is another
guy who is Kara there
she's a hook losing focus okay I'm sorry
she's overcompensating she's only doing
this to show you how good her life is
without you all right so let's retaliate
no yes I'm sorry we can't we have to
take the higher ground here all right
fine I won't post anything no you can't
do that I'm just gonna look devastated
what do you want me to do Brittany here
indifference is key dr. Chen Instagram
well MA oh my god
huh she's just like my post what she
crazy what does this mean does this mean
we're getting back together it's an
attack sir no no okay
if you text her now all the progress
we've made is just gone oh we win I
don't care what if I don't want to do
this anymore what if I don't want to
pretend like everything's okay because
that's what people do Chris they pretend
like everything's okay until things are
eventually but why does there have to be
so many rules what if I just want to be
myself online no don't stop you just won
the break-up from coffee the only
winning move is not to play war games
right yeah I thought that you'd like
that yeah it's the whole singularities
are you were listen yeah okay I'm still
kind of upset about this but what I was
saying that I kind of think the robots
will learn so much that they'll kind of
become
in a sense or at least they'll
understand our concepts they're gonna be
like conservative everything for the
more liberal I think they will
understand God's like every leg
conservative that is social that's just
our interpretation of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
