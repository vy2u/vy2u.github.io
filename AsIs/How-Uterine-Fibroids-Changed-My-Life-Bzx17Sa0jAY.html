might lose your uterus is unnerving to
say the least the first indication that
I have fibroids was fatigue I got to a
point where I was always tired and I
found myself always sleeping and not
feeling rested and so while I had other
symptoms before then that was the main
indicator to me that something was wrong
you need to figure out what it is well
let me do the doctor was the ER but I'll
go back about eight months before I
ended up in the ER and then with my new
doctor I was having super heavy cycles
I couldn't even function when my cycle
was on I've always had very heavy
sometimes painful periods but I could
normally take like an ibuprofen and be
cool
I've always been anemic and I just
attributed out to genetics and my
environment and it wasn't until late 20s
when I felt like my anemia was impacting
my quality of life I found out later
that I was like very anemic to a point
where as it started to get worse and
started to progress I was always cold
and can never ever get warm I go to the
doctor and I'm like hey you know it's
time for my pap smear but I have these
questions because my body is doing
things that are even abnormal for me and
I'm a person with a heavier cycle and so
I told him what was going on he was like
okay no problem I'm just gonna give you
some birth control you should be good
I've heard people that take birth
control they feel better in a couple of
months I was like okay so that's gonna
be my story my period started to get
very heavy there definitely a big
indicator I think for a woman anytime
your menstrual cycle changes first I
tried to manage the symptoms in terms of
my anemia then I realized that I was
losing weight I'm a small person to
begin with and when I got down to 105
pounds you know I wondered if there was
stress but I said wait a second what's
happening so I went to my OB guide again
and I realized that I'd lost so much
blood because of my heavy periods and
then he ordered immediately a blood
transfusion so I was a bit nervous about
a blood transfusion so I said well what
are my options and then he recommend
I'll infusions and that was a way to
build my iron up and I can think back to
maybe there was the first change in in
my cycle was about two years before I
actually had my surgery to have them
removed but again at that time I didn't
recognize any that was probably when I
think back the very first could have
been the earliest symptom the one thing
about fibroids is that they don't know
how fast they grow they progress
differently in every single person every
cycle I'm still having the same exact
period not only is it the same for a few
months it starts to get worse the
bleeding's heavier the periods are
lasting longer the pain is worse and I'm
like okay well maybe it's just a long
birth control but honestly I didn't even
feel like going back to the doctor so I
just kind of ran with it until I landed
in the ER over the course of the year I
did every other week iron infusions and
we checked it after a while and it was
still low he said you may want to
consider options for getting your
fibroids removed and I was really
nervous because I didn't want to go do
any kind of invasive surgery so there
was a procedure that I opted for
initially which was my assure it was an
outpatient experience so no downtime was
able to go back to work in like two days
my doctor as soon as she went to examine
me she was able to feel the fibroids and
she were was able to feel that they were
pretty sizable he initially didn't want
to have surgery doctors try to avoid
that if they don't need to but my
symptoms progressed so much that not
only did I end up having to have surgery
we moved it up the day before I went to
the ER I was taking a shower the next
thing I know I'm like blacking out the
next day I got up and went into work and
I was still in all this pain but I'm
like I mean I've been doing this since
I've had a period I'm not gonna not go
to work because of my period so I'm
sitting at my desk and next thing I know
like I get this like pain was so severe
I go to the bathroom
and as a person with a heavy cycle to
say that I was completely freaked out
when I went to the restroom I was like
oh and she's like am i hemorrhaging I
call the advice nurse and I'm telling
her what my symptoms are and she's like
you need to go to the ER you can't even
wait for a next day appointment like we
you need to go and I was like okay cool
so let's see how this cycle you know
what my next cycle will will tell me and
after that it just got worse to the
point where I was filling a maxi pad
like an overnight pad in an hour
I was extremely insecure about just
being anywhere public during that time I
just did this procedure why is it even
worse than it was before and so that was
a point where I decided with you know
consultation from the doctor and my
family that I needed to get a myomectomy
when she confirmed I had them I mean
that was a relief in a way to know that
that's what was wrong what did kind of
hit me and what got me the most nervous
and scared about them was when we talked
about having surgery and anytime they
tell you you have to have surgery there
are risks associated with it they're
going to do surgery to remove some
things inside and outside your uterus
there's always a risk that you could
lose it I cried about it I thought about
it I overthought it I realized I still
had to do it in order to at least
attempt to keep you know a healthy
uterus so hopefully be able to have
children later go through the ER and I'm
signing in and they're asking me what my
symptoms are and again I'm still feeling
like a complete idiot because I'm like
Here I am telling these nurses that I'm
coming to the ER from my period I almost
felt like I was being judged I probably
wasn't it was probably all in my head
but I felt like it and the doctor comes
in and they take my blood count and he's
like you've lost almost enough blood to
warrant a blood transfusion we had to
build up my iron to get the myomectomy
so a series of months again doing the
iron infusions December 15th of 2011 was
when I had my myomectomy surgery come to
find out the doctor that I went to see
about the symptoms eight months earlier
that gave me the birth control he didn't
tell me I was anemic so I'm severely
anemic at that point
and then this happens and of course that
takes my blood levels all the way down
fast-forward he's had my bag next to me
great got married and of course we want
to start a family and the first thing I
did when I went to my doctor was check
to see if I had fibroids and lo and
behold they came back I think having all
of the symptoms before I was able to
recognize certain things that were
happening to my body that made me feel
like they were back I only found out
this past June for sure that they were
it's pretty common I believe it's at
least there's a 50% chance that they can
recur
we have not discussed any non-surgical
options it really comes down to like
which type of surgery
I'll need and to be honest even if she
were able to put me on a different birth
control or you know do something like
that honestly I want this fibrin out to
say that the last year and a half has
been awful like that's an understatement
few years ago had gone through a
procedure and in less than like three
years they came back I was really
nervous when we were thinking about
conceiving what would happen and
fortunately for us we were able to
conceive and the fibroids and the fetus
coexisted five words themselves are
fairly common most people just don't
know that they have them a lot of people
go through life with them and just don't
really have symptoms at all the and
that's why they don't know a lot about
it not until people have symptoms till
they come in and we find out that
something is wrong with them in all my
research that I've done on fibroids I
found out that it affects African
American women more prominently than any
other race and as I think about my
friends I can count probably over a
dozen of my friends who've either had a
myomectomy fibroids or something of that
nature and it's a bit disheartening
because you just think about something
that's prevalent it's just like you have
the myomectomy you have these other
procedures but they grow back so it's
like why are they growing back we do so
much you know we have to come into work
and succeed we have to be fly outside of
work we have babies we take care of
homes but the thing that we don't always
do is take care of ourselves
put your health first if there is
something wrong and you haven't been to
the doctor or are you afraid to go
because you don't have insurance look
into other options and for women who do
have the insurance but don't make the
time girl make the time because at the
end of the day you only get one body and
if you're not taking care of that one
body then what I have two lessons one is
about just really doing your own
research once you are able to do that
and understand what's happening you are
a better patient because you know what
questions to ask your doctor and can
advocate on behalf of yourself the
second thing I learned I think perhaps
the most important was that sharing is
caring and so the idea of me sharing
this with my friends and family members
and not keeping it to myself offered me
the opportunity to gain much more
knowledge than I initially had
