idk we don't know either
that was really good friend do it again
[Laughter]
anyway hi guys the topic of today's
episode is strange or making us yeah
what is making out though why does it
have you kids with making what else
making out what it say so we're talking
about change change change
Sanjay sure you do it
right before I got this job I was an
assistant to people for a long time
and I was fired for my last assistant
job because I was a terrible assistant I
was like basically alone in the woods
with no money a big change that I went
through was about two years ago I was
living and working in New York City I
was really at a crossroads with my
career and trying to figure out like
exactly what I wanted to do so I ended
up getting the internship at BuzzFeed in
LA so I took the leap of moving and sort
of uprooting myself I decided that I
wanted to try and be a professional
writer and that meant that I had to
accept that like I'm gonna succeed and I
got a right stuff I gotta send it to
people and I gotta go on interview this
and be on top of things and put myself
up for opportunities that I thought I
wasn't good enough for I have no family
in LA I have no not even in California
like I have no family or friends like on
the west coast really so it was a really
really big scary leap for me I'm so much
happier knowing that I took a risk and
have you know kind of succeeded in a way
then just kind of staying complacent and
being too scared sometimes it's really
hard when you're in a comfortable
position to see what could be out there
for you that's better the more
comfortable you are with being
uncomfortable and that's when you can
really like skyrocket and do things yeah
totally I'm on board with that cliche
yeah do something that scares you a
large change that we are all going
through together is that we are starting
our new channel we're pregnant
with our new channel so you may have
noticed that we haven't been posting as
regularly as we were before and that's
because we've been like on really really
big shoots and we've been getting a lot
of stuff planned to release with this be
channel another super exciting aspect of
this new channel is we get to talk to
you and we get to have conversations
with you the viewer and hear what you're
excited about what you want to see from
us keep telling us what you like tell us
what you don't like we can adapt it's
something that we've been working on
while it's exciting and also extremely
scary it is the kind of thing like okay
this is like a big step that we're doing
but Dad dive in yeah sometimes just
gotta go headfirst we hope and like
really want you guys to like trust us
and like take a chance and go on this
journey with us thank you guys for being
