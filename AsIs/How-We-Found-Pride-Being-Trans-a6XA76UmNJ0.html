for me the biggest key to finding a
sense of pride and being trans has been
finding other trans people who I
genuinely enjoy it is the bravery and
resilience of my community that makes me
feel proud to be trans one of the things
that makes me really proud is seeing the
effect that I have on my family and the
people around me my little sister who's
seen me as a trans person almost all of
her life when she went away to college
she was in an all-girls dorm and there
was a young guy there that was trans and
she basically got all the people around
her to treat him like a human being and
create a space for him to be safe when
my mother finally for Mother's Day this
year 2015 she said you have challenged
my perception of what it is to be a
woman and I embrace you fully daughter
learning about trans history made me
proud to be trans marching and doing
demonstrations for trans people made me
feel really amazing when I went to the
White House and spoke up on behalf of my
transgender undocumented community I was
the co-creator of a project called the
trans 100 which is an annual list
celebrating 100 out trans activists the
most proud of ever felt was at our first
live event which was completely done by
trans people for trans people I have
been fortunate to be a part of TV shows
that I would have never thought when I
was younger that I would even be given
an opportunity let alone an acting
opportunity I started printing a
magazine called original plumbing the
first issue we didn't know how was going
to go and we ended up selling out in a
few days I think that it is exciting to
be part of a gender revolution and a
time of that happening and I get to be
part of that history learn to love
yourself as a trans person because you
are changing the world simply by being
who you are you're making the world
better by being who you are as
transgender people we have the gift of
seeing through the veil of gender of
labels of those things that keep us
separated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
