knows herself
I'm grosser like I drool when I eat a
lot and she gets food on her head I'll
take it I think I want to take the quiz
for my perspective I want to tell you
the argument were your parents most
likely to take growing up and I chose
mine bingo what's your sister's best
quality
Bob said humor yes we agree for one what
does your sister most likely to steal
from your closet a sundress bingo I said
a sundress cuz you have your own
companies what plan I do how long does
it take your sister to get ready here we
go
we both said an hour or so only because
there wasn't a two-and-a-half-hour
option what does your sister eat for
breakfast
I chose oatmeal because you offered the
oatmeal for breakfast this morning I you
did everybody
how could you best annoy me going into
your room without permission or going
into the bathroom while I'm in there
without permission yeah that's true
though I said stealing clothes
what's your sister's fighting style I
chose passive aggression what I chose
this because there were times growing up
when we would fight and you'd be passive
aggressive for about a week to me well
no yes but in the heat of the fire I am
emotional warfare
which famous pair of sisters are you
most liked here and there Maury but did
you want to say Venus isn't that their
last name they're married not worried
anymore I feel disappointed but it's
still better than fifty percent I'm
wondering if what happened here was that
we were like what is she gonna say or
like if I were her what would I respond
and then we just messed it all up I feel
like on a surface level it did it did
quiz us well I feel like it went through
the basics of sisters maybe a little bit
more personal questions we would have
nailed oh gosh or like how many how many
dates does it take for bath to sleep
with a guy and vice versa of course vice
versa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
