know it's just hard like I feel like he
was a pretty good boyfriend what do you
miss about him like having an excuse to
go on dates and get a really fancy
restaurant where you just order bottles
of wine and sit there talking for like
two hours
Ellie how many times did that actually
happen and also that's not what it looks
like hmm I guess I'm not imagining I'm
exactly accurately and we mostly went to
that diner he was like obsessed with it
but you know at least I could have sex
whenever I wanted I thought you guys
didn't even have that much sex anymore
wanna I got naughty oh I'm sorry
bachelor in paradise starts in like four
minutes yeah but it was nice just to be
able to complain to somebody whenever I
wanted with no questions asked you silly
for passing you up and honestly you
shouldn't be somewhere where they don't
appreciate me Daniel got the promotion
even though I've been there longer and
my work has always been consistently
better that sucks I mean I'm starting to
think I shouldn't even be at this
company they don't value me for sure
yeah you wouldn't see he does not
understand you you know it's just hard
because he was the best boyfriend I ever
had and I mean sure he had buzz but you
know he tried he was thoughtful you know
we never fought it what about that one
time on my birthday when he took me
hiking and went to that mountain and he
said I love you for the first time are
you joking
well okay Ally that time was a day after
birthday because he forgot and you
didn't get to the top of the mountain
you got to the entrance for the trail
because he was afraid of the hike
he didn't say that he loved you he said
love yeah no I know
and that's very different that is
different
yes so don't worry about it I think I'm
just feeling bad because I broke up with
him and only remembering the good things
don't feel guilty about breaking up with
it you would never break up now
friendships last forever they do here I
got / Karen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
