with my sister Becky my sister possibly
stupidly is allowing me to control her
life for one whole day I came up with a
bunch of stuff that either pushes her
outside of our comfort zone allow us her
to do something she's always wanted to
do or shows her a different side to
something she thinks she doesn't like
and the best part it is all a surprise
to get this started
I'm not shopping for something that she
wouldn't usually wear but I think she
would look good
okay bill denim dress could be an option
she never wears cutesy stuff like this
she definitely never wears red and maybe
some stripes to booty so luckily I'm the
same size as Becky's this is a nice flat
iron thing it also has this just love it
right right
little tiny flowers fruit really want to
get some heels but I don't want to be
too high these don't seem too high to me
I'm a little nervous can I have a drink
I feel like something's gonna happen
where I have to do something
embarrassing in front of a lot of people
you know me so well you know exactly
what will make me uncomfortable I think
I'm quite controlling on my own I'm very
particular and so like to be taken out
of that might be really uncomfortable
but I might learn a thing or two
okay well now it's time for the first
thing of the day I can see you're
getting close out I'd like to be covered
in cats I'm coming in but keep your eyes
closed that's gotten close
item number 1 a color you never wear oh
that's a bright color it is I like thank
you that's another thing I mean I
probably wouldn't wear that unless
someone like made me either no cuz I
might like give it it's like very bright
yeah I kind of want you in something
like boom today you know boom boom here
I come
you're only ever really wear necklaces
gotta pay something I know you find
these hard to buy and honestly alright
one more thing okay the big boy is it
shoes because they're huge feet I said
it this is because you always say you
want to wear these things
but you never actually do so I'm going
to me this is a nice day sir
alright ready for your reveals oh oh
it's nice to cry no oh my god yeah
you're I would never take this I feel
like a summer woman I'm so surprised
that this isn't unflattering because
it's really hard to pick ties to other
people so yeah now we're on to our next
stage some voice surprised I take the
clothes back stage two I'm gonna push
her to do something that she's always
wanted to do but she's a little too
nervous to get
going with stand-up comedy era now I'm a
stand-up comedian oh I'm gonna teach you
how to perform a couple minutes stand-up
oh good so you have a couple of ideas
like a few weeks ago I woke up in the
night and just wrote down some jokes
they're probably terrible that's okay
there's no I wrote my first joke you
started with some observations about
being British I'm coming to the United
States yes which is a great way to start
because starting from truth you're
starting from an opinion so what are
some observations between Britain in the
u.s. that you've noticed in general is
that Americans erase very much in a
positive like you should be a winner
everything about being British is being
oh don't worry about me I'm just an
idiot your comment should be relatable
but not familiar you can take something
that's a cliche like British people are
subdued make it your own by putting your
own experiences I'd say I'm into it well
I did this thing where I was I was kind
of comparing that attitude but putting
it on like candy bars perfect the name
of you guys is candy bars are just so
much more confident than ours this is a
great angle because this is a very
unique and silly angle that the audience
won't see coming so I think you have a
really good start and now it's just a
matter of organizing it and again even
if it's a minute just get up on stage
and try it and just keep doing it over
and over again it was like a an idea in
my mind and now it's like oh it's okay
to try it like you're very encouraging
so thank you so much
please don't judge me this is brand new
I don't know what I'm doing but this is
what the day is about so I'm from
England and I've lived here for about
six years within about the first six
minutes I realized that there's a big
difference between our culture's
Americans are very very confident
they're raised to be like winners
spinning then if you're good at
something you better try your damn
hardest to make sure no one knows an
easy way to represent this idea is with
treats in England our treats all kind of
represent that don't make a scene vibe
like we have a cookie called a digestive
biscuit now I didn't think that was
weird growing up but
sounds like something that makes you
poop in the US you have things like
paydays which sounds like this is as
great as getting paid this is your
reward for being so great and that
really that's that's probably it for me
I want to lie down now
stage 3 is lunchtime by Becky and I love
a cheat day and I wanted to show her the
sandwich I discovered recently it's
pretty insane and I hope she doesn't
throw up inside of a vein that's clogged
yeah it's a sandwich we're by steak
grilled onion melted American cheese
chicken fingers mozzarella stick weekend
Friday Friday I'll get you up on a hero
but I probably best frozen it that is
the mark of a great sandwich it tastes
kind of a barbecue like cause a little
sauces and the murdering whatever the
hell meat isn't there and so got my
outfit well I'm pretty full we only ate
half it but I said I'd eat half because
something you don't really like doing
but I want to do for you is to get good
Instagram pictures today I don't know I
don't like posting pictures where it
looks like I tried really hard
yeah and just was a day I want to push
you cosplay because I get that I find
that too but like if I'm taking it and
maybe you'll feel less worried about it
let's see what can you do put on your
hands in your pockets be at hand closer
to your hair you're like holding a
Hudson no it's all good it's why they
take pieces my name Smith Jetson and I'm
CEO all right welcome to my blue layer
all right lean forward baby put your
legs up and lean over them baby all
right I just have you literally lean on
the wall
askew look that way great you got it man
getting so many more likes than usual
and it just as firm as I believe that
she should be way more confident in
herself and that I should be her
personal photographer stage 5 is to get
her to see something she doesn't think
she likes in a different light she loves
nature and she's not a big fan of
downtown LA because it's so built up so
I decided I'm gonna take it to LA's
tallest building and show what the city
looks like from above so yes we're
driving to a mysterious location I feel
like it's my birthday this is something
terrible and it's just my funeral
so we're going to spy 73 which is at the
intercontinental Los Angeles downtown
hotel
which is behind us so spy 73 is the
tallest open-air bar in all of the
Western Hemisphere wow that's crazy yeah
this is the tallest building in LA let's
go let's go here we are it is level 73
Wow and the first view I'm gonna show
you is this one what yeah yeah but let's
go into the actual bar because it's very
cool
has this changed your view of downtown
not think it is really change what do
you think about it it feels like a whole
different world up here it even like
just the space it feels like we're on a
vacation
Cheers here's to controlling you so the
last thing of the day is purely just
something she loves kind of like a thank
you for Lanie messed up her all day
she is a massive Harry Potter fan so I
have a themed surprise up my sleeve
I know so we're here at Universal
Studios Hollywood we are specifically
going to the Wizarding World of Harry
Potter eyes you are like the biggest fan
ever and I just want to finish off the
day with something that I knew you'd
like and not be uncomfortable at all I'm
very comfortable let's go in
don't try some Barbie yeah let's let's
do fun a bear go free
mmm I don't know what is this great goo
on top
oh no surprise they give you trouble all
right I'm totally into that did you know
I was gonna bring you here are you glad
yes I don't think I even deserve a tree
at the end because it was all fun Lubas
their eyes can see what this one can do
Oh God
Wingardium Leviosa tree Guardium Leviosa
Jesus
I'm not a muggle Guardium Leviosa oh
okay I did it yay I'm a wizard Chloe so
why I really wanted to do with this
video was suppress you to do things that
you wanted to do haven't done or get you
to have new experiences and I'm
surprised how much you really really
liked everything which is great because
it means you should just push yourself
to do stuff but you aren't sure about
yeah I think everyone should do this
with like their best friend or sibling
and see how it turns out
yeah yeah we are a very time now it was
quite a day so we're going to go to bed
yes goodbye goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
