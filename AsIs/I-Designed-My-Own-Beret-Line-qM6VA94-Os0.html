my face so my new obsession lately has
been braised recently I've been seeing
that berets have been the accessory
they started super high fashion and then
celebs starting wearing them and now
they're selling of it like forever 21
and I love wearing them and I was
thinking it would be pretty awesome if I
came out with a beret line since I was
young I've loved fashion I moved out to
LA to go to the Fashion Institute
I've always loved street style following
the trends but also being myself I
thought it would be cool if I made a
beret line and collab with somebody I've
chatted a little bit with my friend
Whitney who owns a shop shop kid Belle
I'm hoping to make some Berets that can
be pretty evergreen and you can wear
them at any time so this is just gonna
be my journey of making my beret line so
I'm here with my girl with me who is
totally down to do a great lab which I
can't believe my life what the I want to
know a little bit more about your store
it's kid Belle calm the partner artists
and influencers with nonprofits we
always do a charitable component so that
you get to wear something that feels
empowering but also benefits the
community we want to empower people to
feel like unapologetically themselves
it's just skyrocketed and people love it
they mean it shows that there's like a
market for this kind of stuff in that
you know when you do get back to charity
like people really want to support that
Jonathan was in a photo shoot we did
like or five months ago and she
obviously wore a bunch of arrays because
like this a bunch of our customers were
messaging us afterwards and we're like
you know we love this phrase we can't
get them I said offhandedly like yeah
like people love your fur is it
you not me where they can get
and you and I've always had to do a line
like have my name behind something in
fashion yeah you were like yeah well I
can make my own mind and I was like well
why don't we and then it happened so
fast I was interested in doing Berets
because I just want like everyday people
to feel like they can wear this fashion
statement to okay some major things that
I want I want the quality to be good
we're gonna do 100% wool via leather
trim okay second of all I want to make
the colors really inclusive a lot of
skin tones other than that I want them
to be dope stylish I want these to be
worn like at all times throughout the
year I'm still in a like is this really
happening but I'm just like let's just
go me and Whitney finally decided on
what Berets we're gonna have all right
so the first beret is mustard with a
navy trim it's a color that can last
through summer and winter our second
beret is a leopard print beret is going
to be outlined in red just to make it
pop a little bit
the third beret is a black beret
outlined in black trim and we made a
little customized patch that's a heart
and it has myself so it's like I love
myself right like come on we should love
ourselves I've also decided to make the
patches optional so if you want a patch
you can get one if you don't you don't
have to our north beret is a green beret
with black trim on it that can come with
a little weed patch or not the fifth
beret is a red beret with little pearls
on it and I'm like I think it's gonna
look so fashionable there is an option
to not have it with pearls too it's
really cool how we're doing everything
you know so if you just want the plain
beret you can get the plain bray if not
you can jazz it up the last beret is
called the Jazz berry beret is two toned
a burgundy color and a pink color this
process is absolutely insane it's a
little surreal it's a lot of stressful
but I think this is gonna be worth it in
the end
some young Whitney are here walking
around looking for some fabrics we need
wool poly blend 95% of all five percent
poly and we need to be pretty thick and
then we need vegan leather okay yeah I'm
gonna take a while we're gonna have a
mascot though me and whit have been
traveling and shopping all day all damn
day we've been to two towns shopping day
is done with as of now I am about to
walk into the room and see my face I'm a
little nervous
everybody is off to go get ready for the
shoot oh wait okay I'm try not to go oh
my god the purl 1 oh I got the green
so it has been one hell of a day
honestly everything turned out perfect
everyone looks so good in the berets I
had an array of skin tones and every
beret looked good on everyone this is
gonna be insane my beret is just dropped
and all holy I am so excited here
they are
oh my gosh they're so good from the hot
mama beret yeah jazz very like I feel
like we have Whitney have been talking
about this for forever and now that my
berets are actually dropped like people
can buy them
it feels very surreal it is absolutely
insane for me to think that my name is
behind clothing that people could wear
through Whitney and shop kid Bell I was
allowed to do that this whole journey
has been such an eye-opening experience
this was like a dream that I've had
since I was a child</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
