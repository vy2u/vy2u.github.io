spec that looks like isn't it yeah
I'm Lina and I'm gonna be dressing emo
for a week when I was in high school it
was like the height of like a bonus
that's like Fall Out Boy was big and
consisteth My Chemical Romance I like
love the aesthetic I felt dark inside I
just like wanted to be a part of that I
would like wear pam t-shirts here and
there but I wouldn't like go full on
massive side part and bang straight and
tear like studded belts I couldn't fully
commit because I was just too
self-conscious about drawing attention
to myself I am a little nervous for
people to suddenly be looking at me a
ton while I have just strong aesthetic
on I feel like I have to be dark now I
feel a little bit ridiculous but also
really good cuz is that this is how I
like always wanted to look when I was in
high school when I step out that door I
don't know what it's gonna be like would
you be friends with me in high school
fellas like this I would try to updating
it I was hot out uh-huh
Hot Topic just like threw up all over
people keep using that phrase it's like
a good Charlotte concert pubes yeah now
you look no I'm scared for you people
were definitely noticing me I don't know
if they were like blocking me or thought
I was ridiculous it definitely made me
stand out more to strangers and I was
like not mad about it are you a fan of
this look yeah didn't get Tina get seats
me yeah I can do it
lots of people did like the look
probably because it reminded them of
like their high school selves or like
people they knew in high school this is
my second day of being emo I've teased
my hair like a lot I think I got like a
lot of volume out of it like I do it a
bit and then I'd be like no more and so
I just like keeps teasing and teasing
and teasing and that like eats away it
all you're telling I'm wearing a Fall
Out Boy shirt
I've had some as a gay teen wearing my
same studded belt from yesterday as
ridiculous as I kind of look as a whole
I feel super confident and like super
badass my my sadness what do you think I
look like scary you look dumb but
leaking it in like a good way I like
that you're being more vulnerable in
your appearance I think that's really
cool lots of people told me that I
looked scary and I was like good I want
people to be a little bit scared of me I
mean there's nothing really that scary
about being emo it's just different like
this very Wednesday Addams II like dress
I don't hate the way it looks and I
might have to adopt this whole tease I
never tease my hair like ever
how do you feel being seen with me oh I
just really good hanging out with
someone I would hang out with when I was
13 it's like oh my god that's how I
looked when I was born it was very
interesting to see especially who would
come up to me and you look at the man
you're like you don't look like you were
former emo this is probably my least
favorite outfit out of all of them
because they feel kind of uncomfortable
I just feel like very schoolgirl I
wouldn't say that I'm like ready for it
to be over but it is a lot of effort in
the morning for me anyways I was like
wait to work everyday this because it
took so long I don't think young me
would have had the time at all because I
was like taking AP classes I'm ready to
go back to my normal aesthetic just so I
can not put quite so much effort in but
I do like how confident I this look
makes me today's my last day
right now I'm wearing things that I wear
all the time this like holy t-shirt is
one that I like just bought and forever
showed me one like a few months ago I
don't necessarily wear like all black
all the time or necessarily pair certain
pieces together but they're all there in
my wardrobe just just waiting for me to
to realize my true you mones some random
person today who just saw me in the
hallway told me that I looked fierce
I've never spoken to or seen her in my
life that made me feel good about myself
I'm definitely gonna take elements of
this look and continue to use them in my
legs it's gonna be sad when I have to
come in and look normal tomorrow
I got to live my high school fantasy and
it was in week six I just felt like I
could like take on the world I was more
assertive with people 100% yes I do
recommend it to other people it really
is like a fantasy roleplay where you
just embody this aesthetic in this mood
just based on the sheer amount of people
who talked to me who like never talked
to me I was like oh this is like a
really uniting force that like a lot of
people around my age felt it is like
wearing the costume for a week and it's
fun because then you just get to take it
off after week and it's like you're back
to normal but maybe you learn something
in the process
