streets of Hollywood and I've already
been checked out by like three dudes
driving past it's just like this
craziest thing because they just like
stare and then they stare again and they
stare some more and I'm like what do you
think is gonna happen bro
this week well I go about my day doing
the same things I do every day go to
work go out at night go for drinks take
my girlfriend out on a date but I'm
gonna do that one day
presenting with masculine clothing
masculine language masculine movements
and then the next day I would do all the
same things with feminine clothes and
feminine language and feminine movements
and we're going to see how people treat
me and how I act differently so it's day
one just woke up and really excited
because today all I have to do is take a
shower put on some clothes and ice
button up brush my teeth a little hair
product in and then I'm out the door
gonna talk to some people see what they
think of my look and what they think
that it says about me masculine look
almost ready for the day I've got on a
pair of boxer briefs a pair of pants
I've got on to maximum strength sports
bras on top together which I find gives
a little bit more like room to breathe
in a traditional binder so that's my
kind of everyday look no quick hardly
more than ready walking in to work ready
to
see how people feel about I look but
it's look I have everyday and so I think
that in general it's gonna be the same
old same old if you saw me walking down
the street you don't know me what were
words that you would use to describe me
fashionable I'd probably hit on you
first of all yep
trendy pull this you know what's in
the style and you know it fits you
really well how would you describe what
my romantic partner might look like for
some reason I imagine a romantic partner
looking very similarly to you I'll be a
pretty lady you girl thing would be
literally semadar to see work sharing
office that's how I feel too I don't
know that I would ever make that
assumption obviously every lesbian Dinos
head has a very different type how would
you describe my gender to somebody else
I would say she's a woman a little bit
like kind of tomboy I think I would
probably use the pronouns of that Martha
Coe hit up Hollywood Boulevard
here's a question if you see me walking
down the street and you don't know me
what kind of words would you use to
describe me I would say very special
like she has a good taste
eclectic up-to-date my swag what do you
think they like my job might be brighter
oh no go around be superior so we are an
only would maybe you are in the film
music industry what do you think if I
have a romantic partner like how would
you maybe describe them what do you
think they look like I mean I guess so
picture either a guy or a girl I'll go
ahead and say probably someone a little
bit more like FEM feminine
it's interesting how when I'm like
standing on the corner of a really busy
street I feel really comfortable like
talking all these people talking to all
kinds of different body people and I
feel safe and I feel like in control
even when it's really busy and hectic
and I wonder if I'll feel like that
tomorrow when I'm wearing a dress
it's nighttime so just my dad we're
gonna go out on a date now I've always
open every door every gate every
everything
we
what did you find so much fun no it's
Day two
that means stress that means makeup that
means heels and I'm pretty excited it's
like a different side of me and I'm
looking forward to it but not the like
part where I have to like shake my legs
and put on makeup that's exhausting it
took me I don't know like 40 minutes
I made it everything like even like foot
hair and I know we're not supposed to
talk about flood hair but I'm here to
tell you that it exists and you take all
of that body air away like it looks
different like your body looks different
your skin looks different this is the
hardest part of any Thursday I've
already it up like I'm already
canceling this at all
wrong you don't really need to do all of
this to like be fem or like be feminine
or female you don't need all of this but
I like seeing what my body can do like
how far I can push it in one direction
or the other really tired from all the
time it took me to get ready this
morning and I realized that I forgot to
shave my mustache I feel like I can't
move and all of these clothes and
jewelry and like everything is just like
situated just like perfectly on my body
as such different my name is Christine
okay
today teacher thanks yeah definitely the
vulnerable a spa
yeah I'm not used to seeing you like
this what do you think
what do you think that some words you
used to describe me all right now
professional feminine put together
fashionable I know you have these
clothes you still look like somebody
what do you think my hobbies are what do
I do for like I think you forgot with
the girls a lot the edgy cut leave them
to believe like maybe you might enjoy
like rock climbing sometimes what do you
think my job is I think you look like a
power lawyer I feel like I feel like
your boss what evening may throw nouns
see I would I automatically assumed that
they were they were her what are they I
would just add you know I think that
this person's pronouns are definitely
her yeah and that's why I have such a
hard time when I present master
still you see because when do you not
see the difference you don't see a much
effort than like this person puts in
been at work now for a couple of hours
and I want every single piece of this
outfit off of my body on the other hand
like I do feel like creating we're on
our way right now to go hit Hollywood
Boulevard and see what the people on the
street think and I have to say that I
don't want to do this part
I really don't and this the only but I
don't want to do at all so you just met
me and walking down the street can you
tell me what words you would use to
describe me this sounds beautiful in
general like friendly edgy spectacular
what do you think like maybe like my job
is what do you think I do for work I
think that you maybe some type of like
artists or fashion designer what do you
think that like I probably do for fun
what am i doing on Saturday
I'd say the word clubbing but not the
higher what do you think that my gender
pronouns are he she they them what would
you use for me she died or she it's been
an interesting day
so many onlookers yeah there's been a
lot of people giving me looks I'm not
used to that it's nighttime it's daytime
and I just want to give you the quick
update that I now have eyebrows I feel
like this is a new whole new femme
Christine and I'm really into it
ridiculous I know everyone's drunk in a
bar the like can you not play all around
and like push me into other women it's
impossible like I mean like look at what
I'm wearing like I can't like hole in my
space this was hard on my body it was
hard on my spirit
playing with gender can be really fun
and we should all do it more I think
that's my point is that we should all do
it a lot more because it shouldn't be so
hard for me to try to step between these
very strict rules for what it is to be
male or female or perform masculinity or
femininity I was reminded about how
rigid definitions we have of what female
is of what she her is what male is and
what he him is and how hard you have to
work how hard I work I think to try to
fit in how hard I work to be masculine
show what I feel like is inside of me
and what's in my head in my heart and
how hard it is for people to perform a
femininity that I think gets respect
maybe like in the workplace you know I
had a lot of people talk to me when I
was performing femininity and say you
look powerful you're like a boss like an
executive and I wonder how much of that
had to do with how highly I was dressed
how much effort that I put into my loom
not sure that that is oh that respect is
always awarded to a femininity that
falls out of like The Devil Wears Prada
like we can't all be a woman every day I
think we can do better for people that
express gender on every end middle side
of the spectrum and continuum so that
it's less pressure and we just get to be
the people that we are around like rich
exploding with experience and purpose
people that we are outside of what is
male and what is female</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
