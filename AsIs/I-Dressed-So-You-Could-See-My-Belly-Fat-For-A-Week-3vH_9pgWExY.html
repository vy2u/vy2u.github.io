won't wanna wear after this experiment
this is little belly line is kind of one
of the last taboos when it comes to body
positivity to explain what that is it's
when you can see the outline of my tummy
the entire Spanx industry is designed to
make sure nobody knows you have a tummy
like it's almost like it's okay for it
to be distributed in other ways like
your butt or your boobs but like not
here this is bad
my whole life as a big person I wear a
line dresses because I've been taught
that like that's what you need to do and
so I thought like what if I just dress
in clothes that I think are cute
regardless of whether or not you can see
my tummy it's not like no one knows I
have a tummy it's not a secret it's not
like people think I'm hiding like fruit
snacks under here
I expect to feel really embarrassed I
think I'm gonna learn like just how
ingrained the humiliation behind
admitting the U of a stomach really is
uh I don't want to do
showing people on the internet my
bellybutton
I just finished visible belly line day
one and I posted a picture of this
outfit on Instagram this afternoon and
people were really enthusiastic about it
which was strange because honestly I
felt like an idiot today this week was
really busy week at work for me and it
was really hard to focus so it's day two
and I forgot that I had a video shoot
today so I have to do the video shoot
like this I hate dressing like this
honestly it makes me feel stupid adding
in like an extra element in there like
to worry about kind of really impacted
my brain at least for the first few days
in such a bad mood dressing like this I
need lots of people to say hey you look
great in order to feel like just okay
and like you can't live life like that
depending on other people's compliments
I learned that there are no off limits
fashion trends like you want to try
something just go for it I'm wearing my
first bodycon dress today I don't know
if I can get through this day with my
belly out like this I feel like I'm
literally oversharing I don't know some
things are private and this feels like
something that's private
like even more so than my boobs which
makes no sense because they're both just
big lumps of fat the other thing that I
learned is that I spend so much time in
pictures like doing like a pose I would
do this thing where I would like suck my
stomach in and make it look like you
know my best self it's just so strange
like how I've trained myself to look in
photos like what I know I'm not gonna
want to see it's hard to just like be my
actual body in photos by the end of the
week I actually started running out of
things to wear and I realized that I was
gonna have to wear pants I hate pants so
I went shopping again like yay for pants
I didn't realize how awesome pants are I
didn't worry about like what's going on
in my stomach
honestly who gives a if my fat does
not go in a place that people feel like
it should be in it's my belly and I
you look so it's day six I just kind of
feel like I can like take on the world
in these pants it just kind of seems
like the fear of people being able to
see my belly is a lot worse than people
actually seeing my belly okay it's my
last day and I decided to wear a
variation on an outfit that a lot of
people said was unflattering this is
definitely the tightest pair of pants
I've worn it's the one where my belly is
the most apparent um but I was super
comfortable everyone was like oh cute
shirt and it was like oh yeah you're
right it turns out lots of options are
open to you if you just chill a little
bit
I think visible belly line is just
another curve on your body I've learned
that I like certain clothing silhouettes
that I had no idea I liked like slinky
skirts totally fun like I would never
know that if I hadn't gotten out of my
comfort zone to try it and a few people
came up to me and they were just like
representation lots of people commented
like this is the thing that scares me
but you did it and so that makes it fine
and really that's what this is all about
I think from now on I'm just gonna wear
cool that feels like good and not care
about what people think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
