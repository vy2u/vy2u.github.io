just threw the stick and the marshmallow
into the fire and was like it I
don't want to see that marshmallow ever
again this week I'm going to be
following fashion rules from women's
magazines from the past several decades
I think for like a lot of girls growing
up women's magazines are sort of your
first venture into the world of
womanhood plus-size fashion has come so
far and like the last five years alone
so I feel like in the 7280 it's gonna be
like if you're a little heavier you
should wear a circus tent so for day one
I had to follow some rules from a 1981
Woman's Day magazine so one of the
things they suggested was a chemise
style dress
that's supposed to skim the hips and
hide your problem areas I look like the
woman at an Italian funeral who gets mad
at everybody for not eating well you
think about that bitches you know it's
just ages you you okay you're about to
play an organ at your own funeral
showing this outfit on someone who is a
completely different body type to use
like so useless
it seemed like the idea in the early 80s
was that like if you have figure
problems you should just go into the
witness protection program for my next
outfit I also pick something from the
later 80s so the rule suggested that I
wear something that had like fitted
trousers but like a really loose tunic
that would skim my hips so it wasn't
like a total potato sack this feels huge
on me I look like a gulf pillow case it
was like a black M&amp;amp;M with legs this does
not make your feet look slimmer at all
it's very shall we say tent chic yeah
that's one way to put it it's flowy I
mostly just kind of look like parts of
me are censored like from here down I'm
too hot for TV this was a thumb sideways
for me
I saw in a magazine there was a spread
where on one half I talked about how to
make a problem waste look better and
then on the other half I talked about
how to make a problem tummy look better
and they were two different habits if
you have a problem waist or problem
tummy you probably have both so I
decided to follow the waist flattering
tips on day three I wore a brightly
colored blazer with a belt and slim
trousers all right
it's my 90th outfit I got this little
belted jacket situation here kind of
feel like a newscaster or like I don't
know epi from The Hunger Games I'm like
a casual Friday this is definitely a
distinct improvement from all black
every day I look like if a highlighting
marker went to a business meeting
I mean it's flattering it's just not
your personal style usually yeah it
doesn't look like you're not usually
like color-block yeah I think the first
nineties outfit was pretty good
90s rules were more about drawing
attention to certain parts of my body
and less about making sure that no one
could see my body at all these rules
seem focused on being like well at least
you have boobs so let's play up the
consolation prize
the second 90s outfit kind of made me
feel like I was trying a little bit too
hard sort of trying to draw attention to
one area when I clearly don't want you
to look at the other area this is what
the first life wears in court to make
sure that her husband doesn't get any of
you staged it's just square it's very
box yeah we used to keep it's like I'm
not a textbook I don't need to be
skimmed oh yeah exactly
yes to the code maybe not to the scarf
if you have the coat open and you will
show a little cleavage be really sexy I
look like a doctor like the fanciest
OBGYN office ever so this alko was also
like a thumb sideways so day five was an
outfit from the mid-2000s I wore an
empire waisted top with a pair of
bootcut jeans because according to the
magazine's I saw bootcut jeans are
supposed to balance out your hips
finding a pair of like really flared
bootcut jeans was really hard they're
really not super do right now so people
aren't wearing them I think what we've
learned here is that I don't so much
look smaller as I just kind of look like
Hilary Duff I think this is a really
good way of making sure no one knows you
a feat these feel sort of like what I
used to wear baggy jeans because I
didn't know how to wear clothes that fit
lean back yes fully customizable I've
spent all college thinking that I should
be wearing these things you look like
Reese Witherspoon in speedo man
yeah I look like How to Lose a Guy in 10
pairs of bell-bottoms everyone is kind
of thought I looked dated is that one
with a thumbs down for me I read an
article in Oprah magazine that talks
about how wrap dresses accentuate your
curves and cinch in your waist because
cinching in your waist is cool again got
the v-neck cuz you can't forget about my
two favorite backup dancers boobs I
think you look nice I like it it's
giving me like Angelina Jolie like pop
at the Oscars vibes right now this dress
never fails
I don't think I talked to anyone who
didn't like this dress I think right now
we're very conditioned to feel that like
showing yourself off as good and so you
know this is kind of like how black
looks like in 2017 it's the intersection
of what's cool and what I like about my
body which is these fun little little
curves here if you don't cinch in your
waist you can't see them take that 80s
this outfit is a thumbs up people always
want to feel like they're wearing the
thing that's gonna make them look the
best fashion has such a powerful role to
play and how people view themselves and
it seems so silly to like cut yourself
off from like different outfits because
some dork in a magazine said it was bad
looking your best is about feeling your
best and you can feel your best in
basically anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
