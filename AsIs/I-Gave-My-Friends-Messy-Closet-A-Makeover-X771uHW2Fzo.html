she's got everything but she's like not
sure if she can handle it
she's really fun though I like her is
that you oh it's my closet that doesn't
describe me at all my name is Ashley and
today we're gonna give my coworker Sarah
a total closet makeover basically I'm
gonna kick Sarah out of her apartment
for 24 hours and give her closet a
complete facelift Sarah is a super
awesome boss lady on the move
she lives in New York City she's a video
producer she does UCB improv she's
getting married soon Sarah is really
busy for sure so she needs a closet
that's super functional and pretty
organized at the moment that is not
exactly what she has going on what's the
biggest problem right now oh my god I
mean look at it
I got a giant suitcase that I put there
in another suitcase this is like dog
stuff I think something maybe Christmas
related back there I have a giant prop
bin of stuff that's pretty much trash
that I keep
I guess just in case I go to a costume
party I don't know it's bad I'll put the
pants on and then I'll be like I can
think of a few shirts that would work
for this the first one I find is the one
I'm gonna wear and then usually I'll
pull it out and I'll be wrinkly and then
I'll be like do I really want to iron
this do I have that time if I think I do
I would have to get the ironing board
out which is also in here I'm just gonna
okay these bins were purposeful
purchases for organization this system
isn't working for me so much I'm always
trying to make the pudding away easy but
that usually makes the finding it take
much longer you got to separate items on
I think this is the top all about
creativity I have no idea what's in
these things I've kind of just accepted
that it's gonna be embarrassing at this
point like I'm already showing you this
I'm just accepting it to recap these are
Sarah's biggest issues at the moment she
can't see everything so she doesn't wear
everything it's a big hassle to put
clothes away
she just has too much fit and she also
has a ton of weird props and then we
have what I'm calling the note list it's
just things that are big fat and new
Sarah is not going to commit to them
we're not gonna do that the three things
on the nope list are lids the easier to
put things away the better mystery boxes
labels are a must
lastly mikroorganisation anything too
complicated is it's not gonna fly I
spent a lot of time thinking about these
things and I have a general plan of
attack so this is the basic layout of
the closet a hanging shoe organizer will
both store shoes and be used as a
divider then I'm gonna try and squeeze
in a hamper right here to free up some
space in her bedroom on this top shelf
we'll put things that Sarah doesn't need
everyday like props
bathing suits scarves in these somewhat
hidden areas on the side I'm going to
put things that she doesn't need to see
all the time her ironing board luggage
things like that so now I'm gonna order
a bunch of stuff online I'm giving
myself a budget of $200 which I think
it's pretty fair for a complete closet
facelift but I also have a major
shopping problem so we'll see if I can
keep it under $200 so there you go $200
24 hours a total closet facelift so I
just kicked Sarah out and we're gonna
start the makeover but the first thing
that I'm gonna do is take everything out
of this closet like every last piece of
whatever is in here
you cannot fully utilize your closet if
you can't fully see your closet the next
thing that I'm going to do is organize
it by item type I'm gonna put dresses
with dresses and Church the shirts and
jackets with jackets you should organize
your closet by how you use your closet
so the other thing that I'm gonna do
while I'm sorting by item type is put
them all on matching hangers this is a
little thing that makes a big difference
so all the clothes are pretty much
sorted they're on new hangers we're
looking good but now I have the pleasure
of going through Sarah's mystery bins
okeydoke this box looks like it is full
of mystery there's a lot of duct tape on
it like I can't even open it winter
coats
that's not very mysterious this is a
very sensible thing darn so the mystery
bin was bust but I have a feeling this
lucky of you might have
son wait hey kids fitness they're gonna
have a stylish home for some not so
stylish props but you know everybody's
got their thing
one of my favorite purchases that I made
is this tamper sort of matches the fins
that we have on the top shelf that x87
dryer sheets here and she resists
superman' hamper to freshen things up
even if you don't get very often
this big-ass piece of luggage isn't
perfect place to put seasonal stuff
because it's just wasted space inside of
here if you leave it empty and things
like winter coats you don't reach her
all year long so I snuck in here and
then on the other side of the suitcase I
stuck in other bags so she's got a lot
of big duffel bags I put them in here
one of the big problems with the bins
was they got kind of dirty and this has
this canvas lining in it you can like
snap it and unsnap it so if it doesn't
get dirty you can just throw it in the
wash and then it's like one of the
biggest things that Sarah said was that
she doesn't wear clothes because she
can't see the clothes
well I've organized it so that hopefully
she can see everything but the real
thing that's gonna help her out and stay
organized is this app that I basically
input all of her clothes into I took a
picture of every piece of clothing she
has and basically in this app you can
like make little outfits and you can
schedule outfits and you can make
packing lists and stuff she might think
it's the most ridiculous thing in the
world and she's probably right but I'm
also one of the most ridiculous people
in the world so I did it and I think
it's pretty awesome
you ready yeah the space is big very big
closet yeah yeah but I see that it is
big now that it's not filled with you
know yeah
that'll do it I love the labels just
like my bins before I had no idea what's
in them other really big change that we
made was we made all the hangers match
which is a little thing but I just think
it's nice it's so much it looks really
nice one item on the cheng'er one item
on each oh my god I like this because if
there are no lids and I can easily see
what's there and it seems like it's very
easy to put away yeah so no excuses
that's mature say okay now for the grand
finale hang on there's more there's more
you can pick out the outfit on your
phone and then be like okay I'm positive
this all looks good together so these
are the only items I'm gonna go find in
the closet right now oh my and I don't
have to like take out 50 things and try
them on with them and they're like yeah
wow I didn't even know that that app was
a thing I'm very excited to try that I
give myself like a 95% chance of success
with this that's pretty good what would
you say it was before oh that's what I
had before yes
others like 0% there we go it was
already a mess and I was never gonna fix
it there you go no but I think it's just
a matter of like doing it that one time
sure maybe it won't look like this every
single day but having a system like this
helps you kind of find that happy medium
give a hug yes thank you
oh the padding was bad okay my bad let's
do a hack like this thing now we need to
go working at my own closet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
