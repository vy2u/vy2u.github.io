rate up huh jumping jacks to keep your
heart rate going
hey real jumping jacks there you go
I think the adult world has been hitting
me hard and I feel like I have zero time
for myself I'm just constantly like at
work and then I'm trying to sleep and
then I eat and then I'm at work again by
the end of the weekend I love myself and
I love where I'm at in my life but I
feel like mentally I need some type of
release and I just want to like be in an
okay place no good how are you good my
name is Brynn and I'm a personal trainer
it wasn't until college that I actually
struggle with depression and it
definitely got to me for sure and I
started to gain weight just gradually
finally one day I walked into a gym and
just said hey I need a trainer I need
help and that completely changed my life
so I'm wanting to go on this like 30-day
journey to really motivate myself I'm
ready to want to workout because I want
to feel that stress relief rather than
lose weight on the scale blah blah blah
blah yes I'm over that I am hoping
through this experience I learned how to
talk to myself better I'm a big advocate
of like if you don't want to do it don't
do it I am hoping that I push myself and
that like no matter what I don't stop
have you ever done the Culver Sears no
but I love stairs how about we run the
Culver stairs together I can do that
okay that will be a way will gauge we
can try to beat that time okay cool I'll
see you tomorrow
yes yeah okay it's currently 539 and I'm
packing my lunch
I packed protein Who am I so I'm on my
way to my little session with Bryn
I'm feeling super sore already but I'm
feeling really good about like my body
and like I feel like I've had more like
endorphins and I've been like happier
throughout the day it was my last
workout of the week was my first week of
tracking what I eat I realized I still
need to work on not caring about weight
I think the pressure of me focusing on
the numbers of weight and inches
honestly has been like just ingrained in
me since I was young and like growing up
that's how I measured my success
especially as women we put so much value
into what that number says and like
legitimately here's a newsflash you can
drink two cups of water and you'll gain
a pound on the scale its water your body
needs water and yet we're we beat
ourselves up because the scale has
changed even though now I'm not dropping
a ton of weight I'm feeling so much
better about myself than when I was
dropping weight and doing it very
unhealthily it was really hard today I
think she called it cardio
felt like cardio okay cool so we're
doing an imam every minute at the top of
each minute you have to start with the
exercise so just pick up the speed a
little bit for me like you're sprinting
ready and go ten seconds boom
five four three two I started using
those rope things today I've never used
those before yeah it was really hard
like before it was kind of like oh okay
like let's get through this and today I
felt like it was more like you're done
let's go to the next thing you're done
let's go to the next thing okay let's
make you question your snow
I would be concerned if he smell like
roses here we go it was my last workout
of week two it was tough
today because I focused a lot more on
muscle than like cardio my calorie burn
was like 200 less than normal but like I
have to get in my head that because I
didn't lose as much calories doesn't
mean I wasn't working out as hard it's
our first time here you are not that
excited I know she's not Oh first of all
they did not even tell you that you have
to walk this little trek to get up to
the stairs I have no time goals my goal
is to just start and finish it was not
terrible
16 minutes 55 seconds pretty good it was
tough he did tell we base ourselves and
that we we took a little break every
like yeah chapter you could take a break
every chapter but my goal for the last
time was to just beat that time this is
getting harder and harder and harder
which I'm glad I have a trainer to do
that for me it's nice to be pushed last
night before I went to bed everything I
was like tomorrow you have to work you
have to move and you have to beat your
own asset workouts tomorrow so today I
tried to be quicker on my breaks and to
do things faster we're here God deal
round 2 I just put myself in the mindset
of like I just need to make it up these
stairs in less than 16 55 I'm not
feeling the most positive but um why not
she's come a long way let's be honest
ourselves I've come a long way but I
don't want to do this the first time I
walked the stairs we were doing 10
stairs at a time this time we were
trying 20 stairs at a time and 30 stairs
at a time rather than like giving myself
bigger breaks we took smaller breaks and
we're probably about a third of the way
done and jazz is killing the game
but she's doing it for all almost there
here you can do this
20 more steps four five six the stairs
were hard and mentally in a different
way
secretly I had a goal for you to get it
under 13 minutes I thought you could
beat your time by at least four minutes
and you did you crushed it so the second
time I went up the stairs it was 12 38
good over halfway you got it right to
the top don't stop don't stop
keep it going keep it going oh my god
you did it guys is the bus that was
really cool to see cuz it wasn't just me
pushing you at that point you were
pushing yourself as well so the first
day we worked out we did an assessment
where we did certain physical activities
for 60 seconds and we times how many
Coutu you did 19 squats the first day
and the last time we did it you did 45
squats did you expect that you would
have done as well as you did in 30 days
I remember the first time we did this I
was like so proud of my number and then
the last time we did this I was like
what was i proud of Oh
Leeanne cuke right Oh like that's a
thing yeah I've gotten so much more out
of this experience than I ever would
have thought focusing on like my stress
levels and focusing on taking this time
for myself and how strong I feel
mentally was so much healthier for me
actually I think my favorite jazz quote
was she said why can't we just do things
I like why can we just do naps but you
know go like eat on your shirt
