my hair off I've had long hair
relatively my whole life the shortest
I've ever cut it was like about my
shoulders I feel like I've just been too
scared to do it
my girlfriend Sam is kind of nervous now
you're gonna be an even bigger chick
magnet I think this is gonna be a big
change comfort wise because everyone
says that my hair is my staple piece so
this is my last night with my hair and
it feels really weird and it's kind of
nerve-racking knowing that I'm going to
be cutting all of my hair off tomorrow
because it's super long I don't know I
guess in a sense I'm gonna miss it just
because like it's all I've ever known
but it's also very exciting that I get
to have a new look for the first time in
my life and not have the same look that
I've had for 26 years of my life
tomorrow the big day and we'll see how
it looks and hope for the best and then
you'll see what it looks like my name is
David day I'm a celebrity hairstylist
and hair try colleges today we're taking
Alisa to an amazing hair journey and
that includes chopping it all out on
someone's hair journey when they grow
their hair out it's because they like
consistency but in my hair world and
consistency equals complacency you can't
go back now
I feel like women who go shorter are
actually a lot sexier it's because
they're fearless
so when ELISA is gonna wear this new
style this new self-confidence this new
her she's going to rock it
what are you feeling I'm feeling excited
to see it
okay that's always a good rap yeah yeah
it's definitely gonna be a change but
you know I think this is the change that
you've been waiting for yeah all right
you ready I'm ready
oh my god I always loved seeing that
baby this is crazy you're paving the way
you're paving the way further than
yourself look at the cut is versatile
which is someone like you know during
our journey together I feel like it you
are that kind of versatile girl this is
great this is the new star if I had the
opportunity to do this again I would
absolutely do it again oh my god
holy oh my god there's no hair there is
no hair it's probably one of the most
freeing feelings ever and it's the best
feeling having no hair touch the back of
my neck when I look at myself in the
mirror prior to cutting my hair I feel
like I didn't recognize that person but
now looking in the mirror I feel like I
definitely recognize this person and
this is who I was supposed to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
