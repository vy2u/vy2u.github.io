done and this time I'm gonna go gray so
what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
getting gray braided extensions on my
hair I have never really tried this so I
really don't know what to expect really
I'm just going from a bunch of Pinterest
pictures that I found I think when
people think of gray hair they think of
old people or storm from x-men well I
think her hair was actually white so
maybe not anyways I hope that this looks
good I hope that I don't regret this
wish me luck
okay so my hair is done you guys are
about to see the big reveal
one two three look how long this is this
was a huge change for me like I've never
even had any kind of color in my hair
and so to have like gray it's just like
I feel like storm from x-men I feel like
I could change the weather right now
it's raining today but I could change
that okay I don't feel like the same
person I don't feel like my wardrobe
matches my new hairstyle but
unfortunately I do not have the time or
the money to go on a shopping spree so
I'm gonna look through my wardrobe and
see how it got to where you are today oh
one two one two new hair new hair up new
hair I've got my hair done and I'm
looking so fresh got braids going on
down my chest looking like storm from
the x-men crew I'm gonna go out gonna
get some dudes you can't tell me nothing
I look so fresh you can't tell me
nothing I've got breasts I don't know
what I'm wrap it anymore cuz I don't
wrap but my hair it looks really cool Oh

never seen you with hair like this it

is like long enough to fall into the
toilet like really I like the fact that
there's color in there thank you
violating all Huskies did you do this no
I didn't do this I'm not skilled we know
it makes you look very like sci-fi

I've never seen a style on you but I
would love it it's like Beyonce are you

out of the car and their braids I liked
up to the ground

life great in my hair and I look like
