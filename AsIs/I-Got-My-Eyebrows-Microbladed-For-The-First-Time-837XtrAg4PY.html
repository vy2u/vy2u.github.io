bladed which sounds terrifying a
permanent makeup artist is going to make
little tiny incisions into my eyebrow
area and fill it with ink so that it
looks like I have more hair than I
actually do on my eyebrows right now the
way that I would describe my eyebrows
would just be like little short little
babies but there's hair there but
they're kind of sparse I think an ideal
eyebrow that I would like to have would
be Candice Welsh she works in the
production office here at BuzzFeed
should be a let alone journey to like
love my eyebrow so the better news in
there to be like really warms my heart I
know your friend she has one no makeup
it looks like she's slang because her
eyebrows are so nice I have very high
hopes for today I hope that the end
result is something that I'm really
really satisfied with I don't want to
not feel like myself I just want to feel
like a more enhanced version so let's go
get microboom good hi I'm Angelina
messiness and today I'm going to be
doing micro bleeding on the lovely
Freddie micro bleeding is a technique
where we use a semi-permanent
ink along with a blade and it's applied
into the skin to create a hair strip I
would say over the past year it's been
the biggest trend especially here in Los
Angeles
everyone loves micro bleeding especially
for people that are missing hairs or
have sparse brows are like most of us
from the 90s over tweeze and over wax
some people that could really benefit
from micro blading are cancer patient
people that know that they're going to
go the chemotherapy so a lot of my
clients will get the micro bleeding
before that happens it's the biggest
thing for a full or beautiful grow we
had a consultation about what look I was
going for in terms of my eyebrows I
would love for my eyebrows to be a
little bit thicker and I also want them
to be longer and I'm not sure if you can
extend the length of my eyebrows but I'm
asked at the end of the session I don't
want to not look like myself I kind of
just want it to look like a little bit
more enhanced I will do an outline I'll
show you and if you like it and we could
get started great I sit down in the
chair
gilina wax my eyebrows which is nice
because I hadn't had to wax a long time
then she sits on kind of like this thick
pointment like numbing cream but I feel
less pain when she actually goes in to
do the micro bleeding so with the micro
bleeding it's a little handful to use a
razor that was composed of really really
really tiny needles and it was kind of
crazy looking if you whip this out at
night no one will suffice then she used
a chalk like ten to draw around my
eyebrow sort of in the shape that she
was going to micro blade them in do you
like an arch or do you like it to be
more straight I'm a fan of an arch so it
kind of looked like a blueprint around
my eyebrows take a look hey so they're
not gonna be this thick and it's not
gonna be as bold cuz it's gonna look
like little tiny hairs or anything you
want different but in terms of shape I'm
into it ready I'm so scared okay oh oh
not too bad no at first it didn't feel
bad at all I think the numbing cream
really did help and it kind of just felt
like little baby scrapes going across my
eyebrow
and then she kept going and going and
going and it started to feel a little
raw it didn't hurt that bad but at that
point I was like okay I'm so glad to be
done with this process but I'm really
anxious to see what my eyebrows look
like I came time for the reveal and even
that so I'm finally done the process
took about 15 minute which was way
shorter than what I thought it was gonna
take right now my brows burn but it's at
a pain level of about a 5 so it's not
terrible I'm excited
show me Wow oh this is pure artistry I
see myself and I'm just like what I am
so into it do I ever have to wear makeup
again like what kind of magic sorcery
did she just perform on my face like I
had never seen my eyebrows look so thick
and so was she in a good way I love the
different directions he went in with The
Strokes it looks super super natural
they were way darker than I had
anticipated but over time after they
finished with the healing process they
get lighter and more natural-looking
there's a large crowd back at the office
who know that this is what I've been
doing today so they're gonna be awaiting
my arrival
they're not gonna be this dark they look
really good I really like that everyone
was really really impressed they were
like wow like these look so real they
look so authentic you'll never have to
your browser again yeah I'm not feeling
them in no you'll never have to ever
again it has been so nice not having to
fill in my eyebrows that's usually the
most daunting part of my makeup routine
if you care about your brows and you
actively fill them in every day to give
them a thicker more enhanced look I
would definitely recommend getting some
micro bladed I would do it every year if
I could and I just might now I get to
sleep in 15 minutes longer every morning
because I don't have to fill in my brows
so hello pillow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
