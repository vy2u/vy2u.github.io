on and all day I take about 30 minutes
to about an hour to get ready and with
my daily life I need more time I have a
startup company with my husband and our
days consist about 12 hours of work days
seven days a week so any time that I
could eliminate from fixing my hair or
makeup would help I've been putting
makeup on now for almost 20 years I
started wearing makeup to feel confident
about myself ever since I was young I'd
watched my mom put her makeup on and I'd
watch her transition into this beautiful
woman I wanted to feel that as well one
I'm not wearing makeup
I feel like I'm not employed or not
finished and I just feel more sure of
myself I'm extremely excited to have
permanent makeup on so I can just hit
the ground ready in a minute that I wake
up
I am Michelle the master therapist we
specialize doing semi-permanent makeup
in the salon to the eyebrow we're doing
a micro play we use a micro play to
scratch straws maestro in the epidermal
layer of the skin the eyebrows looks
very natural and lively for the eye
liner and the lip we use the machine to
do it it's different from tattoo because
it's last dip to penetrate in the skin
but can last for three to five years
first Michelle started with my eyebrows
I could fall asleep I feel a thing it
felt like sandpaper or something drawing
on my on my face I was tearing that wall
is just plucking my eyebrows when she
was poking me in the eye for the
eyeliner it felt uncomfortable in the
sense of that felt like something was
dragging along the hairline of my
eyelashes the pain was like somebody
poking you several times in a row
when Michelle was doing my my lips I did
feel my lips starting to swell
almost immediately after I got the
numbing cream put on the pain on the
lips felt like someone's scraping
consistently on your lips I felt every
needle I felt every stroke I felt every
little thing that she did I think it's
as painful as ripping off a band-aid
slowly but I also knew that I was gonna
get the results that I wanted so I
didn't complain I soldiered through it
and I know by tomorrow I'm gonna be a
happy girl I just got done I'm really
excited to see how everything turned out
ah yes oh my eyebrows look fantastic
and the eyeliner he did such a great job
I love it Michelle thank you coming here
and anticipating for all of these things
to be done I was nervous and skeptical
and excited all at the same time and as
I was laying here I was anticipating on
how things were going to turn out and
when Michelle had to be the mirror it
was everything that I hoped it would be
if you're thinking about getting micro
blady and eyebrows down do it if you're
thinking about getting permanent
eyeliner done do it if you're thinking
about getting permanent makeup done I
would do it the results are worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
