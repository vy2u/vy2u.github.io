and I haven't seen my natural hair color
since I was 14 when I got into middle
school my hair was just kind of plain
brown and I decided that I wanted to
stand out I wanted to be different so I
asked my mom to dye my hair and she said
yes I've done blue purple pink green
blonds Silver's it's just a different
way to express yourself that you know
you can change at the drop of a hat if
you're suddenly feeling like you no
longer want to be blonde you can
suddenly have blue hair seeing it back
in its normal color will be really
really strange and different but I feel
like it'll be a cool way to like connect
to middle school so what are we doing
today we're going back to natural what
what is your natural besides that we see
here on the route yeah so these roots
have been a little bit phoned a little
bit played with but my natural is
definitely like a nice like more golden
brownie that I haven't done since really
or haven't seen yours Wow years yeah so
you're in for a treat today
it feels good it feels weird that it's
out of my control I'm just remembering
that like getting your hair dyed
oh that's so crazy section was really
awesome well feel really good it looks
really really natural it's definitely
how I would imagine it to be right now
if I hadn't spent eight years dyeing it
what do you think
your family I think they'll like it I
think they'll be pleasantly surprised
looks a lot like my mom's hair color so
I think she'll maybe we'll think we're
twins okay so it's like a very unique oh
that's so pretty
thing oh my god she styled like now that
just my eyebrows so I just got home I'm
gonna go inside I'm gonna go see what
parents think it's so looks cute for the
first time in a long time it's pretty
it's been about a week since I've had
the natural hair color I really really
like it
I see it in the mirror and I just think
like oh it looks so natural and so just
so mean I don't think I'm gonna be
dyeing it for a little while if I do
it'll it'll be down the road a little
bit
so as you may have noticed boldly is now
as its new but don't worry you'll still
get all the awesome continues to but
