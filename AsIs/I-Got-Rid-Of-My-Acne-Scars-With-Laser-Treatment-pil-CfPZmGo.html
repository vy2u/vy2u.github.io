lasered off and I'm really nervous
I developed acne around puberty like 13
or 14 all of these dots here are fairly
smooth
none of them are raised I'm tired of
taking pictures and having that be all I
see
I've tried topicals meds derma rolling
heals facials vitamin C and other serums
and kinda just coming to terms with the
fact that it might just take some
serious laser action to completely get
rid of these I would be freed from an
insecurity that would follow me for the
rest of my life otherwise sweetheart
what can I do for you I have these acne
scars Laser typing my last robe and the
scars showed up what four five six years
ago or longer yeah right around then so
you see what I'm looking for is some of
these scars are what we call stretchable
or distensible some of them are you see
on this side it's a little bit worse and
it's mostly red it's mostly a little bit
of pitted and there's very little brown
discoloration it's most mostly
inflammatory we're gonna use something
called an infrared laser it's a laser
that heats the skin about 20 sheets of
paper deep into the skin we're gonna
draw your blood because we're gonna use
your platelet-rich fibrin which is
protein from your own blood to sort of
apply topically to try to get the
healing process better and then after
the laser there's a little tiny fine
golden micro needling instrument that we
use to dispense the platelet-rich fibrin
now what you need to know is when you're
fixing scars it's much more than one
treatment it's not like the treatment
today a week later when you're healed
you're flawless no yeah it's it's baby
steps so let's draw the blood and then
while that's spinning we can do the
laser okay let's activate it it's my
blood
i'm super-nervous I'm about to get
lasered you just gently close your eyes
hanging in there now this part of the
treatment is almost done done all set
but is it still hurting so that was the
laser part of it that little gelatin
middle part separates it and it's the
yellow stuff that we care about
you see that ass leaving a fine film of
this liquid honestly didn't think of it
like that but now that I am absolutely
but you see it's a little bit pink and
puffy and over the next two to four
weeks the degree of scarring will
diminish maybe 5% 10% maybe 20% and then
maybe at one to two to three month
intervals this is repeated amazing
alright my face is very tight I cried a
little bit hopefully in a couple weeks I
see at least a little bit of difference
because this still sort of feels like my
only hope so I guess I let my own blood
things soak into my face from 24 hours
and then that home treatment begins I'm
still a little puffy and very red I
guess that'll be a couple weeks until I
see any change I'm really glad that I
got my acne lasered because it is
already looking lighter and I'm
interested to see how to look in a
couple more weeks when it's really
really healed but he talked to me a lot
about my active acne and how we can work
on getting rid of that I honestly feel
instilled with a new hope that I can
have better skin than I have how're my
acne scars looking too
really quite remarkable I have never
seen it look as smooth
I mean it's been years I'm really
grateful that I did get the lasers so my
acne scars cuz it 100% has made a
difference I feel like my skin just
looks a little healthier I haven't worn
makeup in like a week and a half where
the laser is painful yes they were
uncomfortable but I would 100% do it
again but I don't feel quite so
desperate anymore to get them all to
just disappear if and when the day comes
that I really want to go all in do all
the lasers and get these completely
wiped off of my face that laser does
work and there is an option for me but
in the meantime I'm okay just having
some some dots and scars on my face no
one is perfect and I feel beautiful so
as you may have noticed boldly is now as
is but don't worry you'll still get all
the awesome content you used to but just
even more new great stuff click here to
