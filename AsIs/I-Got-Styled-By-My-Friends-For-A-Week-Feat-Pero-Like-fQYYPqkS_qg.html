and I think everyone watching this video
is gonna thank me for putting you in a
bra here you're welcome America
I'm Sheila and this week I'm gonna get
stabbed by our Latino Channel Beto like
I love the federal like team I think
they're so fun they have a lot of spunk
and they're very vibrant and confident
and I want to be able to exude that
throughout this week this week we are
styling Sheila helping her go outside of
her comfort zone fashion wise Sheila's
known for wearing a giant shirt and
leggings sweaters and leggings t-shirts
and leggings she looks like she won't
work out every five minutes today the
leggings a homegirl I'm really curious
to see what they're gonna put me in
especially gaudy L the one thing I do
not want to wear is a bra or anything
that shows my stomach she definitely
doesn't mean improvement I think it's
just to make her explore some more
fashion options I feel like they're
really gonna push me out of my comfort
zone and really make me try things I
would never try before that's the better
like team they're fun they're bold and I
really am excited to just immerse myself
in my Latin roots well she better be
ready so this is the outfit Curley chose
for me we recently shot a video on petal
like where we put her in five different
looks to look like the cleanest Tejano
music I feel looks amazing so I wanted
to see how she would look in outfits
where she could just kind of go out into
the world and carry that same selena s5
I was super nervous because I was
literally in a bra and a leather jacket
girl way people are treating me so chip
we know you like I'm your assistant a
lot of people really loved Curly's
outfit they were all like girl you
working it lots of like positive
feedback would I wear this work most
definitely not I could see a Selena but
you're just wearing a bra underneath I
know I was worried about running into HR
the whole time because it was like is
this too much for work like is this okay
I haven't really looked amazing I loved
her outfit I thought she looks really
dope her legs looks beautiful in
those boots maybe I didn't pick the most
appropriate outfit but I am really happy
that she did try something new by the
end of the day I felt way more confident
in it and I really kind of just embraced
the Selena vibes that curly was sending
me my style I would say is very like
gender neutral set ready casual chic
it's a little déjà boots I'm like oh
this is exact
guys that were they'll wear one colored
t-shirt and black pants forever until
they die and I was like why can't I do
that it's like you could lead a meeting
but you can have a beer after work the
first day I tried on Claudia's outfit I
got a lot of reactions of people just
thinking I was a boss you just casually
you walk in and I'm like oh yes she was
leaving this game you walk like a
detective or some give me a piece
of that cake
she says my cake I feel in charge with
this outfit
Claudia's challenge for me was to not
carry a purse so I only carried my
credit card and my driver's license in
my back pocket I don't have to carry a
purse all day which is nice and
everything fits in my pocket I kind of
mimicked her personality of being very
strong and confident woman I don't know
if it was just like how put together it
was but I felt like I was just getting
 done I made like a choice - kind of
like streamline my outfits on I want to
give that power to Sheila is like you
can look good with like four simple
items and like worry about other
and minimizing the stuff in your life is
really helpful and kind of declutter
your mind which I understand why Claudia
is so on top of their now probably
can't dance as good as JLo but I feel
like her right now usually my style is
sexy meet tomboy I'm gonna also
incorporate something that I love which
is gold it exudes like confidence or the
feel feel royal feel golden I just like
that in my room he just started laughing
at me and she's like where are you going
you know so worried baggy jeans and I
wore a black bodysuit it was very like
Miami
you look like you're not supposed to be
at work keeps this feel I can a concept
it was super cute I loved what she
looked like
it kind of reminded me of me cuz I walk
into work and Julia's wearing the exact
same outfit as me so we were 20 into the
max she's very confident and proud and I
really try to channel her personality so
Julie says prepping me for this test my
challenge for Sheila was to be
flirtatious I think I got somebody
Sheena two key points she has to he'll
say it looks good asking what are his
plans for the weekend ready
she knows extremely nervous to put
herself out there and flirt it was a
little uncomfortable so I had to take a
minute but I went in and I delivered I
don't know if I delivered well I'm going
to transfer to a party downtown tonight
with having julissa by my side guiding
me being like girl you can do this you
know it wasn't as hard as I thought it
was did she do my type of flirting no
but she did good we gave her a little
bit of oomph in the latina Department
and she slayed Bali Mahone Valley today
I'm wearing my eyes outfit and I feel
very brunch ready
the only thing missing is a glass of
mimosa to go along with this outfit she
loved being a Latina
she loves Elena just as much as me so I
want to put that latina fierce Celina
aspect on her cute flowy but shows a
little bit of belly a little bit of skin
it's a little astounding along
you must be like some special day two
days a week day look at you think that
my gives good shape and and good like
exposure like look at that leg I would
describe my style as latina a quirky
geeky boho chic I feel like he just
walked out of Hawaii look like a Disney
Princess but like a summery Disney
Princess I feel like I channeled Maya's
energy which is super vibrant and fun I
love it I think it's very Selena I was
like boom she looks really good because
I mean so Maya's challenge for me was to
try to do the washing machine so she
taught me a little thing or two and it
was fun I don't know if I mastered it
but I mean at least I tried and it was
just fun to kind of like dance around I
was super happy to see she look it out
of her comfort zone and where some thing
that had a little skin exposed in the
mid-drift for day 5 the grand finale he
wanted me to wear a black dress and
heels in the middle of the day I'd like
to see caudillo wear heels down
Hollywood Boulevard I think that should
be my reward Stila was like daddy are
you gonna stop me on my oh I
panicked because I never saw the woman I
definitely felt very glamorous and very
dressed up I had like a nice necklace
that went along with it
so I felt like I was ready to go to a
ball she showed a little bit more skin
she had like this startling like a
little bit more almost Selena you is
that sheila was that Selena either way
Beedie Beedie Bom Bom guess who I found
America yes when I first saw Sheela
walking in a dress I was like Yolo esta
mujer es la Luz de Esperanza and not
just carita I was like you know what we
should drink a little bit Veneto a
little bit of cheese I got Dominican
cheese in my house
I forgot the wine in my house you forgot
the wine that's the one thing I asked
for
I felt very pretty throughout the day I
felt like a princess maybe that's what
he wanted all along
now y'all wants you to wear a gown
walked out night with everyone
I think you're like famous I want her to
walk out in the street and address in
the middle of the day people need to see
this beauty I feel like I'm walking with
a celebrity right now just keep staring
there she was uncomfortable and I was
enjoying it
you know what people got to break out of
the comfort zone and embrace their
beauty I definitely wear the dress again
but I'd save it for like a nice evening
out rather than going to work in it
it was such a cool experience to try to
delve into different people's styles by
the end of it I was missing my leggings
and my baggy shirt I'll definitely take
pieces of their styles and incorporate
it in my own I really enjoyed the
federal like team and it was cool to
kind of bring my lucky and a side out
style is what you make it no matter what
you wear just wear it with confidence
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
