called me up unease I need a stylist
right now I just recently got styled by
my friends at pedo like and had so much
fun getting out of my comfort zone that
now I'm gonna see what's trending and
get styled by some teams my name is
Terry I'm Lexie
hi I'm Nam and today I'm gonna be
styling Sheila I'm curious to see like
who the team's look up to nowadays
rihanna always in forever Sidney and
Devin Carlson they you're the founder of
wildflower cases I'm obsessed with their
style Hayley Williams from Paramore just
because she has this really awesome
androgynous style so I know the teens
are really into high-waisted jeans and
crop tops other nineties trends are
really coming back so a lot of people
are wearing crop tops like I really like
to wear like high-waisted pants always
I'm really excited to put Sheila and
those kind of clothes today I don't
really like showing my mid-drift often
and especially curious to see what
challenges they have for me because I
just don't know what teens do nowadays I
think it's gonna be lit who knows I
might be coming out looking like Kylie
Jenner by the end of this
I would love to put Sheila in a floral
kind of boxy jacket cuz I think that'd
be really cool to show those masculine
and feminine sides and I think she'd
really rock it I don't know what you'd
call this style but I feel like it's
very grandma chic but I'm kind of into
it cuz I'm into grandma's that might
have came off a little creepy it's cute
I think it's super comfortable and baggy
I like it oh there's even a pocket I'm
ready
it looks so good I'm living for this
look huh am i pulling it off absolutely
it's like everything I imagined and more
looks like something a grandma aware but
like that's in my grandma's like the
thing that was really cool to try
because I feel like I would definitely
pass over that outfit in Urban
Outfitters and not look twice at it it
ended up being one of my favorite outfit
keys you're doing something right
whatever gets you out of leggings I'm
happy maybe you should wear this jacket
work it work it
wow it looks good on men too I don't
know why models do that like they
looking as on set a plane
one challenge I want to give Sheila is
for her to take photos because I feel
like it's all about social media and how
you show off your style on Instagram
what advice would you give me while
doing this photo shoot to rock
everything with confidence like even if
you feel like not quite yourself yet
because it's a new style when you
correct me throughout the shoe and
l'absolu yeah
people seem to really like it I feel
like by the end of the day I kind of
made it my own and I feel very
fashionable in this I'm just gonna blend
in with the shrubs I'm gonna put Sheila
in an outfit that I have in mind
high-waisted with like a checkerboard
like crop top type thing I think my
outfit is gonna look the best I think
that a fun challenge for Sheila to do to
hone into her teens is to go
rollerskating cuz she would have tons of
look at you I love it of course you put
me in a checkered crop top you made this
outfit I did this shirt was really ugly
before so I just like cut it anyway it
was really hard to go rollerskating in
the sweat pants she gave me because they
went all the way down to my toes so I
was struggling down the roller rink
a water for friends made their own
outfits and I was like when I was in
high school I didn't have time to even
do my homework let alone these girls are
just crafting up outfits to wear now
we've become really good friends yeah
we're gonna hang out this entire day see
people like looking your way
style is a little edgier side I really
into fish nuts right now occasionally I
do like to kind of explore the
intersection between femininity and edgy
I'm really excited to see how that looks
on Sheila I don't know what I'm trying
to be right now I feel like I'm rocker
on the top and then it's like I'm going
fishing sexy like I mean this is like
yeah it's like a concert or I just woke
up
all right Chloe what do you think of
this outfit I actually really really
like it I think with this t-shirt dress
thing like yeah did you look so cool
like you pull it off especially with the
fishnets because he like gives us fine
you know you like the fish yeah I don't
think I've ever worn fishnets in my life
cool challenge for Sheila would be to go
to karaoke and do a crazy air guitar
solo while all of her friends watch her
video tape it would be a lot of fun so
I'm walking to Barney's Beanery where
I'm gonna do karaoke I'm gonna show
Natalie my outfit what do you think I
don't go to karaoke because you're a
good singer you just go cause you know
you're giving a claw here's all about
little points
I know I feel like the crowd was into it
yeah for the most re-election is
everything yes when I went to karaoke I
was super nervous because I had to like
sing in front of everyone and singing
makes me very vulnerable but I feel like
with that outfit I was meant to do the
air guitar and I didn't give the care I
was just having fun
nobody's out shake it up beans have died
oh I felt like each outfit I tapped into
a different personality in the beginning
when I first saw their outfits I was
like mmm maybe not on me but then I
tried it on I was like okay they know
what they're doing I'm all for prints
now like I was just a solid black tea
gal and I'm like okay I'm into those
floral prints I'm into those chequered
stuff fishnets I think I might hold off
on that getting to be styled by them and
going through these challenges I felt
like I do have time to have fun I do
have time to like go rollerskating
or go to karaoke I don't know I have fun
I'm like okay can I be a teenager every
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
