Ellen and suit and white suits hahahaha
very wedding vibes yeah it is a little
Ellen now
hey I'm Nikki and this is my fiancee
Kelsey we're getting married this year
and we can't wait to make this perfect
day our it's wedding season and this
week we're talking about suits because
my fiance and I are both female
identified one of the first questions I
get is are you wearing a dress oh I'm
not just because I have a vagina doesn't
I have to wear a big poofy white dress
on my wedding day I've personally never
felt comfortable in dresses they're also
like a lot of stigmas around same-sex
relationships of like well who's the man
well neither of us is the man but yes I
will be wearing a suit I want to feel
comfortable in how I'm expressing my
gender and sometimes that looks like
suits and sometimes that looks like
heels and sometimes it looks like
whatever the box I want it to look like
it's non-traditional but there's a lot
about me that's non-traditional I'm
gonna be working with Tony and Leon from
sharp seating we're gonna help me find
my ideal wedding suit and I'm really
excited because the canvas is kind of
blank for this congratulations on your
engagement are you excited yes I'm
pumped what all are we gonna do today we
are going to take your measurements fit
some jackets just to check some colors
and size fits so tell me a little bit
more about your wedding the ceremony's
gonna be an outdoor reception is like an
inside on the billion type of space so a
lot of natural decor a lot of neutral
colors
finding suits for women can be hard
lately there have been a lot more women
in Hollywood and red carpets rocking the
heck out of suits
I think Janelle Monae looks great in
suits if I can look anything like her I
think we've done a good job in terms of
design and color what did you have in my
clean cut slim fit really sharp and
really good I look hot those aren't very
descriptive they're elegant and classic
yes yeah that guy Tony and lianas went
over everything like what details are we
looking for what's the style we're going
after they also helped design the suit
to match the venue and what Kelsey was
wearing which I still don't know we're
gonna actually ask you to leave so we
can talk to her a little bit about her
wedding dress
my fiance will be wearing a dress
because that's what she would like to
wear strapless sweetheart neckline
sparkly champagne bodice and tulle Avery
skirt so I'm just thinking elegant
and glasses that's the theme of your
wedding do you want her suit to be aged
color or one of the wedding colors
whatever she's comfortable in of course
if she's come from like a lime green
then about it right it was so cool
to be able to break down all of the
details and make something that was
perfect for this occasion and for me and
for this style and for our relationship
in terms a laser fitted feminine cut for
the pants higher rise I used to kind of
accentuate your hips how do you feel
about that shove all of it in there okay
so we're gonna a lot a bunch of fabrics
and trims and see what looks great on
you
how many options
[Laughter]
thanks white it does have a wedding vibe
it is a little Ellen though Ellen looks
great you're not Ellen you don't need to
be Ellen
it's very Harry Potter is let's try on a
black one so then you get the effect of
how that would look now we've got the
full lapel in black satin compared to
the other one this one has a higher peak
that's what's called a peak lapel so we
like this idea in the sunlight is there
gonna be more of like a contrast between
satin and natural suit yeah it's a
little hard to see here I like the
difference between this app and the suit
the nice thing about the wedding being
indoors and outdoors is the suit might
look different when you go outdoors
catches sunlight this is pretty much the
look yeah and just a little sign
attribute that we have a lot of our
clients will get the double as a sign of
equality and it's kind of become a sharp
signature so your entire design we have
a classic black tuxedo with black satin
accents or your peak lapel and wear your
pants I wasted feminine cut with a high
satin black contrast waistband and a
very slender tapered look on the bottom
it's gonna really complement what
Kelsey's gonna be wearing and you guys
are gonna be classic together very
gorgeous couple beautiful we'll come
back in a few weeks they carry many
stylistic alterations
there's been a few weeks and the suits
ready so I'm gonna put it on for the
first time today and hopefully it fits
not will do some alterations I'm worried
about the pants I like it but I think it
needs to be let out a little bit more
straight I've got monster cab and then
we need to bacon hips how do you like
the fit of the jacket the jacket fits
perfectly I look slim yes I'm so excited
this is great the suits done the
alterations have been made I get to try
it on today pumped this is it this is
what I'm gonna look like on my wedding
day oh my god I hope it's great I want
people to look at photos and be like wow
here's the thing weddings are like 50%
making everyone else happy and 50%
looking as hot as you possibly can let's
go try it on
Nicki are you ready that's exactly why
it's very fitted but how does it feel in
terms of movement jacket is super
comfortable it fits really well in the
shoulders which is usually difficult for
me I love the high waisted pants I've
like never been this decked out before
you look better and I predicted oh my
god I love this this is like made for
you yeah fits perfectly and I feel so
good and I look so nice
that's like what you're supposed to feel
when you get married right my friend
yeah let's do it
I'm sorry
it honestly not only suits your body but
it also is your personality which is
very strong and professional and fierce
serious but it's still you this is like
Tesla stupid but like dream come true I
didn't have like a wedding dress moment
but like this is that for me it's better
than I could've imagined that is the
next time you see me in the B on the
wedding day when I decided I wasn't
wearing a dress I knew I was kind of
giving up on that like say yes to the
dress moment it looks such a plate up
moment for women and I kind of thought
that I would pass up on that which I was
fine with but I ended up having it with
my friends and with Tony and Leon yeah
she's gonna be like look at my life I
almost want you to be my wife I want you
to be look at this Oh
it's so nice I'm so excited I'm so glad
you guys are gonna be there this process
was really amazing I really like how I
look at my service the three things that
I learned from this experience one have
people who can help you figure out how
to match what you're wearing to not only
your partner but also the venue and the
style and the overall theme of your
wedding too
this is your wedding you deserve to wear
whatever makes you feel the best so find
what works for you and run with it
three ultimately the most important
thing is that you're sharing this moment
with people that you love and who love
you and at the end of the day that's
really all that matters I'm getting
married in like a month
at least I will look great doing it when
I'm 80 years old someone somewhere will
be looking at these photos and they'll
be like wow that saggy old lady used to
be this that's all I want
next on wedding season wow I'm like a
different person
oh your eyebrows oh my god what have I
done your hair is one thirsty bitch no
you're the Virgin Mary Johnny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
