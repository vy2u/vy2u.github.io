on in the background but I guess there's
gonna be some music over this but you
should find a track that goes to it cuz
it's the beat alright because perfect
today I am going to be interviewing Tyra
Banks Tyra Banks has been a voice for me
ever since I can remember
she started America's Next Top Model
giving a chance for literally anybody to
make it in the industry I always thought
was very like selfless of her that's a
big reason on why I started feed famous
and I considered it like the social
media version of America's Next Top
Model but being yourself and I'm just
putting yourself out there ok I need to
get ready ok so I decided to wear all
black I got a whole crew of bad bitches
coming with me I'm here with my badass
bitch
Bethenny's the Lord how do you feel
about meeting your idol because you know
they say never do it I know
hi I'm jasmine and I'm about to be
interviewing Tyra thanks oh girl I got
you thank you for being here
you're 100% my idol oh thank you yes I
often look upon myself and I'm like man
how did I get to even like making videos
when you were younger did you think you
were gonna be this like boss as when I
was younger I wanted to direct and write
and produce TV okay so I'm doing part of
that but all that supermodel stuff and
then like being the modeling guru and to
being my own businesswoman I had no idea
that's something that evolves yeah so
like if you have some drinks that you
don't have all of them and don't know
it's okay yeah because things happen and
you're like oh my god I want to be a
singer and then you realize that you
really can't sing that good Tyra and you
need to think of something else
America's Next Top Model has really
leaned into like making yourself a brand
and now the modeling industry is getting
into that do you have any tips or
anything about like establishing your
brand there's two categories of creating
like a personal brand and I teach
personal branding at Stanford Business
School Oh some give you a low thumbs up
but one is like what is true to you yes
what feels the most natural that
authenticity is so important that people
can smell it a mile away when it's not
real
the other bucket is differentiation yes
this presentation innovation sometimes
what's true to you is also true to a
whole bunch of people now what is the
icing on that cake that you can add to
it to stand out and be different people
feel like they're best friends with you
I literally go through my older sister
and that has a lot to do with you being
personable how do you feel about having
your personality be such a huge part of
your brand when I had a talk show that
was my real personality and then there's
this created one from America's Next Top
Model that is so not me but it's like a
character oh and it's like you know not
fierce and you I have two photos in my
hands or one vote on my hand that's the
thing that I created but I do think that
when people are coming up to me and they
feel like they know me and not like oh
my god tire it's like oh I think they're
connecting to more of the warmer side
does that other girl she's scaring
someone how do you deal with negative
criticism it's important to not put too
much of your heart and your soul and
your vulnerability into your personal
brand and they are commenting on some
content that you said or but not your
spirit and your being that's crazy good
advice that I've never actually thought
how do you find confidence on a day when
you're not feeling so good and do you do
anything like any little things for
yourself yeah there's a couple things I
do I mean I have friends that I call I
call my mama and then sometimes you say
you gonna cry you sure you're not gonna
cry okay also I've been doing all those
like meditation at have you I just
started meditating oh that's so good I'm
like let me eat green let me meditate
breathe something that I want to thank
you for is one being just like a bold
woman of color you always change your
looks which I know sometimes can be
really really hard even with your
hairstyles like we've seen pixie Tyra
we've seen Bob Tyra we've seen natural
Tyra
you like right sorry did you like like
Dukey brave long ones or like cornrows
okay I see I love my cornrows with the
baby curve uh-huh and look back just
like a ballerina slipper that's fun to
me is like the most elegant thing for
sure how do you feel about the shift in
body positivity that's coming into the
modeling industry right now what we're
taking huge strides on social media how
do you feel about this as a model I was
about 20 pounds heavier than the other
models so back then that was like oh she
did right and that was like
groundbreaking like look at her walking
down the Victoria Secret one way but my
passion is for body and Beauty
positivity from the first season of
America's Next Top Model it was diverse
yeah you know I had my girl and
all shades in different types of beauty
so it's nice to see the world catching
up to what we were doing 18 years ago
you've literally done everything runways
talk shows hosting and now you've
decided to write a book Yeah right here
perfect is boring with your mother
correct yes I will love it why did you
decide to write a book my mom and I
decided to write this book because we
have a relationship that is raw and real
in Lund filter I asked my mama anything
when I was a kid drug stuff alcohol
stuff sex stuff yeah he didn't blush she
would be like oh you want to know here
we go there we go
this book is dedicated to the Mamas and
the daughters we need to be real with
our daughters and daughters need to be
safe enough with their moms to be like
mom I think I'm gonna have sex yeah
that's what this book I'm talking about
it and like taking back the taboo and
it's really funny but it's really raw
and there's also stuff about being a spa
stuff about dating a crazy boyfriend's
I've had that's really about the lesson
and the message and you can pre-order it
now you don't have so i'm also hosting
something for BuzzFeed called feed
famous it's very inspired by America's
Next Top Model
it's like with social media modeling
competition and I am a little nervous to
be eliminating people and going through
casting you host America's Next Top
Model
and America's Got Talent how do you
stomp our people after you so early days
of America's Next Top Model what I used
to do is and it was crazy I would go to
her hotel room girl hold her hands to
talk to her give her advice and then I
had my team at top model they were like
you do this but then the next day you're
like this yeah like hey girls today I'm
gonna do a photo shoot like I was
exhausted and they're like the girls are
gonna be okay we have a team that talks
to them after you cannot do this it's
not sustainable yeah even in that
rejection there can still be a lot of
success well I appreciate you so much
welcome good luck thank good luck with
the show and your jazz you did an
amazing thing yeah I was just like you
know what you guys will just talk to her
just like air chill everything she said
was just so sweet and genuine she was
one of those idols that it's okay to me
yes yes just being around the presence
of such a boss was absolutely insane I
got to sit next to her and literally
meet my idol
she blew my mind away I need to read
more and I'm gonna start with reading
Tyra's book because it seems an amazing
meeting Tyra Banks it was the most
amazing thing of my life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
