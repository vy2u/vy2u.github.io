polycystic ovarian syndrome.
It's a very common hormonal disorder,
in fact one in ten women probably have it
in the United States.
- For this past month,
I've been working out
every single day.
And the devil is trying to test me.
This has been such a journey.
- It's all about education,
it's all about learning what it is
and how to improve your
overall quality of life.
(comforting music)
- The hallmarks of the disease are
irregular periods and elevated
levels of testosterone
that can manifest in one of two ways.
Either you have symptoms, so
you have the hair and acne.
- So about a year and a
half ago, I had noticed
that I wasn't getting my
period every single month.
At first I though it was my birth control
so I kind of went off of
it, still wasn't getting it
and so I thought it was stress,
because I was graduating from college,
I was getting ready to move to L.A.,
when everything kind of settled down,
I still wasn't getting it.
I went to the doctor one day
and was just getting a normal check-up,
and she had noticed that
I had hair on my chin,
and she said, &quot;Oh you probably PCOS.&quot;
So for the next month,
I'm going to be meeting
women's health specialists,
other women who have PCOS,
and a doctor who specializes
it in women's health,
and pretty much doing 360 on my lifestyle.
Is it treatable? Is it curable?
- It's not curable per say.
You can do things to treat it,
in terms of just actually you
doing stuff with your body.
- I read that you kind
of reversed your PCOS
with holistic practices.
- I was able to reverse my
diagnosis in about four months,
through focusing on
digestion and building blood.
Since we're only doing a
month-long kind of trial,
you set-up a special program for me.
What does that consist of?
- So your program's gonna
consist of a supplement routine
so you're gonna have detox to cleanse
the kidney, liver, bowel.
You're gonna have a Candida cleanse,
we're gonna do it with
the apple cider vinegar.
Then you're gonna go into
foods to eat, foods to avoid,
so some of those foods are
gonna be carbonated drinks,
processed foods-
- [Nyla] Damn (laughs)
- [Programmer] Alcohol,
high levels of caffeine.
- My heart is like breaking (laughs)
It's my last night of drinking before
I start my health plan tomorrow.
We got some wine, we have some food,
let the shenanigans begin.
- Why don't we go ahead and
do that ultrasound right now
and so I can actually show you
what the ovaries look like.
- Automatically assumed that ultrasounds,
you know, you have the jelly petroleum,
and then you have the little machine
and it goes around your
uterus and your belly
and then boom, but knowing
that there's something
that actually goes inside of you
to see things that are
happening on the inside,
that's crazy to me and I
didn't know that was a thing.
- You're gonna feel a
little bit of pressure.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Women with PCOS , they have
tons of these little follicles
they're all really small, I
don't see a dominant follicle,
it looks like you're gonna ovulate.
And they're all kinda
just ringing the outside.
Your ovaries have the classic appearance
of someone with PCOS.
- When I met with Dr. Bendikson,
it was extremely overwhelming.
All of these things that I
didn't really know about PCOS,
and it was a little scary,
I was just kinda like,
&quot;Oh, God.&quot;
And then getting a vaginal ultrasound
and seeing my cysts and my ovaries
and then learning that I have fibroid,
that was the validation that
this is really life for me now.
- The diagnosis is truly the crossroads.
Because then you are able to say,
&quot;Do I want to treat this naturally?
Or do I want to treat the symptoms
and go with what the
doctor wants to give me.&quot;
- I can only go to specific
people who take my insurance,
or else it's gonna cost an arm and a leg.
I ended up going to one
who's close to my job.
Told him, &quot;Oh, I was recently
diagnosed with PCOS.&quot;
He walked outside, took out
some generic-ass birth control,
then was like, &quot;Take
this and you'll be fine
and watch what you eat.&quot;
It was so frustrating.
I'm already like scared,
you have these symptoms
and then they're telling you,
&quot;Oh, like it can cause
diabetes and uterine cancer.&quot;
And I walked out of that doctor's office
feeling so defeated.
- It took me five doctors
to get answers about this.
Don't settle for one answer,
figure it out for yourself
if you have to.
- It was important for me
to meet with other women
who have PCOS because I
have a great support circle,
I have a great support group,
but nobody else has PCOS.
They say it takes a
village to raise a child,
and I think coming into
this and just realizing
and being diagnosed
with it, that I have it,
I feel like a child and I felt like
I needed my village to raise me.
So I'm gonna make my
apple cider vinegar drink.
That's awful, but you know what,
it's gonna make me feel better.
(scoffs)
- It can't really be something
that you just follow to
lose the twenty pounds
that you've gained with it.
It has to be for the rest of your life
and that's intimidating.
- There's certain things that when I eat,
I know that's my body kinda
imbalanced immediately.
Like sugar for instance.
- So we're waiting for the shuttle
and the devil is trying to test me.
They smell so chocolaty and good.
I learned the first week that your mind
has control over a lot of things.
And so I kept telling
myself, this is good for me,
this is healthy, I'm gonna get used to it.
Anytime I craved something,
I would just drink water.
Do you recommend any
specific physical activities.
- Yeah, I don't recommend
high-intensity workouts.
Walking for an hour a day
is really, really good.
- I've been working out every single day,
and one of the beauties behind it,
is that I get to experience new places.
Right now we're hiking in
Solstice Canyon in Malibu.
I don't know if I've lost weight,
that's not really my goal.
My goal is to just feel good.
So we get lunch on Mondays and Wednesdays
and we had pizza.
Hey, can't eat that.
Luckily though, they had salad.
So I ended up just taking,
like, a bunch of cucumbers.
This is literally what
my fridge consists of.
Kale, brussels sprouts, some
type of salad stuff, carrots,
eggs, avocados, ground turkey, look at me.
Sweet potatoes at first were kind of
just like another food for me.
And then by week three it was like,
&quot;Oh, I'm gonna treat myself
and have a sweet potato.&quot;
And like, all my friends would be like,
that's not treating yourself,
a glass of wine is treating yourself.
So we have some cauliflower
with drizzled olive oil, salt,
then we have all the ingredients
to create the hummus.
These things ended up becoming, like,
treats for myself, eventually
because my body was
getting used to the idea
of feeding like all of
these good proteins.
It's actually not that bad. Mhmm.
You wanna walk through
life with the confidence
that you are the HBIC,
head bitch in charge,
until something happens with your body
and you're like, &quot;Oh I
have to do a complete 360.&quot;
And so you do, and then
you're kind of like,
&quot;I'm gonna cheat since my body thinks
that it can control me.&quot;
And then it reminds you, &quot;Actually, no.
You're just walking through
this thing called life, for me.&quot;
So I ended up drinking.
I don't have a hangover,
but I do feel crappy
and it made me realize
how much I don't miss
like the aftermath of drinking.
So I came home a little
early from work today
because I'm feeling super, super crappy.
My stomach hurts, I have a headache,
but I'm thinking that maybe
I'm gonna get my period soon.
- I came to realize that
a lot of the reason why
we're not actually getting
our period is because
we don't have the nutrients in our body
based in not eating properly
or supplementing properly
to produce enough blood
to actually have our body
be able be like, &quot;Okay, I'm
gonna give you your period.&quot;
- I got my period!
I thought like, &quot;Oh, when I
do get my period eventually
hopefully, A, it'll be regular,
and B, hopefully I won't be upset.&quot;
But I was actually like, very happy.
Because I didn't get my period last month
or the month before that.
I thought that I would have
to go on all these, like,
pills and medications and stuff.
You know, all I'm really doing
is taking my birth control,
working out and eating healthy.
Every week I've had to do and
apple cider vinegar face mask.
Your face is gonna smell
like apple cider vinegar
so I suggest doing this before a shower,
lay back flat on the ground
with your feet elevated,
for ten minutes, bye.
And this is what your face
is supposed to look like,
Cleopatra, maybe not so much
but I do look like a ray of sunshine.
People are snap chatting
me and they're like,
what are you using, your skin
is so clear all of a sudden,
and I'm like, I'm using Nicole
Granato's essential oils,
healthy eating, minding my business,
working out and drinking just water.
That's it.
- So as soon as I found out about PCOS,
I went into Facebook and I typed it in
and some of them have upwards
of like 60,000 members,
so you're constantly hearing
other people's stories,
you're hearing symptoms that they have,
so you can go in there and say,
&quot;Okay this is what I'm
experiencing right now,
is this normal, is anyone
else going through this,
is this a part of the condition?&quot;
And within minutes you'll
have 30 comments of
what it is or what it isn't.
It's almost like there's
not enough resources for us
so we're making our own altogether.
- Oh my God, can you add me.
(both laugh)
- I look at what I've been through
and I look at my story and I think,
it's for a purpose, it's
to help somebody else.
And to let them know, you're not alone.
- This has been such a journey
and it's been so exhausting.
And the entire time, I
felt like I was so alone
to talk to these women
who not only gave me hope,
were so realistic about their symptoms,
and then invited me to these safe spaces
where thousands and thousands
of other women have PCOS,
gave me so much hope and
it was so liberating.
And it felt like, a weight was
lifted off of my shoulders.
- If you're having symptoms
like acne or hair growth,
don't just assume that it's you.
If you have irregular periods,
don't assume that that's normal.
Those are things you should be talking to
your gynecologist about
because those things,
they may or may not be related to PCOS,
but it's possible, and if
they are, they're treatable.
If I could have a conversation with myself
before I was diagnosed.
I would tell myself to listen
to my body a lot earlier.
I would tell myself that, you know,
when my body says that
something is going on
that's drastically because
I'm not getting my periods every month,
I'm gaining excessive
weight in such sort time.
To go to a doctor and then
if I walk out of that doctor's
office feeling defeated
because I feel like they
didn't give me the answers,
don't stop going to doctors
until you find the answer.
