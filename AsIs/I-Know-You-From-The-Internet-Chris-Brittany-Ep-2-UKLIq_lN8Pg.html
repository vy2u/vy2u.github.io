also has like a little toy in it so you
can heat this out signe are commercially
available I think it's your body
language that's to unwelcoming damn
karate background contra laughs adorn
welcome to pose hey you want to play pin
the tail on Britney's next girlfriend
and or emotional fling that will result
in the quarter life crisis okay spin it
beep beep beep beep beep you can't touch
it it just is where it lands beef babe
she's cute
write this down on my list of app ideas
pilots familiar as hell oh my god
that's that student so what I get my
Instagram crush the woman of my world
wide web dreams who she can launch my
app and make that follower mana I'm
saying that death follow one man and it
says it's a thing
Britney the weirdest thing is happening
to me seriously dude what you're gonna
you're gonna do this thing where you
interrupt my thing for your thing what
no um all right why don't you go talk to
her yeah okay I only have like three
options what's the first I approach her
calm who like I say something like hey I
recognize you from Instagram and you're
really cute okay sounds harmless
yeah what's not
she'll freak out she'll call me a sad
sick stalker percent or drink in my face
natural leave and block me I'll regret
ever being so direct and forward spend
my entire life not taking risks okay um
what's the second option I delete my
account immediately so that there's no
trace of me ever having a social media
presence I approach her calm cool like
is that a motorcycle mine you know what
that's just sick motorcycle is super
dangerous so if anything happened to you
I don't know what I would do
Oh Chris let's see but for the purpose
of this fantasy could you suspend your
disbelief yeah thanks
hey so we hit it off having drinks
someone takes a picture of us and she's
like oh but I say I can't tag myself
because I'm not mention poke witness
protection program yeah offshore banking
we'll get into that later um so then her
protector quality comes out and she
makes us relocate to a secluded cabin
somewhere in Montana then I can't see my
friends and family and we actually grow
to resent each other and then she
eventually gets mauled by a bear it's
actually quite sad what's going on right
now okay Chris talk about your thing
okay look this is weird these girls are
looking at me and it's like they're
attractive and this does not happen to
me and it's like I'm not into it
okay this isn't what are you doing what
what are you doing what what is going on
food I'm here for you and I'm here to do
business
yeah it's cause you're not looking for
it yeah what easy your goal was to stop
caring about girls and once you stop
caring that's when they finally were
interested in you wanna even I know that
the fastest way to my heart's treat me
like why do you think I have the
exes that I do cuz no girl is just gonna
stick around because you're obsessed
with her alright now focus
okay what's up in three okay this is my
favorite one it's the long game
I leave the bar now calm cool like to
hatch my plan using all the data and
information that Instagram has given us
according to all of our TV tease
pictures that she uses are all from when
she studied abroad in Spain so I take
three months immerse myself in the
culture become fluent in the language
also she likes tiny dogs I adopt a tiny
dog that's about a year and a half old
getting accustomed to me so it loves me
like a mother this is insane
but brilliant how will you meet her
that's easy if you look in the back of
her is selfies do you'll see that
there's a dusty acoustic guitar in the
corner see that which always says one
thing on tap attention to become a
musician exactly I'm gonna learn how to
play the guitar like Carlos Santana and
or Taylor Swift on a physician myself at
open mics all around where she lives
which presumably is Silverlake she'll
see me and she'll just have to introduce
herself love at first sight believe that
hipster coffee shop start our blissful
relationship together she'll fall in
love with me at places she's geotagged
yourself in five years from today we'll
be married until your maid of honor
speech I'll be maid of honor
yeah first of all thank you second of
all I want to know more what else is my
life like um you married a WNBA player
didn't work out and then you have a son
that reminds you too much of your
grandfather so WNBA player yeah um let
me finish so we're at the wedding I
feeling this
higher story you're super drunk she
storms out of the reception hall and
just assumes that our relationship was
built entirely upon a lie and once I
finally catch up to her she'll turn out
and say are you pretty 27 ash sorry are
you are you Brit 27 ash huh sorry I know
that's really forward I don't really
know how to approach somebody that I
recognize off the internet yeah
sorry yeah how how would you know how to
do that mm-hmm
um I love your Instagram which sounds
dumb is that dumb I think your comments
are really funny is that weird to say I
they are sorry um stink Megan or Jesse
stink nugget you could fix that whole
thing if there's an app to told you if I
already know people you know like Shazam
she doesn't even follow me yet Shazam
for people huh yeah I could see that
it's a good one yeah he'd see that I
still think the NAP app is the best no
it's a bad one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
