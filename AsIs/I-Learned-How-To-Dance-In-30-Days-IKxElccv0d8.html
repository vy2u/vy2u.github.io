be sexy you guys probably know me as the
awkward girl on the sue pilot I have
always felt super comfortable playing
that character I think it's really funny
to fall and to make weird faces and to
like not know how to flirt with people
but in my real life that awkwardness has
kind of translated into who i actually
am i think a lot of people are asking me
why dance in order to feel sexy because
i think there's a lot of other things
that you can do to feel sexy but to me
the most confident that people ever are
are when they're just on a dance floor
feeling themselves and like looking
awesome and i have never felt that way
about my body i went through puberty
early i was taller than everyone else
i wasn't very good at being feminine I
would hunch a lot and I just didn't feel
comfortable being myself I basically
categorized myself as the type of girl
who is smart and not the type of girl
who is beautiful or sexy the rules of
this video is that I'm gonna dance I'm
gonna do it in 30 days and I am going to
do it in front of my entire office when
I got the idea to dance I knew that I
needed a dance instructor and I called
Kyle hot egami and I called I mean I
slid into his DMS kyle is an amazing
choreographer he works on YouTube he has
videos that have over a hundred million
views he's worked with JLo he's worked
on ABC he's worked with Dancing with the
Stars he's literally been all over the
place and I wanted someone who could
really teach me how to dance well once I
had convinced Kyle to do the video with
me he recruited his three coolest ladies
hailey Emma and Ashley to come help me
learn how to dance and they kind of
became my dance mom kind of the first
thing that happened after I agreed to do
this I've called the Kyle and said I
don't know what to wear dancing and he
was like oh just like loose dance
clothes I had no idea what that meant
for the first class that I had to do
Kyle made me do an industry class which
is just with people who only have talent
agents I showed up in a pink hoodie to a
professional dance class where I had
never danced before and every
was wearing black Kyle wanted to throw
me in with the sharks so I started at
the very top and quickly went to the
Super Bowl you did awesome for first
class I was going to advanced calculus
before learning how to add yeah so I
mean we'll start at the top and we'll
back things up and make sure that you
have a solid foundation to build upon
here we go 30 more days 30 more days
it's gonna be awesome
after that class I realize I have no
dance clothes or dance shoes like what
do I need and he was like one thing that
they should company something that
doesn't show sweat parks
you're gonna want speakers and then for
girls it's always important at heels
what I have not owned a pair of heels
for like 4 years and he was shocked Kyle
and Hailey all went to the mall to get
me a pair of heels and dance heels have
to be very specific they have to have
structure around the ankle so that
you're not wobbling all over the place
and I am probably the one of the most
naturally clumsy people you'll ever meet
they had me like walk around and do a
little twirl
that was the first moment that I really
felt vulnerable and was really scared of
what was to come and then came day one
boot camp dance camp so we're just
walking across the floor all we're gonna
be doing is walking across the floor
walking translates to every single style
of dance so just walk to the beat while
walking to the beat seven eight walk one
no it's not the beat
I thought when I came in here that we
would just start doing choreography but
I'm realizing we have to do kind of the
base of it all and that's actually the
stuff that I feel the most
self-conscious about Wow
oh my god okay something I realized in
that class is I don't make eye contact
with anyone and I'm an actor I'm gonna
stand at the other side I want you to
make eye contact with me the whole time
and wah but the walking I felt like
confident doing across the eye contact
really helps and then the second I had
to keep adding stuff it's that like
mental freeze that happens again now
what I want you to do is I want you to
give me a walk walk and a triple step
and a walk walk and a triple step well
after your triple step I want you to
give me a snap open so I want you right
left and a right left and snap now I
want to try and have a turn but turn
we're going right left and right left
now right it left and a right left now
yep and then no I can't believe how many
body rolls we did today just
body roll after body roll that is the
move that makes me the most
uncomfortable because it's the most like
sexual and supposed to be the most fluid
and that's what I don't feel good at now
you're gonna take your right hand you're
gonna bring it down your body good don't
be afraid to touch yourself it's your
body that's like my body okay step back
on your left face this way and body roll
there was a really cool moment in that
class where Kyle realized that I was
like super freaking out and getting in
my head he was like you know what let's
just turn on some music I'm gonna show
you a game that we play with everyone
called I think it's like blocks or
something like that
I call it grooves so basically we start
with a groove and then we tell you how
to modify it Haley would kind of start
dancing to the beat and then he would
say okay now do it with your eyes closed
and then he would say now do it with
your face up and it gets more and more
ridiculous and you start having fun and
it's just about feeling the music and it
has nothing to do with all the other
stuff and a wink on everyone five six
seven eight and wait good that made me
feel a lot better at the end of that
that I was just like oh I just have to
have fun that's what this is gonna be
about today was about seeing where she
is and she has a ways to go I want her
to figure out what sexy is for her like
it's not the same definition for
everybody so I just wanted to be
confident cuz she's such a sweet
girl it's breaks my heart when people
don't have the confidence to just do
what they want to do if I was gonna do a
routine performance at the end of 30
days for all of my colleagues I was
gonna have to find a routine and we were
gonna have to start learning it fast so
we looked for all these songs and
finally one day when it was just me and
Kyle we found this Jojo song from like
2015 called high heels as soon as the
drum hit he was like this is the sexy
song I thought I was gonna be doing like
a hip hop dance routine and then Kyle
drags his chair into the middle of the
dance floor and is like you're gonna do
this song in heels and it's gonna be
like Flashdance style after the first
class Kyle said that I needed some more
basic work and one of the best things to
do for that is ballet so I took a ballet
class with Melissa Sandvik who is a
professional dancer who was on So You
Think You Can Dance and ballet was so
hard okay so we're gonna start with the
basics the main thing about ballet is
your posture you stretch your legs all
the way and stand as tall as possible
and finding correct alignment all the
way down oh and the most flattering
lines and shapes on your body there you
go nice what that was the most about
we're guy I've ever gotten it's all
about making your body beautiful and
your lines beautiful and that was
actually hard for me because I was
already thinking that okay we're going
down the whole sexy path they're
confident path and now we were in a
ballet class where it's all about grace
and elegance and being beautiful and boy
am i none of those things then it was
just hitting the routine time every day
I would go in and just work with Kyle
and Emma for an hour learning a part of
the routine and I had to do things
hundreds of times my knees in the first
week were purple because I had to do
salat of floor work and every time I
would get on the floor my knees would
have to hit the floor super hard and I
don't know how dancers do what they do
to their body every
to me is hurting today like my shoulders
hurt my knees are killing me
that like weird little kick that we were
doing really like hurt the back of my
knee and then today we're supposed to do
the whole thing with heels so I'm like
one part of me is really excited because
I'm having so much fun learning this
stuff that I didn't think that I could
do and the other part of me is like I
don't have any energy today the first
day walking in heels I was like walking
like a t-rex you're walking with bad
knees and beat you out like this my life
started to feel like a rocky montage
which is really cool to watch in a video
but is a pain in the ass in real life
and every day I would have liked a
little triumph where I was like yes I
nailed this move and then Kyle would
teach a new move and I would just look
at him like I cannot do this I can't do
this and then I would go into my entire
mental game again I feel like I got
worse and I think part of that is that
I'm now just in my head about it and the
moves aren't new anymore and the novelty
has worn off and now I'm just worried
about like all these pictures and
hitting the right moves and it's
starting to get in my head which is when
it looks the worse and I have to wear
heels now which is just not a
comfortable thing for me
style had kept teasing me saying that
there was gonna be a special celebrity
guest who's gonna come in and help us
and I had no idea who it was and for
weeks everyone around me had kind of
been mentioning and almost let it slip
who it was alrights I have the very
amazing one of my very good
julianne hough what the I love her
energy and I love her presents and how
like bubbly she is but she is one of the
best dancers in the industry
girls kicking butt I hear I feel like
I'm on Dancing with the Stars damn let's
see what you got all right you can see
that ready here we go I performed the
worst I've ever performed in my life for
her I completely lost all intention I
completely freaked out and I was just
trying not to mess up the moves and I
was so bad obviously you've got like
this part down yeah and then from here
down yeah something's missing right here
yeah the boobs so what I feel like
you're doing you're just picking up your
leg and you're walking but I want you to
feel my back for a second huh she had me
feel her back and feel exactly how much
of dancing is moving your whole body and
your back so that your core is guiding
you it really made a huge difference yes
yes yes did you see that your whole body
was moving it wasn't just your limbs
moving one thing that Julianne kept
saying and Kyle was that I needed to be
in this character and feel comfortable
feeling my body so something I did was I
went home I played music and I just
danced so I thought that I would just
come home tonight I just danced a little
bit for fun too my favorite songs and
just do some body rolls just move around
do all the things that make me feel
uncomfortable and just really get into
it and move my shoulders and and just
try and feel sexier which is a weird
thing to say because it's something I
never ever think about or tried to
purposely do and then this magical
moment happened where I started to feel
really happy and I stopped caring about
why or how and there was no routine and
then I would look in the mirror and I'm
like I look good I look sexy this is
crazy
I think it was a turning point for me
emotionally to just dance by myself for
no one else with no routine and feel
sexy
all right so we just finished with
Ashley she's doing good like I'm
actually really impressed they think
that she's growing and I think that
she's pushing herself like now when
there's something she can't do she's
like no let's keep it and I'll figure it
out which is she's correcting herself
right she still has like a little
awkwardness to her but uh I think that's
what makes her great then it was about a
week out and I got sick this is the
weekend for the performance I was
supposed to meet with MN Kyle this
morning to do performance but I'm just -
my body's like exhausted so I'm gonna
spend the day kind of just watching old
footage and trying to see what I did
wrong and what I can do better and
hopefully I will be better for this week
I'm so impressed like I want to cry
because she's doing so well starting
from that first rehearsal good lord
when she couldn't kick ball change she
couldn't walk she didn't own heels let
alone walk in them and now she's doing a
full dance routine in heels and she
looks amazing like it's I'm so happy
like I'm so happy the thing that I love
most about watching her do is just
movement in general she uses her whole
body now you can tell she's enjoying it
because before she's getting so
frustrated at everything and now she
just really feels comfortable with
herself like those head whips that she
does and she's like smiling and it just
makes me so happy I've been working with
Ashley now for this whole month today we
took a video at the beginning of the
rehearsal and she watched herself back
on video and watching herself do the
floor moves and the walks with her hands
and her hair like she looks so confident
on camera and it almost was like she
didn't think it was her and she didn't
think she could do that at the beginning
of this process so today's my first day
dancing with Ashley and if they hadn't
told me that she was going through his
process and this transformation I would
have never known it really looks like
she has taken a couple of classes in
heal
and she's kicking but you showed a I
woke up this morning like an hour and a
half before my alarm so just panicking
I'm wearing a body suit my whole like
back is exposed I'm really proud of
myself I'm really excited I can't
believe that that like committed to this
I think just seeing me in heels will be
shocking for like most of the office
once it gets to like floor work I think
people are not gonna know what to do
with themselves
I want Kyle to like be crying a little
that's really like who I feel like has
seen this whole entire thing I just want
to feel like such a badass when the song
ends and the light cue hit I want to be
like I killed that and left
everything on the floor Oh getting loud
I like it when it gets loud I think the
moment came the lights dimmed the smoke
turned on and the first beat hit can I
just did it
these pictures of these bitches
on my
me again
I know I messed up but I didn't feel
like it cuz it was like I I just feel
like I did it I can't believe I did it
was so good Oh like you were so like
let's go to class and performance was
awesome it was really cool to have all
my co-workers there and to actually had
done it out of sheer will and my body
wasn't a joke and I had fun and I had
the best time the coolest thing about
this whole experience is that the
version of me that was sexy at the end
was me all along
it was just me being confident with who
I am my favorite part is when she
slammed the floor with her her couch
sorry I couldn't think of a nicer way to
say it was great it really shook me to
my couch so I think we all just sort of
universally couch doubt there I don't
know if that's the right word I should
do let's go couch couch is okay
