hi I'm Salam i'm anthony anthony and i
yadda-yadda-yadda we went on a date it
was really cool we went on a second date
where Anthony turned me into a vampire
Anthony's really stylish you guys we've
always got like kind of this cool
smoldery eyeliner look so I want a
vampire makeover do you know what most
of these things are yeah we got some
shadows some liners and lipst oh you
want to start with the lips actually he
told me to bring some Kat Von D I'm
pretty sure she's a vampire
her husband is Mixon you do let's watch
us watch it to know it looks like let's
watch it so this is what he thinks is
coral and then this is blood red so
we're going for the darker red it looks
like I want gold that's how I'm talking
about I don't really do eyeshadow very
often close your eyes I feel like this
is that moment and all the vampire
movies where the girl and she's like
okay I'll close my eyes and then she
gets attacked it's all over from there
I'm wondering if we should make both
eyes match yeah I think we should start
do something different than I said do
you wear mascara no are you do I try you
have to look up get to look up okay then
open your mouth we should put some
jewelry on you too after oh damn I'm not
a jewelry person oh dear this point will
probably take a sharpie marker to my
eyebrows if you could I wanna be dark
okay well she'll go way too dark I'm
gonna look crazy unless we're going for
we're gonna bring out our inner
craziness I don't want to the outside go
your eye down a little bit I haven't
done bottom eyeliner since like I listen
to Fall Out Boy nice be an emo band what
was the name of the band
nobody zero that's really
you know want to do a little bit of
shine on the cheeks I'm all messy so I
think we're done okay wait a minute this
is pretty cool actually I would actually
like make my face like this for like a
concert we'll see once once you put this
and everything James it sets it all off
but I actually like it do you want to go
see what my friends think that's good
let's do it it's not his accent he's
lying it's like well duh it looks like a
high-fashion makeup like runway I like
it I like the golden lip not out of
place at like a ritual you bring it a
makeup it's great brilliant oh you
didn't the whole Wow
oh your makeup I think is really nice is
that your boyfriend
no should be like interrupting your
moment oh my good deed are you guys
seeing each other with you Oh cute
together no it's complicated guys don't
it's hard when you have Ted you know so
Anthony did my makeup and it seems like
everyone liked it yeah I actually really
liked it I'm glad that we did this now
we got to go find a vampire event to go
to do I have to bring my teeth I should
probably go home I got my teeth you
don't use it okay to my bathroom goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
