sexy kindergartner I would say hi
everyone I'm Ashley Perez I mainly do
scripted content on busty violet and
it's pretty embarrassing stuff it's like
me falling on the ground or being
ungraceful but recently I've been doing
some unscripted videos that are about
body positivity and self-improvement but
the last piece of the puzzle that I feel
like I don't have is style
I have no swag whatsoever I have humor
and intelligence and I can talk about
politics but when it comes to a
confidence and style I got none of it I
really wear only four colors I wear grey
denim black white and then any variety
of stripes as you can see I've gotten
into a place where I'm afraid to make
any big bold leaps so that's why I
really want to challenge myself to go
outside of my comfort zone I chose
fringe as for this challenge because
they are the two boldest ladies in my
life they wear whatever they want
whenever they want my job this week is
going to be wearing exactly the outfit
that Freddie and jazz picked out for me
and then I'm going to have to Instagram
the outfit without posting anything
about the challenge so that people don't
know that that's what I'm doing this for
so Ashley's style how would you describe
my style kind of casual sometimes sporty
kids sister
wholesome California team is the best
way to describe I feel like she values
comfortability I think though that in
her mind comfortable equals very safe
yes and not taking risks Ashley has
focused so much on everything else but
her clothing that we're not even
supposed to see her clothing so what
we've done is we shopped for five
outfits for Ashley she gave us
permission to go wild I want her to look
like kind of like edgy in a street way
I'm excited to put her in a bunch of
hats and some fun prints we're gonna
 this something like that needs
to happen I'm into that I am like very
drawn to these yeah that never
okay let's do it whoo we could not put
her and though she would not know what
to do I mean both of them yeah even if
the clothes that we put in ribs she
doesn't feel herself in I want her to be
confident and empowered by just being
her I am ready and willing to give
myself over to you and I'm really
excited and also really - I think you're
gonna be really surprised in a good way
by the outfit the outfits paid with
sabab it's gonna be great for what the
bob we're gonna you gonna yeah we're
gonna give you a bob we didn't agree
with that yeah no yeah okay bye what
yeah we weren't kidding Ashley's getting
a bob and this is her actual your
stylist al hey guys so tell me what you
were thinking I know I guess did you
have in your mind I want a blood cut I
want to be fashionable and just like
therapist and we want to take it back -
OH
oh my god I really like this is even
better than I imagined it looking it's
just like everything put together the
color plus the blunt cut and then plus
your cute little face it all looks so
good oh my gosh it's gonna up every
outfit thank you
day one they're getting ready to dress
me yeah Ashley will be sporting neon
yellow short an oversized zip up
sweatshirt tube socks converse at a
backwards hat
all right so Freddy and Jess have
dressed me for the first time it's
definitely different than me I've
already gotten some responses of like oh
well fit I think younger me would have
put this outfit together but at some
point I just started feeling like this
isn't how people dress and I shouldn't
dress like that so I think I'm gonna get
a lot of interesting looks today but I I
feel okay honestly after doing the
haircut last night that felt so much
like a transformation that I can't even
imagine anything more scary than that so
bring on the clothes rocket power
yes yeah it looks so good energy a
cheese stick like you literally look
like a child look amazing I like that
really yeah and and pretty good so look
my debit spread each value I like it was
in bad news
I don't like Grameen it's very important
to have a hype man
with you when you Instagram I would
always get really clammed up if nobody
was saying anything when someone would
give me specific directions like chin
down or look this way or make this space
it helped a lot the spots where people
usually put their hands are like glasses
part of this challenge that I have to
Instagram every day and just be okay
with myself and know that I'm not gonna
be perfect at it the first time and and
not comments anything funny I thought
that they were gonna dress me completely
differently than I did I thought they
were gonna have heels or big platforms
they were buying me converse day two so
day two was big oversized plaid pants
and then this shirt that was
asymmetrical and then Oh yellow beret
and I'm not gonna lie when they brought
out the beret I was a little bit like oh
my oh my god okay - okay
be prepared for a lot of people that say
you look French a beret is fashion at
the look like I always fringe I can't
believe I'm wearing this but the
billiard was pranking that's kind of
like
slumber party and on the bottom French
baseball player I could see you without
the bird but the Braves a lot I have
been in my new outfit for a couple of
hours now
I think the Piraeus is throwing people
off and I don't mind the Brahe I feel
like it's part of this experiment I'm
gonna take the Brea for a little bit and
see if I get a different reaction to the
outfit and if people like it more or
less what are you doing what is this I
like everything individually but I've
never seen you dressed like this so it's
just like who is this person thinking
about this outfit so it's been a day and
a half of actually just trying a little
bit of a new style we're proud of Ashley
but we're pissed we definitely want
authentic reactions from people but we
feel like people aren't being
open-minded she ended up taking off the
yellow grass that's literally the only
thing people were commenting on you're
like almost kind of like making fun yeah
we don't want this to steer her away
from wanting to take risks to work you
know the Rays are cool yeah duh moral of
the story is we're making her put the
braid back on the way back I cannot
believe you weren't wearing the hat
before the Hat makes the difference the
Hat makes a huge difference it's like
the accent piece it really like ties the
whole thing together it's like a focal
point
it feels complete now do like the Hat I
love it looks really good
oh that was probably my favorite
outfit it just looked really cool I did
feel like a 90s cartoon character but in
a really cool way today we're gonna post
a candid I know what if you want to wear
a hat wear hats oh my god but you're
still gonna dress me that's this dress
day three was this giant oversized denim
dress with a hood and then a beanie on
and people made so many Steve's to zoo
aquatic life
jokes at me I knew I knew Steve's the
zoo I think I agree with that because
it's like you like you see you're kind
of like effortlessly so we just got a
gram we found a really cool weird
location though with weird light yeah I
don't know if it's cuz I haven't had as
much energy all day I've just kind of
been like sitting at my desk yeah it was
harder for me to like get the energy to
do the picture
baby was fun cuz we went out in that
outfit and although it's not what I
would think of normally is it going out
outfit we went to this like Club and
they play like old throwback music I
felt like Julia Stiles and Save the Last
Dance in that and he had the most fun
and we can't spill to in the morning and
I was completely sweaty and gross
you still look fabulous dude I feel like
the outfit made me feel differently
Hollywood yes I don't dance at all and I
really over for half the night you were
dancing a lot in well look great folk
get luck the break so this is we won't
be with me actually so we're gonna show
her how to get it done before I wore
this adidas track pants and checkered
fans that was a super comfy day it was
hilarious because I was just walking
around San Diego making my parents take
pictures and footage of me okay then you
have to do some instagrams of me but you
have to take lots of photos okay okay my
parents are now just so used to me
working opposed to me that they're not
even that bothered by it they were like
this is a different look for you
whoo day 5 was this giant oversized
checkered shirt dress thing with
fishnets and a cat purse
a truly felt like I was a six year old
dressing myself but in the best way like
a really cool six year old okay this is
the final day outfit what would you guys
call this I would call this look 90s
skater chic
yes I really do feel like a different
person you look great thank you okay
let's go do this okay the black and
white with the pop of yellow
and also the fishnet stockings you just
look really amazing I feel like you
should be a part of spice world we did
it we did it you did you did it yes
first of all I'm surprised that you even
let us give you a bob yeah I'm a very
part the bob was the first thing that we
did and there was truly no going back
from there I was surprised that you were
so just like down you were like what is
it all right putting it on like you know
you didn't really ever question you were
just in it and I loved how and it you
were and it shows you dedication and how
committed you are to just like
developing and growing and trying to
think that I think this really did push
you into just like a new side of Ashley
and I'm really really proud my
perception of you changed like I knew
you personally of being like very
confident in your thoughts and you
writing and seeing you be confident in
different clothing was just like that
little like star moment where I was like
I think the most interesting thing about
this experience is it feels like I have
made a deep emotional change even though
everything that I did was superficial on
the outside and I think that's because
putting yourself in a different shell
physically can change how you feel on
the inside
thanks guys no more surprise haircuts
the last ending of a vlog with Jay guys
being like I know the Bob now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
