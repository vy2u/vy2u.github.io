and right now I'm a man in transition
after graduating college in May of 2013
and moving across the country to search
out new work opportunities in a new city
my car was broken into during my road
trip and my most important valuables
were stolen but perhaps what Sun the
most was my laptop full of all my
resumes and professional portfolios that
I used to get work with no real way to
prove my worth to employers finding work
was proving to be well challenging
despite my circumstances life continued
and the bills and rent kept coming I was
burnt out exhausted and depression was
taking over like you would not believe
undoubtedly my childhood experiences
spent growing up in foster care and in
various children's homes prepared me
well for navigating through tough
circumstances one night I had this idea
I made a list of my monthly expenses and
what I thought to be quote necessary
spending food gas cell phone bill car
insurance and saving for the future
that's it I removed everything from my
car and I studied the space this is my
best option to get ahead I decided I was
gonna live out of my car
jokingly I called it Hotel Prius but the
name stuck it was challenging at first
but the truth is you just get used to it
having the mobility to go anywhere means
I can keep my options open to say yes to
opportunities as they present themselves
what's that a job in the Northeast on my
way you never know what could happen but
with Hotel Prius I stay ready while on
the road I get asked a ton of questions
the biggest where do I shower gyms no
matter where I go I can usually find a
gym from 10:00
to $25 a month plus I can workout use
the Wi-Fi and if I'm lucky use the pool
okay so where do you park anywhere I
want just as long as I stay within the
local laws it only took one trespassing
ticket for me to learn my lesson okay
maybe three but honestly when people see
a lone Prius in the parking lot no one
thinks hey I wonder if someone's
sleeping in there because come on it's a
Prius what fits in my car I have a soft
bed I have a closet blackout curtains a
desk kitchen table and chair a pantry a
bike a laundry basket travel kit for
emergencies I even mounted a solar panel
for harnessing free electricity during
the day and charging my phone at night I
also have a bathroom as you count the
nearby tree okay so what do you do for
work I help open restaurants essentially
I'm a glorified server and server
trainer it's in no way consistent or
stable but it keeps me busy keeps me fed
and allows me the mobility and money to
keep traveling my depression has
disappeared and life has provided me
with the kind of challenges I just love
to work out and solve life feels real
and organic and best of all simple what
started as a one-month experiment to get
ahead and catch up on life after a turn
for the worse turned into over a year of
so much more than I could've ever hoped
or imagined this is that adventure
thanks for reading yes Priscilla Hotel
Prius
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
