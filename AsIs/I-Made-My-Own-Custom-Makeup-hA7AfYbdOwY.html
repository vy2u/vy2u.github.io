gonna make a full face and nails a
custom makeup I am so excited to try
custom makeup because hello who does not
want their own custom blush foundation
concealer lip gloss lip pencil nail
polish this is truly my dream
hi I'm GL up a blocky of GL accustomed
blend cosmetics and this is one of our
New York City locations where we custom
blend all cosmetics on the spot from BB
cream foundation mineral powder blush
cheek pins mail polish skin care
everything made up for you the cool
thing about custom makeup actually is
that you know every single ingredient
that goes into it because you're
watching it literally I made in front of
you custom blend has really become the
new standard people have so many
allergies and it's really important that
we can choose the right ingredients that
go into their cosmetics today we're
going to do a full face of custom blend
for Chrissy and we're going to start
with foundation finding foundation isn't
very fun for me because I'm just like
really pale all the time and very dry I
would recommend a foundation in a cream
formula that would be really hydrating
for her skin and we could add soy or
shea butter to it she has this like
beautiful shelf of like colorful jars
she just literally went through it and
was like this powder and this powder she
looked at me and said of me like oh you
have a blue undertone I have no idea how
she knew that and I still don't know but
it's some sort of magic that only she
has
now I'm gonna add a little bit of high
def tour minimizing gonna add some soy
butter
she had the tube sitting in a hot tray
and then she mixed them together as they
heated up once it got to the right
consistency you swatched it on her hand
and she got it right the first try which
is insane to me feel so smooth she got
this cool ass compact and then poured it
in its me my liquid skin when I wear
blush it's like oh wow you are like hot
pink or it's like nothing's there and I
look the same
based on Chrissy's hair and skin color
we don't want to use something that's
too muted so her pink is gonna have a
little bit of depth like a fresh dewy
woman but like with a little bit of heat
to her I think it would be nice being
that Chrissy is a little bit on the
drier side to use one of our cream to
powder cheek tones fuchsia and white
will make a lake pink and just a drop a
wild ginger just to make it a little bit
earthy ur watching her mix all the
pigments together was so cool it
was like watching an artist do their
work in front of you they're like
showing you how they got to where they
did they're showing you how they got to
their masterpiece which in this case is
makeup I'm ready I'll give you a
beautiful blushing Rose done at Maya
flowers and then poured it into a tiny
compact this is me getting created step
by step I'm also gonna get a custom lip
pencil made which is great because I
love a good matte lip I wanted a nudie
natural color that had a hint of like
brown purple pink in it I am a beautiful
matte lip baby maybe it tiny bit more
pain
this is it isn't it yeah this is me then
she poured the colored pigment into the
pencil top it hardened and then she
pulled it out and I had this like
perfect pencil tip oh my gosh it's so
beautiful I also I'm going to finish it
off with a little bit of early
two-thousands glitter gloss because hi
we're making custom stuff here we're
gonna get some glitter out of this right
she took basically like a clear sort of
gloss based and she took three different
types of glitters and you can even add
aromatherapy vanilla peppermint orange
jus I want fresh I want peppermint oh my
god this is like my teenage dream coming
true this is nuts
oh my god it's so pretty
it actually looks more adult than I
thought it would it might add and then
she threw it in and now it's just this
like super beautiful good smelling lip
gloss and I will have forever and
cherish I never have bare nails I have
them painted all the time because I'm
obsessed with nail polish and I'm here
to finally make my own and I'm so stoked
this spring it's all about color pops so
we're seeing real brights and pinks and
oranges and red took a little squirt
here a little squirt there a little red
a little orange and then to really
brighten it up we added the yellow and
then we'll suspend it this is art artist
at work and then she mixed it all
together in this little cup and then she
was like do you like this color and I
was like yeah she got right on the first
try again she put it into this little
bottle that had two little balls in it
and then I had my perfect corally red
that I always wanted for spring what
speaking done I think that custom makeup
is so worth a try
I think it especially if you have a
really hard time trying to find your
shade and it is cool to know what is
going into your product one of the cool
parts about making custom makeup is you
get to name them
reminiscent of the 2000 in my favorite
color limited two-part - very hot right
