stuff you see online doesn't have to
stay online I'm gonna bring a stranger's
digital style to life by giving their
space and makeover based only on their
Instagram account let's do it
hey guys it's Ashley and I have another
makeover video for you but this time
things are gonna be a little weirder
than usual I emailed my office and they
said does anybody want a bedroom
makeover if you do send me a link to
your Instagram and I got a lot of really
cool profiles but there was one in
particular that stuck out and that was
Christina Long's profile she sent me her
Instagram along with a couple pictures
of the bedroom I was so struck by how
cool her Instagram was and I was equally
surprised when she sent me pictures of
her bedroom that was kind of plain in
comparison to this digital aesthetic
that she had going on let's try and make
her real-life bedroom match her online
persona and give her just a really cool
space where she can feel creative and
energized and it can feel like home
here's how everything's gonna go down
first
I'll stalk Christina online I'm gonna
use every creepy skill that I have to
find out who she is and what she likes
then comes a makeover Christina is gonna
leave me the key to her apartment and
I'll have one day to make over her face
in a way that perfectly fits her
personality finally the big reveal we're
gonna show Christina the new space and
see if I was able to translate her
digital style into a real-life dream
space okay I have so much research to do
and things are gonna get pretty creepy
so let's get started we are gonna stop
Christina so hard let's be real we all
know how to do it don't pretend like you
haven't done it before and ended up on
your high-school crush's
aunts Facebook page you know what I'm
saying we all know how to get the
information I'm just gonna use it
constructively first let's go through
all her pictures and see what her
posting style is like her profile
compared to mine is like an art gallery
versus your mom's scrapbook you know
what I'm saying there's a really obvious
color theme here purples peaches
okay this is cool her hair right now is
also orange in pink I think that is a
very apparent color scheme that we
should go with here in the description
she calls herself the astrologists you
didn't ask for which is funny and tells
me that she's into astrology so that's
something that I can definitely
incorporate she has a Lincoln profile
that goes - oh wow she makes music okay
so she's obviously artistic I think she
likes playing on maybe first picture she
ever posted is her palm holding some
moss a lot of landscapes I think she'd
really appreciates the outdoors so I'm
gonna try and bring the outdoors inside
let's see who she's following oh I think
I need to take up my phone for this
that's the other thing sometimes you can
get better information from the
Instagram app than you can on the
Instagram website actually I know a lot
of the people that she's following hmm
it seems to be mostly unverified
accounts which I'm gonna assume our her
friend the only three celebrities I see
that she's following are Solange Rihanna
and Lord that is a really interesting
trifecta of style icons I think there's
definitely some sort of common thread
like a high-fashion quirky style am I
wrong I think that's like kind of true
maybe I don't know I could also just be
embarrassing myself right now some major
takeaways from my stocking are in terms
of color she seems to like orange and
pink with a couple of lavender and blue
accents thrown in she seems to be
interested in nature she's a musician
she's a very creative and expressive
person which is awesome and something I
definitely want to incorporate into her
room she doesn't follow many celebrity
accounts but I will say the few
celebrities that she does follow have a
common theme so I do think that is
something that can influence how I
designed her bedroom
now that we've stopped Christina it's
time for the really fun part and that is
shopping
alright we're about to go into the room
for the first time what are your
predictions I'm kind of skid me too
let's do it
we're gonna start the makeover the first
thing I'm gonna do is clear out all the
accessories all the trinkets and as much
stuff as I can get out of this room I'm
gonna take out and then bring the old
stuff in with the new stuff and find a
perfect cohesive placement for
everything
one of the really big takeaways that
Kanan and I discovered while we were
clearing out Christina's room is that
this girl knows how to take care of
herself
she has a lot of crystal she has a lot
of plants she has a lot of I don't want
to say self-help books but how would you
describe that self-care right I'm really
hoping that this new bedroom becomes a
space where Kristina can recharge she
feels totally authentically herself and
that it's sort of just an extension of
who she is already which is a funny
thing to do because I don't actually
know Kristina yet let's go do it
saying that Kristina tagged me in her
Instagram story nervous let's see what
she said Wow remember the room looks
like that only a few minutes ago this is
a good reminder of how far we've come we
were definitely right about her loving
crystals because she has one with her at
this coffee shop right now she said
wondering what kind of unmentionables
Ashley be gastric is digging up she must
have heard us her ears must be ringing
cuz we've been talking about a cool she
is all day but she also must know that I
went through her closet god no I don't
believe we got that I ordered a rug I
got it from Urban Outfitters home
I have a little bit of a decision to
make because one side is green and one
side is purple this is the perfect time
to send Christina and Instagram poll and
ask her which side she wants facing up
at these cute little suction cup
planters but I forgot to buy succulents
Cana informed me I did not know this
that you charge your crystals by the
moonlight is this yeah that's usually a
foolin this is all new to me is this not
like the cutest little crystal charging
station
we only have like ten minutes Kristina's
gonna be here and I am not at all
Brittany I'm just second-guessing
everything I'm nervous that she's not
gonna like it
remember she's not gonna like me I just
have to stay positive Kristina we're
ready for this real here is your new
bedroom
okay I'm already alone with the colors
beans it's like you did a swatch palette
I've all my photos and then you just
spread it on room yo I'm so sad you got
a rug because I've never had a rug in my
entire life ah this mirror
it's beautiful this is probably my
favorite part of the room that way
down to this tiny shelf this
beautiful in transformer
though TF ease thoughts feelings
emotions it looks like a magazine like I
just stepped into a home I don't usually
put myself in spaces a lot of color and
this is inviting positive change into my
life which is what I need the thought
process behind my board is definitely
not how I go about my usual life now I
feel like all of this is so cohesive and
beautiful I mean you've definitely
figured out like the the me that I want
to present people that's the interesting
yeah no you absolutely nailed that I
think just like internally this isn't
how I always see myself so that's why
it's so disorienting would you rather
your room be like this or would you
rather your instagrams be like your
original room and now that I've been
sitting in this I do kind of want to see
myself as the person I project so yeah
you've opened up new horizons
Cariah exactly oh good no I'm excited to
wake up to this much color I feel like
it's gonna be it's gonna put me in a
really good mindset for the day I'm like
roll into the office and say I can do
this well I'm excited I'll see you
around the office I each other that's
why I do those I just wanna make friends

needs makeover or any other space it
doesn't need to be your bedroom give

might be creeping on some of you guys to
see there's any other makeover subjects
