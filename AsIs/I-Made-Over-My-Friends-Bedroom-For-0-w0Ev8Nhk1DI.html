makeover I'm just hoping that we just
thin the confides in here
oh my god hey guys my name is Ashley and
today I am gonna give my friend Tara at
a zero dollar makeover basically I'm
gonna work with everything that tower
already owns to make her face as
beautiful and as functional as possible
Tara is one of my really good friends
she is hilarious she's the funniest
person I know
super hard-working and just the best
energy in the world so we are gonna make
her space equally amazing for the record
I am NOT an interior designer I make no
claims of being a professional I just
love homes and decor and all that jazz
so I've been doing a lot of research on
room arrangement and even Fung Shui
principles to try and incorporate some
of that knowledge I've acquired in the
past few weeks - Tara space our other
friend Jeremy is also going to come
along to help us with the heavy lifting
and all that sort of stuff so it's gonna
be a good time I'm pretty excited about
it and let's go see what Tara's working
with I don't wanna look like a serial
killer like inviting you tonight a real
killer dead hey guys I'm gonna come
check out my room
this is where all the magic happens
magic as in laying watching Netflix
being late to work here we have my
nightstand it's a little bit of a
cluster mess but it works over here you
have my big ginormous dresser
none of the drawers closed because
they're so stuffed with clothes that's
my own personal we have tons of candles
they're mostly burnt out and old so this
is like my mini library I love having
all my comedy books and art books I have
lots of little tchotchkes around always
but they're kind of a cluttered mess I
think my biggest fix for this would be
just getting better lighting near my
vanity this is my first apartment so I
didn't do like the best job decorating
and putting things together but the
potential is there because this space is
so good I just need some help all right
Terra has Joey hundred over the key it's
time to get started on this paper
there are really three main components
to making a zero dollar makeover work
it's moving stuff organizing stuff and
decorating the first thing we're gonna
do is move stuff big items like the bed
the dresser the vanity those all need to
be repositioned to give this room the
best possible energy first we're gonna
move the bed
ideally headboard should be positioned
against a supported wall because it
visually anchors the bed and also
creates a protective energy around your
head as you sleep there's about 37,000
hair ties under this bed and two socks
next step we are moving the vanity Tara
was complaining about the lighting near
her vanity and unlight is the best light
and it is also free so the vanity is
going right under the window good
another big move is the mirror
originally Tara had her mirror facing
the bed which is 100% the worst possible
spot for a mirror mirrors have a lot of
chaotic energy to them because of that I
moved her so that it wasn't in line with
her bed she also had an extra ottoman
that wasn't super cute so I draped a
throw blanket over it and now she has
this adorable little dressing station I
put the other ottoman over by the
radiator to kind of cover it a little
bit and also to create a mini reading
nook since we've worked so hard I think
we should treat ourselves to a prank
call for Tara yes hey my phone what
should I tell her do you know how to
turn your water off yeah that's it okay
I'm just gonna do it okay ready
oh hey okay
hey hey do you know how to turn off your
your water you're like um like the under
sink why is it funny
yeah just watch your shirt off and I was
pressing all the buttons and now there's
water everywhere oh my god I think it's
going through the floor are you ready to
decorate mm-hmm
if you have too many little mementos and
don't really know what to do with them
if you just get three pieces that vary
in height slightly and put them together
suddenly you have a really cute
collection instead of just a random odd
pairing of things I was cleaning up and
I just happened to find this brand-new
poster Tibetan Chara has not even hung
up yet and it goes with the color scheme
it's super cute if I can open it and
show you oh there we go I took a pants
hanger from Tara's closet and I'm gonna
clip it on to the top of here it doesn't
sound like it's gonna look cute but it's
gonna look cute I promise
another thing that Tara had a lot of
work handles she really likes candles
and she goes through them pretty quickly
I just couldn't bear to throw away this
cute little jar so this is one of my
favorite hacks of all time you can
freeze a finished candle and then once
it's frozen just take a knife and kind
of like stab it
don't hurt yourself please and the wax
should come right out ready I'll show
you right now so just like that and then
there you go we have this adorable jar
now and I'm gonna put Tara's makeup
brushes in there the biggest change I
made with the nightstand was actually
not moving it but moving all the stuff
off of it I gave her a little charging
station on the other side of the room
because not only does it make it look
nicer and more relaxing but also she
won't stay on her phone all night as
it's charging and she's trying to fall
asleep but it looks really sleek and
nice and hopefully she'll get a better
night's sleep because of it I know this
is a zero dollar makeover but I cheated
a little bit because I stole this plant
from Tara's living room but that's okay
because we just needed a pop of color on
this side of the room
and also to even out the visual weight
so I stole a plant okay
Eddie I'm nervous here we go see wait
wait oh my god it's so good I love these
posters that were sitting in the corner
of a room for so long wait this looks
amazing
Ashley what this is a whole new week
this looks really good
why aren't everything to use the window
so I didn't even know I had a window so
I love it Ashley I feel like I just feel
cool living here you are cool like you
already owned all of these things I just
sort of put it on display but you picked
out all these items I know and I just
feel like there's just so much more room
here there's so many like activities you
can do here too just waking up and
staring at the screen area in front of
my face is like beautiful I said I'm
gonna feel really refreshed in the
morning organized do one thing here do
moving over there not just like throw
all my stuff in a pile thanks oh yeah I
got to leave get out I'm gonna leave you
alone to hang out my cool Joel look at
me yeah you can say for like only for
like 15 minutes doing I really bad pizza
in the kitchen for my girls I had pizza
breath oh I have that too get out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
