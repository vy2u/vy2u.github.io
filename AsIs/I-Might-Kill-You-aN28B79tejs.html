all the salad oh no again I'm sorry we
don't have more vegetables I know how
you like a well-balanced meal that's
fine don't don't worry about it you're
okay Randy was arrested today Randy from
work what happened he murdered his wife
Karen but she was so sweet why would he
do that that's what I'm trying to figure
out I've been wondering about it all day
I'm sure was a big misunderstanding
maybe it was a suicide I bet it was a
suicide I'm shot back at a head the cops
drag him through the office kicking and
screaming oh well it's good thing you
two weren't that close it would have
been a bad home fun we were very close
Mary and very similar Randy with the bow
tie and the scrunchie was the only other
one in the office that liked that noodle
place on vine we'd send funny articles
back and forth about Russian politics he
was about to join my fantasy baseball
league we did all the same things well
honey I didn't realize must be hard to
lose a friend he wasn't just my friend
he was a man that had a lot of
similarities to me and then he shot his
wife so what are you thinking it's not
like you're gonna shoot me I can no
longer say that with confidence you
don't have a killing bone in them geenie
body you don't know what I'm capable of
Randy was voted the most likable guy in
the office two months in a row do you
know who's a shoo-in for April this guy
Davis I know sometimes you have a hard
time separating yourself from other
people and certain pets but you have no
idea what was going on in that house
thirteen is it exactly you never know
when people are gonna
I'm sorry okay only Penta people's nap
you're not Penta I'm pent up I never say
the things I want to say or do do you
complain all the time no I never say all
the things like what
I can't wouldn't be polite but the light
is gonna see my life I really bitch me
up and slit my throat you always need to
be so graphic okay complete number one
what else I don't know you're clumsy
calligraphy yes you're clumsy you're
always dropping things and then you
smile and you shrug and you're like
whoops sorry for my butterfingers are so
adorable you're mad about the salad no
I'm mad about you being clumsy that's
another thing like I say something and
you immediately add this layer to it
that doesn't even exist I'm a simple guy
I thought your whole point was that
you're not a simple guy that you're in
fact so complicated that you're capable
of actions that I can't possibly
condescending hi Paige okay why will you
just wax your legs are you always
talking about how hard it is to shave
your legs but then when I bring up
waxing or heaven forbid like laser
treatment you look at me like I have
horns growing out on my head Black Sea
heard so it's cutting your leg every two
days with a razor blade okay you know
what you're not exactly a walk in the
park either okay if I suddenly snapped
people wouldn't be too sure that you're
a cold-blooded killer know that you
annoyed me enough to kill you Mary have
you seen my good shorts Mary did you
leave the ironing board on I need to
iron my good shorts Mary take all these
vitamins you don't need you said those
vitamins are helping here I lied okay
this is ridiculous I promise not to
shoot you if you won't shoot me can we
even make that sort of a promise yes
because we're married and we took a vow
not to shoot each other in the head
Randy took that same vow are you
listening to yourself I mean if anything
you should be scared of me why you can't
even really know yourself let alone
another person I mean for all you know I
could be sticking it to the handyman as
soon as you go to work you leave before
me in the morning but where do I go
work look the basis of any merit is
trust trust that you won't lie trust
that you won't cheat trust that you
won't shoot each other in the head and
then chop up the body and bury in the
rib I didn't say anything about chopping
up the body how'd you know that
educated guess Davis if you want to kill
me
go ahead do it it's ridiculous I don't
want to kill you right now
great I'm gonna get some salt because my
steak is bland and near too much of a
 to complain about it second oh
don't you
what an idiot
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
