like tethered to our email and slack
here
I don't know I go upstairs again I
really wanted to do this challenge
because I've been here for a year and a
half and there are people that I've
never spoken to in person my whole job
is to give notes to people
it's always over email slack I feel like
every time someone sees a message for me
they're probably unhappy because it
means they have to do extra work now I'm
really looking forward to just talking
to people face-to-face I feel like
things are gonna be more efficient
because we've been definitely like feed
off of each other you can read it way
better there are some challenges to
talking to people only in person not
totally sure where everyone sits so
that'll be interesting cool jobs are
pretty even flag Libby was like the pros
even talk to people and like maybe we'd
see fewer mistakes in the future they'd
understand them a little better cons I
would die all right so I was just
looking at the worth it episode for the
speak and the end cards are too short so
now I have to go ask Alex if she could
pretty please react sport check your
calendar to the family
they don't generally
speak to me about these issues in person
I was initially very surprised it sounds
like it's gonna be a lot more
time-consuming like to send someone a
message like takes like that long but to
like locate them that's another thing
you don't know where they are
you have to just wander around and
finally yeah I wandered over to
Lexington someone who's working from
home and I didn't man to come back so
Norberto sent a urgent video checked his
calendar and it says he's at
WrestleMania so we'll see if he's
actually in the office okay I guess
that's where these challenge fails so
the day's about halfway done and so far
the challenge has been not too difficult
it's been really fun to talk to people
in general where it feels a lot more
casual which is saying something for
BuzzFeed because it's already pretty
casual here I'm having a really great
day and it's probably because I'm
talking to people more rather than
sending them an email moving on and not
really having like a real social
interaction first off I need to find
Fernando I do not know where he sits but
I have a feeling it's on the second
floor
maybe he's downstairs yeah I was really
scared I don't like it when people ask
me to talk to me for a second I think it
was cool because I was able to like talk
to her like and get more like in-person
vibes I was terrified that is pretty
 I'm actually like we don't say
anything to each other in person to the
which someone comes up unexpectedly like
you automatically assumes the absolute
worst two people are both in the other
building one of them I think they talked
to her at the holiday party but I'm not
totally sure
walk around the see if I can see
everything
there's no
I'm moving around walking in them
all right thank you so I just was
upstairs giving notes to Nancy and Teddy
and now someone else who sits right next
to them send a video and I'm gonna see
if I can just yell at him from the lobby
because I don't know it go upstairs
again Justin Justin
your big girl
so it's the end of the day I
successfully did not use slack email for
a full workday honestly by the end of
the day I got pretty tired of talking to
people I think I would do this more
often
it was good to just like socialize more
throughout the day I'm hoping that maybe
they'll be like people I can say hi to
around the office now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
