somebody's wish today and if their
wishes
seeing my bare arms my explodes back
wish granted
so I'm Sri Lankan and growing up I
really only wore South Asian clothes to
special events or as we call them
functions I would wear them to weddings
to like Sri Lankan parties to Indian
dance recitals and that's kind of about
it I never really found a way when I was
growing up to incorporate anything from
South Asian fashion into my regular
wardrobe and that's really something I
want to change I'm proud to be South
Asian I'm proud to be tree lankan and I
want to show off the things from my
culture that I find amazing in my
clothes that I wear every day I tend to
dress for comfort with like a little bit
of coolness my wardrobe features a lot
of black a lot lot lot lot of blacks if
I'm gonna be wearing a bunch of clothes
from South Asian designers this week I'm
betting a lot of them are gonna be
really colorful and people are gonna
look at me and that just makes me want
to like shrink into a ball and die South
Asian fashion does have a lot of like
sex to it there's a lot of clothes where
you're wearing a long skirt B you're
like showing your full stomach I'm gonna
try to embrace that this week even if it
means showing off a part of myself that
I'm insecure about it's gonna be a
challenge here is my outfit for the day
this is something I would see on the
rack somewhere and be like yeah someone
should wear that but not me I definitely
feel insecure about showing this much of
like my arm I'm really exposed it's a
big setup day for a really big shoot
it's just a lot of physical labor and so
on those days I tend to like really
dress down but like I'm trying to be
bolder I'm trying to be more fashionable
I'm trying to take risks I opted to go
with this like faux diamond nose-ring
mom got this for me shout out to UM
I guess now I'm like ready to go Nikki
do you like me I'm good
I do like your outfit we've got a lot of
stuff to do today though do you feel
very practical I mean I can move around
for the most part I can't squat very far
but this is like yeah as long as you
don't have a big hole in your butt I
think you're going
I never usually exposed this much of my
back and I feel very self-conscious
about all my back rolls and stuff trying
really hard to like sit upright so
people don't see them / not face anyone
but it's difficult I would just saw you
wear more colors you know always work so
up or your skin tone you look amazing
I'm loving this little nose ringing up
in the air thank you you should wear
this more often you've a bangin
body
I am leaving work now having spent a
full day in this outfit I was definitely
kind of insecure the whole day I felt
like everyone was just kind of staring
at me from my back or my arms I survived
a day of a lot of running around putting
stuff together it's definitely easier
for me to feel more comfortable and the
clothes themselves are you know
comfortable even though I was insecure
about showing these parts of my body I
still feel confident so this one gets a
check from me
so this outfit is a langa from a brand
called kira and beer as you can see I'm
wearing the short skirt part of it
underneath the long leg ascore part of
it is just like red and sheer and sexy
tonight I'm challenging myself to go to
a PR event in this outfit where a B
dress code is fashionably fun and I
think this fits that my face is on my
one accessories on this is from my mom
we'll see how it goes tonight
you look like a beautiful goddess yeah
like a little tree going on it's only
like lunchtime basically and I'm feeling
the struggle because like my skirt is
very long I'm so scared that I'm gonna
trip and like tear it
there's no perils of just being a chore
person if I was like some sweet almonds
out of it would be perfect egg looks
great I love it thank you very hard any
looking
this is to me something I don't know
anything about any of this we're but
this looks like modern traditional this
is a thing and you committed to it 100%
and it's clearly also like a part of who
you are as a person and I think that's
beautiful to celebrate
I'm literally laying in bed in my kira
and beer outfit from today because I
don't want to take it oh I loved that I
was able to absolutely rock this look
you're gonna look at me then you're
gonna look at me and I'm gonna know that
I look good so like yeah like come on
we're going on keep on looking cuz I am
wearing my outfit for today which is
another one by tkc design it's
definitely again not something I would
wear for me also like these pants are
like more billowy than I normally wear I
like the way my legs look and so I tend
to like either wear short things or
things that are like really tight around
the leg there's like so much texture
happening and that is a thing that I
just now realized I don't really wear a
ton of textured clothing Here I am with
my cool buta cush armband because she's
also made by a South Asian woman all
right I'm gonna go tackle the day
when you walk back I was like oh my god
she's so summery and colorful it's so
beautiful you're more of a billowy pant
wear than I am so I also up so really
how do I get these pants the workday is
done and this outfit got so many
comments like people who don't normally
talk to me we're coming up to me to say
today to say how much they liked this
outfit and a really interesting thing
people said to me today was that my
outfit felt very like Coachella to them
which is interesting because I think in
their minds they're making the
connection that it's like very desi
inspired fashion but they don't know the
words for that they just know that they
see that kind of fashion appropriated I
could tell I thought today was a really
good example of how like me stepping out
of my comfort zone was something that
people responded really positively to
which is nice I guess I got a step out
of my comfort zone more it was really
easy to do in these clothes because I I
felt so empowered there's something
about wearing and rocking stuff from
your own culture that like makes me feel
like a superhero holy look at this
outfit I look like a princess
a little Sri Lankan princess but I don't
think I carry myself like a princess I
wanted to try to wear one seemingly
fancy outfit just as I kind of live my
life on the weekend and today I decided
to accessorize with a little tika my
boyfriend has not seen me let's go show
him oh I'll come by and get the invite
to the god
stunned honestly where are we right now
we're at the mall the last time I came
to the mall actually I saw a girl in a
giant poufy ball gown dress and I
thought when I saw her I was like Klout
she looks beautiful but also that must
feel crazy and now here I am effectively
like doing the same thing
so we've been at the mall for like I'm
in it now it's been surprisingly quiet
I've definitely caught people staring at
me there are a lot of like long looks
just like
and I'm kind of surprised that nobody
has come up and said anything about this
thing either to just be like oh that's
nicer Oh like what is that what are you
doing it just kind of lets me know that
like hey I can wear stuff like this and
like have it be accepted as being normal
and like nobody's really gonna question
me perhaps because I'm rocking it with
confident it's like I'm kind of walking
straighter with my shoulders back and
stuff and I just been like yeah but says
how I look all the time and yes you will
respect me so you know maybe I'm giving
off an arrow like so we had a full day
of errand running today I do feel a
little bit exhausted today but I think
this outfit actually helped me like keep
my energy up because I was like you know
what I'm dressed like a South Asian
princess and therefore I need to hold
myself like a South Asian princess so I
was trying not to like slouch and look
too tired gotta represent the culture
well this is an outfit it's definitely
definitely not a color that I would
normally pick for myself I've paired it
with this necklace also from Vita Kosh
has a little Ganesha on it
I feel like super extra round today so
here we go Chrissy
so beautiful I mean I think the hardest
thing for me is just being short and
wearing long skirts one I always feel
like they swallow me a little bit you
don't think so obviously look why you're
about to go on the red carpet but like
cool and hot like I tried to start this
day with my skirt hiked up higher over
my bellybutton but that's not where the
skirt is meant to sit and I kind of
didn't even notice as it like slipped
lower down people have been pointing out
like oh you have like your belly yeah
today also I never cereal tum I was like
 do I um turns out I do the Regal
nacelle against of this whole outfit has
like inspired in me a confidence that I
don't normally feel like if I was
wearing western clothes and you said hey
you're gonna wear like a maxi skirt that
hits you under your belly button I feel
like get that away from me I think you
look awesome yeah I'm so into it she
runs every day was agony changing - oh
yes my clothes in this part of the world
it draws a lot of attention to you but
if we were back home I wouldn't be that
big deal at all Yeah right like this
would just be like some kind of fancy
yeah exactly
but the workday
pretty much over and I am going to now
meet my boyfriend and we're gonna have a
little date seriously I got a lot of
compliments from random strangers that I
was just like walking around and going
to the bathroom whatever I like people
were talking to me and like saying nice
things just very very kind and I
appreciate they should because you look
ravishing babe
ultimately like you're always worried
that people are gonna see you as an
other and that can happen especially
when you're like wearing clothes of your
culture and your culture is not Western
but forcing myself to wear the clothes
of my culture out and about helps me
really unlearn that kind of stuff so my
experiment is over and I'm really sad
about it
I loved this whole week I don't need
anybody's permission to wear clothes
that are designed by South Asian people
but it feels good to know that other
people think it looks good do I really
gained an understanding going forward
how I want to incorporate elements of
South Asian fashion into like my day to
day look and I think that that made this
whole experience invaluable doing this
whole thing showed me but South Asian
fashion is something to be loved and
something to be proud of and something
to be shown off I always had that little
seedling inside me of knowing that but
now it has grown into a beautiful tree
of pride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
