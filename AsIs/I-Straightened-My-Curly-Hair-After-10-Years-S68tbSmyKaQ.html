little trash in my hair today I am
getting my hair straightened for the
first time in like 10 years
I've had curly hair my entire life and
when I was a kid I really did not like
it everybody else had beautiful like
smooth wonderful hair
my mother had straight hair and she did
not really know what to do with this
business I resorted to hats a lot you
know and now obviously I have found ways
to team with my hair and I love it and I
wouldn't have it any other way but
people always ask me what do you what do
you look like was trait haired you have
a picture do you have anything the
answer is no I don't and I truthfully
don't know what it looks like but I
guess today we're gonna find out what do
you think I'll look like with straight
hair smaller okay I guess I'm ready for
this experience there might be like some
bobby bobby pins hidden in there
when you wake up a stray hair you're
like oh mm-hmm it's fine
I wake up and I look like an
electrocuted sheep
what is that what's in my hair there's a
little trash in my hair Wow
it definitely looks a little bit like a
wig it's so weird it's like looking into
a parallel universe there's something
like this is the other me who would
murder me at night and take over my life
I'm like running for governor I feel
like people will be shocked to see this
especially since like I didn't really
tell anybody about it I can like already
feel my hair just wanting to curl up I'm
curious to see what people say about it
what they think about it maybe they'll
think it makes me look more mature
look at this you look like you have the
Rachel what do you think about my hair
in whoa like it who's good I loves it I
didn't say it wasn't good you look like
you think it looks good yeah you look
adorable and you like Millennials and
knows what she wants and doesn't give a
 about what everyone else thinks oh
my god it's so weird as a curly-haired
person it makes me sad to see someone
with like beautiful curly hair
straightening is like it's so
representative of your personality but
it doesn't look bad what do you think
your new lady I truly do like your
actual hair yeah yeah whoo thank you Wow
I'm surprised that people are saying
that it looks good I don't know maybe I
should like try to switch it up more
there's no way I'd ever be able to do
this by myself without the help of a
skilled professional this is kind of
good it's funny how integral hair is to
your identity because when I looked at
you I was like that's not the quirky fun
sir I know whoa I look like a cool mom
I'm honest when I passed by you there's
another person in the office a purple
here and then you turn around like oh
that's Sarah sort of settling into
having this hair it's really fun to do
that it's kind of a hairstyle of like
Scully from the x-files okay straight
this
this is very fun and very different for
me so that was a day I just don't feel
like myself I with this look which is
interesting because it's what I always
wanted when I was a kid even though it's
something that I want it's just not
really true to who I am I find it
interesting that despite it being
straightened it's like trying to curl
back almost like just resisting
normalization you have curly hair and
you want to straighten it I support you
but I also think that having curly hair
kind of makes you unique you know it's
something not everybody has a certain
joy that I think can be associated with
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
