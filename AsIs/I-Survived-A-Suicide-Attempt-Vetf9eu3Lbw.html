suicide attempt survivor
I am a suicide attempt survivor
I am a suicide attempt survivor
I had a hard transition into high school
and I got hit really hard with
depression for the first time I started
questioning my sexuality I started
hurting myself I was not the coolest kid
in the block just like Charlie like
fitting with you know different groups
and whatnot I was the smallest I was the
youngest my weight was something that I
was is something that I've always
struggled with and because of my weight
I always kind of just felt like I was
never enough addiction runs in my family
and so because of that growing up there
was a lot of those issues to deal with
being around violence and healthy
relationships unhealthy environment it
just started getting a little rough you
know I started getting a little rough
like run edges along you know trying to
make friends I just felt like because
this was something that I couldn't
control that I was just worthless I got
myself into an emotionally and
physically volatile relationship that
coupled with all of the things that had
been happening in my mind for so many
years kind of got to a breaking point
and then the rape happened I was
convinced my life was not supposed to
happen finding the right therapist
finding the right fit is really key
seeing a therapist is one of the best
things that you could ever do for
yourself it gave me purpose it was
exciting to have somebody to go to that
wanted to hear about what I had to say
and what I was going through talking to
other survivors is what actually saved
my life talking to other rape survivors
talking to other people who have tried
to kill themselves because we think that
we're in this tiny little bubble and
nobody sees us because that's how we
feel because we're empty I'm a leftover
nobody knows I exist but in reality we
all are feeling the same thing you know
if you had a broken leg or a broken arm
or if you have a cold you're going to go
to a doctor you're going to go get the
help that you need everyone is worthy of
life every single person that is born is
worthy of life having a creative outlet
is huge I'm a writer and writing is the
only thing that helps me
make sense of things whatever you're
going through is stronger than you think
you know I can really have you on
another level so I mean the people are
trying to help you let them let them in
I know it's going to be hard and
difficult but just let them in try and
think about what you need if you just
need somebody to sit with you ask them
to sit with you if you need them to take
you out of your house ask them to take
you out of your house if there's no one
around for whatever reason because that
does happen figure out one thing that
can get you through one minute and then
figure out another thing that can get
you through the next minute I needed to
know that I had the power to save myself
that I wasn't powerless that I had the
control to pick up the phone or to make
an appointment or to to talk to a
psychiatrist or to just walk outside and
say I don't want to talk to anybody
today I just need to be alone get up
keep walking no matter what they throw
at you they matter what they say no
matter what they do just keep living and
keep pushing I can say now that I have
the most beautiful most fulfilling life
it's turned out far better than the 23
year old girl who wanted to die and try
to die could ever have hoped for but
that doesn't mean that the struggle is
over you know I have to maintain my
health I still have suicidal crises I
still sometimes want to hurt myself but
the fact of the matter is that I have
tools and I have a support system and I
can make it through and I do make it
through every single day it gets better
you are worth life you are worth living
you are worth breathing you are worth
having children you are worth going to
college you are worth telling jokes you
are worth writing poems you are worth
your life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
