attack I don't know where that came from
but today I'm trying the most expensive
mascara you can find at Sephora there's
nothing very special about my eyelashes
they curl which is cute but there's just
not a lot of them it's like a very bare
forest there's some trees there but I
don't know if you'd qualify as like a
camping ground you know why is this
heavy this feels like a box of jewelry
this is my first red bottom that's not
even like a shoe it's my first Christian
this is so bougie I love it
this is like an anniversary gift you
give her first year you're like honey I
love you
here's the $70 mascara it's like solid
metal this is like the best packaging on
the planet I guess we'll go straight
into it
here we go that first coat it's working
like a regular mascara I go straight up
just to get that formula on there and
then to really get into that roots and
for it to lift I'll do a little wiggle
it's a lash wiggle it's a little I like
them to be lengthy but I also like them
to look full and a little chunky so I'll
put a little bit more than usual like I
feel like this is how all mascaras work
and there's not a huge difference
besides like wands and packaging at this
point the formula is going on smooth and
effortlessly it's holding very true and
just coating each lash very nicely and
evenly I'm still like waiting for that
70 dollars to kick in so my right eyes
done this side of my face 7000 mascara
the side of my face we also have a way
cheaper Sephora mascara lash craft
length and volume this is from the
Sephora collection and this is
significantly cheaper than mr. Christian
we're gonna try this little nugget out
on my left eye and just compare the
results
these ones are more separated and their
lengthy while these are just like on the
clumpy er end and they're a little bit
more chunky finally have a full face on
$70 is definitely a lot of packaging and
it's a lot of the utility of the actual
wand formula wise they're very
comparable in a sense that they both
just lathered in eyelashes and like a
sick beautiful black lacquer coat I love
me a good splurge but I feel like
something like a mascara you don't
really need to splurge on because I know
I can get the same results with a
mascara half of this price I feel it
especially bougie this I probably
wouldn't wink at people with but be like
