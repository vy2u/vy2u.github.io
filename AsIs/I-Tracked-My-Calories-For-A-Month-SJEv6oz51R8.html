you know I don't really have an excuse
for it I'm just really one of those
potatoes
how do I normally eat I normally eat
like I hate myself pizza from
lunch but I did get a ginger ale instead
of a coca-cola because I think it's
healthier right I'd like to feel better
and that feel like I'm drastically
changing everything about my lifestyle
to do so
proximal lighting it's a type of way of
eating both foods you need to eat and
also the things you want to eat whilst
helping you get to your goal at the same
time laws you need certain parameters
custom set parameters such as target
calorie intake a target protein intake
and sometimes you might also set our
carbon fat goal per day then you can an
SS fill those calories and those carbs
proteins and fats with with whatever
foods you want
the general recommendation as well for
what were diving is to make sure that
the majority of your food choices are
from nutrient-dense food so you're not
just filling your calories junk doing
good with my grilled chicken lunch and
then all of a sudden we got cake on set
they cheated today and had some cake and
broke and I only have a couple hundred
calories left for the day I decided to
make a healthy dinner with some water
right we you your only live once eat the
damn doughnut eat the damn pasta but
when you have those choices go for the
better
broccoli I'm still getting pasta in
there because like don't Trent take me
all the way don't be afraid to take baby
steps and small steps you want to start
with behaviors that you know you can
consistently execute on a day to day
basis is really terrible expensive not
as expensive as on
because I do go out to restaurants so
much the calories aren't just readily
available especially when you go to
these like artisanal hipster joints you
don't really know what you're consuming
so I'm here grocery shopping which is
something I never do and I bought a ton
of protein so on my way out of the
grocery store I ran into the cutest
 in Los Angeles the goddamn Girl
Scouts goddamn and I almost almost got
led astray but I said no thank you but I
still give them a donation because I'm
not an asshole it's up to you to figure
out what nutrition strategy makes you
feel your best and what you really enjoy
and can stick to it you know you can
stick to over the long haul look at this
 breakfast I can't even
finish this whoopie pie guys I already
feel sick I've been eating so many
vegetables and I've been B so helpfully
that like all this sugar is like killing
me is it over it's been 30 days really
dude this is easy this is like the
easiest video I've done
yeah I had like a really negative
self-talk about it I would really beat
myself up about the types of food I was
eating and it got really kind of
unhealthy mentally I definitely have a
weird relationship with foods like I
make myself feel terrible if I eat
shitty and I make myself feel really
guilty if I eat shitty and I didn't
realize that I was doing that to myself
until I started eating better I wasn't
like trying to lose weight I was just
trying to eat healthier and feel better
and I did a hundred percent this is kind
of like a tool that I now can put in my
tool belt of self-care and healthy
lifestyle so I think I keep doing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
