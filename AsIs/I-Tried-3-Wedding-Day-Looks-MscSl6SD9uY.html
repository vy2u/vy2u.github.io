here oh hey I'm Nikki and this is my
fiancee Kelsey we're getting married
this year
and we can't wait to make this perfect
day our oh it's wedding season and this
week we're talking about hair and makeup
trials beauty beauty
finding the right hair and makeup artist
is so so important when it comes to your
wedding day because that's what you're
gonna look like in all of your photos
for all of time whenever you book a hair
and makeup artist for your wedding what
they recommend is doing a trial that's
you meeting up with them a few weeks
before your wedding to decide on what
your look is you're gonna be beautiful
because you're so happy so that's
already going for you you just don't
want to make the mistake of like
especially too much makeup because you
want to be able to recognize yourself
you really want it to reflect what you
look like on your best day today we're
getting three different hair and makeup
looks from three different sets of
stylists they'll all get the same
information about our wedding our style
what we're gonna be wearing and who we
are as a couple I have a few ideas about
what I want and I have no idea what I
want it can be pretty hard to put your
hair and makeup into the hands of
someone who doesn't know you they could
all be very drastically different things
I just hope I like one of them it's
gonna be a surprise - hi my name is
Patrick Santa Anna and this is my sister
hazel one of our favorite things to do
our weddings and I'm gonna be doing
makeup today and she's gonna be doing
pretty hair so for Kelsey you want to do
alternate waves and maybe a soft little
braid on the side for Nicki because she
doesn't wear too much makeup I was
thinking about structured contour nude
eyes with just a wing tip and then also
a really bold lip we always ask the same
couple what makes it stressful this
concept of this most important day of
your light and having nine months to
plan the biggest party you've ever
planned constantly seeing beautiful
people get married and hoping that yours
will look as good as that if not that
better okay for Kelsey I had in mind to
do a really pretty smoky bronzed look
with ardell lashes on the side so they
ever had lashes on yeah oh here we go
Nicki a little bit more volume on top
side part little Hollywood ish oh my god
I cry
look sexy virgin okay two one go wow
your eyelashes I know you can see that
can't you yeah you look great thank you
so do you
thank you your hair so pretty oh really
sexy I like here's a lot closer eyes if
Hollywood glam was what we were going
for are we achieved it I feel like
everyone will just be looking at my lips
all because you're looking at your lips
all also you're like in normal clothes
if you're wearing a suit it'll be a nice
pop I love the hair this is everything I
wanted in a swoop ever it's a great
swoop what do you think about mine I
really like you do look like a virgin
princess was that the look we were after
I think we should cut my name is you

today so are you planning on putting my
hair up board leaving it down
hop-hop and a half down we have like a
lot hair if you have netball you and
it's gonna be so oh I want to do like
very pop at you and Graham I'm planning
to do sweet and soft look Paul Kelsey Oh
Nikita look simple natural edgy and cool
yeah eyebrows on all right so good thing
you're gonna wear the tuxedo yeah I'm
excited I'm so curious to know what is
going on here I'm curious about mine
there was a lot of criss-crossing
Affairs over my head I think something's
happening like 1 million bobby pins
mm-hmm 3 2 1 go very very tall up top
Wow is that all your hair why is it
really big no there's like a lot of
different layers to it which is so cool
you look like a princess you look like
an edgy princess
I kind of love this you should it's
really oh my god so much happening on my
head I do have so much hair do you what
I'm saying cuz you have like this and
this and there's this if you look up
wedding looks on Pinterest is like I
think this is the makeup look that I'm
after though you look like you but never
be fine yeah do you like yours yes I do
I'm still coming around to a darker eye
because I never do that on myself ever I
don't know my eyes are just so huge it
looks like he's in a band take down I'm
Sam and I'm gonna be doing makeup today
and I'm Krystal and I'm gonna be doing
here today so I'm Kelsey we're gonna be
doing a really nice natural look if you
were to wear one would you do blush or
bronzer or a little bit of bold and just
would like to look glowy so however you
can make that happen for Nicky's hair
we're gonna do a sleek bath so you can
see her pretty face very sleek can you
look very you feel very sleek I'm Kelsey
we're gonna make her hair a little bit
glam for Nicky's look today we're gonna
be doing a nice natural love umph DUP a
little bit I get wedding nightmare still
look like what it's the wedding day my
clothes aren't there okay she's walking
down the aisle and I'm not dressed yet
people do I'm going there's so many
moving parts and it's so easy to forget
one of them I'm sure then you just like
wake up in the nose like I have to call
the DJ about this really sucker
maybe just suck man but like we don't
know and some long it's hard being
beautiful it's a lot of work three two
one go yeah you really do oh it's very
sleek you're doing okay yes okay it's
the simplest of the three we're like in
a nice way yeah that lip color right you
have a very nice and natural glowy face
and it's very like sleek and smooth very
different from the other looks I want to
see myself ready three two one
this is what I want your eyes are
lighter this time I love it it looks
like a ballroom dancer oh you think that
like we're about to a tango oh maybe
we'd be very complimentary oh yeah this
is a very nice bone though it's like a
very classic look a little more makeup
than last time I think this is a good
nude lip color though I really like it
too how you do you like you're making
mm-hmm I do okay what do you think what
the first life virgin princess with the
braid has a nice and simple look but
maybe just not I was going for I like
the hair on my look that was lamb arrest
some makeup was just like a bit too much
that second look wowza I don't think I
could ever wear that hairstyle for the
wedding he looked amazing though how are
you there was a lot going on two months
I'm huge
I liked your makeup though I loved my
second makeup good I think it was a
really good fit for you I think this was
like a perfect mix between the previous
two looks so feel like myself I like
this stuff this I think is very cool but
I think for our lush garden ceremony
going slick like this wouldn't super fit
into the vibe maybe you needed something
a little more and down yeah but I do
like the clean neckline yeah this was so
I opening I didn't realize how different
I could look but I think we've
definitely got some good ideas for the
actual day right thank you good job
next on wedding season it's here I'm
getting married in like a week this
thing that we've been planning for the
past ten months is actually happening
now and I kind of cannot believe it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
