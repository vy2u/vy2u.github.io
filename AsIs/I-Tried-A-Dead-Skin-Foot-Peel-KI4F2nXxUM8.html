is part of the video
this is fully like a zombie movie just
of my feet
all right so while ago there was this
baby foot peel foot mask thing that was
doing the rounds on social media and it
legitimately looked like it took off
your entire foot skin I never got to try
it
but I found this thing in alter the
other day it's upside down
this thing which I think is pretty
similar now this is only about seven or
eight bucks so it's preachy I want to
see if it's as Extreme as the other one
I just feel like it might be a bit of a
gimmick
it's called changing you magic foot
peeling shoes so you put them on like
little booties and just sit around in
them I think I have quite dry skin on my
feet I've always walked around without
shoes on or with sandals on which I
think rub your heels and make them hard
the best part of the entire product it's
always in the back steps that can
transform an average looking woman into
an attractive lady I wasn't aware the
state of my feet is what made me
attractive or not alright so it doesn't
say you have to put your feet in water
first or anything you just shove these
right on so let's get going oh I think
this is how you do booties are pee like
crap around then you attach them now
these are supposed to stay on until the
liquid is soaks up as liquid in it this
is so cute always wet inside okay yeah
it sounds pretty good actually it's not
very fruity put sheets on your feet keep
both sheets on your feet and wait until
your foot skin absorbs a liquid in
around an hour or an hour and a half
oh that feels so weird oh it's kind of
Mormon liquidy just feels like if you're
really sweaty with socks on after you've
worked out pretty gross feet you're done
if you can hear this is squelching this
is all gonna be slipped up by my feet so
it's been about 45 minutes and they're
starting to sting a little bit not ideal
so it's been an hour it's still wet it
feels like when you put like tea tree
oil or something in the manifold on your
skin I just want this to soak up so I
can take these boots off pretty sure
these are never going to dry out it's
been on for over an hour and a half and
it is not dry there is no way my feet is
soaked up enough liquid I'm gonna take
them off now because it's so
uncomfortable you know when you've been
in the bath too long and you start
getting like all wrinkly I feel like my
feet look exactly like that right now oh
yeah yep very pruney or it's enough to
watch my feet and I just wait for the
skin to fall off I just came back from
the Renaissance Fair please ignore that
sentence I was walking around all day
and I just realized they're starting to
peel I'm like stupidly excited about it
look at this bad boy you know what so
now as any day three today but I was
starting to feel really pessimistic that
this just like wasn't gonna work at all
now though I don't know how to stop
picking it but it specifically says on
the instructions don't peel it let it
just like go on its own my toes is
fighting - goes well Andy flicked his
skin all over my shoes I was walking
around my apartment this morning and I'm
like this feels really weird and yeah
there's like a giant flap of skin just
flapping around I guess I'm gonna have
to pull it off because it just is really
annoying right now only that much it's
actually that's not just took my shoe
from having it on all day it is so
disgusting this bits still left to go
that fits the dryest actually surprised
it's not gone I was just investigate you
my foot further and I realize the top of
my foot is in fact peeling - not just
the underneath I don't know what that
means it's just like an apocalypse
down there now really embarrassed to
show you but this is part of the video
this is really like a zombie movie just
over my feet I'm heading to work and I'm
gonna ask some of my co-workers what
they think of my feet however at the end
of this you are gonna have like baby
your foot is like molting I hope you're
not wearing socks that you like like
this isn't as gross as you think it is
but like you can't wear sandals it feels
like the whole satisfying part of it
would be just like human you know even
if you split your foot doesn't it just
grow back really quick anyway so it's
like I wonder if the process of you
doing this is even gonna like last yeah
so just took a shower and they're like
even worse than they were before I'm
getting pretty much really retailers now
it feels really uncomfortable I just
feel like I have to keep my feet encased
in socks the whole time I can't do that
when I'm showering so look what happened
all right it's been two whole weeks and
honestly they stop peeling after just
one week so quicker than what it said in
the packet it worked exactly as it said
it would
it was gross while I was going through
it and I could not wear sandals because
no one wants to see fashion and I had to
wear socks in bed because I didn't want
to get flakes in my bed but it was a
kind of an interesting process to go
through just to like see it happening as
disgusting as that sounds they don't
feel like crazy soft honestly but they
definitely are a little less rough than
it used to be I can't quite believe how
much I've talked about my feet in one
video but hopefully it has been
marginally helpful for you I think
that's it for me and feet for a while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
