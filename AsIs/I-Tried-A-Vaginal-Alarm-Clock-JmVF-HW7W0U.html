my name is Merle my struggle and the
reason that I am shamelessly here aside
from the fact that I'm not planning a
career in politics is the fact that I
actually do have a multitude of issues
waking up in the morning ready to do
that I have a real alarm clock like the
one on Blue's Clues that one I just
throw that right off the bed
Stan I've tried everything
cold showers you still have to get up in
order to get to the shower go into bed
early it's never gonna happen
average snooze button hit probably like
five to six times I cannot get up in the
morning wake sexy already like where
this is going oh my goodness I don't
know what these things are these like
fallopian tube or like like lips
whatever this is this looks kind of like
a little mini speculum it goes just
directly under your vagina but like I
thought it was gonna go inside my vagina
so I mean kind of weird to say a little
disappointed
slipped little rooster into the front of
your panties it adjust it until it feels
comfortable
Oh arm little roosters vibrations start
five minutes before alarm time smart
they know me and then the power slowly
increases you can choose the maximum
power and set up I know already I'm
gonna need the maximum power in set up
it's gonna be a great experience I can
already tell my biggest fear is that I
can even escape a vaginal alarm clock
and everyone's gonna know well what is
this like Barbie mirror that you have
right now that's my vibrator I have to
put it in my underwear outside of my
machine before I go to sleep this place
is so weird would you name it I
said Wendy Agnes
tonight is the first night I have to try
to figure out how to set this alarm it
looks like it connects to Wi-Fi can you
figure this out
great
what time is a renowned military time 43
so hot you know day one a huge fail I
was supposed to be up 45 minutes ago I
set it to the lowest setting it fell if
there was like a flea sized version of
Luo man's group concert in my underwear
I'm gonna have to commit a little bit
more to having it remain where it
belongs
which i think means wearing more sturdy
underoos guys once a again it
didn't even go off I don't know what's
going on here but I can't really let
anyone touch it I'm supposed to be in at
9 I blame it on the military
time honestly I don't know
military time I know look it up I'll
figure it out it's basic math whatever
so 936 and I was supposed to be at work
at 9:30 this has got to stop happening
while the alarm clock is very misleading
the vibrator works and now I just feel
like a very dirty lady you know I'm
starting to wonder if this is going to
turn into how to lose your job in seven
days so moving forward we're gonna get
the updated version of the rooster who
knows what that means
and wha
Oh somehow you were buttons I already
didn't know what the I was doing it
looks more like chic and like it's gonna
fit here's hope and kiddos so after a
week and some change of using this
product I will be happy to say that it
did absolutely help me get up in the
morning
all right this is the first time that
this has actually worked it starts
really really slow and that like builds
to a crescendo but it's nice that they
ease you into it it wasn't just like I
was sound asleep it also it's like mmm
like electrocute your clitoris it was
like a slow build okay it's been like
five minutes and I haven't gone back to
sleep yet so that's like huge
so anyway I'm gonna get up yeah it
definitely made at the beginning of my
day of all like softly aired welcome to
Subway as always and I can't help think
that everybody I walk by knows what I
did this morning I feel refreshed Hill
awake a little dirty the first one was
like the wall eats very square it didn't
comfortably fit I felt like I was like
defiling a Disney character that I loved
the second version sleeker it was more
likely to stay in place I'm not gonna
lie like the mornings have been much
more interesting I don't know it makes
you feel some kind of way when you're
finding a pipe vibrator personally I'm a
fan I don't know if I would have
believed it from someone else but I'm
definitely gonna keep using it and now I
have to it's like I don't know what I'll
do with those but we'll find a use for
them one way or another I don't know I'd
be curious to see what else little
rooster comes up with in the future
where else they can put vibrators we'll
have to wait and see I'll probably end
up in that video too lord knows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
