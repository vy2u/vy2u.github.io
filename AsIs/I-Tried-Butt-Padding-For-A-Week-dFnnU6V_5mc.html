padding underwear cuz on a bigger but I
really wanted to try out some but
enhancing and but shaping underwear I'm
a petite girl over the curve so go with
my little body but would like a little
more junk back here I personally have
always associated curviness with
womanliness curves are celebrated
whether it's the black icons who I grew
up with or the music videos that I watch
having a nice big round booty that's
everything if butt pad underwear did
exist when I was growing up I definitely
would have tried them out too now as an
adult I get my chance to and I'm really
excited these are the bubble buns these
have a nice cut they actually looked
just like underwear the foam insert sort
of like that material that would be in
like levels neck pillows I don't know
the foam is definitely giving more lifts
and perkiness it's sort of like a modest
big little boots just hopped out the
shower about to get dressed so you can
see from the front it's business as
usual no from the back I got a little
wedge situation going on
I am on my way to the spy I'm about to
walk up to my friend crazy who doesn't
know that I'm wearing these new butt pad
underwears so let's see how she responds
I would say those butt pads were a
success the only thing though is that
the sizing was totally off I think that
was like a kid sized the school using
the life out of my lady parts
overall positive experience it felt firm
I'm a muscular which is pretty cool it
didn't feel like cartoonish I'm really
looking forward to trying this one out
and it actually looks like on your rare
this is cute I have a feeling this one's
gonna work out okay
yeah this definitely gave me a bigger
ass but when I turn that's where the
surprise is that so I'm going to add a
party where there's gonna be lots of
dancing so I decided to try out this
number it doesn't have any inserts but
it does have a shape y'all can see and
bicycle to that dance party he's gonna
know so let's go find out so you think
you're gonna know when I'm wearing the
booty underwear yeah I know your butt
[Laughter]
feels like a big pillow if I didn't know
you before heads
I would think of its natural it's not
really shaking I think it'll work let's
try this baby out and then I I am back
from the dance party a lot of grinding I
was real nervous at first because I felt
like such a fraud and I thought someone
was just gonna clean at me and just be
like y'all those girls will burn a fake
but one of the dudes that came up I'm
just like winding my waist I told him
I'm wearing but pads for this story and
he was like oh no I can't tell
two thumbs up oh you're worried that
they're gonna notice do didn't notice so
final verdict drum roll please
if I had to choose between these phone
ones there what's the spine or the
preform shape ones that were out dancing
I would definitely go with the pre shape
to form ones I just like how curvy
around it made my booty overall I'm a
rock wit my natural booty I'm just gonna
work on toning my butt to eat your own
we have in these ideal images of what we
want our body to look like during the
butt pads gave me a really great chance
to find out what the grass is like on
the other side and it wasn't necessarily
greener if I could go back to my 16 year
old self you know the girl who thought
she was too skinny or wasn't curvy
enough I would let her know don't worry
you're gonna become so much more
confident and the skinnier and you might
think you want something different but
it'll likely turn out that you're just
more comfortable with what you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
