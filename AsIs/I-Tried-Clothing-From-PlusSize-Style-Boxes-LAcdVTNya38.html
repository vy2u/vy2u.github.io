style boxes for plus-size women
basically you give a company a lot of
information about things you like to
wear don't like to wear your
measurements and then based on that
information they curate a little box for
you that's full of clothes that you
presumably would want to buy plus
lifestyle boxes are a relatively new
thing so the three services I'm trying
are Guiney B D and company and plush a
lot of you lure behind these boxes is
that you don't have to go shopping you
do have to pay a styling fee for these
boxes so I'm wondering if I'm going to
get my money's worth it could go really
well it could go really poorly I really
want somebody to succeed so I pick out
the stuff in this box so it's not really
a surprise but I've already forgotten
what I picked out so it's a surprise to
me it's hard whoa oh this is way cuter
than I thought it would be the print is
adorable ten of ten the thing I like
most about this dress
Hoggett my nipples supposed to be up
here and instead it's down here because
I'm an underachiever the whole dress
just looks a little bit 2/10 like from
the side like there's a big old circus
happening under there which there is
from the hourglass body shape flexion I
got this little tea wrap dress oh it is
large like to wear this you need either
bigger boobs or more courage and I have
neither so I got this skirt from the
oval body shape collection there's a
little bit more administrative assistant
and I think I was like hey look at this
I just want to wiggle in it it was
really cool to be totally wrong about an
article of clothing time to open my dia
and company box skinny jean normally not
a big fan of pants but I wanted to give
pants a chance it was like two arm holes
then like a leg hole this sure is sheer
you can see through it the jeans are
awesome though they're really soft
they're like the softest puppy at puppy
camp the tailor
Claire dress sleeveless fit-and-flare
actually the colors are gorgeous it's
made for someone with bigger boobs than
me it is a little frustrating that a lot
of retailers assume that if you're
bigger you have like Z cup boobs overall
I think with the D in company box if
they had one more crack at it they
probably would have gotten it right just
got my third style box from plush zip
pocket culottes if you can wear culottes
effectively good for you
every 10 years or so fashion is like you
know what we should do culottes and we
buy them because we're ridiculous round
neck blouse there's a whole lot of love
it looked like the red Eminem's
grandmother it's a bag but it's a red
bag so people still notice you these
culottes are basically just short
bell-bottoms Lotus print tank it is at
least the right height for me sort of
it's very grandma summer vacation why
does this shirt come with a leash I feel
like plus-size women honestly have spent
a lot of time trying to not dress like
this lacy blue dress it's well made it
fits nicely
I enjoy the pattern it's kind of my
style I would pay that much money if it
was in a color I liked which for someone
who's styling me who's never met me
before is pretty good kimono style black
maxi I already have a black wrap dress I
like it a lot you can wear a black wrap
dress anywhere brunch
coven meeting it is dope I love the slit
got some kick action just kind of flows
the plush box was the highest highs and
the lowest what the Fox of plus-size
fashion I was able to find at least one
thing I liked in every box my personal
favorite was the Guiney B box because I
enjoy controlling things however if you
are a lady who is on a more of a budget
and you enjoy the traditional surprises
that come with a style box the D in
company box is probably for you if you
have a little bit more money to spend
and you're willing to take more of a
risk then try the plush box
overall I was super excited to get three
plus size style boxes little own one so
the fact that these exist are excellent
and great it's totally worth the fun
surprise you learn things that you might
not know about what you like fashion
wise and I have some new clothes now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
