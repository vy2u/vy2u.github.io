this week I'm going to try to style my
hair everyday I usually wear my hair
down then I'll put it halfway up then
I'll put it all the way up and those are
my three sort of basic hair styles when
it's down it can be really big and I
kind of get self-conscious about it when
I put it up it just kind of looks like I
scoured the internet I found some
tutorials for hair types that are close
to mine I'm gonna try them out I'm gonna
see what people at work think and I feel
like this could be a whole new avenue of
creative expression who knows the first
day I think I'm gonna do space buns just
because a is something that I have at
least attempted before there's no
tutorial it's just making two little
bottoms on your head so I'm gonna ease
into it with that if you don't get a
part try and do in the middle so hard to
part like the straight part the tough
part for me is making sure they have the
equal amounts of carrying them and also
that they're at the same point okay this
one is way further but I feel like
that's just the best that's gonna happen
I guess I'll put some maker spray on it
that's what we go to bring right in my
face
I guess my biggest fear is that these
will come loose and I'll just end up
looking like an understudy from cast the
musical what do you think about MySpace
but they do match you
you're a very galactic person so these
buns are still moving up one problem
that I have encounter is that my head
seems to itch just like right directly
under them it's a pencil I don't want to
mess it up the other thing about my
hairstyle it's good it's cool what you
say this is cute I like it it's really
fun I guess yeah I've never seen you do
anything this is what I would do I in
fact I just want you to picture your
frame with my face in it okay I'll
Photoshop that for the video it's the
end of hair day one buns are there they
definitely came out a little bit I
definitely do feel like the hairstyle is
me and something that I would probably
do again tomorrow I am going to yoga in
the morning the time between that and
going to work is very short so it's
gonna be a big challenge for me to be
able to do my hair after yoga and to do
like a style it's gonna be a tight
squeeze it's stuck it's tied in a knot
I just got home from yoga and normally
it doesn't make me that sweaty but this
time it did so I have to take a shower
before I go to work the downside of that
is that my hair will not be dry enough
to style so I guess I'm going to style
it maybe when I get to work today I'm
gonna try a triple bun it's mostly
taking place at the back of my head so
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to really
see it
this kind of tends to get really frizzy
when it's pulled back so there's not a
lot of hair left to be honest there's
not a lot of hair left I don't know if
it's gonna be enough for buns so she
does offer a thing that says if there
you don't have enough hair to do two
buns so I'm gonna do two buns
oh god my hair is not long enough
so yesterday was a bit of a fail on the
hairstyling front this is what my hair
looks like currently I'd like it to look
slightly better than this we're gonna
try an updo situation a piece from here
twist actually feels pretty secure okay
that it looks like she does it on the
other side
it doesn't look as pretty as hers but
it's not terrible from the front it's
business yes and then in the back it's
just like whoa if that's like it seems
like it took a lot of effort to do that
is he here she is somebody who you
support a lot of curly hairstyles do i
yeah I know like my sporting of I mean
illusion right now that's great yeah
I'll show video you bumping a little one
right now I've been rocking this since
high school
it looks really really beautiful from
the back I want to try it I don't do
this one I do like two buttons hair down
like momma but I like this a lot it
feels like you could wear this to an
event so I don't know if you can see but
yeah it's just all kind of coming out
and I have to keep taking out the bobby
pins and putting them back in and I just
don't really want to be doing that every
30 minutes or so I kind of look like a
princess who had a wild night maybe I
had one too many champagnes and her hair
comes undone does not seem practical
it's completely undone in the back like
there's little pieces hanging off and I
just can't you know maintain hair like
that for you know a special event I
think it's a good option
it's the morning time for another
hairstyle today I'm going to be trying
braid it up - it looks like it's sort of
two braids one on each side meeting in a
vine oh there's a bobby pin in my hair
from yesterday
I have braided before at least so I feel
confident in that respect I know exactly
what I'm doing and my looks a hundred
percent like the girl
what do you think about my hairstyle
today oh yeah it's cool
you've naturally curly hair so kind of
just like you didn't even notice them
yeah hmm
I see human so what's good love it chic
romantic braids does the shooting y'all
does this feel different for you uh this
one definitely makes me feel like a
schoolmarm what I didn't even like I
feel like of this so yeah yeah I didn't
notice like not in a bad way I thought
you just did your hair I'm like how do
they look those it look good on your
brain I think it's really it's a
surprise braid because when I look at
you straight on you can't tell it's
braid but as soon as you know you give
me a little movement it's like a
surprise braid which is always the best
types of braid so I like it
this day is almost over honestly and I
have to say this is pretty decent it's
holding it together I definitely have
like a halo of frizz going on but that's
just to be expected it's a very hot day
there's only bobby pins really and like
one elastic and it is holding very it is
cinched I like it I like the braid to
birds that's cool it's giving me very
much
Princess Leia and Return of the Jedi
yeah it was 90 degrees today and having
my hair kind of all tied up in these
braids was really great just taking out
my bun in the back my elastics broke
it's another day which team eat it's
another day which means it's time for
another hairstyle
I truly am growing tired of this I do
not want to do it anymore that I'm very
unhappy okay so this one is super simple
but sometimes simple is better and it
seems like I'm not capable of doing
anything difficult so this is a French
twist half French twist and then taking
an elastic and making like a little
she's got this two sides oh my hair is
not a lie enough for this either oh god
this is the worst day Wi-Fi I'm doing
this and then I guess we did the same
it's not totally clear what's happening
in these pictures I mean it shows very
making ponytails I don't know where
they're going it just sucks cuz like I
can't do it it looks bad I have to go to
work there's no instructions it's just
like now put pins the places we all
obviously don't put them no wonder some
just don't know where to put the pins
they're just got like random luckily
with curly hair you know it just kind of
looks the same what no matter what you
do especially when it's up so what I'm
beginning to learn I think is that this
is something that only should be
attempted by professionals and not by me
it appears I have a stray a little stray
hair here you don't want to say still
you know what cursed me that I probably
could have gone like training from
professional or something for this video
but that's not obviously not something
that everybody has access to so I opted
not to am i regretting that decision
I wasn't paying that's the way you like
to that looks tough not like you look
glamorous Wow
we give her a Roman goddess hairstyle
today okay from the front you're just
like oh like this looks like some messy
bun or like messy updo but then once you
turn around look at these clasps like
you can like see all of your different
highlights it's the end of the day this
is definitely my least favorite I feel
like I look like a mess from the front
people said they liked it though it's
definitely one where I've unprompted
people complimented me on this hairstyle
which is very strange to me because I
feel so uncomfortable in it one size
does not fit all in terms of tutorials
everybody's hair is different
everybody's haircuts different there's
no way everything is gonna work for you
really what's worked best is just like
modifying pre-existing styles to kind of
suit what I have definitely my favorite
has been the space buns I think I'm
definitely gonna revisit that one it's a
her style that felt very me it was
really easy to do can't do a hairstyle
if it's not working for you don't feel
bad cuz I don't meet you men whore but I
kinda thought it would be good at this
and I'm not gonna</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
