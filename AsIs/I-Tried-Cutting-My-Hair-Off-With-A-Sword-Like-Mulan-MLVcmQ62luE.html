there's no turning back now I'm so
stressed
hey dudes welcome back to our laboratory
I'm Chrissy and I'm sissy so we were
reading some of the comments on your
last video and a lot of you were saying
some pretty interesting stuff like what
one comment was so bad they made our
legal team cringe can you cut your hair
like Mulan from Disney one Swift sword
wave this sounds extremely dangerous so
we knew we had to do it here's the deal
Mulan is a teen in a time when people
have to like fight for their country so
she's like oh shit dude I gotta like
pretend to be a guy so my dad doesn't
die because I'm a boss bitch and I'm
also really sweet there is a hit that
you'll see it's like pouring rain okay
she like hugs a pole runs full speed
with drenched hair into a pitch it's
nothing but a curtain she's like I'm
gonna do it right here right now
and I almost there's fuck scissors looks
at herself in her sword reflection she's
like shit I would look it with a bob
maybe she didn't say that and then be
like I'm just gonna cut it all up and
then she just like puts in a high bun
and she said bye wait I could do it dude
with a fucking sword I'd look cute with
it but Johnny without a bob lon
right right right all right
I'm shook hi how's it going good who are
you I am master Bruce Van from the
Shaolin Temple in China movie Mulan he
tell us a little bit about the Chinese
history mulan take place tuned and
Lordan and started dynasty let me tell
you how the dynasty work okay if I
happen to be the king of this dynasty
why if you want to be the king you gotta
kill me in move ah she cuts off her hair
with a sword in one swipe do you think
that's possible I think it is possible
that's all she doesn't hold back
oh you look to her the person makes the
weapon not the weapon makes the person
this is deep I'm feeling inspired and
also like I want to kill someone at the
same time what are all of the things
that could possibly go wrong cutting
your hair design there's many
possibilities she does anything wrong
she could usually cut her neck she could
have maybe accidentally shut her head or
if the sword fall she could cut somebody
out I would say it is 90% to 100%
dangerous so she's putting her life at
risk by cutting her hair do you think a
bob is worth that today we will be
learning the straight sword which is one
of the more major weapon of the martial
arts sissy you ready to do this that's
very important that we don't die cause
you only live once right this one right
here is the old Chinese sort that they
used in mula sissy hold it
which sword should sissy use to cover
her according to her Heights this is
what we call a double-edged sword
okay see this is pink he's gonna turn
wet when this blood oh my hat says long
Chung long means the dragon within the
track and so the dragon within you being
able to recreate this moment make Disney
proud and make Mulan proud by doing this
over again is just something that we
will do our best to bring on the dragon
in you yes watch love it you see how to
learn the basics of martial arts sword
fighting you know you can't learn like
thousands of years worth of history in
like a couple hours but sissy fucking
killed it
I was amazed that she was able to chop
the wood in half I couldn't help but be
inspired to see her like actually moving
around in something that wasn't high
heels was a really big deal for me in
order to chop my hair with a sword there
are several things that I'm gonna have
to accomplish I'm gonna get some toilet
paper but Canada is my hair I'd have to
think about holding out my arm bending
it out of angle so that when the sword
comes through it doesn't cut me and then
at the same time I'm straight through my
hair at a 45 degree angle so not 46 not
44 but 45 is the magic number for
tomorrow tomorrow is going to be very
interesting because you only get one
shot baby
today it's my last day in u.s. sissie
tomorrow I'll be seeing you as the
legendary you know what's the difference
between legend and legendary dary
yes tomorrow you're gonna be the
legendary Mulan it is not a matter of
how to I think since he's gonna do
tomorrow it is a matter of how she's
gonna think she's gonna do tomorrow am I
just gonna kill myself am I gonna give
myself about a haircut she could
accomplish the goal of cutting her hair
with the real sort if she believed that
she could do it a warrior does not stop
Mulan does not stop blonde keeps on
going I hope nobody dies in the set
either okay let's do this one two one
two there you go hey sissy you spent all
day training with Bruce but today things
are getting serious I'm like
legitimately nervous oh the sword is
being sharpened today actually going to
be a weapon there are people around the
set
just hoping I don't kill myself on
accident you won't right I know this is
fucking Disney and Disney seems chill
but this experiment not chill at all you
have to stay serious safety precautions
I'm not fucking around don't try this at
home
teens adults babies you can't try out
either what we're gonna do today to make
sure no one dies we're going to have you
wear full body armor protection around
your neck arm protection you're not
gonna cover their nails though because
those are cute also your face is out
because you have to cut your hair so you
can't wear a helmet which is a
precaution that we should have taken but
we did it sorry but we do have a
paramedic on site you cannot get hurt we
love you you want you to be here
ready to cut us a little hair off ready
as I'm ever gonna be all right let's go
we've been preparing for this moment
it's finally here there's no turning
back now

oh my god cut some of it it didn't go
through all of it oh boy holy shit you
have half a bob I have literally half a
bob right now

tighter we're gonna take a smaller
portion

attempt she's gonna saw the shit out of
her hair
