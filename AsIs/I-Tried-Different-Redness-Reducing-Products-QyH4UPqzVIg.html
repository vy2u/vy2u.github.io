be the same this month were trying the
most expensive redness reducing products
from Amazon Sephora and Ulta there's
this hyperpigmentation on my face about
six months ago I stopped taking my birth
control when I did that this all went to
 the redness in my skin I would say
is not severe but it is kind of all over
when Megan the producer asked me if I
wanted to be in the video about
something that helps with redness I
jumped at the chance we're gonna see if
this will go away with some fancy-ass
product I'm trying the most expensive
redness reducing products from Ulta
Marad Marad Marad this is it I don't
know how to pronounce it this month I
will be capturing youth it's soothing
and correcting redness using peptides
from cotton that sounds scientific okay
looks like any other kind of fancy
bottle I don't even know it's in this
yet I have pretty high hopes I guess in
a month we'll find out how silly those
hopes wonders
I just put three drops on my hands it
said to put two to three drops the area
that I want to focus on the redness is
here so far so good
this stuff there
blew it smells chemically blew it burns
 well that goes away day one time
one in the bag it really burns I was not
expecting that does it really say
exactly how much so I'm just gonna wing
it
sure it's very thin smells kind of like
a facial it's been about a minute minute
and a half and it's still kind of sticky
it's definitely a step that requires a
little bit of time I haven't started to
see like permanent changes but there is
this sort of magic hour 25 to 30 minutes
after I put it on when I'm driving to
work and I'm like wait does my skin look
super even right now we're on day three
and I'm trying to give my face a break I
normally do wear a lot of product to
cover this I didn't even have this bad
acne when I was in high school I need to
go to a dermatologist I think I'm gonna
go to a dermatologist it's been about a
week of using this guy I can't honestly
say that I've seen much of a difference
yet but it's only been a week so I'm I
haven't given up yet so I'm actually at
the dermatologists office right now and
see what you say about this to be honest
not seeing a whole lot of change I will
say that like 20 minutes from now I
might notice that it's a little less
gray but then it just always back the
next morning I went to the dermatologist
and he basically said everything that is
happening to my face is completely
hormonal and he said the best thing to
do for this is use Cetaphil and just
stop using the lotion so I have to bow
out gracefully of this it feels nice
it's soft and like it smells good it
makes my skin feel
nice for lasting redness I'm not quite
sure it's doing anything I look in the
mirror this morning and sort of felt
better now that I'm looking again I
don't maybe there's not a change I think
I just want there to be a change
I feel super conflicted about this
journey I've taken this month because
some days I'm like oh my god I think it
looks great it looks so much better and
other days I'm like literally nothing
has changed the month is over and I have
thrown my redness reducing product away
I feel like it doesn't make any
difference at all it's kind of good to
confirm that even though it's expensive
it does not mean that it's effective
that being said maybe the redness in my
skin is due to something that that
product just isn't made to fix I'm glad
I tried it out it doesn't feel like a
waste of time because I would have
wondered otherwise so you might have
noticed bulb leaves now as is but don't
worry you'll still get all the same
