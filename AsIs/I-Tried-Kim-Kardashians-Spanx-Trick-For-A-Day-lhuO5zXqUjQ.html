so a little while ago on her app Kim
Kardashian said that when she's feeling
a little bit heavier
she literally puts on two pairs of like
Spanx so I got these Spanx higher-power
shorty I've worn Spanx before and like
they're fine they definitely like suck
you in a little bit more but like I'm
hoping that this trick will work for me
and like maybe make me a little more
confident this should be an Olympic
event itself oh jeez this is this is
just the first one too so I've got the
first one Ron it was a struggle I broke
a sweat here comes number two going over
my thighs
oh that was like not that bad okay I
can't breathe but uh bogus yeah I think
I look good up here there's the second
pair of Spanx is definitely doing some
extra work before you could see every
little like lump and indentation and now
it's like it's just much smoother I
think I think I can last if Kim could do
it I can do it right so I'm eating lunch
right now hmm
everything is it goes inside me it's
just like it travels travels travels and
as soon as it gets here it's like
Chrissy how do you think I look today
feel acute you look hot you look
different do you look different yeah
I don't know what if I were to tell you
that I'm wearing not one but two pairs
of Spanx today it feel really bad forget
do you think I look like sleeker oh you
you look great
it's perhaps subtle only because I see
you every day look at where it's
supposed to be that's where like the
role is in the back it's like pinching
my skin out it does not look good I
think that's really was making it like
extra hard to breathe and I don't
understand how Kim avoids the role is
she's like pinning it to her bra or
something I have to like lean back and
sit like this to get it to like feel
okay I just want this day to be over I
don't think there's any way that she's
wearing two pairs of Spanx at the same
time I don't buy it just a clever
marketing ploy like Kim Kardashian and
Spanx to get you to buy two of something
that you don't need instead of one of
something think Tony nobody's body is so
horrible but it can't be in a body con
dress like all you need for a bodycon
dress is a body you don't need Spanx you
don't need any other kind of like body
shaper there's no reason to put yourself
through like that kind of pain and
discomfort just so it like removes one
little lump or something not worth it
people can get used to looking at your
body however the way it is she probably
has a team with like who have like
fishing line and Crisco to help her like
get into the ship she probably just
stands there like a bald shore her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
