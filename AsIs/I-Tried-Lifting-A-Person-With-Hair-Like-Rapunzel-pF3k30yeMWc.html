good welcome back to our laboratory
I'm Salam and I'm Chrissy all right
dudes here's the deal if she can love
Disney skin love drama luckily we love
debunking so we're gonna get a full
season of Disney themed drama coming
your way what's up first
Salam Tom when you think of the most
iconic Disney Princess hair who do you
think of Rapunzel
right that's just like deep dive inter
of puzzles life she's a teen she's
trapped in a tower and her mom sucks
okay
her mom is basically a witch who
kidnapped her and uses like her hair
powers to make herself look hotter aka
younger but younger doesn't always mean
hot early don't follow beauty standards
okay the only way that she could get her
mom up there is if she throws her hair
through that tiniest window her mom's
like hey let me just like a little
pulley he like latches it in there and
so she's all OOP and then she like lets
it go and then her mom's literally just
like puts her foot in it and then it
Rapunzel looks like and then her mom's
like I suck hey then they chat and hang
out and then that's like her only social
interaction for the day that's the stuff
that's real stuck to her how does her
neck not break actually if you think
about like all your teen probs and
you're like Rapunzel's going through it
so we know we're puzzles a boss that's
vicious so we need to figure out if you
actually can lift a human with your hair
through a pulley system we're gonna need
to talk to a physics expert because I
don't know anything about police and
we're gonna have to get my hair dyed but
I just got my hair done
so um this is something for you great
sure a pencil yeah I'm doing this for
Rapunzel
also I know you love your mom but like
she's stirred up don't listen to her I
know you don't have internet and you
can't see this her only friend was a
lizard man that's so sad love yous all
this is for you Flint ah my name is
Jenna
Irvin I'm the science program specialist
at cats based Jill's Museum in Pasadena
California so will you tell us the
physics behind
rapunzel pulling up her mom with just
one little pulley so but basically
looking at our two masses one mass is
Rapunzel's mom and one mass is Rapunzel
and they're being connected over a
pulley by a single rope so you think the
hair can live to human yeah Oh easily
the hair isn't the problem it's the neck
breakage so her neck wants to stay in
her body vertically but if your force is
moving horizontally it's going to map it
that way and then you would die yeah so
use the leverage of your arms and the
leverage of your like legs and torso to
how cool that is
so do you think that this is possible I
think it's possible okay without dying
um oh my god it's David Day he fixed
that sword situation of a haircut let me
just lay this out for you
like I want to be Rapunzel I want a 70
foot long blonde gorgeous train of hair
that I can like whip around like pull
people up with and a yacht attached to
that to life right we're at it right
let's just pull the yacht in here can
actually hold up to 12 times Wow so do
it 12 times is about the size of two
elephants what how many feet of hair is
impossible because you would have to be
growing your hair at a half an inch a
month and be anywhere from 125 to
dinosaur ears so what are some alternate
solutions to get that Rapunzel hair vibe
so we've created a head of hair for you
60 inches which is 5 feet she is right
here oh oh she keeps coming
feels like my dog so it's synthetic hair
to kind of mimic the strands of hair on
your head well I already feel like it's
a part of me
I've got extensions put in my hair like
multiple times so I know that this is a
process like Crissy this is actually
going to be sewn into your hair so let's
talk about the dangers of what this hair
could do for you right
your head could snap at any moment your
edges could get snatched snatched right
off your scalp could be removed what
well on God full-on gone gone girl its
whole entire process is probably gonna
take anywhere from four to five hours
that's short girl did you eat lunch
we're gonna sew it in a track-by-track
and the reason that we're gonna do that
is so your head doesn't move all right
um I'm gonna get some snacks and let's
do this
thank you guys this is sweet you're one
of us one of us
Selam are you ready to see me for the
first time I'm ready my hands over my
eyeballs okay doll lookee yet don't look
don't touch me with the hair I'm gonna
freak out oh my god no your princess
yeah this hair is as long as my body how
does that feel are you not like
struggling ah I am so today we're gonna
test the strength of your hair and
you're gonna be lifting a human
we couldn't find a human who would sign
the waiver so we have it dummy oh that's
fine are you scared at all
yeah yeah I am you know here's the thing
this is sewn into my freaking head
that's your Scott now meaning if this
little dummy man comes along and I drop
it all 110 pounds gonna be like Boop
meaning I could break my neck all the
little holes of my hair follicles could
bleed profusely from my head
Rapunzel made it look so easy and I
haven't even done anything yet but I'm
like already sweating okay well before
we do anything with the dummy cuz that's
dangerous
we're gonna try a test with a frying pan
and then we're gonna try a test with a
TV we have our paramedic here whatever
you do do not try this at home no no no
no
we need to test your theory about the
hair being able to hold the weight of
two elements we're going to start it off
kind of easy we're gonna use this frying
pan one of you can help put it through
the hole so this is really good because
this is a lighter object Wow looks like
you've done this before
absolutely this is our first test we're
just starting out small full frying pan
here you ready
should I get like a little like a little
clock still swing like no why we're all
swinging but we're gonna swing together
yeah how do we go from a frying pan to a
TV I'm sweaty oh my god I am so scared
okay we'll stand up should I hold your
hair no no no don't hold anything take
your hands away from the TV
watch your feet you should start okay
I'm still holding it don't worry you're
not one finger at a time okay there we
go oh god I'm sweating to it I'm not
even doing all right dude now it is
officially time I'm going to go on this
little Tower eat our thing and I'm gonna
throw my hair over it and we're gonna
add a few little rope inches on to the
end so that way I can like get the full
Rapunzel experience and then I'm gonna
like see if I can lift a hundred and ten
freakin pounds I'm really scared for you
why I was freaking out a lot during that
TV part you know we're here oh my god
you like my face your tower yes you look
like a beautiful princess just like
although my people clearly we already
know the strength of hair now it's about
testing my strength okay I took some
safety precautions got some little
gloves gloves with some little grippy
grips like I'm already tired
how are you really tired because I'm
stressed all right I'm gonna get a
little leverage here you can do it one
two keep pulling you got it okay
well you got the chest up and you got
the head up okay look at going
one two three go keep going
harder you're almost kind of okay it's
like halfway off the ground before they
get the same thing what is harder okay
I'm gonna try a new method in which I
turn around the other that's not what
the friends'll did but do it you know
what okay
all right that's I'm having like a real
moment I'm not as strong as I thought I
was it's really heartbreaking you know
like I really thought I could like lifts
her mom but I can't I don't think you're
so close I think it's worth one more try
do you want to come up here with me and
try we're both up here we're up here if
I can lift 50 pounds and you can lift 50
pounds then the others they're not 110
so we can do it that's I feel more
distress with you up here no I do not
mean it's just like we're in tight
quarters now two one go
we got the bitch that's right you're
evil
we did it you did it feel like we still
need to see if one person can let this
though yeah like me you like a strong
human becomes wealthy yeah I Wasi tell
us about how strong you are
I don't want to overhype myself no
you're never over oversell yourself come
on okay okay well on a good day I can
deadlift around 205 pounds Mitch are you
on and I don't know you know work okay
and I'll just be like hovering if you
let go you gotta say it okay I'll let
you guys I don't want to be like given
like mom she could die okay cool I won't
let that happen to you all right ready
yeah three two one okay I'm gonna let it
go all right very slowly very slowly
thank you I'm surprised it must be the
almonds that I ate right before this
Rapunzel is you know uh you um I'll be
there once I
this freakin worked so in conclude you
can lift an entire human body with your
little hair hairs if you're strong
enough
I feel like Rapunzel was super tone like
she must have been in that tower just
like lifting what she was doing yeah
maybe I'm one of those like bars that
you put in your doorway looks like Oh
silver puns lifting a human body with
her own hair so what sort of traumatic
event should we go through next you
decide your hair dance get in you hear
you dance she white sock okay I'm
getting tangled in it I'm not gonna
touch it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
