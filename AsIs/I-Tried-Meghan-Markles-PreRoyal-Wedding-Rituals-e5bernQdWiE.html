Saturday when she marries Prince Harry
at st. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle
along with most of England and America
I'm obsessed with Meghan Markel she's
just so cool you know she bucks world
traditions and wears jeans and not
pantyhose two royal events she also
rocks that messy low bond plus she's not
having fruitcake at her wedding which is
like good on you Meghan you have your
cake and eat it too Oh Meghan I also
have a ton in common she's getting
married soon I'm getting married soon
her name has a silent age my name has a
sign late follow me but don't talk to me
she acts on the small screen and I act
on the even smaller screen she's about
to become an American princess well
technically a duchess but let's not get
into that and I'm an American whose name
means princess in Hebrew okay so maybe
not like a ton in common but we're about
to have a whole lot more in common
because I'm gonna try to do all the
things Meghan does in order to get ready
for a big day that's right I'm gonna go
on morning runs use her celeb indoors
face lotion take that crazy Pilates
machine class and get a buckle massage
which is probably not what you think it
is no just getting to know your mouth a
little and hopefully then I can be as
cool and chill a bride as Meghan Markel
Meghan says exercising keeps her
grounded as well as in shape so I'd
started doing what she do I took a run
in the park she follows that up with
meditation so I did that as kind of
feels like a wasted time but then again
it's like nice to have a little rest I
think honestly I started the day feeling
pretty great it was good idea thanks
Megan so after that I've tried that luck
skin gel that Megan is rumored to use
botulin its dubbed Botox in a bottle and
I don't even understand how that is
possible but I implicitly trust
everything Megan puts on her face
because she is gorgeous then I went to
this wedding-dress expert to try to see
if I could steal Megan's actual Bridal
style for the day I'm here with Susan
spring and Susan is going to give us
information on wedding dresses whatever
she wears is gonna definitely come
crashing down on Bridal fashions she
couldn't give me the inside scoop on
what design Megan had ax
chosen but she could give me her
educated guess Megan Marvel definitely
could lean towards the Bohemia
but I think that she's going to follow
the other trend which is beautiful
classic ball gown because Megan's
a pseudo sort of princess she'll have
some sort of lace or beading she's gonna
have a super long train because of the
Cathedral something really giant is
gonna overwhelm her so something fitted
and chances are very covered there are
some companies that produce copycat
dresses almost overnight and with Kate
Middleton I must have gotten 15 calls
from fashion magazines asking if we had
a little chubby sweater like the one
that she had worn to her evening
reception so you never know what part of
her outfit is gonna be the one that
people want to mimic the most Megan
reportedly will wear two dresses so she
could have both but my wedding budget
only includes room for one dress so I'm
just gonna have to take that chance that
I will be copying the soon to be
ubiquitous wedding style then because
Megan loves to work I got into this
Royal approved Pilates class Megan Marco
does this really intense tape
make up for
Pilates well okay I couldn't find
exactly that but I did find a similar
crazy machine Pilates class I'm making
Marco puzzle first you know the classic
machine so we're gonna try
they kind of like medieval don't they
they look like medieval torture machines
what's this machine called cadillac the
cadillac that's able to reform and
that's their form all right was intense
cool yeah megan has balance and serious
sports train maybe a little too intense
for me after that it was time to relax
with the type of facial that megan
reportedly recommends i am going to be
performing my signature facial treatment
the buccal facial and to be clear we're
not taking out a belt buckle and hitting
me with it no no no it's yeah I am
trying to prepare for my wedding the
same way making Markel is first and she
apparently loves this she does and a lot
of other celebs love it as well but Moss
JLo it's pretty popular and it's a
natural alternative new things like
Botox and fillers Megan walks in she
lies down then what so I start the
treatment by just looking at your skin
analyzing and see what's going on and
then I move on to cleansing facial
cupping which kind of gets the lymph
going hey this isn't a fluffy facial for
creating a micro trauma to the skin by
the repetition of the movements so that
the skin can jump-start the production
of collagen and elastin now we're gonna
be doing the inner mouth massage which
is the wow factor and all of this the
buccal facial includes a massage in your
mouth yeah at first I was pretty
horrified how could make him do this to
me open up
getting to know your mouth a little bit
feels rude brings anyone a bit your
finger no never
please don't I work inside even outside
simultaneously and I'm able to really
access the tiny muscles that we really
never stimulate this area's what makes a
lot of people look like they're frowning
as we get older sounds like this helps
with the resting bitchface it's exactly
and you know what it actually wasn't bad
it was kind of like a facelift about the
surgery why I made you look like you're
20 now
Megan Merkel is like 36 yes me no way
yeah she doesn't she does no well she
gets the buccal facial yeah afterwards
not only was my body tired from Pilates
but my face was tired from the facial
workout walking him ready for her
wedding Megan is avoiding alcohol but
she still finishes the day with a glass
of red wine in order to learn wine from
all that stress her wine blog tag was
named after her favorite team e'en Ella
wine which costs around 90 to 120 bucks
what did you figure out I didn't have
that much budget remaining so I settled
for a bottle of $10 wine and go up down
a class or two or three okay so being
like Meghan Markel was way harder than I
thought sure she looks cool and chill
but she puts in the work to get there
and then I Anna I'm getting ready for a
wedding for like 150 people eighteen
point seven million people watch Prince
William and Kate Middleton's wedding on
BBC one she will have the pressure of
millions of pairs of eyes on her I don't
so I'm going to enjoy it but I'll
definitely be following her
recommendation for a daily glass of wine
to Harry and Megan congratulations on
your wedding
that's good I can imagine how good to
like $90 bottle of wine that she drinks
is I don't have very high class taste</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
