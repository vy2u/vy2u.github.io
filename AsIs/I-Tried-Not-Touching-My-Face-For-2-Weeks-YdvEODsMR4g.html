two weeks you will touch your face in 15
minutes so you wanna yes I am doing this
video where I'm not trying to touch my
face for two weeks okay
but I wanted to know don't do it how
about taking strangers no your words are
dirty why do you touch your face on this
they have to do do this video
oh I touch my face all the time because
I have like you can see I have like
little scabs and stuff here
oh so you pick your like picked up my
acne
a long time yeah it is do you think I
can do it
how's way I don't think you're gonna be
able to do that because you just do it
without thinking how many times a day do
you see me touching my face a lot
yeah whatever scabs you have a feeling
pimple and it's gaps are you always
picking at it hmm
like when do I usually touch me whenever
you're nervous because I've already
three years this red one it's squeezed
it it is now an hour into this challenge
and I've already slightly failed because
I hitched my nose and it was itchy I had
no choice and I'm touching my face again
great yeah I have like very chapped lips
and I tend to pick up that dead skin us
as well which is also another habit I
want to break tomorrow I'm gonna have a
meeting and it's gonna be a long meeting
so we'll see if my boredom may get the
best of me or if I can stay engaged and
actually pay attention so I'm just
getting to work I have no makeup on it's
gonna be an interesting day gonna be
good I just got out of my long ass
meeting it was all day and I realized
when I'm bored I touched my face more so
I had to find new ways of entertaining
my boredom and what happened was I
started picking at my thumb and you can
see it's like kind of bloody and
bleeding and everything I'm trying to
think of a new strategy so when I rest
my hand on my face
I'm not having old Tom on my face maybe
this so I just caught myself picking up
my lip it's all dry but I really wanted
to strip off all that dry skin so maybe
I do have a picking peeling fetish when
I was little and insecure and had a lot
of acne issues on my skin and so I would
just keep picking at it because I was
nervous or anxious about something or
just generally bored and just wanted to
get all these flaws off my face and as I
grew up it just translated to my adult
life look at my struggle I'm gonna do
this strategy here watch this chest and
it's gone
I poop out of my eyes and I look into a
mirror and I kind of
but I'm not gonna do that today so after
doing all of my foundation and then
halfway doing my eyeliner as you can see
face it I realized I was touching my
face as I was doing it so I'm gonna try
and do my eyeliner without touching my
face
it's okay it's okay I was just I'm
consciously catching myself scratching
this little devil pimple here and it's
definitely a little welled up now and a
little bit angry at me the whole
self-control and willpower has really
grown in me just last week and a half
for me to not touch my face is huge its
monumental you can ask any of my family
members you can ask any of my friends
man that is tough for me I'm kind of
getting tired of not being able to touch
my face for things that I need to touch
my face for and that was yummy
hi day today and lunch is pizza so I put
my hair up so I will eliminate the
factor of
hair in my face and touching my face
with three people two hands
I have coverage because 15
go up here I'm okay here is an updated
tally all the days so far and done which
I've touched my face
we are Stacey's decimates and we have
been tasked with it trying to get her to
touch her face or at least just annoy
her which is something we're used to
doing on a daily basis
easy kid no it's easy that counts you
can't roll your face on your desk
I was just sabotaged by my desk mates
I'm gonna stop tickling your face I'm
walking my dog right now so I didn't
vlog much today because I didn't touch
my face that much now we're watching a
mr. knowledge how do you think how do
you feel I feel good I feel like have
you noticed any difference I've noticed
that I haven't broken out in a long time
and whenever I touch my face now it
feels weird to touch my face because I
haven't touched it so like you created
like a habit of not touching it's not
good yeah I am
broke my bad habit it's the end of the
two weeks of not touching my face and
man was it hard I didn't realize how
many times I subconsciously touched my
face not to do my face for two weeks
definitely made a huge difference I
noticed that my skin was glowy er I
don't know if that's a word I forgot
what my face felt like and then when I
touched it it was so much softer than
before I didn't have any new pimples or
blackheads emerge because I wasn't
touching my face I don't want to have to
deal with pimples anymore so this is
gonna be my attempt of just having clear
skin for the rest of my life
