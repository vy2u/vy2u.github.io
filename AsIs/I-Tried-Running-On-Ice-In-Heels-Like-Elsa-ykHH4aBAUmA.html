I'm still gonna recap it anyway sorry
Elsa is having this beautiful coronation
her sister is all like oh my god I met a
really hot man and he's all like let's
get married I've known you for a day and
also is like what the hell leaving and
she's like like shooting out of her hand
the fountain lights and all the people
in the town are like you have monster
and then she's like you know what I
can't take this anymore because someone
just called me a monster and that is
rude the only way out is Elaine she
takes one little step and bam the lake
turns to ice she's full speed run across
the lake in her little low fees slow
first for those non to know every step
she takes it's like ice ice ice ice ice
ice ice and she just runs with her cape
flowing in the wind and then onna takes
one step and she's like she can't even
take one step on the ice
pathetic pathetic later in the movie
takes it to the next level and puts on
little heels so what we need to test
today is whether or not you can run on
Ice in loafers and heels I feel like I
want to do this I'm a really big frozen
fan you want to run on ice I do why I
mean I just want to be Elsa yeah I mean
she's cool oh my god it is so cold in
here what it's snowing I guess so sir
who are you my name is Niki Yuhas and
I'm a science youtuber professional so
how is ice form that's exactly you need
what is known as a nucleation site like
a piece of dust or a hair or whatever or
somebody touches the water ice crystals
will actually begin to form around that
nucleation site and we'll cliff rate
outwards from the area so when Elsa puts
her foot on the water and then it turns
to ice you're saying that's real that
could happen it could happen on earth
I've heard the good news we're ready for
the crazy condition she shoots magic out
of her hand so let's just say for
example in this universe her feet can
get to the temperature of absolute so
her foot is a frozen piece of ice so 50
daddy but like freeze-dried food
she's a freeze-dried foot more like her
foot by stepping on to the water is
actually sucking up the energy and force
freezing the water where her foot is
thus creating the nucleation site thus
proliferating the ice it's possible
basically to sum it up she could
probably do it I mean yeah basically
that's like yeah that's pretty much what
it is yeah I'm a visual person and I
need to like see some freaking evidence
that what you're saying is real what a
lot because we have an experiment that
actually shows instant ice whoa I like
experiment and anybody can do this in
huh you get purified or distilled water
put it in your freezer for around two
hours and thirty minutes or so strike it
with your hand and then that creates the
nucleation site and perforates the ice
right to the bottom you can actually see
the ice being formed exactly what it
looked like try that one too before it
goes I've eaten so many times on ice why
is it so slippery ice is liquid on the
outside so the coefficient of friction
is less so it's slippery on that surface
it is exchanging back and forth between
the solid phase and the liquid phase the
ice is confused what it is why there is
a thin layer of water on the outside of
ice it's still unknown we know about
water yet what year is this your meter
so Elsa is a magic it's okay we're just
basic people so if there is a solid
sheet of ice how can you run on that ice
without falling to not ever run and then
stop so if you were to continue to run
in my gallivant you do a full running
example firstly antilope thing I would
run something like this
sweet adorable again look at that ice
rod that so cute
what are some dangerous that I should
take it to account the most dangerous
part would be slipping and hitting your
head especially because like when you do
the whiplash thing back the speed and
velocity that your head actually hits
the ground is a lot faster than you
falling don't want that so I would wear
a helmet you could sprain your wrist you
kid maybe take some skin off like you
yeah yeah I like my skin I'm scared okay
here we are at the ice rink whoo it's
cold there's a Zamboni it's a boat
hamboning booty yeah right now the ice
is really cut up as they say in the ice
biz when Elsa did this she was walking
on fresh ice because she made it with
her feet that's what we've got the
Zamboni making things really slippery
and really dangerous he's getting really
close I'm really nervous this is really
dangerous
don't try this at home luckily we have a
ice skate in somewhere around here
so swarm if you can't run on ice we're
gonna take it to the next key level and
have amber try it toe pick on three it's
okay yeah one two three hey what's a toe
pick
oh my god you look so beautiful yeah I
think I'm ready I'm freezing so can you
do this quickly I'm gonna dress so I'm
definitely freezing where's that
sprinting no you can clearly speed walk
on ice but also keep run okay
run like I run from my problems you
ready I'm ready to do this three two
No are you okay my god I'm so sorry
are you ready to do in heels no we have
two three
okay we have a little extra challenge
for you since you killed it we're gonna
have you race amber and high heels okay
do it
she's a figure skater this doesn't count
I know but this is new
yeah
that's the way too small for me that was
fun
how does it feel to be a star you know
the difference between me and Elsa's
that Elsa looked so graceful when she
was running I didn't look graceful I
looked like a deer
you can run real fast not fall but like
we're not gonna guarantee that you won't
fall at the end to just offer yourself
which is like what I did I felt yeah if
she fell a little I fell and I laughed a
little
everybody laughed I heard it so it's
basically not we did it I did it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
