crotch is burning that gap fits
in like every gherkin nothing it's a
line this is a size small it's a size
medium what this is nothing really makes
sense and I don't know if I'm the crazy
one or if it's actually the sizing and I
really want to find out I always feel
crazy when I go shopping I don't know if
it's just me but I am here to find out
I'm a size 12 so when I go shopping it
is really hard to find a size that
actually fits you it's usually like the
thing in the way back of the rack that
I'm like oh yes like they have my size
or on the opposite side of the spectrum
I'm squeezing into like things that are
size small and all in one day I could be
a extra small or a 1416 size numbers
mean a lot as a woman you start like ik
waiting numbers to what is hot and like
what is accepted it's hard to not feel
discouraged by all these numbers being
thrown at you when you're trying on
things I have not always been a size 12
I have ranged from 6 to 16 in my
lifetime I've been around the size
and it doesn't matter what size you are
it never gets any easier I'm gonna go to
four different stores and China size 12
in all these stores the stores I'm going
to are Topshop forever 21 H&amp;amp;M and Old
Navy and at each of those I'm going to
try on different pants shirts jackets
gifts get a full vibe of what a size 12
is like and each one of these stores I'm
interested to see how much of a
variation is or if I really am making
this all up so I guess we'll take it
from here and see if a size 12 is
exactly what they say it is
all right I'm at forever 21 it's got
some stuff to try on see how it looks
first of all I realized there was
actually no size 12 so I had to ask the
sales associate what is size 12 what so
the sales associate told me that a size
12 is a size medium and dresses so this
is a size medium the dress that I tried
was kind of like a body con cotton
halter dress and that one fit because
Cotton's like stretchy and forgiving I
could have easily gone to a large know
what if it way better full-hearted the
jumpsuit I was fully naked
there's the jumpsuit and the rest of my
body is I didn't get it up past my
thighs and it's a size medium and that's
what they suggested for us as well oh my
god this sales associate told me that I
was a size 27 28 so I went for those
well
this is as far as the shorts go okay
won't be wearing these in public ever
unless I want to get arrested
I want three different types of pairs of
jeans to just to like get a variation
the 27 and 28 or
so stop let me just see about a
big fat no honestly none of the genes
really actually truly fit me I tried on
this sort of cropped t-shirt I also
asked the sales associate what a size 12
is in shirt sizes and it's a medium
apparently and this is a medium it's not
stretchy tall and this shirt is so tight
everything about every part of me
without in a way that I did not like I
think the biggest lesson I learned at
this number 21 experience was not only
do I feel like I don't know what size I
am either do this house associate it's
not just me it's fair to England sizing
in general forever21 is consistently
very small wellmaybe was very
interesting because one of the first
things I did was I walked in and asked
the sales associate what size dress is a
size 12 he said a small a small if you
were smaller than me like what size
would you wear forever21 said that size
12 is a medium already there's some
discrepancy between sizing in places
that is very clear for the start since I
had a size small dress one of them fit
really well this actually fits like this
is like budding on in a good way
I think I could get down with this I
haven't been here like 10 years the
other dress was a more flowy look what
do we think
size small I look like
kind of bet yummy and I'm supposed to be
a size 12 so it is unclear as to what
happens to the people that are as I see
over to size 12 is so small so remember
that the pants on the rack looked really
big and I was really suspicious about I
was like there's no way these will fit
me and then when I put them on they
weren't so insane these are a size 12
regular but they definitely were
probably two or three sizes too big like
it was just too bad you do that that
like weird back gap over your butt which
is super annoying I could probably go
two inch sizes smaller these and then
weirdly for this shirt I asked her to
size swamis and he said it was a medium
apart from the boobs being really tight
it fits I never usually wear button-up
shirts that much because like I have
that like the infamous boob gap this
medium shirt fits pretty well also and
it's like pretty roomy in the boobs
between dresses and shirts within one
store it's not the same size I just
don't know what size I am yes all their
sizes ran big but they were all
consistently big across the board it's
interesting that at H&amp;amp;M when I actually
got to the dressing room and I tried on
this stuff at least I felt like it's
somewhat was for a human body
never had asked any sales associate for
any sizing questions everything was very
clearly marked to get started hmm this
is a size 12 actually fits I tried it
one dress and it was like a bodycon
dress and it was tight like in a way
that I wouldn't probably ever purchase
it yeah but then there was this one
dress somehow between that dress and the
pink dress it's like
like one of them fit me pretty well the
other one I couldn't even zip up half my
body and then I had it jumps you and
then that one like got over my thighs
then like didn't zip up too fast this
makes no sense
I'm starting to feel more discouraged as
time goes on
honestly shopping always starts off
really fun and then you start realizing
that like it's not you it's them with
H&amp;amp;M pants it seems like they're really
tight and small around the thighs
hmm had a pair of leather ones that like
only could go up to like my crotch but
I'd say for the most part they kind of
understand what a size 12 it is bring
these actually fit their tight shirts
fit really well like Finn all right
places and like it did all the right
things that was supposed to is no
consistency between any of the Thompson
I tried forever21 it H and ever kind of
a toss off the range which is really big
of all the places we went today Topshop
is most aligned with high fashion
so you'd think that that would be the
hardest thing to fit into I thought the
most fashion people would not understand
my size and not understand my body more
than anyone else but was actually
totally the opposite all right this is
the first size 12 that isn't actually
fit me in every way the dresses are
really cool you know you put on
something it just feels really
good there's so many in baby
and the other red dress was really cute
too and my mind is blown I literally was
like gasping as I was putting the pants
I don't like do you guys know where this
is first time around it's really
cool that the sizes were consistent even
within the store this isn't
this is literally never happens to me
yeah this is great
this shirt fits really well around the
boobs you know sort of capping almost
everything I tried on fit perfectly and
exactly the right way right shape right
size and I'm about to drop some serious
money
I just wish that's how easy it was at
every store in the middle of the day I
was really down on myself being like
I'll never find anything and then
Topshop is the last place that we went
to thinking this will be an end up being
the best is like the best feeling
overall the most consistent sizing
across the board was definitely a top
job after the day was over I wanted some
 answers so I reached out to
Jessica Murphy who is a size fit expert
and co-founder of true fit which is a
company that helps you find clothing
that actually fits high in your
experience
when you look across small clothing
brands is their size inconsistent so the
answer is absolutely not once upon a
time we had consistency back in the
1960s when there was a standard but now
retail brands cater and create their
sizes depending on who their audiences
so we actually did a study where we took
ten thousand jeans across the same exact
size and the same relative styles and
what we found was that there was about a
five inch difference between the jeans
so that's a lot like if you look at you
chooses a ton right what we found is
that on average women wear a range of
three sizes when it comes to standard
sizes and a range of two sizes when
things are like alpha sizes like small
medium large extra-large wit Sephora
stores we went to Old Navy forever21
Topshop and H&amp;amp;M trans cater to who they
take their customer is so when they
assign a medium to the label that's not
trying to adhere to some standard and
what medium is that literally is saying
what is the middle of the size scale
that I am producing for who I think my
customer is Topshop is based out of the
UK and so their size scale is very
different than what we have in the US
H&amp;amp;M it's another international brand
they're Swedish brand so again we're
dealing with a whole different size
skills and then you take Old Navy who
caters to a very very different audience
so they're gonna be a little
more generously is because they have a
different demographic brands have been
kind of on a bad rap you know that they
make us feel bad they they're not
consistent but really it's just that
they're trying to again cater to who
they think their customer is is there
any advice that you can give
specifically to women on before they
head out to a store
how can they be successful in their
shopping and how can we feel good about
it what I recommend customers do is
really good familiar with the styles
that work well for their body shape it's
less about what size you're buying and
more about so I feel more comfortable
and do I feel and you know kind of the
the good mark of like does it work for
you is when you put it on you look in
the mirror and you're just like yeah I
look good and you just feel good
there's no matter what the heck size is
on the label but pay attention to the to
the details of the items is it higher in
the rise for example and that's what's
making me feel comfortable if it's a
dress is it cinched in the waist they
try to understand the details and the
patterns and what you wear and what are
your go-to things that you always seem
to gravitate towards and then look at
those characteristics and then when
you're shopping try to pick out those
things that are similar the reality is
if you dress in great fitting clothes
and regardless of your size you're gonna
feel so much better and you're gonna
look amazing
so if I said I'm Chrissy and I'm a size
12 does that mean anything it doesn't
mean anything to me because my next
question to you would be in what brand
are you a size 12
exactly fashion I love you I shopped all
the damn time and all I'm asking for is
just a little bit of consistency across
the sizes so I can buy more you said for
anyone out there shopping who has
difficulty relating to sizes on the
racks buy what fits you do not worry
about the numbers because I have proof
that they don't mean anything
let's make shopping fun again so you
might have noticed fold leaves now as is
but don't worry you'll still get all the
same awesome content you used to plus
