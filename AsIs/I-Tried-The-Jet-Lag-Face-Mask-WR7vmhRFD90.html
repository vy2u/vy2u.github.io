don't want you to see my nipples and
that's a little I need to my ideal world
to be that I'm always on the move but
unfortunately after over five planes
four different states and two countries
my skin started to break out really bad
usually when I'm traveling I do like a
hotel facial where I steam my face I
wash it and then I also use a variation
of face mask
unfortunately that requires me to carry
a lot of things so sometimes I have
coconut oil and aloe vera or I have my
face watch which is angels on bare skin
while looking through Sephora one day I
found this thing called the jetlag face
mask which seemed pretty perfect for my
needs I needed something that would
clean my skin but not be heavy and not
require multiple moving parts just
walked up to the mail room and I'm found
my jetlag face mask let's go ahead and
unbox it so you jump in the shower and
just do it the quick rinse and cleanse
of my face before we do the face mask
11 fingers crossed time to cleanse my
skin all right sorry just got out of the
bath I'm feeling like a fresh a snack
but as you can see we still haven't
looked a lot of pimple action little bit
of a cat action and just in general my
skin looks really fatigued so on
cleansed rice can apply a thin even
layer of finger tips you guys think
about when you're applying the face mask
I'm thinking about the next place I'm
gonna go if I can get deals on the fly
but my ex is doing Honduran Oprah uses
as a face mask oh this is fun so yeah
I'm used to face masks kind of going on
in a more like visible manner at that
time and the more invisible manner so
yeah I didn't even know what side I did
cuz it disappears something that I was
pleasantly surprised about with the
jetlag face mask was the fact that it
was a chemical exfoliant and not a
physical one so first and foremost it's
incredibly hydrating like it feels like
a kiss is being applied to my face ever
so gently across every inch of my skin
now to 810 well we raid I'll regale you
with tales while I was on the airplane
this time the flight attendant
recognized me and we chatted a little
bit and it just felt really good and
then I ran into another one of you guys
outside in the airport I love travel for
a myriad of reasons but I think one of
the main reasons is getting to come in
contact with so many beautiful kind
people
I think another fun thing about
traveling is there babes all over the
world you guys I always say when my
friends are like oh I'm single I'm like
you just seem to travel more there's
plenty plenty of fish out in the sea but
maybe your pond just got a little dried
up no I'm saying it's such a thin layer
that I feel like I can't feel at all
which is great I'm used to face mat it's
like totally hardening your entire face
until you can't move and you're just
like so I think we're at the 10-minute
mark and my skin feels supple
like a baby's bottom I have noticed I
feel like there's a little bit more of a
glow there after wearing yet so I think
now I'm gonna go rinse and see what the
business is
so I was like let me do the sudden test
as my skin glowing my skin is freakin
glowing so if you compare my skin on my
face was to get on my chest you can tell
there's like a death definitive like
shine and like brilliance so okay okay
face masks giving me that natural
highlight because it was a chemical
exfoliant and there wasn't a physical
exfoliant I wasn't sure if I was working
so I decided to check in with some of my
co-workers and see what they thought you
look so pretty look glowing darling your
skin looks flawless I can't get enough
of this Suchet your skin is popping
that's the first thing I thought you I
serious talk about your way because I
think your skin looks beautiful it looks
dewy and glowy like you're ready to
party it's the weekend you look
refreshed you don't have a jet lag in
sight it's the end of the day I still
have a pimple but my skin still looks
really radiant
my name is the LA office and they asked
a bunch of people and they all thought I
was wearing makeup
shucks I think I would recommend this
but I think it's still important to
create your own like skincare routine
because you know your skin I know that
if I you didn't the Ala and the steaming
and all of those things like I know that
some of these impurities would have been
pulled out and thus it would probably be
a little less big but I don't think
that's really with the face mask promise
it promises that you'll have radiant
moisturized skin and I definitely do I
think this is a great place holder for
just like I'm just going to look nicer
in event or I just need to feel a little
bit refreshed and pretty during the day
after a long day or in my case after
flight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
