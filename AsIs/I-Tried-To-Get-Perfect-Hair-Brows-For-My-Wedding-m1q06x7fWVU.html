that other way No
hey I'm Nikki and this is my fiancee
Kelsey we're getting married this year
and we can't wait to make this perfect
day our it's wedding season and this
week we're talking hair and brows hair
there's a lot of pressure around having
really great hair for your wedding
because it's something that's gonna be
in your photos forever just as you want
to care for your skin you also want to
care for your hairs whether it's used a
leave-in treatment product or just going
to the flan to get some treatments done
for the wedding I would ideally love to
have really voluminous silky shiny hair
like a well-groomed dog so I'm gonna get
help from a professional hairstylist and
hopefully he can help me achieve those
voluminous silky shiny hair vibes that
I'm going after welcome to raw how are
you feeling we are in the countdown
we're in the sprint mode now but I'm
excited what's your timeframe as far as
from here today to your wedding a little
more over three months and that's story
but that's good because the length of
your hair and what you want to achieve
is doable what's like your hair routine
I wash it about every three days right I
use dry shampoo on the days that I don't
want but the most part my hair is pretty
boring I thought that's not Asian
parents I just kind of bounce right here
I don't know how we're you can really
change that the first thing I want to do
today is kind of get your style back on
track so what I'm gonna do is teaching
math oh it's gonna be a little cold the
teacher is gonna help us to kind of like
clear the base and also heal and seal I
usually recommend could you show only
once a week
line it up Sunday Monday and that's your
mouse you know that and then we're gonna
take the biotin pills top fortify your
hair skin and nails that you're glowing
on your wedding day
and that your hair goes at least maybe
an inch to two inch of water we're out
and then I'm gonna hair scribe you a
couple products to use great shampoo and
conditioner and with the red Korean
seaweed to help strengthen the hair mask
once a week Sunday Funday great we even
commissioned her for every time that you
don't use conditioner or volumizer at
the root and then we're gonna use a
shine before and after a blow-dry I'll
see you in 30 days the light trim and
then we'll see with the health of your
hair is at that four top
Johnny's
supposed to help you're like hair growth
what smells like a lot of huge in
addition to working on the hair on my
head I'm also gonna look into my brows
so brows are like a thing I'm not good
at they honestly frame your face even
just a little bit of care and grooming
to your brows can change the overall
look of your face but in a very subtle
way a lot of brides do micro bleeding to
make their lives a little bit easier on
the day-to-day but also just to have
that perfect look for their wedding day
as well my friend you got your brows
micro bleeding I did what did you think
I can't imagine myself never having
micro bladed eyebrows I've gotten so
used to not having to worry about them I
will say it's a little scary at first
it's a needle that I dip in ink and I
make incisions into your brow area to
mimic care why should people do this
over like other brow things compared to
the old method of tattooing like
permanent makeup it fades - this a
really nice natural color and there's no
undertones or other pigments that are
gonna come through so it's worth it it's
so worth it I literally roll out of bed
and just come to work and I still feel
on fleek I just don't feel like you Fred
so first we're gonna clean up your
eyebrows do you have any pictures of
things that you like I like to look like
me so how long do these last so we're
between a year sometimes a year in two
years we'll put a little numbing cream
on there so I won't feel anything no you
both hear more than you actually feel
that'll sit on for about 20 minutes Oh
kind of Numb a little bit heavy
uh-huh I'm a little nervous it's not bad
at all this is the needle I use it's
super super small I will do an outline
to make sure you're okay with the shape
that we decide to do so I'm basically
gonna fill in this area just kind of get
it feather
they're bridge all that maybe extend it
just a little bit pretty much looks like
my eyebrows now you ready let's see if
your nose let's hope so
mm-hmm oh yeah it does sound bad the
application itself takes about 15 20
minutes like we're drawing in hairs
exactly you want to take a look at what
it's looking like sure is that scary
yeah oh yeah that is supernatural
it does look dark about the stains the
hairs a little creepy sounds real
unnerving just a feeling about that oh
yeah
it takes about three days to start to
heal and then kind of pills off no one's
really gonna notice you it'll just look
like your brow gel on or something wow
I'm like a different person
especially this area because you don't
really have anything but when it heals
you're pretty much gonna lose a lot of
the outer edge my foreheads been through
a lot a little bold but alright it's not
gonna stay like that let's see what
Kelsey has to say about she didn't know
I did this today oh your eyebrows wait
that's tattooed they're very shapely
yeah there are little intense but it'll
get it's just like very new look like
they've been drawn on like a cartoon the
first three days I got them done all
anyone could do was look at my brows you
turn to me and I immediately notice your
eyebrows they are darker they look
precise though I like it yeah but
they've mellowed out my eyebrows are
scabbing now they look a less intense
right guys yeah yeah do you like I like
him a lot yeah I was so nervous right
after cuz I was like oh my god what have
I done
it's like when you draw eyebrows on a
god they still look really good but now
they look like normal honestly I was a
little skeptical that I would see any
difference in my hair but it felt so
much lighter and so nice so shiny it's
like a beautiful unicorn
they're picking up my bookshelf used to
take 15 minutes to see my hair now it
takes like 45 so today what we're gonna
do is I'm gonna gloss the entire hair
it's kind of you're like reviving your
hair back up but it's also gonna tone
down some of these highlights that you
have in your hair cuz your wedding's
gonna be outside we want the Sun to hit
it correctly and bounce off of your hair
I tell people to not go cheap on the
hair or the makeup because pretty much
that's the way you're gonna look for the
rest of your I think my ultimate goals
are my hair is so healthy that I don't
have to do anything to it in the morning
I've been working out a lot I'm sweating
a lot but my hair isn't like holding up
really well look at you Missy you're
getting right with the hair gods
now you're the Virgin Mary we're putting
purple shampoo on you what's gonna ask
out some of the warmth in your hair I
definitely want some layers and I want
to go order but like if I decide to do
an updo I want to be able to have the
length to do that so we're gonna do a
longer layers and then we're gonna take
it up just a bit Wow nice simple day so
what's next for you and your journey is
just keep on with your routine I didn't
think you were gonna come through but
you did know because you look scared but
the logic behind it has definitely
proven thank you so much you like my
hair looks really natural and it goes
better with your eyebrows too here are
three things that I learned about this
entire hair experience one Wow we do not
need to be conditioning our hair every
time we wash it leave-in conditioner was
just as fine too hair is a really long
process get help early on as soon as you
can it's not one of those things you
want to leave to the last minute my hair
right now gives me a lot of versatility
whether I want to leave it down and
leave it a little bit bigger and
voluminous or if I want to put it up
either way I think it'll look really
great so I'm excited to try out a couple
different looks three your eyebrows
microwave it's so expensive
if you don't realize how much browse due
to how your face looks until you get
them done professionally I'm all those
people who cares about what their Browns
look like now look you're great
next on wedding season 12 weeks spinach
