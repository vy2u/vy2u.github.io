little bit of the sting one two and
three ah how was that okay
hey I'm Nikki and this is my fiancee
Kelsey we're getting married this year
and we can't wait to make this perfect
day our it's wedding season and this
week we're talking about skincare I'm
getting married this year and I'm very
excited but also there's a lot to do and
that's not just for wedding planning but
everything to do with being a bride for
the next few months I'm gonna go through
all of the ultimate Bridal prep that I
possibly can that's gonna include skin
care hair nutrition working out
accessories makeup to see if I can
actually do it my current skincare
regimen is very very simple
I wash my face in the morning and at
night with a simple cleanser for
sensitive skin for my skincare journey
I'm gonna consult a dermatologist and an
aesthetician to help me find out what my
ultimate skincare routine should be for
me to look
hi there how are you a little nervous
about the wedding or about me I've never
been to a dermatologist before I've
never gotten a facial I really have no
idea what I'm getting into
I was a bride not too long ago almost
two years exactly congratulation thank
you it's a stressful time yeah a lot of
things with the skin are related to
stress so when you're under stress
things of course especially acne I'd say
have a pretty average skin I have some
like dry splotchy patches like kind of
around my cheeks on my face area I'm
gonna call out a lot of stuff and I
don't want to overwhelm you but this is
what my eye and my clinical judgment
expertise disease okay these lines
should only be there when you're moving
but as you can see there's two lines
here round in the middle like you're mad
you see how these kind of form these are
called your eleven lines so another area
where Botox can help it's a little bit
hollow under your eye I think it would
be nice if your chin came out a little
bit more on the lower part you have a
little bit of rosacea really shut for
the redness we have a laser called xov
ah and then we have another device
called clearing Berlin so I was like
burning the rubber if you want to do
some Botox today we can do here if you
like that a lot of information yes
alright let's get started those like a
little bit of the sting one two and
three ah
so we're selectively targeting red blood
so I'll heat up your vessels it's like a
teeny tiny needle way more intense than
I thought it would be we did two
different lasers one for redness and
once the pore minimizing the experience
was not super Pleasant it was kind of
shocking so this is the laser Genesis
how's that
okay I can smell it yeah that's what
debris on your skin is that it makes
your skin smoother it's a textural so I
look beautiful yet alright get angry for
me my god whoa why the bubble of Botox
it goes away in like pricing hmm
easy and quick three to four days it
starts working is really nice thank you
so much for everything
hey um so that just happened yeah wait
till I tell my fiance that I got Botox
today cos she doesn't not know what do
you think of my botox looks smooth hi
welcome to keel thank you we get a lot
of brides to be coming into keels
and we call it let's get you ready for
wedding day again I picked keels because
a lot of my friends use keel products
and actually really really love them so
I was really excited to get like an
entire regiment from them you wear
makeup I do a little bit I wear
sunscreen I don't
dermatologists gave me one so I do now
okay
you'll have to I'm going to use our skin
barrier testing tab okay and I'm gonna
actually diagnose your skin type they're
only gonna pick up your natural sebum no
but you're definitely a little bit
oilier on the forehead okay and drier on
the cheek so this is a dehydration
analyzer tool this sends an undetectable
microcurrent ten layers deep into the
skin so ideally I'd like you to be at
50% hydration you came back at 34.6 okay
so back yeah no it's not horrible so I'm
gonna pull out our skin strengthening
complex this is the base of any
apothecary preparation or minimizing and
then we're also gonna do our
neutralizing of the redness you're gonna
just do two or three drops morning and
night there's your pocket airy
preparations okay calendula lenser and
toner
morning and night rate moisturizer
creamy eye with avocado for the eyes
your sunscreen soothing hydration matha
micro dermabrasion one-time elite did
not expect to get that many products if
anything I'm gonna smell like a whole
new movie this was only been a day since
I've been at the dermatologist and like
you can kind of already see like I'm Way
less red than I normally am there
anything different you guys can tell
about my forehead there are less lines
yes get Botox yeah I think so Botox
works I have fewer lines up here but I
would be hesitant to do again for me
it's very disconcerning telling your
brain to move a certain part of your
body and that part not moving that was
very odd for me the lasers
those things worked really well oh I'm a
few days into using my old mining
products and my skin is actually really
really dry I just you can see there's
like skin flaking on my skin did freaked
out a little bit I think I honestly just
made the jump too quickly
I went from using like two products to
using like eight I think I figured out
it's the toner the toner that came with
like the face wash that I use when I
reintroduce that my skin like did the
same thing I got really really dry and
like would flake off just to the touch
it's just not right for my skin so I'm
gonna stop using it but other than the
toner like the serum is great I still
use my rosacea cream eye cream is really
nice
so I have my daily routine and then I
have the weekly mask which is lovely
hi i'm mclean i would be working on your
face today great and we went over your
allergies discussed all that so I'm
gonna start by cleansing yeah I'm gonna
take a look and see what's going on okay
good so I had a facial for the first
time it's not that I never wanted one I
think it's just like in the spectrum of
things I wanted to spend money on that
was just pretty low priority
I met with Mike Lee who is an
aesthetician who gave me that Hydra
facial we do a lot of exfoliating and
facials there's different ways there's
chemical exfoliants is physical
exfoliant today i'm gonna be using kind
of a combination of both of machine
called hydra facial the machine does
everything your skin needs it cleanses
it exfoliates it extracts it protects
and a peptide infusion so they help
protect and strengthen the skin oh my
goodness my pores don't touch it
oh sorry am i glowing she was just able
to clean my skin in a way that I'm not
able to do myself it was so relaxing it
was so nice my skin feels very very
clean and soft so after 30 days I
definitely noticed a difference now that
my skin's gotten used to the products I
do feel a lot clearer my skin feels a
lot better it's softer and I am a lot
less red here are three things that I
learned from this experience
number one sunscreen sunscreen is like
the number one protector of keeping your
skin not damaged two there are a lot of
factors that can affect your skin stress
genetic hormones and your diet and
that's just a few of them so even though
you're taking really good care of it you
should watch out for other factors as
well and finally give yourself time
talk to a doctor six months in advance
try a new regimen at least three months
ahead of time so getting your perfect
wedding day skin is actually a lot
harder than I thought it was going to be
I got like some of the best care from
some of the best professionals I could
find and even then like I got it on my
face last week do you think I achieved
that glow that I was looking for
everyone's talking about being glowy on
their wedding day it's definitely
possible if I can do it you can do it
next on wedding season weddings are like
50% making everyone
happy and 50% looking as hot as we
possibly can yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
