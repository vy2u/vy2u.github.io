on the same page it makes me crazy
weddings but not the worst
hi I'm Chrissy I'm getting married very
soon to a man named Josh who I've known
for 11 freakin years so today I'm going
to try on some Amazon wedding dresses
with all my friends but I'm putting a
little twist on it can I guess how much
it is for my little bridal party have
invited jasmine
Kristin and Sheridan here's the thing
okay Kristin is like very sweet she's
not gonna be me and I love being nice
stared and on the other hand will be
like you look bad I just think it looks
like a bad prom dress I don't know
Jasmine Jasmine I'm just an angel she's
coming from a fashion background so
she'll be able to know what kind of
fabrics are being used are they
expensive are they inexpensive we ready
to get some numbers ready to throw some
prices out there okay but what does the
winner get Oh eternal love you know
everybody I'm in the room with today has
all found their eternal love that's cute
I'm wondering if the quality is good how
it looks
IRL I have moderate expectations
Chrissy's main struggle is going to be
the fit for sure I feel like it's gonna
be a little bit of a struggle just like
getting that variety whatever the
that means I am convinced that there is
something out there that everyone can
find for under $100 no question we're
gonna hang out hopefully drink some
champagne like they do and the bridal Oh
just kidding
this looks really beautiful what I saw
Chrissy walk out in the first dress I
was like okay I didn't mind the first
dress at all I like to be chill I like
to be easy-breezy I like my dress to be
glowy enough that I can eat in it when I
walked out that no one had tears and I
was like oh I think it's really sweet
Jared's bougie ass right now spots where
it was a little dirt I feel like a
wedding day you want to feel a little
more special I don't think there's
anything special about this it was like
in the same zip code or survived but
like not quite at the address that you
wanted when you plugged it into Google
Maps earlier I can't wear underwear with
it because it is
why are you recovering the bushes let's
come to the chase how much you think
this dress is $65 hundred to forty and
the price is $15 my noggin flew off my
head we went to another state now that I
know the price of it I think it's more
than okay it's great for 15 bucks yeah
it wasn't trying to be like oh I'm such
an extravagant wedding dress it was
staying in its own lane and it was $15
another challenge
Wow
I need a drink being the winner and all
that I try to be I won the first round I
wasn't shocked
so when Chrissie came out in the
strapless dress you could tell something
was a little off there's something
happening with the fabric on like the
bodice wear it like reflects green kind
of there was one like pointy part of her
boob it literally just kind of swallowed
her like a sock this dress is acting
like it's something that it's not this
is an imposter
that strapless just was very clearly not
for Chrissie she wanted to get eject if
you're over a size D boob strapless
immediately makes you like flinch like
any time together weird strapless I'm
like how much do you think this
strapless dress is if you told me this
dress cost you know five hundred dollars
I would believe you cuz I think it looks
like what I would also be a little we
are not on the same page
[Laughter]
142 dollars 135 67 in the price
this dress is $65 nipple is weird I
think if you're just like oops let me
just tuck that Roush if I may I think
you actually could totally work and when
I say work I mean not for me look if
you're only gonna wear a dress one it
doesn't need to be perfect
it just needs to be good enough for like
six hours believe you've won two in a
row I thought it was just really cute
flattering it was classy but you know it
showed some legs so a little bit of sex
appeal in there exactly those wedding
stoppers on every cake I was literally
flew I was all I was me all of the style
but we have to talk about the
construction there's rings line hardest
thing to tell on the Internet is how
something feels like I just don't want
to like crunch around you only mean I
don't want to be like I'm in like a taco
wrapper the big question how much I'm
gonna go with 90 for a hundred and fifty
eighty five dollars that someone could
spend so little money and be true to
their aesthetic as they're into that
like vintage feel was really great to
hear yeah
this one kind of top this one I love
cupcake Krissi my immediate reaction to
the fourth dress was how dare you and
who gives you the right I think it's
both boring and too much some people
will look at this and say it's the most
beautiful dress in the world and I think
it's fine I think things got heated with
this dress this dress is the throwaway
dress that they make bigger women wear
because they don't bother to design a
nice dress and so I'm angry that
anyone's you have to put this dress on
their bodies I know why they
should get a throwaway dress hallelujah
just because like I personally don't
like it doesn't mean that it's not a
pretty dress in my opinion I understand
this fourth dress was like a certain
type of person would like it but this
was the only type of dress for so long
that was available for thicker women
it's like being an adult and trying to
acquire taste for Brussels sprouts when
you spent your entire childhood trying
to eat horrible boiled Brussels sprouts
so Brussels sprouts of dresses despite
it being a very polarizing dress what do
you guys think it cost I think this is
130 dollars I don't know why I guessed
hires of that I've seen that dress that
dress has been $95 since 1997 I was
surprised by how bad it looked in real
life because it looks so good online at
the end of the day Chrissy didn't like
the fourth dress and I won in the
pricing option so that's really all that
matters
so now and we look open your eyes she's
mad final dress we really needed like a
showstopper piece you know and that
thing's been delivered they were three
different dresses that I think were
Frankenstein's together it's like they
checked every box on the like what
should a wedding dress have yes yes yes
let's add it all you don't need the belt
and the lace and the sleeve I don't like
it had the retro vibe but it was also
like we still want to be a retro
princess you went for the vibe the vibe
is I fall in love weddings
I think this satin bow it's like a cute
little detail and then you realize I
wanted I love The Fault sorry I love the
last dress I loved it honest to gosh I
wasn't surprised that Kristen really
liked this last dress you don't have to
like the things that I like but Wow did
I like this thing that I like how much
do you think this dress is 145
I'm thinking 135 I'm gonna go one two oh
five $89 if you put on that dress and
told me that was a $1,200 dress I would
believe you but I don't know I also
believe that Tupac is still alive every
dress is under 100 it's good surprise
all these wedding dresses are under $100
and they all pretty much fit now I'm
just like wondering why I spend all
those days like sweating in salons I
think it's so often that people are
buying their wedding dresses online
overall it was really relieving to me to
know that people could still stay there
aesthetic and get dresses under $100 I
think regardless you were a stunning
bride no matter what I am so excited for
Chrissy's wedding and for her
get married she's gonna be such a
beautiful bride when it comes to wedding
planning there are so many uncertainties
for food to choose your hair but I will
say that I am certain about one thing
and that's that I'm really happy to
bring Josh thank you guys let's not
forget the actual winner you all have
significant others and I have a boxer so
you might have noticed bullies now as is
but don't worry just look at all the
same awesome concert you used to plus
even more new great stuff click to
