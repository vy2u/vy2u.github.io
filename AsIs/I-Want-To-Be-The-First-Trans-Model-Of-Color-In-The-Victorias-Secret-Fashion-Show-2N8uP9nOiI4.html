the first trans model of color in the
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show I started
last Monday on Twitter I didn't even
think about it
I just put I want to be the first trans
models clothing to be a Victoria's
Secret model the chance is a big going
dot for and reaching that made people I
had no idea I got into modeling because
no one in the fashion world look like me
speak like me and was presented like me
I felt like I truly was in the world
that I didn't fit in so I wanted to
create a new one have I dealt with
discrimination in the fashion world oh
absolutely
not just in the fashion world everywhere
at my life I remember like going to
casting that I was fine to go to clients
no I'm on my way and I arrived and they
find out
oh she's trans someone tells him I'm
trans or they see my color and next day
you're too dark I'm sorry
we have enough dark models one time I
was booked for the shop and I show up
one instead and there's his white model
shooting they didn't like her back they
say take it out they didn't like her
shoes change them oh you know what add
the black girl I'm an accessory I don't
want to be an accessory anymore I don't
deserve that I deserve to be front and
center and I deserve to be celebrated
why do I want to walk in the Victoria's
Secret Fashion Show this brain has to
find
femininity in the most beautiful way and
it changed my life I remember never see
some fantasize about wearing lingerie
the way or make me feel the way with me
feel comfortable in my body when I first
started transitioning I couldn't wait to
go to the Victoria's Secret store and
get those bras and those panties and to
feel that that handling vibe and to
actually be at that place right now to
just do that
it's a liberating feeling others who are
out here that don't want to see me love
my body don't want to see me love the
skin on men there needs to be more
equality there makes them more color
there needs to be more shapes or need to
be more scientist everyone in humanity
needs to be represented the Victoria's
Secret is that one brand that can really
change the game they can really set the
tone on what needs to be done in fashion
and not just in fashion the entire world
but stuff like that happens people are
thinking you know what I'm gonna hire
that trans girl I'm going to hire that
person that is different that we're
going to bring something different to my
workplace to my environment that will
bring everyone together and we can all
feel connected at the end of the day and
that is what it's about and that's why
we need to have this moment once that
door is open so many young trans women
around
broke and say she did it I can't - I
just want people to know out there and
that when you represent who you are and
what you are where you come from you can
never go wrong just believe in yourself
love yourself
anything can happen with courage and
confidence the sky is the limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
