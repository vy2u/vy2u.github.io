what's going on hey my hair is part of
my identity it's normally the way that
people point me out or describe me and
I'm curious to know how much of my
identity
femininity my confidence is really
actually tied in with my hair really I
just wonder what I look like bald so
today I'm gonna find out I got this
latex bald cap the guy said I should
absolutely not do this alone that I
should really have a professional do it
because I will mess it up but I want to
do it now if this actually does turn out
really terrible I will just bring in a
makeup artist to do it tomorrow
attend number one is a fail it just
looks too far from actually being bald I
think I'm just gonna bring in a actual
professional tomorrow's lol forever at
the fact that I thought I could put a
bald cap on alone yesterday and that's
why we have arson here with us it turns
out you can't do anything you set your
mind to
okay ready oh my god
I'm bald so far I don't feel any less
confident but I also am surrounded by
people who have been watching this
happen let's go introduce bald Megan to
the world
whoa my immediate instinct is I just
want to rub your head I think you still
look bangin feel still can't tell us
you're a woman you're still beautiful it
was just shocking to see no hair I hate
my forehead it's probably my least
favorite part of my face but now that
like my whole head is my forehead I'm
not I don't have to be insecure about it
without your hair we definitely like
look more closely and seeing like your
facial features
I see like your lips pop more and your
eyebrows pop more your eyes pop more in
things if I'm having a bad hair day I
feel like all of me looks bad and if I'm
having a really good hair day then I
feel great so when you take away the
thing that's sort of dictating how you
should feel about how you look I think I
expected it to just all be bad and I
like how I look
wow you look great you do you look great
as a boat lady you're so positive you
have the perfect bone structure
walking back from lunch I definitely
noticed more people with lingering eyes
than normal which is fair if I saw a
cute guy that I wanted to approach I
would feel really insecure doing it like
this as some woman who observes hijab
sometimes that gets hard to walk around
and also feel beautiful but like as I've
grown older and you find other ways to
kind of express beauty and understand
that concept does not something that's
always physical is also internal I'm
kind of hoping that when I take my hair
back out at the end of the night I'll
still see myself as this feminine and
beautiful with my hair down which is
kind of the opposite of what I expected
here so from the front I'm still looking
pretty normal but then when I turn to
the side edge happening alright so I'm
back home sometimes people lose all
their hair and it's not their choice
whether it be alopecia or sexual trauma
or chemo today I got to walk around
because I did have a choice and I'm
grateful for that but I'm curious to see
how differently I'll feel when I don't
have any makeup on
I think that looking at my face without
my hair allows me to appreciate what I
look like in a way that I don't think I
would have been able to do with my hair
I grew up really hating my hair I didn't
know how to take care of it and I
thought that it was a mistake but I've
grown to absolutely love my hair but
it's good to know that even if it was
all taken away I don't feel any less
myself that being said I'm ready to take
this off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
