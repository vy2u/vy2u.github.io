high school and I was so high I came
down the wrong way and almost got hit
and had to jump up that curb I'm glad I
don't know all the things that and
that's a good metaphor for the financial
so mom how long have you been a realtor
thirty years why don't I know anything
about buying now because I've never been
around I'm gonna find ya it's good to
own real estate Sylvester investment now
that you have money we can get you
qualified and see what you can afford
okay here we go all right you guys just
hang on you'll be back a little bit no
just stay in the car we don't want
anyone seeing you guys I wanted to show
you the entry-level pricing for you this
house is 210,000 big yeah it's a good
it's a really good sized home this one
is three bedroom two and a half bath Wow
almost 1,800 square feet this is 210
think maybe you can get this for 200
because around you you can negotiate in
California you not so much you're never
gonna get a home like brand-spanking-new
unless you build it from the ground up
yourself so like you expect costs to fix
things well then you can ask the seller
to do the repairs it says in the
contract already that the seller agrees
they will spend up to one and a half
percent of the sale price so the biggest
thing you want to watch out for is the
age of the roof and the AC system oh the
insurance industry requires when a
shingle roof is 25 years old no matter
if it's leaking or not you must put a
new roof on this house is 24 years old
guess why I get new this original room
so counsel this is the deal I've taken
you up on another hundred thousand
dollars this is only three two thousand
dollars just three hundred thousand
watch this it's 3,200 square feet girl
just we just went way way way up and
this one is a 5-bedroom let me tell you
house is in California $1,000 a foot and
up in here there are a hundred dollars a
foot but of course you got to live in
Florida okay so why should someone get a
realtor
well it's Clank why should I pay you my
money you're not gonna pay as a buyer
the seller pays everything it doesn't
cost you a penny
all right Kelsey I have got the perfect
millennial home for you this is one of
the newest homes I'm going to be able to
show you today and this one's only
priced at 264 built in 2005 you want to
ask the seller to give you a disclosure
any material defect that would affect
the value of the property so someone
being murdered in it but by law we do
not have to disclose if someone died in
the home we had a listing where they
found the seller up in the attic he went
up there during the day when it was too
hot and died didn't find him for a week
yeah uh I guess tell people where you're
going
see you don't die sure I guess it's good
advice still don't die
in your house tell people about it you
don't have to tell people about it I
wasn't paying attention sorry mom
ha I can't change me so I hope you
learned something you could tell me this
when I was like you know a teenager and
what it would have been you click here
to watch my new show am I doing this
right it's the perfect thing to watch
with a glass of wine and your best
friends we're not your best friends
watch it
