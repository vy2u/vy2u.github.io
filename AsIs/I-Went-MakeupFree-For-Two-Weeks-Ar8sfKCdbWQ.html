the end of it can you imagine just a
whole new transplanted baby it's just
like I walk in a room and I just glow
yeah like the heavens open and it's like
so what I'm gonna be doing for the next
two weeks is wearing a SK 2's facial
treatment essence on my face instead of
makeup none nada
nip LA Fashion Week is at the end of the
two weeks and I want to go in there
looking radiant and not even having to
think about what my skin looks like so I
spent about 30 minutes to an hour to do
my makeup every morning I don't know
it's just like my knee time I've been
wearing makeup since seventh grade which
is kind of crazy usually I have
combination skin where I'm only and also
drive but lately I've been very dry I'm
very insecure about my pores so SK 2 has
a campaign where it's one bottle away
from having just more radiant skin but I
only have two weeks to try it out so
we're gonna see what the short-term
benefits are getting used to me with my
regular skin is going to be so weird but
awesome
I hope all right it is day one my makeup
is gone I am just a pale face truly so
I'm gonna try SK 2 for the first time we
were supposed to do with this is you're
supposed to put fortified drops on a
cotton pad you just you just pat pat it
feels like like honestly just like cold
nice water on your face you can put a
few more drops in your hand and then
kind of rub it together and then just
feel so nice I love it
I'm shocked like who knew something so
simple would be so nice I'm nervous to
see what all my friends have to say all
right do you notice that anything
different about me today
you're wearing all black okay
paired we already talked about this here
are you wearing makeup no yeah we're
gonna make yeah is that what's different
is that right oh yeah I'm not gonna be
wearing makeup for two weeks
oh and usually you like makeup I love
make on with makeup I do your creative
makeup person yeah Justin hey Tristan
can I ask you one question do you notice
anything different about me no makeup on
yes what I've noticed at work is I get
to the end of the day and my face is not
oily without makeup on I just think I
look younger so I'm the whole thing that
I don't know I'm taken seriously I asked
everyone at the end of the meeting if
they notice that I wasn't wearing makeup
and everyone was like no no she just
looks like her
bad businesswoman self as usual Wow I
cannot believe I have gone basically an
entire week without wearing any makeup I
am so proud of myself my skin definitely
now feels rejuvenated and bright and I
feel like I have a natural highlight and
I don't need to put on a highlight like
look at that so I am going to brunch in
this really fancy hotel and oh my gosh I
usually definitely wear makeup to brush
but he look happy
it's hilarious because literally no one
like none of my friends even cared
notice if I didn't wear makeup for the
rest of my life from now on like they
wouldn't even think anything of it you
know like they'd support it and that's
so cool and awesome so today I have to
post on social media without my makeup
on take a selfie I have posted on social
media without makeup on but I've always
hit it with like sunglasses or something
else so like this is the first time I'm
posting raw so I will post it and let's
see what everyone has to say I'm looking
at the comments now and oh my gosh you
know like it's actually pretty
overwhelming how positive they are I
think social media just has so much
perfection and so much you know the
standards of how you should look are so
high and that you should have a full
face and perfect contour etc etc and
there's not a lot of fresh face but I
think once it's posted people love it
and they feel not alone as a community
whether we know each other or not or as
women or just as people in general like
we just need to keep supporting each
other and and supporting our natural
beauty and our natural selves and our
flaws and imperfections or whatever
society deems that I definitely think
this was the hardest challenge but
became the most rewarding
alright I'm on my way to LA Fashion Week
and I have put on makeup first time in
two weeks I'm not gonna lie it was very
weird to get into my old habit of
putting on some makeup but I didn't put
as much on as I normally do because it
just felt weird I have been used to my
face without it for so long now what's
it like seeing me with makeup on again I
think you look gorgeous either way
now that I'm taking better care of my
skin I feel like makeup is now a choice
and not a necessity for me I've only
been using a bottle for two weeks but
I'm definitely gonna keep using it
overall I just feel like my skin is
tighter and healthier and softer yeah it
was more about me exerting confidence
even though I was feeling insecure I
feel like a new woman but it's funny
because I'm like my natural woman that
I've always been I just haven't seen her
