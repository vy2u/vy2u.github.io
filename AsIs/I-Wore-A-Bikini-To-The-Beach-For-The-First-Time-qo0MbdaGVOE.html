head that I'm not supposed to wear a
bikini hi my name is Jazmin and I'm
going to be wearing a bikini for the
first time I had issues loving myself
junior year of high school too like
junior year of college I grew up just
being around a lot of girls who were
super thin and super blonde and super ye
I idolized them and their figures more
than I appreciated my own figure I went
through a hard time of just like eating
disorders and therapists and really
getting down on myself I want to do this
because I see other women bigger than me
wearing them and I'm like you go girl
but if I put it on I'm like no girl and
that's what pisses me off is that I
would tell someone else that they could
wear this but like when it comes to me
I'd be like no I really want to work on
being the most confident version of
myself that I can be I'm on a journey to
love me for me and if people love it
that's awesome and if people don't
that's not my problem so I've gotten to
some students the first one I decided I
just went for it I was like I'm just
gonna get this one it's not the most
terrible thing I've ever seen in my life
there's this butt thing
people with an ass don't need that
my second swimsuit Ashley Graham Ashley
love you girl so this is the black
swimsuit
I've never swore insurance in my life it
feels good I feel like I could pop a red
lip on with us you like on Baywatch
honestly I'm so sick of thinking about
this swimsuit that I just don't even
care how high he had even work the black
one was overall like I felt most
comfortable in it and I thought it was
the cutest as I was packing that day the
only thing I could really think about
was like how many people were gonna be
on the beach we just got to the beach
I'm feeling a little nervous I think it
was just like what other people are
gonna think about me what other people
are gonna say about me
but more so like if I should be wearing
this because I feel like I take a lot of
pride in what I wear I've never been one
to wear anything like below my belly
button because I just don't like that
I'm feeling good I'm feeling a lot of
confidence it's really nice being here
right people that are so nice in support
of Gavin yeah
I hate you all it the moment that I
started feeling most comfortable was
kind of when I just let myself just be
like whatever you're here you're at the
beach in this bikini just like rocket a
lot of times to feel Tommy I look out
and I'm like yeah okay whatever but I
truly believe that like this swimsuit is
this must be mine shortly after the
beach I posted a picture on Instagram in
my bikini and I was a little bit
hesitant at first because I was nervous
what people were going to say but
honestly I got like a lot of really nice
comments and I did get some like shitty
like haters too but when it comes down
to it it's me and it's my body before
this experience I thought that I shown
ly be wearing high-waisted swimsuits
because of my body type but now I feel
like I'm gonna be trying on a whole
bunch of different swimsuits because I
feel like I should Rock every swimsuit
