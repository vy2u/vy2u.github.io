you might know me as the girl that has
to wear weird genes outside this is too
much look at my pants and tell me what
you think of them but my co-workers sent
me a link to this new item this is
probably the tiniest jeans I've ever
seen if you're horrified that I'm about
to wear these outside I guess you should
be but this is not a miniskirt it is a
belt this is bad a high school girl who
was in a miniskirts but she just took it
too far that's what it looks like in
honor of New York Fashion Week I'm gonna
wear this Jean belt out it looks really
stupid no matter what you wear under it
and I'm gonna see what the people of New
York think because the people of New
York know whether things are cool and
they're gonna tell me let's go around
New York City we're gonna find out what
people think of my jean belt
what do you think this place as in your
short shorts what is it anyway it's good
or a shirt I can see the difference I'm
just really confused I don't know what's
happening is this a pants video you're
damn right it it's pretty deceiving you
also have pants and a sweater but
somehow it still makes that part of my
brain go wow she just has those shorts
on so what's the point of this how'd you
put that on it's a ton of buttons
their button fly oh no we should
comfortable too
no one's ever asked me that so thank you
for asking you would expect it to have a
fraud ship yeah it bends oh yeah it ends
there yeah so it's sort of strange I
wouldn't wear it on its own I'm into it
you know
denim so I'm okay with the way they're
cut it looks like someone just saw the
pants off like I got like the bottom
half my body chopped oh yeah did you
make that would you believe I didn't I
bought it what piece of clothing do you
think it is
well maybe what skirts is it doesn't
have a cross it's not about either it's
rather unique it's maybe service up out
that's it that's exactly it's advertised
as a belt but no one you're the first
person to guess it it feels like it
should be a miniskirt but it's not it's
a big denim belt no yeah I would have
ended that if you were marketing this
what would you call it mini belt I
remind people of the miniskirt so you
can buy miniskirt belt mini belt what
would you like call these a mistake
super super miniskirt just the sound of
a P cuz we're not even gonna fill the
rest of the word pants why don't we Ben
a new name sure we that pants because I
don't think you can we're only done in
between to even decide to call it
something it's not a belt it's not a
skirt it's like a Bert
now wouldn't even give it a name what
celebrity do you think could pull these
off oh gosh it's a hideous and the only
person who can make it look decent is
Rihanna Rihanna Rihanna can make
anything look good 90s Jim Carrey as
like a funny goof Breanna Spears when
she wear adul jeans with Justin
Timberlake tell her she means this scarf
you kind of up 16 years ago you
should have been wearing this yeah
Lady Gaga would probably wear it Lady
Gaga Giudice trying out something news
it's worn much worse
I don't know know if she's around
anymore but Paris Hilton she just got
engaged recently I think Oh
Demi Lovato I feel like she rock it how
much do you think I paid for this
should be for free it's you and guess
how much they cost this is the
depressing part of the video did you buy
it like that yeah I do
twenty dollars I hope no more than five
dollars and I'll pause bedazzle in acts
of fifty bucks right now it's hundred
but in five years more if it's a trend
it will cost four hundred and ninety
nine it's crazy that you just said that
because the amount actually cost is four
hundred dollars no it wasn't yes it was
stop are you kidding me four hundred
growth you no way you could you could
have given that to me if you know how
much money I owe Sallie Mae Wow yes my
super good at designing and charging not
so much like material just like the
design I guess you can't buy a gene
built anywhere else how would you wear
it
I wouldn't so you would wear this I
don't know if I would go that far but I
don't hate it would you ever wear this
it's not cool enough
it's rather confusing it requires people
wearing it should be super confident I
would not wear these would you get them
for your wife yes I would how do you
think you would style it if you got
those um like garter belt tights just
that under that and so you'd show some
sexy like cheeks you can be used on the
neck too
I hadn't considered that so like like a
scarf type thing yeah a new type of
scarf maybe just make it a piece of
lingerie and call it a day do you think
this is gonna catch on honestly I don't
think so everything that comes from from
New York people is wearing that I'm
gonna wear it - if you tell hey a
Chilean give me the idea of a jean scarf
they were probably rock into it the
people of New York had spoken and in
general they're confused by this
this is marketed as a belt but really it
should be and
but about if you wear around your
shoulders then people are like that's
not supposed to go there and I like
doing this looks better it's kind of
Virgin Mary yes you're gonna go for this
you got to do something a little more
interesting with it then make it a belt
that's what I learned when you take
risks take the risk all the way don't
half-ass it if you have assets you end
up with this so I'm wearing this in New
York so definitely people are gonna
start wearing on a rug too nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
