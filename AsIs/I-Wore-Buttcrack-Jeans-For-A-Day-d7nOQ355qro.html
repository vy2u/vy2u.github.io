and then super chill mom in the back.
- So my friend Taylor
just sent me a message
showing me these jeans
that elongate your crack.
They're 60 bucks a pop.
I'm gonna buy them, I'm gonna try them on,
and I'm gonna see if I can
pull them off, 'cause why not?
These are crack jeans.
They look from the front
like a normal pair of jeans,
but in the back there's just this
I also don't understand the purpose.
Are ass cracks that go up high attractive?
Is that a thing, will it feel nice
to have the top part of
my butt feel the breeze?
Maybe, and maybe that's enough for me.
Let's try these suckers on.
I don't know whether I can
wear underwear with them,
I guess I'm gonna find out.
Oh no
I feel like, to truly experience
these crack ass jeans,
I need to wear no underwear.
I have the jeans on, they look
pretty normal from the front,
but then you look at the butt,
and that's what they look like.
It looks like it's my ass crack.
I'm making mom jeans cool, turn it around.
Remember 2001 where
everyone had a whale tail
'cause they had low rise jeans.
Do you wanna relive that?
I'm gonna see what the great people
of New York City think
about my ass crack jeans.
Anybody want to talk to me about my jeans?
What do you think of my pants?
- They look good.
- They look comfortable but still stylish.
- Now I'm gonna show you what
they look like from behind.
- Okay.
- It's revolutionary.
- It's an interesting surprise.
- Why are you wearing that?
- That's super cute, I
think it's super cute.
- Not practical, probably
not comfortable either.
- I mean, it's sexy, I
would wear it clubbing,
but at the same time, I
wouldn't wear it clubbing,
because it's mom jeans.
- Is it supposed to show
off ass crack, or what?
Can I see more?
- It's covering the crack which is nice.
- We're calling these ass crack jeans.
- What would you call these jeans?
- Butt holey.
- I would call them Tramp Stamp Jeans.
If you had a tramp stamp, it
would show it off very well.
- The Slit, I don't know.
The Slit, that's what stands out.
- I am not wearing underwear.
- I'm glad.
- Do you think this is in?
- It could be.
- I don't know if it
would ever be a popular
- Oh okay.
- look or if it would've been in the past.
- I see this is making
it look like a crack,
but I don't see your crack.
- I mean, it kind of looks
like a swimsuit, a little bit.
- Do you think this is a
trend that's gonna catch on?
- No, no.
- No.
- No?
- No.
- I would wear those because
it would allow for me to put
on jewelry around there
which I normally wouldn't.
So that would be cute.
- What celebrities do you
think could wear these?
- Lady Gaga, 'cause she
can do whatever she wants.
- Gigi Hadid, obviously.
- I feel like Channing
Tatum could wear those,
and they would look great.
- Rihanna is the only celebrity,
I think, it would look flattering on.
- Angelina Jolie could pull those off.
- No, I don't think
she would even want to.
I don't want to see her wearing it then.
- They look really good from the front.
They look awesome, but then
why would they put that.
- Is it cool down there?
- I keep forgetting that
part of my ass is showing.
I just came back in
from walking the streets
of New York City with my ass half out.
I was able to boost my lower back,
upper butt self-confidence.
I've worn jeans where I
showed off more of my butt,
and I didn't feel self-conscious at all.
But honestly, I think I'm going
to try these on with a leotard or unitard,
because I like these jeans a lot.
They're super comfortable,
but I think this paneling
is just too weird.
But why, why would you show this off?
Some people said they'd wear it to a club,
but that's probably not
what I'm going to do.
But I could be a sexy
plumber for Halloween,
and that's how I'm probably
going to use these jeans.
