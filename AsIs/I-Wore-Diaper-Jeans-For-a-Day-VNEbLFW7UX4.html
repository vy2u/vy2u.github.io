from the pants and I understand I was
online just shopping and I came across
these crazy jeans that look exactly like
diapers they're not actually diapers but
they look absolutely bonkers
they're $5 so in the name of high
fashion I ordered them and I'm gonna
make my coworker Sarah try them so I
don't know where they're I don't know
whether to put them on the shorts first
or attach this all together I'm gonna
try and catch it all together and do it
that way
discovering that these diaper pants are
mysteriously baggy on the legs and
extremely tight around the button crotch
I'm gonna go show them to my co-workers
and see what they think of the diaper
jeans
hey um can I ask you what you think of
my pants can I see the back they're
definitely a choice what's going on I am
kind of attracted to you right now at
first I thought it was like you know tan
straps or something I don't know it was
just like the new style but now I see
that it's you they look extremely
constricting around the butt and then
way too much room around the thigh and
calf area literally I just like turned
designers here's an idea how about you
design jeans that fit bodies for when
they new I think they look rather nice I
feel like you're gonna get on a
motorcycle right now when you go to the
bathroom like it just like flip down the
top highs were just shorts and you
didn't have the leg parts it would not
look weird I would just think oh hi yeah
the tops of them definitely looked like
a jean diaper something like a really
cool baby would wear this is something
you would definitely buy at like a sex
shop
they look like chaps for a horseback
rider something you wear when you're
trying to get sexy alone with your horse
it's a good diaper but then mom Jean
styles
you guys think this is a trend that will
catch on yeah it'll probably catch on I
don't know I've seen it on the internet
kind of I think Kanye could probably
bring it in a style like Ariana Loki see
Megan Fox pulling this out I think it
actually that's $500 well spent somebody
whose thighs are your best feature these
pants these pants could really work for
you I'm struggling so much to take them
off the jords are just that tight
they're denim they don't have any give
is this a trend that's gonna catch on
thumbs up or thumbs down all right well
I guess I should take these off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
