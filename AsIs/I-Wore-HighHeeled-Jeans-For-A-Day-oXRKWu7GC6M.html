that's what's unclear I was shopping for
shoes one day online and I came across
the most intense high-heeled boots I've
ever seen they come up so high that they
turn into pants they are shoes and pants
in one and I just had to get a pair and
see if I could make somebody try them on
these are high heels stiletto boots that
go all the way to your waist they become
pants and yet they're also like buttless
the peekaboo butt or something I don't
know how I'm gonna get into these
when I first saw these I didn't even
think I could get this on my body and I
was I was wrong they're on my body so
that's impressive
this I'm I'm very surprised at I don't
think they look bad I like the height in
the front they're surprisingly stretchy
you could very stretchy enough stretchy
enough to fit a burrito if you want to
eat a burrito I am wearing underwear
there's like skin color shorts but I
don't know I assume you wear a thong
with this they want you to wear a phone
cuz you want to show your butt the
sizing for this is the shoe size so the
pants themselves are one size fits all
now we're gonna go and show people these
high-heeled jeans and see what they
think okay like regular oh my god okay I
didn't expect that oh my god this is
like HR violation the shoes are part of
the pants well that changed everything I
love them if you wear this out
you can't take your shoes off so if you
twist your ankle or you just don't want
to wear five-inch heels anymore you
don't have a choice you're wearing these
for the rest of the day
I kind of like it I'm kind of here for
it it's a look like this is her like
over here this is just like a million
hairband lines but just like all up and
down your legs but you get caught on
something and then you're like gonna go
down so the shoes are starting to get
pretty hot
and so I'm better starting to understand
the need for this ventilation right here
because it's the only thing keeping my
feet from turning into a swamp my oh do
they rip how did you hear them picket I
don't I felt a rip
even though pants are stretchy that
doesn't mean they can't rip that's
something I learned they look like
something in Kardashian would work thank
you they look like something Rihanna
where I feel like Rihanna would do this
this parts give me like Christina
Aguilera vibes this reads very like
Nickelodeon star who's like
experimenting a little bit to be honest
they're jeggings they're surprisingly
comfortable but for me like for me this
is this is too much if they cut it here
I think I would wear them I would
consider wearing them do you think this
is a fashion trend that's gonna catch on
no not even a little bit I really hope
not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
