mermaid jeans are great if there's
someone who wants to look like a mermaid
but you also still want to look like a
human adult these jeans are from Topshop
they look exactly like a mermaid fin and
we had to try them it's already falling
apart
they're already falling off the secrets
now I'm gonna try to get these mermaid
jeans on my body I feel like I'm more of
a low-key person so wearing something
this bright something this shiny is a
big step for me they're so shiny
you guys like my parents my friend has a
pillow like this and I couldn't sell
 baby Sparkle
I feel bad cuz I know they were like
over $100 and the sequins are falling
off but I can't stop touching these this
is like better than a fidget spinner
their sequins to rub here too bitch I'm
a mermaid they're comfortable jeans like
you can do your squats and you can do
your kicks do you wanna feel them I
think you want to feel up there's a
trail of sequins everywhere I'm gonna
hit the streets in New York and see what
people think of my new mermaid jeans
let's go please look at my pants and
tell me what you think of that I would
describe him as mermaid ish almost like
a mermaid type of sequins color looks
like a mermaid's tail kind of like
mermaid ish I would totally wear them oh
my god day and night absolutely dress it
up dress it down I think they're
fabulous I actually really like it it's
kind of cool for like casual like
hanging around in the park it hurts my
eyes a little bit just a little bit
would you ever wear these yeah I would I
would and in the right circumstance they
do you think of mermaid would wear these
jeans yes
if you had legs what a celebrity could
you see pulling these off Rihanna I see
Katy Perry in these four oh are you
gonna buy a pair are you gonna wear them
about boutique over men I mean why not I
don't see why you can't now if they do
I'll think about it where would you wear
these on a date at a club to a wedding
party everywhere now you pull it off and
I'm not even saying it to say that
people seem to really love these mermaid
jeans even more than I could have ever
imagined I've lost probably like a
hundred sequins where at me because you
can move them up and you can move them
down and then you can move them up and
then you can move them down I guess
these pants would be great to wear when
you're drunk because you will never get
lost you can hoist just follow the
sequin trail home a lot of people
thought you could wear the slip during
the day and you can keep it more casual
and it made me realize I could take more
chances with my fashion you can wear
them out at night or you can you know
feel yourself during the day whatever I
would not have picked these pants out
and I probably would've put them on
unless my coworker forced me to but I'm
very glad she did because turns out I
can pull off this look wait this is a
mermaid's comb their hair right right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
