there's not really any selling point for
why I'm doing this I got this dress at a
vintage estate sale and there was
something about it that I was like I can
pull this off and it was really marked
down so I just decided to get it two
years later it has been sitting in my
closet it was a tag on it and I've never
worn it there is no occasion or season
that it really fits for the dress has a
very high neck and then it has a slit
down the legs this is like the dress
that Angelina Jolie would wear in Tomb
Raider when she's like hiding knives and
guns under a dress and needs to
assassinate someone I'm ready to try it
on I guess so welcome to the year 2030
apparently I'm about ready to hop on my
spaceship this dress is also way more
staticky than I remembered like I cannot
walk without it sticking and it looks
like an elephant so I have a couple of
things going on today that I would
really love to not be wearing this dress
for I have to interview someone I have a
couple important meetings but I guess
this is just on the plus side it is
incredibly comfy it's kind of Snuggie
chic on Monday one of my period so I
need comfort over everything I already
put a jacket over I know I'm being very
overly dramatic but it just feels a
little extra for work I guess you don't
think it's weird
fall I love the color Anthony what do
you think sitting laughing
hundreds my rocking it but I understand
why it was good you're okay thank you I
have noticed a really bad part of this
dress and it is that this slit just
happens and it's just a lot what do you
think of the outfit I'm wearing right
now trying to get work done and I look
down that's really that's really great
for work I just had a video call with
someone and they complimented my outfit
I don't know if that's because they
thought it was a shirt and they don't
realize I'm wearing a suede almost
floor-length dress but I will take it
it's shiny in the right way is it suede
yeah very sad chicken okay so it is
almost the end of the day I just pumped
gas in this I have never felt more
overdressed pumping gas um the attendant
looked at me kind of like this maybe
isn't the place for that dress but no
one's really noticed in fact I've gotten
a couple compliments so I think this
just proves that like you're in your own
head more than anyone else is really
thinking about what you're doing I'm
home and I was like yes it's time to
take off the dress the zippers too god
damn high so I'm gonna have to wait for
someone to zip me out of it
so this was a big problem all day I just
felt like I was on the edge of flashing
someone my butt my girlfriend is getting
home later than I expected so I've been
doing like this contortionist act my
face is all red for me clothes should be
worn if they make you feel good
I mean clothes should be worn probably
at least at work but I got this dress
and some part of me really loved this
dress the next time I wear it I'll
probably wear it to a more formal
no one really cares what you're wearing
like you can take the faster fashion
risks you want to take and no one's
really watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
