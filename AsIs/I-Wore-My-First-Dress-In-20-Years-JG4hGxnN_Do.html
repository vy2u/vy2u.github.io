last time I wore a dress was and I can't
I'm sure that I wore one on my eighth
birthday always have hated dresses
always I imagine that you would feel
really liberated wearing a dress so I
wish that I liked them
I definitely like them on other people
yeah I just don't feel comfortable
personally in them this is gonna truly
be a challenge for me
I'm gonna feel pretty bad I assume for
most of the day when you've looked at
particular way for a really long time
you become afraid of looking anything
outside of that my ideal dress is just a
really long shot she looks nice with her
beanie that's something I would wear it
just looks like a long t-shirt it's
pretty short but can I wear stockings
underneath no no all right that's a
maybe I don't like this one because it's
got this like open part here that wear
reveals the side it's loose but it's
still like you can tell that she's got
hips and a bot and that's stuff that I
don't normally shout out to the public
so no this is a red and black so there's
a bit of color here
not too much leopard print shirt dress
you really want me to show my legs look
I think this kind of suits my style but
still that's so much thigh then No
and that side-split it's black that
would be really challenging because
that's like sexy I like this one that's
mad see this is this is what I'm talking
about actually I really like this
because of all the texture in that
pleats good and it's just like this box
EOS boring black long t-shirt I love it
I left the house today and had to turn
around because I realized I hadn't
shaved my legs not that we have to to
wear a dress but it was the first time
where I actually cared to I'm so tired
I'm getting my period so that sucks for
when you're about to put a dress on for
the first time in what 20 years dress
number one is how my insides feel right
now
I feel like I'm not wearing anything at
all I feel really free and cold but
mostly free overall it doesn't feel as
bad as I thought and it's not as short
as I thought too
I was really afraid of it being short I
hate it I just straight-up hate this one
I thought I would like this one the most
it kind of feels like a uniform so it's
some kind of conservative cold get out
of here god damn it look at that
flip look at my leg already it's like
just poking out there thank God look at
that but I don't know what to do with my
buddy this one makes me feel the least
comfortable out of the three options
maybe it does look good right now I feel
terrible I don't feel confident at all I
wish I were better underwear see these
are things that people who wear dresses
have to think about this is like
combating so many fears at once maybe it
might increase them time will tell
let's see how many stairs I can do now
this is kind of fun Wow yes yes approved
elegant very elegant this sleek black
it's really cute it's oh it suits you
yeah I saw you from far away I was like
oh that looks like tan but she's wearing
a dress that can't be tan I think you
look good it's it's a little bit strange
but I've never seen you wear a dress
before it's a minor thing but I haven't
actually won one for 20 years 20 years
yeah it is interesting how you define
like your personality about what you
wear when you change it you realize it's
all the performance I lucked out hanging
out in a stairwell normally the security
pass is attached to my pants I have none
hi
I looked up yeah sure
thank you do you notice anything
different about me while you're at it
this is not here I've never seen you
wear a dress before this is so cool
it's hard to not stare at your legs but
I shouldn't say your legs you objectify
me I think I turned a gay man by yes a
little bit a little bit
so my girlfriend literally just text me
to ask whether I'm in the dress already
I have invited her out for coffee
here are my original clothes and here is
my leg in case you forgot how it looks
like
like the legs
it's really
but when I sit down it like shows my
entire vagina ah basically that's what
it feels like fun though totally forgot
that I was in a dress and then I caught
sight of my reflection I was like
that's right she said you look really
fancy and like you're about to walk into
a room and just fire everybody what a
compliment honestly so far wing in a
dress has been my favorite thing that
I've done as an individual it's the end
of the day and it's like it's kind of a
bummer to be honest era because I'm so
shocked that you're saying that because
you so did not want to do this I know
but the only time I felt this
comfortable is literally when I wore my
pajamas to work they're so convenient
going to the toilet going to the
restroom and just like getting out of
there within seconds Wow and everyone's
has been like looking me up and down
checking out my legs I'm kind of
enjoying that as fun someone was like
that's the first time I've seen your
ankles which was pretty funny ankles I
can't fault it apart from like a couple
of times it felt like it was writing so
far up mm-hmm
it was like almost just at my underwear
it would just reminded me like how much
of a performance clothing is I know it's
like not that far off from what I
normally wear it's still black it's
still kind of goth but this was a really
big deal for me I actually legitimately
think I would wear this too
a casual kind of event maybe like a like
a movie film opening or like a nice
dinner with a mate
you often tell yourself that you can't
do something especially when it comes to
clothing or hair color hair style you
know we're like can I pull that off of
course you can pull it off and boring
I've realized today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
