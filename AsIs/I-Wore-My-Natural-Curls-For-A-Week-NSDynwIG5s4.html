hoodie right now so I don't get my hair
wet because if a speck of rain gets on
it it's gonna be super curly this is my
natural hair and I should take care of
it I struggle with finding perfection
and things when you do something that
you're scared to do it opens doors for
you to be more confident and other
things you need to lock yours now none
of us are perfect so why should our
hairpiece I'm Sheila and I'm going to
try to embrace my curls for a week I
have naturally curly big wavy hair I
straighten it almost every day and it
takes me about an hour and a half
my mom is Peruvian and she has really
thick coarse black hair and my dad is
Persian and he has a lot of hair I'm
just a poor ball of air so I would see
people on TV like Beyonce and Taylor
Swift and they would have this silky
straight hair and to realize that they
actually have naturally curly hair and
made me feel that curly hair wasn't as
glamorous I just don't want to be
embarrassed with something that I
naturally have I don't want to hide
behind straighteners all the time
hopefully I don't come out looking like
a chia pet since I'm gonna wear my hair
naturally curly I decided to talk to
professional Shai who's known as the
curl doctor to give me a few tips on how
to style my hair I have naturally frizzy
curly hair and I'm really nervous to
wear it out they say a phrase is a crow
waiting to happen I wouldn't worry so
much you just have to enjoy it
understand that it's beautiful the way
it is the more you flow down your hair
the more you deform your crow pattern
and when the crow pattern is deformed
it's hard to make it bounce and have the
same elasticity everyone I'm janae Diggs
I'm shiz assistant I've been natural for
almost four years now how do I get to
get my hair looking as great as well
no more straightening it
you want to hydrate the hair so water
soluble products ideal celebrities in
front of camera reached out to me you
know like zendaya Tamera Mowry these are
girls that have beautiful curly hair but
just never had the proper education my
curls are trying to come out you're
looking for moisture in the air and
that's why mr. Frizzell there try it's
like wearing a straitjacket and it grows
out of your head curly yes so why not
enjoy the wait girls out of your head oh
my god it's so curly wow this is I'm
beyond excited for her hair journey I'm
ecstatic for her I'm ecstatic for
everybody who wants to do this we're
done with the society standards that our
hair needs to be straight none of us are
perfect so why should our hair be
today's day one so we'll see how it goes
the rest of the week hopefully can stay
looking this fleek lot of my peers have
never seen my hair curly so some of them
might be in for a surprise
we've been in this bathroom for like I
think ten minutes now probably you
definitely sync it up and try and get
you a pep talk
what will be on they do yeah natural
curls
yeah all the curly heads listen what's
not real is it is it's beautiful no I'm
gonna be wrong if it is your natural
hair power to you sister
so many compliments they're so nice I
thought your net was so strange
rocky girl rock girl I can't stop
touching my hair the curls feel very
intact like I keep putting my hands
through it and they're staying in place
styling it correctly really makes a
difference I'm not gonna lie I do miss
my straightener but I don't miss the
amount of time that I spent
straightening my hair I feel like a
really want experiment now now that I'm
getting a little more comfortable
so I'm trying this new updo hairstyle
it's a bit different from what I
normally do trying to be Beyonce with
this trying to work it actually like day
3 hair it's definitely losing some of
the crews but I'm not bad about
only took me two minutes to do my hair
two minutes
so I normally am hesitant to wear my
hair out in the rain I don't have to
worry about it being straight and the
more moisture the better so today is
such an emotional day because I think
for the first time I don't really miss
my straightener I'm content with the way
my hair is right now I'm so grateful for
learning how to style it because there
is a routine to curly hair that I never
got the chance to learn I just want to
be able to care so much I was new in
October I never wore my hair curly I was
really afraid of that I didn't think it
looked good and then I started wearing
it curly again and I've never bought so
many compliments in my life I would see
their curly hair and I would say it's so
beautiful but I like couldn't see that
in myself I understand your anxiety
about wearing your hair natural because
it's scary
I remember Princess Diaries they
straightened her hair because it was
frizzy that for me was a big thing that
I was like oh I should straight my hair
to Mia Thermopolis didn't I'm doing it
just how it naturally is and I'm not
trying to make it perfect so I'm still
trying to get used to my curly hair one
of the ways that will help me do so is a
photo shoot and I brought one of my good
friends andreia I've been campaigning
for this curly hair for three years
she's such a confident person and I feel
like embracing the curl it's gonna make
you just explode I'm ready to do this on
a drag
I felt so confident and pretty like I
never thought that wearing my hair curly
I could look like a Pantene commercial
when you do something that you're scared
to do it opens doors for you to be more
confident other things I look like that
like I don't believe this it's one of
those things like she saw it on paper so
there's evidence you know that the curls
can make her feel powerful and sexy
vulnerable and different and thoroughly
her do things that put you out of your
comfort zone I feel like I learned a lot
about who I was today I really felt
confident it was so much more fun and
freeing and just to touch my curls and
feel the texture during the shoot was
really cool I embraced who I was and I
felt like people saw that and we're so
open to it my hair has a personality of
its own one that I wasn't used to seeing
on camera I'm so used to having a
perfect sleek look and then now seeing
the images and like whoa my hair is
coming to life I won't give up
straightening my hair completely but I
will definitely embrace wearing my curls
more often
I sleep in my morning in the bathroom
training her hair I'll be like not go
out a little more nigga man she's like
no you come in tomorrow because I'm
still straightening my hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
