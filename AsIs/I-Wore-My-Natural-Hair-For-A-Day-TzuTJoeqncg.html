what time is it it's like 3:00 in the
morning so for the first time in five
years I'm gonna be wearing my natural
hair for a day I feel like my identity
is tied into my hair almost when I take
out my hair at night I'm literally going
to do it the next morning no one has
ever seen the in-between a little
nervous about like going a whole day
natural because I feel like not only
will they be in shock that my hair's
like super huge but like they're like
what happened where's the color honestly
I think everyone's gonna be shocked I'm
just gonna scare people let's do this so
our very young age my mom relaxed my
hair which is when you basically use
like chemicals to like straighten out
your curls and then when I got into high
school I would straighten my hair on top
of the chemical and I went through this
like emo phase so I used to put like
purple streaks in my hair and then that
kind of became my thing but eventually
the straightener was like damaging my
hair so I wanted to protect it and so
the first time I took out my braids my
hair was like an afro and I had no idea
what to do with it
so this is what it looks like before I
wash it I had to do so much preparation
just before I went to bed okay can we
just talk about shrinkage for a moment
my hair is literally a sponge
I think natural has beautiful but I'm a
little lazy when it comes to like the
upkeep it's just a big ball of fluff I
like just waking up and having my hair
like already done it kind of feels like
being naked cuz I'm so like used to
having long purple hair look at her all
natural I love it I think it looks so
good from behind I was like who is that
I'm obsessed I feel like this should be
you every single day
most people were like oh you look so
different but in a good way I think your
hair looks beautiful I think looks
really nice I really think this hair
opens you up it was really surprised
that all the reactions were positive
because I didn't really think I looked
good with my natural hair I mean I know
it's like it's like a like a long
journey to sometimes except the way that
your hair grows in your head I still
have
with mine so to be honest like I'm
getting my head on tomorrow because that
is why I prefer it's okay to style your
hair any way that you want you don't
need to be judged by anyone just because
you are natural but it's also okay to
love you a natural hair and do whatever
makes you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
