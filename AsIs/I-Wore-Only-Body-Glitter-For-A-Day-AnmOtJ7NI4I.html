gonna make me top and some leggings made
completely out of glitter I'm excited
but I'm also really scared because other
than glitter I'm basically naked
I'm afraid that a gust of wind will
knock it all up and everyone will see my
my girls I'm excited to kind of just get
to celebrate my body I'm not gonna tell
my mom about this cuz I never know she's
gonna say but we'll just keep it between
you and me you're in the Internet I'm
Sofia and I'm Holly and we're go get
glitter we are a specialist little
cosmetics brand that travels from the UK
all around the world trying to spread
the sparkle today we're going to be
creating a glitter fashion 4d look it
will take about an hour we're using our
metallic classic glitter set which you
can purchase online on my website it's
all biodegradable and 43 we also want to
try and push the idea that people should
feel comfortable in the skin they're in
why are you holding those we're putting
them on my bum so we can put glitter
around it I went to pride and I think it
was the first time I saw someone just
walking around in pasties and I was like
how do you do that
I want to do that but I don't really
want to do that I think there's some
mornings when you wake up and you look
at yourself and you're really pleased
with what you see and then there's other
days where you just pick apart all the
little things that you don't like my
hips are too wide or maybe they're not
wide enough my stomach isn't as flat as
I would want it to be there's just so
many things and I think it's all really
stupid I think the best thing you can do
for yourself is just to embrace every
single part of you and not care about
what other people think about it
okay so I'm about to look at myself oh
I'm so shiny here yeah I think I'm
definitely a lot better with this now
because it looks so cool and it kind of
distracts me from the fact that I'm like
pretty much naked it's literally like a
rainbow of colors oh my god now that I'm
completely covering glitter and I think
I'm ready to go outside and show my
friends I feel ridiculously naked now
that we're outside it wasn't until I got
outside that I realized how scared I was
to let people see me like this
although I didn't show it it was instant
regret you're a little exposed like you
have a pet glitter muncher
Coachella but no one else is at
Coachella I had to remind myself that I
wasn't doing this to get other people's
reactions I was simply trying to feel
more comfortable in my own skin just
like a phase you're going through a
phase and people judge me and I didn't
appreciate it so I'm not gonna judge you
what do you think would you do this zone
know if you're confident about you and
you're confident about your appearance
it doesn't really matter what everyone
thinks yeah I think this experience
really taught me that if you can exert
confidence and be yourself in any
situation wearing whatever you can do
anything I would do it again but I'm not
gonna do in my office you're not gonna
get me to do this in my office again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
