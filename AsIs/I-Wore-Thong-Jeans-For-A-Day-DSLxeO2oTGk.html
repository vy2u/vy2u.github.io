sister took and then like ruined her
clothing I was looking online and I
found these high-fashion
song jeans that debuted Amazon fashion
week in Tokyo they're basically just
jeans with everything cut off of them
except for the seams my first thought
was Sarah's gotta try these I went and
tried to find them but it seems like the
only place that the designer sells is
within Japan so I am going to DIY them
let's do this just Lee that seems like a
waste of perfectly good jeans but they
are complete I'm gonna go find Sarah and
make her try them wait what is this I
made them for you oh my god all right
let's go do it I'm gonna put these long
jeans on and I don't know why I agreed
to do this can you imagine not wearing
anything with these you would be seeing
everything boy go look like a video game
character cuz it's like video game
characters always wearing outfits that
you're like why people of New York City
always surprised me with how much they
liked the weird pants I put on so this
time I'm gonna guess that they're gonna
absolutely love the thong jeans
what do you think of my pants are you
sure there's a really pants jeans
surprise you can come up a pants but I
like though wow it's all about
deconstructionism really obviously you
know this is a breaking it all down and
then you know not building it back up
just leaving it down think they're
interesting and cute and fun I think it
depends on what you're wearing
underneath them a bitch knows to layer
in Manhattan where would you see these
pants again the beach should be great
what you're doing is perfect museum
installations amazing so you're
basically saying these jeans are a work
of art maybe you feel like we're to the
beach it's just like an easy like over
thing that'd be kind of cute and sexy I
guess so what would you call these Oh
with fake pants pants outline jeans regs
these are the Internet's calling these
thong jeans fun pants
G jeans feel like g-string what celeb
can pull this off Rihanna Rihanna will
walk outside and go to the Grammys with
this and we'd be like oh my god yes
Taylor Swift Tina Turner for sure Jaden
Smith Santa from Game of Thrones LeBron
I'd like to see him dunk with this do
you guys think that this is a trend that
will catch on definitely make parents
not happy and kids love that maybe if
you started best beginning of summer
it's possible wear them confidently and
have your friends wear them and let's
see how it spreads around you have a lot
of old pairs of jeans that I don't know
what to do with them so if I cut them up
yeah you look great you do back in from
where the song jeans out it was an
experience I'm not really into these
pants lights I'm still very happy that I
went out to the streets of New York City
and asked people what they thought
because people are really nice and
friendly and even if they were mean
about the jeans they were nice to me and
they made me feel good the young men I
interviewed said that I was pulling them
off because I had confidence which is
not something I really felt but
apparently I exuded it so that's good to
know but maybe even if you don't feel
confident what you're wearing you can
look confident and that's enough all
right well I'm gonna take them off now I
mean or I just leave them on
because it's like I'm wearing nothing
anyway I can cover this that's holy this
is a commentator on society take her
seriously no matter what her fashion
choices are that's a very personal and
individual subjective thing and you
cannot really judge someone based on
their fashion statements thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
