gonna wear a velvet blazer and then I
never wear it everybody has some stuff
in your closet that you're like why is
that there I don't know that was a
mistake but I can't throw it out cuz I
spent money on it so tomorrow actually
gonna wear that things and see if maybe
it's just something that I don't like or
other people will agree with me why do
you want that that's not you stop
wasting money on you don't need do
something in your closet that you don't
like like a lot alright let's go see
what's in the old closet eh
so here it is I'm not gonna beat around
the bush this thing is see-through I
don't own a nude slip so I just wear it
with a black one I actually really like
the drawings on it I wish they were on a
different piece of clothing the wrap
itself is not very flattering on me this
dress is also just short enough that you
have to shave your legs when you wear it
but it's also too long to wear it with
tights me in this dress we're gonna do
it
get a suck it looks like a spy
rope I have to again wear the slip under
it because it is see-through the rap is
like sewn here so it's like connected
there and so it just kind of like flops
like that and it's not as neat of a wrap
she does have pockets so that's a plus
I'm old southern belle and I'm gonna
yell at ya to get off my lawn I coming
out my slippers waving a baguette at you
is that what something people do
oh I love the print I'm a sucker for
football gets long on you which is nice
this is the thing that I hate most in my
closet
why you can't control how like fitta is
ever buy anything that you're like this
is like something I'm aspiring to but
it's not necessarily yes I feel like I
do that all the time you just get a
different type of dealt a like a writer
of Mel what is up with that why like
replace that and actually extend your
waist a little bit of sort of like Julia
Roberts in a afternoon Roberts though
she is Julia yeah I think it's adorable
you like it I do but I definitely it
seems like a wardrobe malfunction
waiting to happen my clothes lying
everywhere it's probably like fancy
stuff but I was like oh that's trendy
and then I was like what's that one sad
enough it's not that it's like a fashion
thing where people dress like older
women but it's like the coolest aisle
now
but like I'm about to drink coffee in
this dress which is gonna be a pretty
big challenge for me
this dress is asking for coffee to be
spilled all over it oh it's cute I like
it on you
it looks like you're going to church
pages something like a grandmother dress
shoes yeah it isn't like you she's like
oh like it's something I feel like you
were wear so your grandmother doesn't
say like you're going to watch day yeah
just gotta tighten this I'll guess what
this camp is hi yeah I'm just cold
I'm just so cold it's funny if you can
film me I want to be like I like your
dress then you were about to film me
this is come on time I think 20 times
today why you let me just hear hold it
okay it's a shame because it's really
cute and like I don't think I would
second guess and I saw you wearing it so
like maybe you can repurpose it or
something yeah maybe I can like make it
into a pillow or something I just ran up
like four flights of stairs I've been
asking people if they bought things
they haven't worn that they regret
buying overwhelmingly people say yeah
they bought things that they felt we're
aspirational purchases it makes me happy
that at least I'm not alone in that
aspect I'm looking forward to donating
this dress to somebody who will you know
really appreciate it who probably is a
couple inches taller than me and can
wear it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
