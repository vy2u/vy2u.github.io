You Kate I just was a I haven't seen you
in a couple days I know you've been so
busy doing you are writing the second
season of unfortunately Ashley which is
Ashley presents and other buzz feeders
show and we haven't seen each other well
I wrote the season and now we're filming
and it's gonna be a pretty good show I'm
excited for it it's gonna come out
December 15th you guys want to see it
where I keep plugging everything is not
it's that's our lives now is we're
 bloggers podcasters goddammit so
I've noticed okay so from working so
much I've noticed that when I do have a
moment to like go out boy do i I was
drunk all weekend thing on Sunday I was
like I'm gonna give my liver a break and
I'm just gonna you know drink yeah I
mean that is technically I think lighter
on the liver venom whiskey which is what
we were drinking cool avoid is whiskey
make me fine there's a little love in my
heart for whiskey I with the
whiskey I like fightin to be quite
honest I'm having like an incredibly
good week things are going so dope and
I'm really happy and it's just one of
those things where it feels too good to
be true when things are going really
well
I immediately go how can I this up
boy we're getting into it real quick
hmm believing you don't deserve certain
things like if you work for something
it's not gonna not gonna happen I'm
constantly waiting for the other shoe to
drop I take daily between I am a goddamn
queen who deserves the world and I am a
trash person who should be stepped on
every day so when when things are going
well we're very cautious but I think we
should slow down a little bit and
appreciate when things are going well
yeah cuz nine times out of ten we're
always complaining I mean things will go
badly again that's for sure like just
because things go well I think that's
like the thing that happens kind of a
lot
I don't know social media encourages
this my theory is that it does is that
because you could sort of control how
you're seen and like how your do how
people think you're doing yeah you know
what I mean so you sort of have this
like idea of how she got her perfect
body you like how she you know is doing
this or you know there you're on a
vacation you're living this perfect life
but the truth of the matter is is that
you will always have good times and
always have bad times yes I think a lot
of times I personally sabotage the good
times
fearing I'm getting ready for the bad
time sometimes I'll look back I like my
Instagram are my
feed and be like wow I was faking
looking like I was having the best time
like I look so happy in this moment like
I was killing it with and I was so
unhappy
I do that okay listen I hear oh is it I
know this isn't it coach to say did you
just a brave coach I'm sorry let me
start that let's get that out no for
keepin that in a lot of times I'll
post stuff because I just bite Wow
excuse me don't apologize I despite or
out of like for the love of God please
light into my dance for the wall of God
I just don't have to do with what we
were just talking about post stuff about
me you're doing happier or like being
happier than you actually are
Oh every day I'm waiting for someone to
confess their undying love that they've
had for me for years
senior social media we did have a ton of
you guys write to us on Twitter and
Instagram that's not only complimenting
us which we totally appreciate in
like can't even handle we don't know
what to do with all this awesome
feedback but asking us questions and we
thought what better way to to
have a segment then pull some of the
questions you guys asked us and
answer right here live it's not live so
we have our first question who comes it
comes from a girl named Courtney and we
don't want to say her like handle or any
Charlotte well I was gonna okay I'm
using a big name okay we're gonna use a
fake name it says from Courtney sure um
she wrote in and asked and that's the
other thing is we're gonna keep her name
anonymous right now because we don't we
didn't ask if we could yeah I'll do for
you know her profile was private yeah so
if you don't mind us answering your
question on the air just tell us when
you write us like say we can use this
she wanted to know talking about our
first episode about hoe member coming up
she wanted to know it's here it's here
it's officially November Charlotte asked
Oh whoops Kourtney slash Charlotte we've
already this up she wanted to
know how do you prep for hoe member Wow
great question great question I feel
like we covered the mental prep came on
our first episode if you haven't
listened to that go ahead listen mm-hmm
but there also is I think some like you
got a physically prep a little bit for
November I think this is gonna be a
really interesting
question for both Kelsey unite to answer
because of the fact that Kelsey is a
seasoned veteran in makeup and hair and
leg tips hat to myself I mean just like
personal maintenance I like that she's
got it and I will talk to everyone out
there who struggles so do you want to go
first I am one of those feminists who
believe that you don't have to
look good for anyone I truly love to get
ready for myself and if a girl
complements me when I'm out that is way
bigger of a compliment than I
dude of course a dude is gonna come up
to me and be like hey you look good on
my dick we do yeah and to me really
actually no one's ever said look no I
don't have to morons yeah yeah I do but
it is the biggest compliment if a chick
likes what I'm doing with myself so just
I would say go in with that mindset that
you're getting ready for you if you like
the way you look and you're gonna rock
you know maybe a bold lip or kind of an
outfit you wouldn't normally wear out
like ho vember the time to experiment
you don't have to be your self
at all I would actually say don't be
yourself whatsoever fail so you make it
baby you've gotten yourself here so yeah
thank you you can take it baby and I'm
talking about the deck or the
whatever you are doing like and what
about what you say for you okay your
mental game or yeah I have more
sweatshirts and sweatpants then I do
full outfit through I'm by Cena and
they're great thank you this is a nice
pale pink thank you very little
millennial pink of you okay so what I
would say is definitely shower one cuz
if you're gonna go out it's gonna be
sweaty and stuff like that you want to
make sure all your and really get in
there make sure all your creases are not
they're not holding any sort of
bacterial action your creases are in
greases yeah get rid of the grease from
your crease okay
and then I would say also take care of I
haven't done it in a while but take care
of the upper lip hair mmm that's
good one the nipple hair oh do you
really do you think hair people are
noticing hair that I noticed I feel
better hmm I have dark hairs so I feel
better when they're gone right I've let
my eyebrows go cuz I don't give a
and then the nips you know I try to
pluck them have it in a while but
they're no I don't have nipple hair but
I have this one crazy I got one there
tick dark chest hair yeah Valar
testosterone I think there's one video
that Eugene made you can go look at it
on BuzzFeed where he actually pulled it
out with his teeth and I'll just leave
that behind on your own time for
dressing because sometimes it's hard I
find it really hard to like get myself
actually ready because I wear so many
comfortable clothes and I'm not
necessarily always confident in my body
I have like bigger boobs so sometimes
like hanky so sometimes like if I wear a
bra like I have like the back you
know that happens whatever I don't think
anyone else Minds it but I just stop
wearing a bra nice stop wearing a bra
and wear a skirt and that's how I feel
good just yeah I what you said wearing
what you feel comfortable and also the
nipple is back in guys like I and also I
don't think they realize yeah it's free
in the tits it's it's only been
beneficial for the longest time I was
like it's gonna hurt because for sure
there are people who like for sure can't
yeah you know it just it hurts it hurts
just you know what you're comfortable in
yeah anything you look you know yeah you
can't ho if you're uncomfortable if
you're wearing heels that you are giving
you blisters or you're in an outfit
where you feel like you're not gonna be
able to be your best you have to be
comfortable and if that means
wearing millennial pink sweatshirt out
and getting that Ditka place then
 wear that sweatshirt out
sweatshirts give me cute yeah I'm really
into rock and just t-shirts right now
another thing I sort of came to terms
with because I heard a lot of people
sort of give me advice about being like
you got to wear like something super
low-cut you got a dress sexy and that
pissed you me off to no end because I'm
like okay if you want to okay so if what
you're only looking for is going and
getting or or whatever
fine and you have like a certain like
okay I know that this is the right it's
gonna sound awful bait to use you know
what I mean and just be like okay cool
here's what I have going on definitely
the flavor or if you're looking for
someone who
you would connect with and have like a
fun time with even if it's just a
one-night stand where what you're
comfortable in because if they're not
approaching you wearing what you're
comfortable in then they're not they're
not that truly not only do they not
deserve you
chances are you guys aren't gonna mesh
and they're not gonna be able to make
you come truth on that and
basing off of like what I hate to say
like relationships don't happen out of
HO member but like if you're going in
with a mindset to hoe and then really
truly deep down you want a relationship
you're gonna hurt yourself
so like be honest you can still be a hoe
and like be honest with your feelings
you can still be wrong why don't your
feelings yeah you can still be a hoe and
want to be in a relationship it's a
state of mind it is not a physical act
and it's up to you I think that's
another thing that it doesn't always
feel like it's a it's up to you and that
kind of brings us to the next question
the same darlin Cortney whatever her
name was the second question was what do
you do with the regret and the guilt
that you feel after hooking up in like a
one-night stand sort of situation and if
that's the case that's a pretty layered
question cuz there's multiple ways that
this can be let's unpack it like a nice
onion we should also mention that we are
doing sober vember and we had we posted
on on our social medias and a lot of
people messaged just being like how the
 are we supposed to do hope ember
sober obviously guys we have no
clue I don't even know how to do ho
member yeah it's a pipe dream this is
nice we this is a big step for both of
us so yeah I can't speak for you but I
can definitely I told this to you a
million times I told the group chat that
I definitely sometimes use alcohol as
not a way to bring out my confidence but
as almost as an excuse so like it numbs
your insecurities it numbs my
insecurities what drunk people danced on
freaking table Touche so I have a real
hard time with things I talk about this
in therapy like a lot things that I
enjoy mm-hmm give me extreme guilt so
like I choke and say like I'm a prude
and stuff like that but really it's
and even like being bisexual is sort of
like I still sort of hold back because
I'm just sort of like I don't I don't
deserve this I don't I I can't do I
can't enjoy this and it makes me feel
like dirty and weird and you know that
could be unpacked in a bunch of
different ways so that's one thing maybe
you know if it's something along the
lines of you feel guilty because you
feel bad for enjoying yourself in that
way because we are kind of taught to not
enjoy ourselves in that way then that's
something to like maybe work on in
smaller doses like what what's your
favorite food what's your favorite like
song what's your color like pamper
yourself with like your favorite sin in
other ways if you're feeling guilty
because you didn't want to do it
maybe examine like what what you how you
got there yeah and like there's no I
know it really feels like you know we're
joking around about home ember and being
and you know talking about it but it's
what you it's what you want to do when
it's also subjective and there are so
many like most of the time I literally
all of the time I don't go home with
bats or girls you don't want to on the
first date I might want to like maybe
dance with them or like flirt or
something like that but it's not within
my comfort level to be like yeah let's
go home so you're allowed to if you want
to and you don't have to if you don't
want you and it doesn't mean you're a
prude and it doesn't mean you're not
like it's a chill cool girl it just
where is I am the quite opposite of that
when I I liked one-night stands I don't
have like you know I don't consider it
to be a thing I think it's a
great way to like test to see if you
have chemistry with someone the worst
thing that has happened to me is where
I've hit it on the park with someone
personality-wise because I think I
haven't I think I have a pretty outgoing
personality where people week I I'm a
people person and then the worst thing
is find out you have no sexual chemistry
and sometimes even if I'm going or I'm
looking for a relationship I would like
to figure that out sooner than later
mm-hmm
let me tell you what what does turn me
on is when the act is happening and
maybe we slow it down because we like
each other and it doesn't have to like
snowball into sects each time like I
think sometimes we'll start talking and
I'll stay up till 3:00 in the morning
talking to this person or like we'll go
end up going to like a diner and
grabbing like a late night drunk snack
or something I think that is also to me
ho member like I'm still doing what I
want to do like as long as you feel like
you're in control like the second you
feel out of control I would say wave the
flag go out yeah you know I I think
sober member is gonna be good for me
because I usually don't have sex with
someone for the first time without
alcohol for the first time sleeping with
them I wasn't not drinking alcohol so
like okay so the second time maybe we
were sober before that but the first
time there's something about like those
nerves and that jitteriness that like
maybe a glass of wine helps me feel more
comfortable with my sexuality so like
for this November I specifically wanted
to be sober to see if I'm comfortable in
my own body and feeling like a sexual
being and I gotta say I have never been
more horny in my life I'm
talking about
I wake up masturbating yeah it's I have
it might also be a combination of I
stopped taking my birth control like
three months ago for the first body's
like obvious yeah I'm the I have
never been more like turned on by
conversation or art or a song or
something and I I feel like it's
actually kind of perfect of course I'm
scared of course I'm nervous to be able
to like go out and have to approach
people without the confidence of alcohol
but I think I know it's gonna be really
good for me yeah I think another thing
is that sometimes even with alcohol I
regret the things that I do like the
things that I say and like I won't
necessarily always be clear I'll think
I'm being clear but I'm not being there
and then I'm like oh you sweet bitch
whatever you do put that as our third
March it's a sweet bitch sweet bitch
it's it yeah so I it's gonna be
interesting to know it's also gonna be
really good cause I'm trying to save
money
yeah alcohol is so expensive I spent so
much this weekend drinking and I really
tried listen guys listen listen I really
really tried to get with this guy
weekend oh it was well okay it was my
good friend
let me tell you that there were two guys
that you were trying to get with okay
the one you wanted to get with I didn't
ever like for you ever I was like NAT
yes second guy who I'm still rooting for
I really want to happen
spoiler alert neither one we're here but
you haven't tried yeah I know I know
that's another thing okay let's talk
about this okay a rookie - a rookie -
pro ho I was talking to this guy at like
a bar and this girl kind of comes up to
him and puts her hands in his pockets
there was a what the is happened to
me and this is after you guys have been
flirting like standing talking to each
other for like an hour but I also don't
know so that's that's interesting I feel
like I remember hearing guys talk about
how their look I don't know this girl's
flirting with me or just talking to me
or whatever
no and now you guys were flirting okay
cool so you're flirting however and then
he she's doing that I'm like I will
literally round ya in a bit
I was on the dance floor and all of a
sudden everyone's dancing swaying back
and forth and then all of a sudden out
of the corner of my eye I just see Kate
there's a dance alarm making full-blown
locked I contact with me and I went what
what she did poison ivy and I was like
come here and grab my hand and I'm like
what it she's like oh just your weight
cuz she knew I had been watching her
like oh yeah that's my girls going
I told her everything cuz he then put
his hand on her shoulder yeah it was
obvious that they were something buddy
yeah but then I tell you like told her
about it she was like oh absolutely not
you go back at you piss on your
territory so what did we do we walk back
over there and he literally turned his
body away from her and I looked in her
arms or like coming through and like
holding it yeah that she was trying to
koala on him it was a very amazing what
is happening she we walked over there
and I immediately started talking to her
to distract her it was like hi oh my god
II love your skirt are you and you
turned to him in his and say shots I
forgot so we do around the shots and she
doesn't and I'm still trying to Train
wingman so while I'm talking
her kate says i said who is she to you
and he was like oh we've been in like a
couple dates follow a lot and I was like
is it girlfriend and he never said yeah
he was like and I was like so okay
I'm never straightforward never but you
run that south in your baby when it
comes to like that sort of like gastro
stuff and so I would I I remember saying
and again this was cloudy what I
remember saying is if that's what she is
that's how you have to introduce yes
because you also I heard you yeah cuz I
was like I was flirting I was like like
yeah touching her touching him and stuff
and so like yeah I looked shitty and I
was mad at her and I don't like
text I was like who is his bitch
wouldn't really she was just like lovely
girl like I don't know yeah I'm with
this guy that I'm supposed to be doing
what you said which I liked it yeah you
kind of like stood up for her you were
like she look at her she feels that like
you need to introduce her as your girl
if she's yeah girl she can kiss you
because she was marking like she was
like holding him and stuff like that
yeah and she was being shitty which is
why he's the guy that I think you
shouldn't pursue cuz he clearly is like
a nice guy but it was just I think it
was just an uncomfortable situation
everyone was but so how do you feel
because something that I appreciate that
you do that I also do is like you obsess
over it for about three days
yep and then you're done yeah I
wasn't really done that night because I
you had been this had been a couple days
thing yeah but I also like even the next
day I was kind of like I'd like to win
this but I mean I still think he's like
really cool and kick it off you know all
that sort of stuff but I really felt
like I truly felt bad for getting being
like who is this bitch like and I don't
like thinking that but I thought it was
just simple legs it wasn't her
fault
no and I like really did I felt like
that was a I don't think any of it to be
quite honest I don't think any of it was
intentional there is another guy that's
on her radar that I think that Kelsey
likes but I don't think it's I think
he's great for you and he's so cute yeah
very cute yeah yeah he's a very exactly
you get nervous are you I'm like your
cheeks are red I think that this will be
your next conquest for the weekend
coming up here
I hope hope ha period though so what
that's fine
well that I would I just finished mine
and you my diva oh I forgot
mmm-hmm tell Seward me and Ivica I did
because I'm a good friend and I believe
that everyone should use Daddy pick up
my period just ended which was good
based on what happened to me last week
do we get into it I think this is when
we should probably get into okay so
we're just gonna put this out here this
is technically this was supposed to be
the theme of this week's episode but we
we also wanted to film a little bit
longer for you guys because some of you
guys commented that you wanted a little
bit longer episodes so here we are we're
talking about it and okay so the theme
of this African theme of this episode is
revenge and that was revenge in case
again matters revenge and nature's
revenge karma I don't really think it's
worth like the breath to explain the
full story of what happened but
basically someone did something really
shitty that is like a basic foundation
I'm having sexual relations adult and I
think 10 years ago I would have been
really pissed and wanted some
sort of revenge but then something
dawned on me I don't know it was sort of
a revelation I just did not give a
this time oh oh my god to not I was like
closer to 30 baby I guess I have no
whole into what this thing this dude did
to me and I could really get angry and
then there was just some sort of clarity
it could just be gone from your life
it's like I had a choice on how I
reacted yeah it was just it was such a
weight lifted off my shoulders and then
it started it made me start thinking
about all the times that I did waste
trying to get revenge on people that had
wronged me and realizing and accepting
an apology that you're never gonna get
is the most freeing feeling that is
yeah dude I feel like revenge never
truly feels that good maybe sometimes
I've never felt good you will feel
better when you truly want him to be
happy yeah and it was right I was just
like yeah yeah I just wanna like I
cannot stress that enough about like
relationships in your early 20s or your
late teens or like high from high school
to whenever you do end up with the one
yeah I cannot stress enough how much
those relationships sure while they do
shape you how much time heals wounds
like there are things that I'm sure
we've all felt so spiteful over
and angry over and like crushed over to
only realize that when they say like it
does get better it's annoying but it
really does get yes because I
was I was also one to pine I pined after
people like oh my god very British word
i mining but I would do that for like a
really long time and now I'm just sorta
like I'm not chasing anyone if you don't
like me cool it's nice it's just such a
freeing feeling because again like there
have been relationships I mean that have
ruined me ruined me and now I look back
on them even I don't know five years
later and I'm where was that even really
love but at the time it was so
all-consuming and all I wanted was for
that person to hurt as bad as I did yeah
or did and now I just want that person
to be happy there are some guys that I
kind of feel bad for that I'm like I
just feel sorry for you that at the time
I would have liked nothing more than to
 hurt them and cheat on them and
crush them and and ruin them and sure I
sure did hurt some people back in the
day but now there's something I think
once you go through enough of those
moments of realizing that that revenge
feeling is such a temporary high the
feeling of not giving a yeah
getting over it and yes putting your
energy into that actually matters
is the most freeing feeling of my life
it's because you wake up and
we talk a lot about like hangover
hangover blues and it's kind of like you
wake up after certain things and you're
like oh I'm heartbroken about this or
Emily really sad about this or or maybe
I'm not
or maybe I may have a choice yes and the
options are both definitely their
sadness or choose hi yeah it doesn't
come easily know that we both live with
depression and anxiety and we've got
sorry dog yeah yeah I just assumed we've
crippling we put that out there in other
videos where it's it's chemical there
for sure days where I wake up and I'm
like oh this is a depression day like
you no matter what I choose I still feel
bad but there are situations and events
yeah and people that you can choose and
you wake up with that feeling of like
regret or anger or wanting revenge and
you can physically decide that you don't
want to go on you don't want to jump on
that train and think you take the other
one take it's a happy town and it's so
nice to also be like because it it's
all-consuming right it's like it
couldn't make you God takes away all
your light it's like this darkness it
just takes with all of your light that
could be better
shed on like other issues things that
you like things like things you feel
passionate about her about specific duty
and I'm volunteering we don't
forget to do it but like the day after
that person did a shitty thing to me
when he told me this shitty thing yeah I
probably talked about it for like a good
straight 12 hours to my best friend's
being like man I just feel so stupid I
feel gross I feel this and I was doing a
lot of like self hate and then it turns
into like no this person did something
wrong or growth or shitty and I was able
to go through the roller coaster of
rides and I felt really bad that I was
taking up Kate and Freddie's time
talking about it being like I'm sorry I
I keep mentioning it I just I feel so
dumb where I feel so this and Kate said
something to me that I will never
 forget sometimes you have to
talk about it all day to get to that
feeling of numbness like sometimes
talking about it enough seeing it from
every angle what could you have done
differently
what will you
you next time gets you to that place of
not giving a and you know this is
different I'm not giving a sure but
like there is a numbness where you just
talk it to death and then she followed
it up with and I almost shut it here
she said you forget that your friends
want to be there for you and that was
like a god damn revelation it's
true like I'm going that's why this
sounds good you are going through
something it's really hard to ask for
help or like if you if you're mad at
someone or you're angry or someone has
done you wrong it is really easy to want
to internalize that and keep it in but
sometimes you gotta let it out
listen I did that and I kind of
up a relationship like a friendship even
there was like this girl who I was good
friends with and then we kind of liked
each other and we weren't comfortable
telling each other because we weren't
really comfortable in our sexuality and
we both got kind of like it would come
out in like different ways and then
because I wasn't talking about it
honestly even with my closest friends
yeah because I was so scared of like you
being attracted to her so I was like I
played full victim like I was like and
we both had you know done stuff you're
damn bad no and yeah it was we were
equal in it and but for some reason it
just made so much sense for me to
internalize all of it and be like she's
bad and she did this or whatever and I
did it for so long it took me so long to
come around and feel like I played a
really big hand and what happened our
fallout and I'm still real sad about it
and it's just something it's a lesson
that I'm really cool glad I learned and
I don't want to do that ever again cuz
it feels bad to even not be like close
with her now she was a good friend and
well there's something to that story of
like taking what how do you get to a
place where you feel like you have your
power back you guys being a victim never
feels good like some people do it not
saying this is what you're talking about
but like some people like being the
victim like I liked it at that time cuz
it meant that the truth wasn't right it
wasn't the truth and sure there are
things that happen to people where it is
absolutely not your fault but the way to
not be a victim anymore is to take your
power back and whatever that means to
you like you that's where I would give
advice to people to look first instead
like sure see all the anger feel all the
feelings get out you need to get out
but the more you waste your time is
doing those feelings and having those
reactions is last time you get to spend
being happy we're moving on something
I've been trying to do is just be honest
about what I want when I want it and if
it doesn't work out deal with it then if
you avoid pain and you avoid hurt and
you avoid failure but really you're
avoiding the possibility for good things
and success and fun and love really so
you avoid all of the good stuff and to
me that's playing it safe that's playing
it smart and that's not good well it's
like you never know what true happiness
is if you didn't know what true hurt
felt like like all those times where you
know you get out of a relationship where
you go a situation where you're like
well less and learn next time I'm gonna
do it different as cliche as it sounds
it's true like sometimes it takes ten of
the same thing to happen by the
same person
even for it to but eventually like you
you'll go through the motions and that
idea of the temporary negativity like
the more you harp on that the more of a
reality it does cotton become and the
more you look back at that love or that
friendship or that relationship or that
one-night stand and the more you'll look
at it in a negative light you know I can
look back on relationships now and be
like wow now I can see the good because
I'm so glad I moved I can really see how
that was a great relationship and how
much I learned in the lessons I learned
and then there are relationships where I
was like what I was severely like you
know either emotionally abuse or
whatever it was yeah it took
time and if we act we if we react in
those like moments of anger we're like
in high school I remember egging a guy's
car with my best friend and we were like
yeah that guy and then we were like
okay now what like that's it yeah like
those moments of temporary revenge never
feel as good as good as like channeling
your energy into something better
