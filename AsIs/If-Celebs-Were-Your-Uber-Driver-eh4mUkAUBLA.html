Get in the car, bitch.
(laughter)
- [Voiceover] You wanna go to Taco Bell?
(laughter)
- Hi. Hope you don't mind,
the radio's broken, but
that's OK, because we
can sing together. Shake it off.
(laughs)
- OK, all right, that's
what I'm talkin' about, huh?
You in the office, baby.
You right here, in the office.
How you feelin', huh?
You wanna smoke some weed?
- C'mon in, buddy. We're
gonna drive to Venice.
This is going to take at least two hours.
You and me, boxed in. What a trip!
- I know you were thinking
of vomiting in my car,
but I'd have to advise
you severely against it.
The star ratings themselves
would be unthinkable.
- Now this will charge
directly to your card,
but you can pay however you want.
It doesn't matter. We're all gonna die.
- Our ride today, broken
up into three acts.
In the first act, I pick you up.
You've summoned me, you've tracked me.
I've given you an estimated fare.
- You're a troll. Duh!
I can feel your vibes
sucking the tire blood out of my vehicle.
- I just feel really
comfortable with you, you know?
I just feel like I can
just, like, be myself.
You should totally be yourself, too.
- Let me be clear.
This is just a side hustle.
- Vrooom, vrooom, vroom,
vroom, vroom. Ooooh!
- Oh. I'm overjoyed
that you've selected me
as a driver today. Where to?
- Oh, what?
- There's no earthly way of knowing,
which direction we are going.
And the grizzly reaper's mowing.
There's no way of knowing what time
we'll be in Van Nuys! Aaaaah!
- Will you be fornicating tonight?
Because I will, too.
- Hey, yo, you crazy for this one, B.
It's your Uber.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
