Los Angeles in hopes of becoming an
actress she just moved in with her
boyfriend of two years
Ian who is also an actor but Ian's
koreatown studio apartment is too close
for comfort for Sara and she needs more
space also ian is pretty disgusting
um I honestly don't know if our
relationship is ready for this but the
cameras are here so it's too late now
okay here we are with a little help from
Sara's parents the struggling actors are
looking at a four hundred thousand
dollar condo in West Hollywood oh this
place is gorgeous and it looked like
such a dump from outside I like this I
love all the big windows and the natural
lighting but I don't know I like to walk
around naked that's gonna be an issue
I've always wanted a formal dining room
that nobody ever uses my mom only common
like that um it's it's a little small I
feel like I need granite countertops I
don't even know what granite means but I
feel like I know I need to granite
countertops
upstairs there are two bedrooms this is
a good little guest room for what our
friends come to stay once every five
years the couple is keeping an open mind
about what to do with their spare room
maybe it's an office I can set up to
make it look like I'm busy and important
realistically though this would be a
great place for us to throw random junk
in and clean only when absolutely
necessary I love double sinks especially
because your toothpaste stains are
really disgusting yours grossed me out
too I know we can't paint the walls but
let's be serious that's not gonna happen
I mean you really really hate these
popcorn ceilings no no I'm never gonna
look at them ever again this place kind
of feels like somebody died in here
doesn't it I just feel like if we could
change everything about this house it
would be perfect oh it is such a good
fixer-upper Oh kind of like you hurts my
feelings
Oh
hahahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
