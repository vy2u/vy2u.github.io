apologize for the barking last night it
was 2 a.m. and you were just trying to
get some sleep and you know I respect
that I know where you're coming from
it's just that I heard a squirrel
outside and I started getting nervous
that maybe it wanted to break into the
house and attack you and that really
freaked me out so I started barking and
then you had to put me in the crate and
I wouldn't calm down into you my cute
boy and then hey who are you you're new
you smell like another dog do you want
to pet me ha ha ha right the jumping
thing my bad ha ha ok but I'm gonna
follow up on that petting me thing
smelling good man you are smelling good
you don't understand though you left the
house to go grocery shopping and you
were gone for like 45 minutes and for a
dog that's like 3 and a half days so I
got super worried and I went into your
closet and everything smelled like you
and I got confused and angry and hungry
and then I just started chewing it's ok
these were really ugly
JK love them love you hey I'm sorry but
I peed on your brand-new carpet well
firstly I want to apologize for this
this obviously turned out poorly but you
know this is good this is good for me
because now I know now I know I'm not
allowed to eat bees because bees sting
me and I swell up sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
