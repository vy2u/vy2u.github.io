- Yeah.
- That's cool. I haven't worn it yet,
but that's cool.
- Okay.
- Are you mad at me?
- No. Are you mad at me?
- No.
- No way!
- No, I'm not mad at you at all.
- No, I'm not mad at you.
- We should have a boys night, tonight.
- I'm supposed to do something with Jodie.
But, maybe we could just
cram it all together.
- Hey, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
- Really shows that we're
fans without--
- Keith.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
- We'll be here.
- We met in the bathroom.
- Because he's wearing this amazing
super pea coat.
- Stop.
- Like I...
that we just met, but I have like a very
good feeling about all of you.
- Me too.
- Oh, yeah!
- Thank you. We have a
great feeling about Steve.
- Thank you!
- Your welcome.
- I mean, I'm not being defensive,
but I feel like you are attacking me.
- I get how you would think that
because you think
- Well, I mean.
- [Keith] a lot of things wrong.
- [Keith] I have a really
good sense of people's
vibes, and that guy's got a weird vibe.
- Okay.
- Just too nice. Nobody's that nice.
- I would not be his friend
if you weren't his friend.
- When he smiles, I'm afraid that
his skull's going to fall out of his lips.
- Plus, he kind of looks like an elephant.
- He's close to becoming my enemy.
- Steve's here.
- Hey!
- Oh, Jodie's here.
- Hey.
- Everything okay with you guys?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah!
- Can we talk about his
girlfriend for a second?
- Oh my god! Can we talk about her?
- Well, I like Jodie.
- Well, I like Ashley.
But you're always telling
me what's good for me.
- Ashley is bad for you.
- It's also like, he
doesn't do his dishes.
It's little things. You know what I mean?
- He won't even like, respond to my text.
- Maybe he hasn't seen it yet.
- He's seen it.
- I don't mean this in a bad way,
but Jodie's kind of here a lot.
And it's like, be respectful
of your roommates.
You know, that's why you never let me
spend the night.
- I don't have a roommate.
- This is a really big place.
- Oh, you won!
- [Keith] No, you've won.
- No, you're the winner!
- [Keith] The argument's over.
- Oh, crown you! You won!
- [Keith] So you've won.
- I get it!
- He's weird.
You don't like Steve.
That's fine.
- [Keith] Be careful
doing that. Be careful doing that.
- [Keith] He doesn't love you.
- Oh, okay.
- So nobody loves me in my life.
Is that what you're saying?
- [Keith] Are you kidding me?
- [Keith] Maybe you should
- If I leave you--
- [Keith] because I'm
paying for this place!
- Because if I leave you,
you'll have no other friends!
- Keith.
Keith?
- What?
- Look, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I've been such a jerk.
- No. I've been a jerk.
- No. I was really stupid about the rent.
- No. I've been stupid about the dishes
and about--
- [Keith] It's just
you are my one person.
- No. You're my one person.
- I'm so glad we're
having this conversation.
- You're my boy.
- I love you.
- [Keith] Are we back?
- We're back.
- We're back.
- Oh, I keep crying a lot this week.
- Hey, look. I haven't told you about this
but I keep this in here for emergency.
- That's really smart.
I hate drama.
- [Keith] I hate drama.
- I hate drama.
- Thanks for listening.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
