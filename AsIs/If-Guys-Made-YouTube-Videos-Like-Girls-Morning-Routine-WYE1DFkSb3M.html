186 today I'm gonna be doing my morning
routine a lot of people have been
requesting and tagging me for it so here
it is okay so the first thing I do when
I get up is I clean my face now
generally what I like to use is water
and I get that from the sink here I have
a sample of water that I use it's really
cool as you can see it's like clear and
it's a liquid which is like a definite
plus
these are my hands I generally use them
to scoop up the water and then I splash
it all over my face really easy anyone
can do it as long as your hands okay so
it's totally up to you if you want to
use soap or not I usually go with the
soap that's nearest me because the water
is like dripping off my face the really
cool thing about soap is like when you
hit it with water it gets all sudsy
which is great because that will go over
your face a lot smoother than just like
a dry bar of soap so just add water okay
so now it's time for my hair
okay so I woke up in my hair look just
like this which I'm totally cool with so
that's how it's gonna let the rest of
the day okay well that was my morning
routine if you like what you saw please
subscribe and all catch y'all later
alright Joshi party animal 186 have a
great day
how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
