I'm here with my outfit of the day which
you can totally check out on Instagram
if you like I went with a grey shirt
with a pocket some jeans and some gray
socks
I like this outfit because it makes me
feel like I have clothes on and I
totally love wearing clothes I really
like this shirt because it doesn't smell
yet I'm probably nowhere tomorrow and
depending how tomorrow goes I'll
probably wear it on Saturday
these pants are great because they cover
my legs which pants are supposed to do
and also the zipper works which I
totally like all right so that was my
outfit of the day I wish I could tell
you where I got everything from but I
can't remember because I bought it like
eight years ago be sure to subscribe if
you like what you saw and next week I'm
gonna be doing my back-to-school nail
art video or it's basically just me
biting my nails for five minutes I check
you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
