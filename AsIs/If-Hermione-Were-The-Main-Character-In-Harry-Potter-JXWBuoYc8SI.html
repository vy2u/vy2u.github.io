Grainger of London were
proud to say that they had a witch for a
daughter proud that is until their
daughter Hermione white all trace of her
existence from their memory Hermione was
in the midst of a war and she was trying
to protect her parents from the force
she'd been fighting against for years
the patriarchy now bitch is gonna die
six years earlier
Hermione first boarded the Hogwarts
Express excited to make friends and
finally be valued for her talents rather
than teased for being different
hello I'm Hermione Granger is that seat
taken
I'm Harry Harry Potter and sorry this
carriage is for boys only it was in that
moment that Hermione first learned a
valuable skill throwing shade I've read
all the rules there's no such thing as a
boys only carriage do you know who that
is
that's Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived
it's funny you should say that because
I'm Hermione Granger the girl who gave
literally zero her badass antics
attracted the boy's attention you are
fierce and independent that scares us
would you be in our gang please despite
their vaguely offensive ways
Hermione sense that Ron and Harry
weren't so bad over the course of the
year she saved them several times
without Hermione the Boy Who Lived
would have been dead as Harry and
Ron began to think of Hermione as a
sister and felt protective toward her
but she didn't need their protection
especially when Drake who was involved
nice hoodie it it look even better on
the floor of the Slytherin dorms what
did you say to me
go on say that again it was a compliment
I swear it was just a compliment
oh yeah well so is this Oh Twitter
wasn't around in those days but if it
was she'd have just invented the boss
which hashtag for Thea brought with it
Bulgarian bombshell Viktor Krum he had
asked Hermione to the dance and the pair
looked resplendent Ron was more than a
little jealous and asked Hermione to
dance but she didn't want to why are you
dressed like that if you don't want to
tension ate Ron you idiot
how dare you how dare you
I didn't dress like this with Viktor
offer you offer anyone I dressed up for
me
so I could feel good and you ruined it
trying to repair the damage
Harry apologized on Ron's behalf one's a
nice guy not like Draco he didn't mean
to hurt you that's the problem Harry
he didn't think what he was saying was
wrong and it's not just Ron and Draco I
had to worry about not all witches feel
that way though surely yes all witches
all witches have had to put up with
comments like that and worse but that's
that's impossible
Hermione was furious if she couldn't get
Harry her most reasonable supportive
male friend to understand then she may
as well give up but then the Dark Wizard
Voldemort returned surprise bitches and
summoned his Death Eaters including
treecko's dad to update him on their
plan
we're not oppressing all which is quite
yet my lord but soon Harry couldn't
believe his ears he managed to escape
but his world had changed forever
it's real you were right I'm so sorry
yes all witches
Hermione forgave Ron realizing he too
was a victim of the patriarchy when you
grow up in a culture that allows wizards
to speak to witches that way how he was
supposed to know that it's wrong but do
it again and I'll cut you the fight
against the patriarchy was beginning in
earnest after months of wandering around
forests Hermione took charge
let's go up their sensing this
might be her last night on earth
Hermione kissed Ron's she didn't have
time to explain that this was not a
binding contract guaranteeing a future
of marriage and children sometimes a
kiss was just that Draco was still
trying to make this all about him
witches get a free ride it's with us
like me who suffer where's my special
treatment I deserve a kiss it's missin
tree I tell you don't misinterpret your
feelings of inadequacy for the cultural
social economic and political oppression
of an entire gender Draco didn't listen
so Hermione shot him down the best way
she knew how she said that
it's on fire outside the Battle of
Hogwarts have begun
Hermione Berg the bad news to Harry for
the plan to work
he'd have to die Harry Potter is dead
long live the patriarchy but Hermione
wasn't done yet
not so fast face a girl who gave
literally zero we meet at last you
know I used to hate you but now I pity
you you don't hate witches you hate
yourself that's what this is really
about Harry was alive the whole time so
much privileged that boy even death gave
him a pass Hermione had figured out the
source of Voldemort's power his snake
she given Neville the most important job
because good leadership is about good
delegation and he arrived right on
schedule
cutting the head off Voldemort snake
just the tip really with his snake
dismembered Voldemort crumbled away to
nothing and took his archaic notions of
gender roles with him does this mean the
patriarchy is over unfortunately now
their figurehead is gone yes but the
fight will continue we need to weed out
and destroy sexism in all its forms
Hermione did just that she dedicated her
life to wiping out sexism in both the
magic and muggle world all was well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
