confidence to talk to you do you like
that I'm bad at introductions you want
some alcohol
I am only really want to talk to one of
you but I'm gonna try to impress both of
you just in case
hi you're very pretty and I don't know
what to do about it now I'm trying to
determine your amount of emotional
baggage and see whether I can handle it
or not I'm up saw lying to you right now
looks like he sent you a drink so you
couldn't say no I don't actually love
your earrings I just want an excuse to
compliment you looked at you for a long
time before I came over here I don't
want to face rejection so instead of
asking you on a proper date I'm just
gonna suggest we hang out sometimes he's
just lying I'm lying out of time I'd be
lying and to be honest I was kind of
hoping maybe you'd come over and just
talk to me and I know that's not how
things go but a boy can dream that's
saying threesome like it's a joke but I
would totally take part of that I'm
interested in having sex with someone
tonight I'm approaching you with that in
mind nice breasts better yet I'll give
you my phone number because typing is
way easier than talking after a while
he'll walk up casually and join the
conversation and at this point I put a
lot of time into this conversation so if
I find out you have a boyfriend I'm
gonna go straight home just straight
home I'm just looking for someone who
has the same interest as me and also has
a vagina to share do you want to have
sex with me tonight did you tell her I
was looking for sex oh I'm just looking
for sex
I'm just looking for a meaningful
relationship in which I can find someone
to get married to and then I'll grow a
beard and you'll grow long hair and have
little kids and they'll grow up and
Merredin grow beards and long hair it'll
be so joyful I've chosen years of her
life mate we can never guess
picking up women is hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
