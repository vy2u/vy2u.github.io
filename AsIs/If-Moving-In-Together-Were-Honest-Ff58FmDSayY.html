and there's three things broken I don't
tell you about we're keeping up our fake
professional demeanor that we had when
we are showing the place okay if you
need anything I don't pick up phone
we'll only see you in red slate ah we
could be making any huge mistake but I
see your place every me anyways let's
not this up for 12 months you never
have to pack an overnight bag again we
should hire movers
oh my masculinity has me pretending like
my arms aren't on fire
Oh explaining proper lifting technique
to you while doing the opposite I'll
still terrified that I'm losing 50% of
my stuff and 50% of my independence Oh
starting a really personal story about
this no and then realizing that it's you
had to be there stirring house Trillian
giving up I'm not in my head I'm
actually ignoring you trying to picture
what you were like in college
okay picturing my parents old furniture
here but picturing them in totally
different sizes than they actually are
I'm putting this frame on the ground
because we won't get to actually hanging
out for three months yeah I'm thinking
we put this thing that I got from a flea
market for $4 it's right above an old
IKEA rug that's so for my ex-roommate um
facing my opinion like it's a question
so it's not her uh security about my
design abilities reconsidering what is
and isn't my territory I'm just excited
to be finally throwing away all of your
junk except for your really nice TV yeah
I just have a irrational sentimental
attachment to a few crappy things for my
childhood and I'm gonna take any attempt
to get rid of them as a personal affront
I'm saying that I'm not trying to change
you but I'm just trying to change you oh
hey I'm impressing you by saying I'm
gonna paint this wall and then I'm gonna
put it off and keep putting it off
and keep putting it off until eventually
we move out or we break up Oh convincing
you that this overpriced couch is
actually a steel yeah
pretending like $600 isn't that much
money in me I'm gonna take up about 70%
of the counter space but call 50:50 I'm
gonna be really clean for the first two
months and then I'll revert to my usual
disgusting sell oh yeah I'm gonna be
real discreet about gross body stuff for
the first couple months and then I'll
revert back to my usual disgusting cell
phone I never had hand soap before well
I think I'm gonna start seeing you every
part of every day now second guessing
whether I made the right decision
wondering if this'll end us completely
I'm just one of the people that kind of
look looks around when they're nervous
and thinking about things and inside the
head and hold on hey changing your
nervousness to excitement enticing
possibility right saying that we could
get a puppy even though it's
irresponsible and unsafe and not
something I want to do it all a
housewarming party that won't happen for
like six months and then only like three
of our friends will show up yeah I'll
have all my friends over for Game of
Thrones and we'll be way too loud while
you're trying to get worked up I'm gonna
start farting in front of you I just
leave drawers and cabinets open constant
yeah we're just gonna never have sex
oh and all cook and you did
it is this is just a step I've never
taken with anyone before
I'm coming on at the end the night to
one person I'm glad to see you
so begins
