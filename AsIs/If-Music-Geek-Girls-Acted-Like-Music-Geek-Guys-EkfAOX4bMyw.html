sleep with all of them you probably just
go to music festivals to take pictures
of your outfits right they're way better
live but you've probably never seen them
if you like The Runaways you're like
Joan Jett do you saw that movie of
Kristin's do it right no no no Stevie
Nicks is a woman here Bruce Springsteen
he's a boy like you are you're just not
going to understand that album I
shouldn't even sell it to you I'll get
you something a little bit on my like an
acoustic version this is why I'm
sticking to Spotify and fun with that
compressed bitrate I just don't consider
it rock and roll for lead vocals aren't
sung by a woman
you play triangle or timbre not I play
guitar I played guitar in a band well
that's cute is it boy than you don't
have a record player leave some on the
wall
oh no they're called Queen but there's
not actually any women in the band so
it's not worth your time are you sure
you like that band just don't look like
the type of person who you've known
either guy you sent it close to Kim the
Pixies really do you even know who the
man is on your shirt did you just get it
at the registered Urban Outfitters oh my
god it's so smart to be a juvenile
record store you can pick up chicks so
usually because they think you really
like this stuff you saw them in concert
click with your girlfriend like your
girlfriend brought you
you know Courtney Love wrote all of
Nirvana songs right no no put down the
Patti Smith you that is not for you oh
you like the Beatles those guys that
tried to ruin Yoko Ono's solo career
three guys we wasn't a real fan anyway
nice jazz don't see that every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
