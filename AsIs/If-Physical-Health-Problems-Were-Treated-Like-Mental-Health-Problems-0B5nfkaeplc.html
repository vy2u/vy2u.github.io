are you even trying to get better
Hey look at it this way there's plenty
of people out there that haven't worse
often you do you stop focusing all the
bad things in life and just try to enjoy
it it's all in your head I don't think
you need to be taking medication every
day just to feel normal
don't you think it's changing you listen
you really just need to suck it up like
everybody goes through this and you're
just feeling sorry for yourself why
don't you just go to the doctor thank
you my insurance doesn't cover the flu
Oh Stephen
man that's broken you need to see a
doctor to say I'm fine I get better on
my own
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
