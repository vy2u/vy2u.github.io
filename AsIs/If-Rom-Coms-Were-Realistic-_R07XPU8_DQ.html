I wish oh my god I wish you could have
been there it was like fate it was like
we were meant to be together and we just
fell into each other
it was amazing mm-hmm I'm sure the Stars
will align and after some tumultuous
will they won't they will end up
together like Ross and Rachel Jen stop
talking about him just go on tinder Oh
Charles how's it going that's tinder is
that like a cute park bench where you
meet someone but on the Internet
jumping sorry no drink no I think see
you what I'm actually I see
I mean it's not serious we just met but
I'm pretty sure it will be I can tell
you about it actually
hey Charles man what's up I feel like
the only way I can get them to like me
as if I change my luck or something okay
don't do that it's so stupid
playing hi

second okay can we do this later I have
like a lunch thing and I just would love
to leave you look the same but now
you're wearing a dress so I should go
talk to hey hey are you doing here
oh I just come to this park a lot and
I've always done that not because I saw
