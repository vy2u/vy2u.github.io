worst nightmare
oh now I'm gonna have to get you
something nice and your birthday to our
innocence people remember that it's my
birthday this is my favorite day of the
year because I could be super typical
and no one can say a damn thing about it
I'm a shot that's what this means I know
you're all just here because you want
cake none of you give a about my
birthday okay I miss getting presents I
know my birthday is only one day but I'm
gonna drag it out for an entire week
please what so I can go back to work I
know you're using my birthday as an
excuse just to get drunk so am i oh yeah
I'm just in most of today counting my
facebook posts the only people wish me a
happy birthday I know I'm in a bearable
drunk but it's my birthday so you
literally have no choice but to stand
here decorating I wish this moment would
end please you're my secret office
crushin if you don't come to my party
I'm gonna just destroy me this present
is just a reminder of how old I'm
getting if you actually haven't enjoyed
a birthday since I turned 21 I'm gonna
die alone bitch don't think I didn't
notice you didn't write on my facebook
law texts don't count the office manager
forgot to buy me a cake and I'm slowly
dying inside I got a hat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
