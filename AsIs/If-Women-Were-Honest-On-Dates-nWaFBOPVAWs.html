personality very true very very true I
am just wondering what you look like
naked you are a lot cuter than I
remember it almost makes me wish I had
shaved my leg I can barely eat in this
dress and I'm hungry it's funny because
I'm trying to decide if I could see
myself kissing you and I just don't know
yet you mentioned your mom a couple of
times and that's very attractive to me I
can tell you're not listening to
anything that I'm saying I'm pretending
this is work but I'm really telling my
roommate this food is making me gassy
unfortunately for you cuz I was gonna
put out that waitress was definitely
flirting with you for some reason that
makes you more attractive that is really
funny but I can see you staring at my
chest you're giving me too many
compliments it's creepy all of these
obscure bands that I'm pretending to
have heard of I haven't all of the cute
little things that you think I'm doing
without realizing them I realize them
they're completely calculated I'm
actually wondering if I'm showing too
much boob you know I'm not really sure I
like you but damn it we look good
together you have weird drunk eyes now
I'd like to stop you right there and
just have you asked about me cannot
imagine getting along with your friend
I'm flapping because I'm scared of
violence and I'm here because all of my
friends have boyfriends oh my god I had
no idea you were that old that's awful
but I think our babies would be so cute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
