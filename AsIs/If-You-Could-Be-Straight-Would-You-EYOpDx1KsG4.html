gay as they come
pansexual lesbian I identify as a gay
man a bisexual female fabulously
ferocious gay man oh yeah my life would
totally be easier if I were straight
depends on how you look at it I feel
like growing up it probably would have
been a lot easier understanding my own
body and what was going on in my own
head it's really hard that's a good
young kid because you know people would
make fun of you people want to beat you
up but just because you're different or
you talk differently if I go back home
to North Carolina and I had a girl with
me I have to walk about what I do is say
you know in high school I wanted to take
a guy to the prom and I couldn't do that
it's hard enough being a person of color
and I think not being straight is
another level of privilege that I don't
have we as gay people have to go to gay
themed events gay bars gay clubs whereas
a straight person can even just go to
the grocery store and find someone my
life has become a lot easier now that
I've kind of just accepted Who I am and
not giving a about what anybody
thinks more than my life being easy I
just I mostly think about my family's
life being easier it's really not the
easiest life
um I would not be straight if I could be
God no no I tried to be straight once
the last about two months I wouldn't be
straight no because I think the world
has gotten to a more accepting place no
I would never turn straight if I could
no I'm very comfortable in my own skin I
don't want to turn straight I don't want
to be straight I want to be gay the way
I am
I love being gay I love being you know
this flamboyant person I love enjoying
life and grabbing life by the balls not
being straight is awesome I live in this
beautiful limbo that I've created for
myself I've come out on the other side
of this dark tunnel that all the gays go
through but I can see why people would
want to as a Christian to like I believe
I'm the way I am for a reason I think if
I hadn't have had those experiences I
wouldn't be Who I am today to even think
about that would just be disregarding
all of the hard work I put into myself
have you ever been to a gay bar if you
haven't you need to go straight bars are
so boring
I feel like if I grew up not having to
question these things I would not be as
compassionate of a person or as educated
of a person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
