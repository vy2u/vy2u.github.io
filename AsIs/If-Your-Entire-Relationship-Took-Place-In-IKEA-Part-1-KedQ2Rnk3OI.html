play fair this plan can't fail but said
ourselves of course to the middle of the
ocean tomorrow

now let's get out of here yeah that Oh
in those ice trays you know the stars I
think they're hot
if I could get you alone I swear I could
get rid of the sorrow
state I've ever been on whatever for
we can't live together someday
it was fun wait have you brought other
girls here report oh I like that I'm
over with you oh I called the insurance
company they're only gonna cover 15% I
told you not to call them without me on
the phone why is nothing ever do right
look you're the one who's always
complaining I Drive too fast I pick out
the wrong dish cause once you just pick
them out yourself I I don't want to see
for money I don't want our relationship
to ever be like a business transaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
