says Labradoodle more like Labrador okay
but she like almost died right she loves
that you literally almost got a victory
okay okay you two are the biggest dog
stomps I swear it's like their little
 dudes that was great really was
great job you guys
fantastic so we're gonna run it again
but this time the execs they kind of
want to tweak the cast a little bit
really quickly so Cristina if you don't
mind we're actually gonna ask you to go
back to your trailer yep the producers
there they're gonna just really quick
all right here we go and have a seat
right here
yeah perfect hi I'm Cristina no you're
not yes this is the new Christina look
all right look it's not me guys okay
it's the higher-ups it's very important
to the advertisers that we can appeal to
a much wider audience did you say whiter
audience wider I'm confused I don't
understand what okay trill you're
amazing
thank you but can I get you to talk a
little more urban you more urbanist yeah
what are you thinking right now yeah
like tough huh perfect okay we're gonna
run up to the top here we go
here we go quiet on set all right and
action okay that's why not Jordan turns
that means like Morgan turns to him and
he's like Labradoodle earlier that bird
oh no I'm sorry I can't do this
I'm arias cut okay Jordan your timing is
spot on I really I love everything about
you
but we're actually going to swap you out
with yesteryear Beneke and here we go
she's gonna be Terrell's girlfriend now
we just want to make sure that people
can relate whoa whoa you folks have been
doing a super super job being able to
relate to straight people for centuries
oh wait you think I'm not relatable
exactly thank you for understanding
thank you all right we're gonna talk to
you it's fine so Terrell yes meet
Jessica
go ahead Jessica give him your
catchphrase oh I'm spicy buddy it's
funny right come on that's on our team
of writers two days to come up with it
and none of them are even Latino come on
all women they want to be like Sofia
Vergara right yeah you know I can't do
this this is not right
well Terrell you're just gonna be single
now so let's take it from crystals line
all right quiet on set and action you
two are the biggest dogs not hot that's
it okay crystal
can I get you to lose the American
accent I don't I don't have an accent
this is how I speak right yeah but where
were you from originally
Louisiana okay okay can I get you to
talk with an accent that maybe you might
have heard from like say your parents or
your grandparents sure awesome all right
let me hear it you two seem like the
biggest dog snobs us
where I was kind of looking more for a
Raj from Big Bang Theory that's that's
horribly offensive all right please go
back to your trailer and one of the
producers will actually meet you there
right this way wait what what it'll be
fine it'll be fine just a quick quick
little surge in there we go so look I'm
sorry guys um we're just really trying
to appeal to a much wider audience he
definitely said wider audience that's
not right okay we'll just take it from a
knees line all right rolling and action
uh you too hot Annie I'm really sorry to
have to do this but we're gonna actually
replace you with Erik here why the
executives they don't want to have sex
with you I think you have no sex appeal
so they don't believe that men will
actually want to see this film so we're
just gonna replace you with Erik here
and that way we can appeal to both men
and women that sounds wonderful good
luck thank you there you go
I like this chemistry this up sighs all
right do you need anything champ you
want some water
champagne another world in a blockbuster
film no huh well I'm good okay we're
just gonna take it from Erik's line all
right quiet on set and action you two
are being such little shih tzus sounds
like that was amazing
yeah all right cut that's good right
it's perfect where are you writing the
sequel all right you heard him that's a
wrap guys great job everybody
and action you two are being such a
little Sue's credits rolling now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
