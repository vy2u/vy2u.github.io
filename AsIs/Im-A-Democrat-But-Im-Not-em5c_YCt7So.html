Clinton is a robot that was sent back
through time to popularize pantsuits I'm
a Democrat but I've never hugged a tree
I'm a Democrat but I don't care about
legalizing marijuana I'm a Democrat but
I like going to the shooting range
I don't watch MSNBC but I'm not an
entitled millennial I'm a Democrat but I
hate kale but I'm a military veteran but
sometimes I forget to recycle and I like
hunter but some of my best friends are
conservatives and I don't worship Bill
Clinton I'm a Democrat but I don't want
to take away everybody's guns but I
don't think we need government handouts
but I don't think that Bernie Sanders is
God's gift to America but I didn't get
into school because of affirmative
action I'm a Democrat but I really like
singing the national anthem but I'm not
interested in political correctness but
I don't support Union thackeray and my
mustache is not ironic but I don't want
to raise government spending but I don't
think that GMO is synonymous with poison
I'm a Democrat but I'm not a freeloader
but I like to have my beliefs challenged
one thing I think people get wrong often
about Democrats is that we're not all
homogeneous right we don't have all the
same ideas people think Democrats want
government to control every single
aspect of everyone's life when actually
we just want to give everyone the
freedom to live life as they choose
don't let Democrat be a dirty word
