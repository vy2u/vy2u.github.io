answering your questions most of the
time I wear the good job but I'm not
Malala I can't give you my autograph I
can't take a photo with you I'm not her
she's a little cooler than me I'm a
hijabi but I'm not Sheikh Google but
please tell me again what my religion
means and what it stands for I'm a
hijabi woman but mainstream media
doesn't represent Who I am but I don't
need to be questioned by you as to why I
wear hijab I don't have a green card I
don't have a visa I was born in Boston I
wear the job but why do you care so much
I'm a hijabi but there is no but I can
be a hijab' but there's so many more
things to talk about that's just barely
scratching the surface I were their job
and I'm an engineer I'm a photographer I
play the piano I have so many hobbies
and I'm more than just a woman in the
scarf I'm a blogger and a mother and a
designer and I'm a makeup artist
I wasn't a job but I'm also a scuba
diver I'm a job' and I'm a fashion
blogger and I like to have fun styling
my hijab different ways
think it'd save time in the morning but
that time that you spend doing your hair
just get to paste with doing your job if
not makes your day longer and I'm not
shy and I represent myself I wear the
hijab and sometimes I had to prove that
I'm an American and I'm scared and I'm
worried and I'm tired and I feel like I
have to smile at people all the time in
order for them to know that all Muslims
aren't scary and I stand way back at the
subway platforms
I wear the job and I have never been
scared of living in America until three
of my friends died in the Chapel Hill
shooting I'm constantly aware and
thinking about concealed weapons because
my friends got shot in Chapel Hill a few
months ago and all my friends and family
who wear the hijab should feel safe
walking down the streets just like you
and I resent the fact that I'm
constantly asked to condemn violence and
extremism I think it goes without saying
but I will keep doing it because it's
weren't to me that you know that and the
hijab has taught me not to judge people
by how they look this is a part of me
and now I can take it away and I love it
I'm proud of Who I am I'm proud of being
a Muslim and I have 90 hearing problems
but the jabot one let's move on to other
topics there's gotta be more interesting
things to talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
