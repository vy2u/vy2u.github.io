job doesn't define you you define
yourself so
while I was sitting in front of the
mirror trying new styles and I just
wanted to find something that fit me
better and those during a time where
nobody was really exploring new styles
it was just a basic header you know
basic wraparound gonna take the longer
piece and bring it around town and I got
to a point where everywhere that I went
where there was Muslim women they were
like oh can you show me can you show me
can you show me and I was like you know
what I think it's time to just make a
video you see my first video had Jeb
tutorial number one it was so
embarrassing but that's where it all
began
I've done videos from hijab tutorials to
makeup tutorials to outfit of the days
but no majority of my stuff is hid you
have tutorials how to styling how to do
this
Hey
so just being able to relate with all
these girls they feel sort of a
connection with me and that's truly a
blessing that's unlike um everyone it's
yes is bad so I'm here with another
hijab tutorial because it's not easy
wearing the job here in America I know
tons of girls who will start to wear the
hijab and feel that the pressures of
society are coming down on them and they
end up taking the hedge a ball and when
I started
it wasn't about fame whatsoever when I
started I started to help girls because
they were asking me so I was
filling their requests
and I was doing it with pure intentions
of wanting to help to be honest there
isn't really a specific store that I
like to shop at I like to go around to
different stores to find that like
unique piece
find that one unique piece the
not every place is going to have some
kinda masculine right I love it
like masculine cheek is that I don't
know don't work for me stuff like this
is perfect
long-sleeve you don't have to layer it's
long and modest and it's loose and it's
light oh my god
my closet is mayhem for real I would say
this whole section is like all just tops
long tops shorter tops I look chic okay
I don't know acting cute now
oh honey that's not bad it's what I did
it the trees it looks amazing I got to
pray guys so I will be right back then
we can continue this and five minutes
well what I'm doing is really important
especially for the young Muslims that
are out there they need to have someone
to look up to to know that I can wear
the hijab and still be proud to walk the
streets anywhere I go you know people
will love you for who you are and know
that and again don't let the head you
have to find you let you know who you
are in your personality come out and
shine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
