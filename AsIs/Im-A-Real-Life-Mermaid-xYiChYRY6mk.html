important mermaids were real that was it
of course they're real you know no
matter what the government says
mermaids are real my name is Lauren
Freeman and I'm a real-life name I'm
Erin Gallagher and I'm a real live
mermaid my name is Katie Schultz and I'm
a real-life mermaid
I've always loved the water I've been a
swimmer for as long as I can remember
and growing up in Florida you went to
the beach and you played mermaids
so I've done it for years as a kid
growing up I thought it was the greatest
thing always loved the water definitely
a fish growing up and have always really
enjoyed it oh I remember when Lauren
first came to me and asked if I wanted
to help create the mermaid program here
at the Florida Aquarium and I
immediately called my mom and said you
are not going to believe this
I told you I was going to be a mermaid
when I grew up and now I'm gonna get to
be one I actually have a very different
story from the other girls I was born
and raised in Arizona so I was always in
the water kind of playing around I've
been diving since I was 12 but I don't
think even as a kid I ever told my
parents I'm gonna be a mermaid
should I tell what my brother said all
right so telling my mom about this and
she's gonna well what why do you do this
and I said you know what something new
is something just to try it pays well
kind of told her about that aspect of
well it's pretty good
and you don't even have to be a hooker
so I guess that was my family's take on
it people initially are definitely a
little confused and they want to know
well what do you mean you're a mermaid
so when I describe what I do that I
literally get in the water and I am a
mermaid they have lots of questions
we're all professional divers here at
the aquarium we do guest diving programs
where we'll take guests in to do dyes
with our sharks we also do a lot of the
grunt work we'll get in and clean the
exhibits and that's not such a pretty
mermaid task but we do it anyway so it's
about 3:30 right now yeah none of us
will be touching our face
the aquarium no one ever sees us in
makeup oh yeah it's really
transformational we are deaf people are
used to see that's what I like to hear
definitely not the makeup pretty girls
at the aquarium 99% of the time so to
have our co-workers see us like this
with a shocking change
it does take a lot to get ready the
tails are so custom-fit but it's
actually really hard to get into them so
takes a good 10 minutes to actually put
the tail on swimming with a tail on and
having your feet bound it's a lot
different than wearing fins and being on
scuba so for us to learn to do it and
then on top of that try to look pretty
while doing it that was the biggest
challenges are the hoses that we breathe
from like pathetic I think people think
it's easy they see the finished product
they see us in there with our makeup
done in these gorgeous tails that we
have gracefully swimming around doing
choreographed routines to music takes a
long time to get there to look
comfortable while holding your breath
underwater and not look like you're in
pain or the salt waters in your eyes and
there's fish everywhere it's very
difficult to be a mermaid every day is
something that I never thought I would
get to do but to be able to come to work
and do something that I've always loved
I've always wanted to do with people
that are my friends is fantastic it's
really a dream come true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
