so much death and pain sometimes like
the thought that I could have a son and
he could just be taken from me at any
minute and people expect me to just kind
of sit there and be passive about it
like who wouldn't be angry about that
I'm not to this but I'm not angry I just
get angry when people are ignorant you
know the world won't change is because
we wish it to like we'll have to work to
make it happen and that work is like
hard and slow and painful sometimes but
it requires like real work to change
things I'm an activist but I don't speak
for all black women it's just like the
many different crossroads that black
women sit at so I'm a black woman but I
relate to black girls I live in a world
of Samad privilege I'm an activist and
sometimes I'm angry because there should
be justice why are we we always have
this discussion could be sham justice
I'm an activist but a lot of the things
that I stand up for I never experienced
firsthand activism is a commitment to
figure out how to change the world to be
a better place and that comes in many
forms there's no one type of activist or
one type of activism the idea of
equality isn't something that's just an
idea it's something that we can actively
change we can make happen I want for my
kids and my nephew
needs to be able to be comfortable in
this world I have the luxury of choosing
to be an activist and I think more
people should choose to be an activist
on any level I'm an activist but I use
comedy as my vehicle of change comedy is
about truth so it helps me to be honest
this way people can see the truth and
laugh about it but maybe they think
about it later and say hmm maybe that's
something that needs to change I'm an
activist and without justice there will
be no peace I'm an activist and I think
that social media does affect real
change I'm an activist but I'm not
always conscious of it I'm an activist
and I am super shy I have an activist
and I know the movement is bigger than
me it was bigger than you it'll take all
of us to win</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
