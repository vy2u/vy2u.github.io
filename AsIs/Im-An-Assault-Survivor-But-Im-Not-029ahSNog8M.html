birthday and it was just your typical
run-of-the-mill getting drugged dragged
back to the fraternity house date-rape
next thing I knew I woke up and I was in
his bed with no clothes on and he got on
top of me and raped me and I started to
say no and then he put his hand over to
silence me I was sexually assaulted by a
stranger while I was walking alone in my
neighborhood I was assaulted and robbed
at gunpoint in my own neighborhood I was
in an abusive relationship for two years
it started out with verbal assault and
escalated to physical he would take a
knife and cut the parts of my body that
he thought were too fat
I was actually assaulted in high school
by an older woman that I knew she had
her friends hold me down by my shoulders
while she like peeled off my clothing
and basically groped me whoever she felt
like it I was assaulted right outside
the door to my home growing up as an
athlete and a physically strong woman I
thought that I might be physically
prepared for a situation like this
should it ever happen but by god I was
not mentally prepared for a weapon being
put in my face how do you build up your
feeling of self-worth and it's been
stripped from you in an instant I don't
want to talk about it too much but it
was a big thing happening in my life and
some people just didn't even want to be
associated with me being treated like
you're just nothing um really messes
with you it makes you think about things
in a different perspective when this
happened to me and I decided to open up
to others about it I was so surprised at
how many of my friends and family
members had experienced assault but had
never talked to anybody
out it for a long time I was just afraid
of people I think it's necessary to
speak about these experiences just to
create awareness because there are so
many people like you who've experienced
the same thing the sexual assault
attacks your body in one instance it
really also attacks your feelings of
self-worth and that's a lasting
repercussion that needs to be taken more
seriously I think because I'm a male
survivor a lot of people in validated my
experience as if like what happened to
me didn't really happen so I think for a
long time it was hard like for even me
to believe that what happened to me
actually happened it is so important to
not suppress what you've been through if
you don't process it then you're
basically giving your assault permission
to run your life everyone's first
reaction is Tempest why you stayed and
it's because I felt so ashamed and
isolated and embarrassed because nobody
likes to talk about it I know if you
bring it up it makes people
uncomfortable it took me about a year to
be able to look in the mirror again
there are more of us out there than you
think so open up and reach out I'm an
assault survivor not a victim a survivor
I'm an assault survivor but I'm not a
woman I'm an assault survivor but I'm
not gonna let the actions of someone
else dictate the rest of my life but I
am NOT any less of a man but that
doesn't mean I'm a weak little girl but
I am not afraid I'm an assault survivor
and I'm so much more I'm an assault
survivor and I'm married with two kids
I'm an assault survivor and it wasn't my
fault it was not my fault
