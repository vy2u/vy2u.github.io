jobs not take jobs I'm an immigrant but
my Colombian passport does not make me a
drug dealer I'm no criminal
I'm not a bad person and I'm not here to
take your money but I don't feel foreign
in this country I'm not a monster
I've never hugged the queue at A&amp;amp;E I'm
an immigrant I don't feel like an
immigrant I'm an immigrant and I have
two masters and I'm in the middle of my
PhD I have a post-grad in Development
Studies and I love cats and I love fish
and chips
I do drama I play the violin I got
married way before I was ready because I
just wanted to live in the same country
as the person I love and I love his
standards tintin tintin tintin i'm
olivia grant and my favorite Disney
Princesses Ariel The Little Mermaid it's
not that we hate your culture and we
don't want to get involved actually
we're we're very much curious they're
humans just like you are I come from a
country in massive debt it doesn't mean
that I'm here to take benefits from the
UK like I've never seen a benefit in my
life being an immigrant is something you
have to write in a legal document every
immigrant has their own unique story and
they are not all the same when you say
you're an immigrant people think oh well
that that's enough Ari I've got you
figure it out whenever we have crises
hit areas people migrate it's it's a
general human trait if this room was on
fire would all run it's really hard work
to come here and you don't do it if it's
not worth it it's a status it's not
really something that that you interent
lee are you are so many other things you
are what you love you are what you do
without immigrants we wouldn't have
Indian food Chinese food Japanese food
the history of humanity has been a
history of traveling and it has been a
history of exchange without immigrants
you wouldn't have let goes from the
beginning of time people of migrated
migration is a part of life
