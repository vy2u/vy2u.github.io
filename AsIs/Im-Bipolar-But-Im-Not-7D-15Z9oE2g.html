an x-ray machine and say that's what's
wrong when it's happening inside your
mind it feels like it's not a real thing
and I think that that's where a lot of
the stigmas come from
I'm bipolar I'm bipolar I'm bipolar but
I'm not a ticking time bomb we're not
all depressed but I'm not just gonna
snap out of it through positive thinking
I'm bipolar bipolar but I'm not
unpredictable I'm not fragile or
delicate I'm bipolar but I'm not a
zombie
I don't attract chaos I don't define
myself by an illness I'm bipolar but I'm
not a drug addict just because someone
is on medication doesn't mean that they
are a drug addict we all experience
emotions I'm not off my meds just
because I'm emotional and I'm not trying
to be trendy with my cool mental illness
I am NOT your Manic Pixie dream girl but
I'm not looking for attention I am NOT a
victim of my emotions
if you feel like you can't deal with
things on your own it can be as easy as
talking to somebody about it I promise
you that when you speak and ask for help
and talk about it you will realize that
you are not the only person dealing with
this I didn't give up you are stronger
than you think you are self-care is not
selfish you are not alone I have bipolar
disorder but I'm not weak or using it as
a cop-out to not live life I live life
large I am a dad a husband and a family
man I am capable of having a long term
relationship I've had a lot of
relationships like a lot I'm bipolar and
I'm a vegan and I'm a cat mom making
people laugh and laughing is my favorite
thing I am an advocate for mental
illness and for quality for everyone and
I'm great with kids I'm a nanny and a
camp counselor and I rock it I'm single
I am a veteran I believe in in serving
people in helping people I'm a FEMINIST
I lead a completely normal life I'm a
human being we're all human beings I'm
human like you I have bipolar disorder
and I am happy with who I am
it is so not who I am it's just a part
of who I am and I'd say that I am pretty
happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
