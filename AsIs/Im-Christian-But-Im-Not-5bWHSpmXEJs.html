Christian and I'm definitely not perfect
I'm Christian but I'm not close-minded
but I'm not unaccepting but I'm not
uneducated but I am not judgmental but
I'm not conservative I'm not ignorant
but I don't place myself on a pedestal
I'm Christian but I don't have all the
answers but I am accepting but I am
queer I am gay but I am a feminist a
feminist definitely am a feminist but I
do believe in science in fact I think
science makes God look really cool I'm
not afraid to talk about sex
I love me some Beyonce but I love Y I do
believe in monogamy before sex but I
will give you sex advice if you need it
but I do go to church on Sundays I was a
young life camp counselor I do listen to
Christian music Christian rock Christian
rap t-mac all the cool kids I have
friends from all walks of life and
different religions I love them
I guess what I'd like people to know
about Christianity today is that world
kind of not crazy
we shouldn't be judged on just the
people that you see in the media or just
the people that you've met in your
everyday life every Christian is
different and we deserve a chance to
explain ourselves a lot of people think
that Christianity ruins people but to me
I think it's people that are ruining
Christianity you never really see the
good that happens you only see the
hypocrites and the people who put
themselves on a higher pedestal but at
its core it really is about love and
acceptance and being a good neighbor
just because you prescribed to a faith
it has some really terrible people in it
does it make all of it's terrible I
don't think that Christians should judge
people for who they are and what they do
and everybody is indifferent part of
life on their own path to wherever
they're trying to go we're all people I
think love is most important thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
