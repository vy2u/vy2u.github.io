latina but I'm not spicy I'm Latino but
I'm not feeling your jobs but I'm not a
drug dealer
but I'm not lazy but I don't put up with
machismo by don't celebrate Cinco de
Mayo I'm latina but I'm not Mexican
we're not all Mexican I'm Latino and I'm
a creative artist I'm latina and I love
books I'm Latino end of the hähnel and I
have a master's degree and I love Lady
gaga
and I read comic books and I am the geek
and I like to drink Coronas and I love
spicy food and I'm often mistaken for a
gringa and I'm a social justice activist
and I'm a FEMINIST I'm a Latina and I'm
American I'm latina and I'm an American
growing up in my house you grew up
knowing that you were human you never
really considered yourself Mexican you
just work music and food were a big part
of my life growing up you walk into my
house and it smells like frijoles
negative and then you hear sabado
gigante playing in the background we
would always have those calendars from
the Benedetti hanging up in our kitchen
my mom loved to cook with chilies it
would smoke up the entire house but at
the end of the day you had some bomb-ass
Cheetos a you knows when you're at home
you're not Salvador when you walk out
that door you're in America so you get a
little bit of both being Latino to me
means being really close with my family
Sunday's were for going on walks and
hanging out with your media family for
me to be Latino means having history
even though it wasn't taught at school
my dad made sure that we knew the
history of Mexico people don't like talk
about like what it was like their
memories of Cuba being Latino was
complicated on one hand I'm Mexican on
the other hand I'm American me sorry
that Guinea sorry that yeah every
milestone I made wasn't about being the
latina who did this it was about being
ally no one word could describe all of
us we are a very beautiful diverse
community of people you just kind of
have to grow up and learn that there are
more people in the world ready to
embrace you there's immigrants in the
past and they'll be immigrants in the
future everyone deserves a shot and it's
our time I'm latina and I would never
want to be anything else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
