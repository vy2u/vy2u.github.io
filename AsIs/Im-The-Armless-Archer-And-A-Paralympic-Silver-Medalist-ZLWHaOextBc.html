I'm gonna go pain that's what I'm doing
like it's actually pretty cool cuz you
can flip it I don't even know just
heaven
my name is Matt Stutzman I am a
Paralympic Archer and I am from
Fairfield Iowa
I actually started archery in 2010 I was
at a tournament with one of my friends
didn't do very well so I first
tournament ever two days later I was
contacted by a sponsor like hey we want
to give you some stuff I take this stuff
home and I'm bragging to all my friends
how cool this bow is and I had a friend
look at me and say Matt the reason why
they sponsor you is because you have no
arms and it's not because you're good
but the reality is is that was the truth
and I was like well you know what I
don't want to be known as the sideshow I
want to be known as the best archer in
the world and then by the way did you
know he does it with no arms and I sat
in a chair kind of like this one eight
hours a day and I taught myself how to
shoot
this is well we call compound bow this
is usually where it sits in front of me
because I hold the both my right foot so
this actually goes right here right
there okay try to pull it back with that
hand it's hard as game wait am I
supposed to be able to know but keep
trying wait how in the heck old welcome
I use my legs I actually hold the bow
like where your hand is is where my foot
is right got it and then this this is
attached to my shoulder and then I push
my leg away from my chest which draws
the bow everything that I have done that
you see me do is all self-talk let's
start with something simple these are my
hands right step wadis hold at your toes
you want to just do your first name
using this button like stability and non
cursive yeah alright so put your foot
there oh my that's better than my
handwriting why is my foot shaking yeah
have a seat now sit down in the chair
I'd ask if you need a hand but um yeah
it's pretty good what was your name okay
I'm competitive I'm competitive and they
gave me a standing ovation look at that
this is the secret on how you tie your
shoes when you have no arms you ready
it's really cool ready can you tie that
please
if you are trying to be the best at
something you have to surround yourself
with people who are going to motivate
you and we're going to push you to never
quit never give up we're going to be
always around you even when times get
tough and with their help and with to
their motivation with your Drive you can
literally overcome and accomplish it
I've come out of the bathroom stall and
they do like a double take on it's like
you do not want to go in there I had
hands when I went in there not having to
go find management right now like you
know you do have a pretty good idea
anything Jia you you have to play it off
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
