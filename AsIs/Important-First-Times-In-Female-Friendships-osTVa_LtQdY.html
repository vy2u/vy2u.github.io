Our first picture together.
- Important Firsts in Female Friendships.
- That's cool.
- I like your sweater.
- Oh, thank you.
I got it at Target.
- I love Target.
- Me too. It's my favorite store.
- It's the best place ever.
I'm Laura.
- Loren.
- Nice to meet you.
- Love that picture.
- You have got to tag me on Insta.
- Actually, I'm not following you yet.
- That's ridiculous.
- We need to fix that immediately.
- We could fix that.
I think we're there.
- Ah, okay, satay.
- That's me.
- Pad Thai.
- Okay. Gilmore Girls,
sweats, let's do it.
- What should I wear?
- Oh, what about the yellow
thing that's like ...
- But it kind of ...
- Uh, what if you put the rrr on it.
- Yes! Thank you, seriously, thank you.
- My cramps have cramps.
- I know.
- No, no, no. No Facebook stalking.
- What? He's so cute, though.
- No, he is not even that cute.
You are so much hotter than he is.
- But, you set me up with him.
- And I brought wine, and
there's Thai food on the way.
We can go to Target and
walk around till they close,
and not even buy anything.
- That sounds good.
- Yeah.
- Three, two, one, Happy New Year!
- Are you going to make
that your profile picture.
- Mm-hmm (positive).
- I was going to make
that my profile picture.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
