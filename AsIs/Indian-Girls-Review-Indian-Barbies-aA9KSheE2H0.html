grew up to become I do remember I used
to like cutting the Barbie doll's hair
and like you know giving them different
outfits and there's some huge boobs I
had like an unrealistic expectation of
boobs the body was like this for me
Ken and Barbie literally held hands and
that was love and it was beautiful
if I eat Pray Love she's come to visit
India she looks like she doesn't know
how to party the Bobby not even brown
enough like I am more round your head
round this dress and these shoes no been
this permanent like this is not a part
of a personality like you're Indian
you're going to wear openly like this is
what you were born for when they're
trying to do like emulator culture they
don't understand it's just chaos so it's
from the festivals of the world the
valley so and the center's Beyonce there
are a lot of fair girls in India but she
looks like she is a foreigner who's
dressed in Indian clothes this outfit is
worse than fire with you and Padma
Potter's outfit in Harry Potter so she's
kind of flushed flat-chested which is
great to see because you know you don't
want like really curvy dolls all the
time you don't you notice how arranged
marriages work the skin color is quite
right and it looks really really really
pretty red outfit white red and white is
the traditional Indian bridal colors dip
that means you Bob is kind of on point
cuz but we do dress up a lot when we got
married
she's wearing a lot of layers here she
looks really uncomfortable who can blame
her even I would be if I was wearing
like three layers of clothing in India
as well it's no good behind like no
penis sure this is clearly an arranged
marriage I haven't paid detail to like
the color and everything but we're more
than color and bindis all seem lecture
Maggie's daughter who is like better
than you at everything they'd always
been making this really skinny bodies
are like oh yeah what is up with that I
don't look like
kids are really impressionable so let's
not force our views onto them let's give
them normal looking toys which represent
normal looking people so that they don't
have a tough time growing up and they
can have a lot of fun with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
