person literally kissing each other's
butt cheeks when I first heard that
penises grow I thought someone meant
that I would grow more penises as I got
older you have no idea what the drawings
of my grandpa look like I thought that
men got pregnant with boys and women got
pregnant with girls I used to think
people got pregnant because the couple
sat down together and had a special meal
like a special herb or root which made
the woman pregnant when I was a kid I
used to think that if someone didn't
flush the toilet and they had gone pee
and they were the opposite sex of you
and you and pee to that it would make a
baby
I thought that when a woman wanted a
baby she'd write a letter burn it then
the spirit of multiple babies would come
and sniff her but the one that liked it
the most would be her baby when I was
younger I thought that for some strange
reason spooning was putting a spoon up
your partner's but to relieve
constipation and I would just visualize
a cold spoon and sugar there was a
commercial for clone that are condoms
claiming that they protected you in the
bedroom and kept you safe all I could
imagine was a little glowing robot that
sat on your bedroom floor at night
keeping you from harm I spent a long
time thinking gay sex was when two men
stared at each other with their penises
sword fighting style boy was I wrong
until I was eight I thought babies came
out of your butt seems plausible at the
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
