about being so ambiguous looking clients
have literally told me that with my hair
that I look too urban or too ethnic I
think now it's actually helping me
because people are trying to be more
diverse in all aspects I moved to Los
Angeles to become an actress but I
started seeing a couple girls who looked
like me I kind of saw an opportunity to
start modeling at the size that I was
most of the gigs that I'm doing right
now our e-commerce I go to work give a
makeup done get my hair done and I have
a lot of clothes that I need to get
through very swiftly another thing that
could happen in the work week is going
to an editorial shoot
I actually prefer editorial shoots more
than anything it's a whole scene it's
almost like a movie you're just taking
stills so you're creating a character
you have this whole ambiance a lot of
the times it's campaign for a brand or
you're just testing with the
photographer let someone tell you their
vision and you just get to be a part of
it I think it's important for people to
realize that when you see an image what
you don't see behind the scenes is the
whole crew if you're getting your exact
perfect angle if that's the point of it
you're supposed to create perfection in
that moment you can create it for a
moment in an image that's been altered
but you still have to go out and live
your life I also work as a fit model I
actually really love doing fit because I
get to give input and the way clothing
fits growing up and even as an adult I
never able to find clothing that fit me
well so being able to work with
companies especially torrid where they
actually make clothing specifically for
women with my body type that's awesome
I see women being pitted against each
other on Instagram and Facebook guys
don't want bones they want curvy girls
like okay that's great you could like
what you want to like but we're not here
to say hey we're better we're here to
make space to show that they're women of
all sizes who can be beautiful
I am NOT representing the average type
model I am an ethnically ambiguous woman
I'm a curvy female and to actually make
a living off of this it gives a mirror
to other girls who are like me and I
think that's really important I wish I
had that to look up to as a kid
