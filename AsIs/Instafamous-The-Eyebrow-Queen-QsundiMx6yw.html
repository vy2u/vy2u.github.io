we'll be right with you my name is Kelly
also known as Kelly Baker brows that is
name that my friends and instagramers
and clients named me make up in brows
and hair and any kind of thing that has
to do with art is just what I love brows
are definitely the focal point of your
face and it's the one thing that you
look at first when you meet someone and
it's really important to have a nice
shape to frame your face and to make you
look proportionate there is a fun quote
that's going around that says I make
brow contact before I make eye contact
I'm going to go ahead and relax her so
now I'm tweezing my eyes brows but now
I'm going to go all along the bottom of
her brow and on the top of her brow so
now her brows are nicely shaped and
we're going to go ahead and use my
products to fill them in to give them a
little bit more definition so now I'm
going to go ahead and take my brown
powder and my angle brush and we're
going to fill in her brows just a little
bit so what really helps me with my
Instagram growth was posting before and
after pictures and that's actually
something that I've been doing for years
and then I'd show my clients and then
back in the day would post it on Yelp
and then once I figure out how to use
Instagram I started posting
before-and-after pictures on Instagram
and no one was really doing that and
four years later if you look at brows on
Instagram I mean millions and tons and
tons of photos of before and afters it's
really really cool what we've
accomplished and where brows have grown
so I am about to officially start my own
brow tour I've done about three shows
with convention centers like I'm at soar
fame Expo and we just decided to do it
on our own
and I basically tell everyone everything
that I do from the products that I use
to how to talk to the client to how to
shape how to trim all of my tips I just
want people to be happy so my gift is
brows who knew of course my favorite
part about doing brows is handing my
client a mirror and letting them see the
after a lot of times they will say I
love you oh my god I've never thought I
could have brows like this one in
particular story that I always remember
is a young girl that had come in with
her mom and her sister and she had
really really thick brows and they were
very different and it was nothing that I
had actually worked on before they were
really thick and they grew straight up
all the way across and when she sat in
my chair I thought how am I going to
shape her brows like I've never done
this but of course I knew I had to and I
had to just make it happen
and when I gave her the mirrors to start
crying and then her mom started crying
and her sister started crying and they
said thank you so much she has been
bullied her whole life on on how big and
thick her brows are and how different
they are and she's actually tried to
commit suicide twice because of it and
you know of course that broke my heart
and I was like I told my front desk like
her brows are free she can have every
product we own like whenever you want to
come in is on the house you know if that
kind of confidence comes from just
shaping someone's brows that's what I'm
here for I've been able to take a
passion and
I love and turn it into a career and
from that it's turned into giving people
confidence and making them feel good
about themselves so it's not even really
about brows anymore I get more joy in
just having fun with people and making
them feel pretty and feel good about
themselves and it's a pretty amazing
thing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
