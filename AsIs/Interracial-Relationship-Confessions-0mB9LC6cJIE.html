public and wonder how they met because
their culture seems so different I guess
I forget my husband and I get stared at
for the same reason
I've been in my interracial relationship
for almost three years now it takes a
lot of patience and understanding but
it's really worth it I've learned a lot
I just told my family about my
interracial relationship and I'm more
than overjoyed at their response I hate
the looks I get in public for dating a
white guy what's wrong with interracial
dating the hardest part about being in
an interracial relationship is a culture
clashes some days I feel self ed up I'm
leaving my toxic family to be with my
boyfriend they would never accept my
interracial relationship I'm essentially
risking it all for him I thought my
parents would be more understanding on
my racial preference they're trying to
kick me out of the house because they
don't do interracial relationships my
boyfriend doesn't hold my hand in public
shows no PDA and doesn't ever want to
take pictures with me we're an
interracial couple and I feel like he's
embarrassed because I'm black yeah
people do stare I've had people walk
past me and say really or sarcastic Wow
sad but true I just can't stand people
who discriminate towards interracial
couples just let them be happy together
it doesn't affect you either way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
