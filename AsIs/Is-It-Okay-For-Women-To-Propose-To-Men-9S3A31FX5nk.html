would you right now know I have a
girlfriend yesica please it's 2016
Hillary Clinton is running for president
Nouveau rings are in our men the only
ones that can propose I don't know what
would you do if your partner posed to
you don't don't I would propose that you
propose you feel me
it is not my job if she wants to buy an
expensive ring which I'm not gonna buy
an expensive ring because there's blood
on him I would want them to do the
proposing because less pressure on me
it would it would be a lot less stress
if she would just do it she can propose
as she wants but you know I would like
to keep it old-fashioned but I I might
not let that happen cuz I'm just I'm
Swift I think chicks should propose
that's all that's sexy I like it when
chicks pay for dinner too yeah it
wouldn't really matter to me my parents
I think they did it at the same time
basically they were just like you and
you married yeah it depends on how drunk
I am what mood were in they've scheduled
an appointment I think she just gives
herself a ring but I think it's because
like can I marry you awesome
Topanga asked Cory to marry him was Cory
any less of a man I don't think so i
think that's a guy that a lot of men
should look up to so BAM so turns out
guys don't really care about who's doing
the proposal but if women do so get the
ring and put it on my finger you know
I don't know rings are dumb aren't they
I agree oh I so want one though oakville
you're part of the problem message
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
