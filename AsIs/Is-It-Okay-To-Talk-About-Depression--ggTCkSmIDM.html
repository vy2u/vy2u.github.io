street to see if it's okay to talk about
depression yeah I think we should be
talking about depression a lot more than
we do
because we live in a society where it's
very easy to become depressed I think
it's absolutely okay
I mean some people might have a problem
with it but it's something that happens
in our world so why wouldn't we talk
about it I mean if you're coming from a
place of love I don't see why not a lot
of times in particularly in the black
community a lot of people won't admit
that they're actually depressed so I'm
really an advocate for mental health my
my best friend in the world has been
depressed through bouts of depression it
was irreconcilable like I was not able
to take him out of his mood by words
I've had friends go through go through
the pressure tonight and I feel like
it's a different experience because with
friends you don't really know if what
you can say what you can do but family
it's it's you know you love them no
matter what so you're gonna do
everything you can for them one of the
times when I was really depressed I went
and saw a therapist because I felt like
I didn't want to burden the people in my
life with my problems all day so I said
we pay somebody to listen to me if
someone knew someone who had depression
I would say just try and give them as
much company as you can and like be with
them because I don't know human
interaction can be more powerful than we
estimated to be the one thing we were
able to do that I think helped him was
to play music ignite something that you
know the person is passionate about and
trying to get them involved in that the
main thing you want to do is listen a
lot of times people try to fix a
depressed person's life well you should
do this so maybe you should go to
yada-yada and sometimes when you're
depressed and you're just having a
terrible day just kind of we'll talk
about it even if it is depressing the
person you have to talk to that's a
feeling that you know you want to talk
to somebody about preferably with
chocolate and wine so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
