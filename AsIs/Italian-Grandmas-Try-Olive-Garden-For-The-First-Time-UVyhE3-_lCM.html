it's an ancient type of food and then
the natural part of the food you know
the good oil the good the good earth to
cook it to eat it to watch other people
eat it is even better anything that
grows naturally that's what makes the
Italian food great Oh ugly it looks like
a skinny to me I wish that this
breadstick would be more flavorful like
with them garlic flavor a little more so
just a little more salt on top and I'm
not even inside it just a little more a
little more flavor it tastes like I
married that that's not good you know
what let it is terrible
don't let you look oh very good
what kind of is this it's crispy the way
I like it made eggplant that's because
the tomatoes are fresh and I love
delicious I really do tastes like I just
came from Neverland but I'm sorry I
don't like the way it's fryer this
almost look like eggplant eggplant
parmigiana very good there is eggplant
right I have to be honest yet we don't
make spaghetti and meatballs
it's an American recipe Olive Garden is
good for American people who cook this
because they didn't cook it right this
daddy is just right just the way I like
it
the pasta has no bite no texture really
good it really is good then
No maybe a little more maybe a little
more salt in the sauce the last time you
look they're supposed to look like all
together
you fill it up the first layer you put
ricotta you put it I usually make little
meat the ball it's a synthetic make call
it was Anya you should bring my daughter
here next time Oh daddy what is this no
these are not very early no no no these
are not very early it might be have to
be cooked a little longer but then if
you overcook them they may open up and
that's why most people don't overcook
them I wonder what kind tomatoes they
use is very very good very good the
flavor of the tomato mixing with the
mozzarella the cheese's inside of the
pasta and the pasta is critical to this
is so up but the ends are very hard
they're like almost raw you know the
dough over here because it's double
together not ester sweet you know the
way we make you know the sun's not sweet
we make up testing they smell have to be
ha
oh man how is she can come to my house
and try my spaghetti and they have a lot
of good deals now yes I know buy one get
one free
oh I love to be their home at dinner
America somebody no cook everything you
give oh it's nice though it's wonderful
oh so good now when you know something
you know the way is the taste
yes I know I love Italian food it isn't
passing with me and I'm passionate about
it my whole life
rolls around Italian food</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
