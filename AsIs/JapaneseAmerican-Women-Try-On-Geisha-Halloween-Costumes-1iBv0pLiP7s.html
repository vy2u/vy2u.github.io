for everything about how it makes me
feel I think
the public's perception of what a Geisha
is is she's a Japanese prostitute my
grandmother's an artist and her subjects
were geishas they actually babysat me
but actress and members of a Geisha the
movie was actually Chinese which I
always thought was kind of weird
shut up guys there's dragons on this it
doesn't look Japanese at all there's not
even an Asian girl on this I cover the
whole intrigue of a Geisha is that she's
conservative the Geisha with a dragon
tattoo what's stupid is they didn't even
do their research right like this
costume is a huge mix of like Japanese
and Chinese motif red sequin Obi belt
Obi is japanese mandarin collar choker
Mandarin is Chinese not even try it
includes chopsticks people don't put
chopsticks in their hair in Japan ever
chopsticks are for eating the mother
 is Grace if I ever saw one I look
like a character from American Horror
Story I feel extremely uncomfortable I
feel like this is the least Japanese
thing I've ever worn in my whole life
what is this what am I supposed to do
with this it's like southern belle like
Stella from streetcar from desire meets
Midwestern Chinese restaurant tablecloth
even from a basic design point very
displeasing to look at I mean you might
as well wear your bathrobe if you want
to be sexy and Halloween there are so
many ways you can be sexy without like
sort of like disparaging another
person's culture for one you would never
see a kimono like this ever the great
thing about a real kimono or you've got
that or anything is that there's usually
a slit here so you can pick a wallet in
and stuff at actual kimono will take you
an hour to two hours to put on it's
basically the Japanese version / corset
it's not like a skimpy piece of clothing
with sequins on it you cannot see any
part of their body except for their face
and maybe their hands if I wanted to be
a
Dasia I might read a little bit I might
learn a little bit I might try and be a
Geisha in a way that was like accurate
or interesting going to a Japanese event
or learning the history of kimono and
geishas would be such a better way of
appreciating it it's just so sad what's
happening over there oh yeah you know
know the half of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
