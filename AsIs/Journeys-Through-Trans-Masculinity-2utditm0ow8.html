supermarket because she was sure I was
Ellen DeGeneres like that's flattering
I'm a guy you know
hi my name is buck angel my name is Pat
Manuel my name is Scott Turner Scofield
my name is Rocco and I identify as a man
with a transgender history
masculinity is it's an energy has
nothing to do with your chromosomes when
I was still identifying as female body
like I was definitely masculine there's
never been a point in my life where I
haven't identified as masculine my
masculinity defines my maleness it just
does there are days for situations that
I'm more masculine and then there are
other situations that I am more feminine
but I'm always a man my parents really
just thought of me as their son I really
believe that and I honestly didn't
understand that I wasn't male until
puberty it was always involved in
stereotypical roughhousing and my sister
and I used to get in fistfights on
Aurora blades playing hockey I would
play with my friends and we would play
Barbies and I would always play cat
there was a shape with Daddy kit that
was like this fake little razor and a
fake um shaving cream bottle and I would
stand in the mirror next to my dad and
pretend to shave every day the other day
I saw myself and I said I've become Ken
careful what you wish for
okay age 11 was when my best guy friend
sat me down and said if you don't start
acting like a girl I'm not gonna be able
to stop what happens to you bad things
started to happen to me and my I just
wasn't comfortable and with myself I
fell into a bit of a depression
I stopped going to school and I had been
in honors classes have the adolescent
part where you're struggling to say like
look I Know Who I am it's not a phase
it's not weird it just is what it is why
do I have to go through this lie
it took me finding out that there was an
option to align my brain in my body to
feel comfortable I became involved in
boxing as a way to kind of craft a image
of myself that I had in my head but
didn't know how to get out boxing was
basically my gateway to my queer
identity so my transition was really the
catalyst for me to be able to finally
feel like myself in the world all the
negativity that I felt in that baggage
that I had been carrying with me for you
know a decade plus fell away as soon as
I looked the way that I had always felt
I don't like to shave my face because
that's when people start calling me
ma'am I'm constantly conscious of how am
i a man how much space am i taking up
how am i making people uncomfortable
now that I walk through this world
looking to people as a black man the
hostility has increased I definitely
started to experience you know being
pulled over by police a lot more often I
was like oh what am I getting pulled
over for I'm not being able to talk
myself out of the ticket like my mom was
able to
my experience as a transgender person
has been one of self-acceptance my
entire life I was not accepted trans men
talking to cisgender man-cake could
really let them understand that you know
it's okay just to become the kind of man
that you want to be not the kind of man
that you've been taught to be what I say
to everybody I think just fits you know
forget chapter how do you be you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
