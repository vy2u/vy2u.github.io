already dude birthday stuff and then I
saw on your Instagram all of these
people at your house and I was like oh
okay I guess I wasn't invited
alrighty pretty mostly kills he wants to
know if she wasn't invited I was like oh
 because I called and the thing is
even the people that I did invite I
didn't tell them about like what was
happening later to us people were like
you didn't give us any warning well also
Ned our friend Ned yes I don't know him
as a good try guy Ned had his baby
shower yesterday you were going to yeah
so I told you I was going to that but
there may be something in the evening
but I knew you'd be drunk so it's just a
whole wash it was all I am what do you
eat for brunch we had really good
potatoes po-tah-toes and eggs and nyla
made banana bread mmm plantains and you
just made me think of something sorry I
hurt you off but today I heard on the
radio that the number this they said it
was science I don't know how much I
believe I don't know also why I'm like
talking into the Megillah uh they said
our science proved that the number one
smell that was like the biggest
aphrodisiac guaranteed is banana bread

day

no I'm just getting old you turned 29
after 29 one year closer to 30 when
you're closer to dead lucky bitch
you know we always say that like 30s the
year that you get it together but not
you specifically but just people in
general but I still don't think even
that's true I think we ever get it
together I feel good I had it really how
could I just do it now it makes more
sense to say it now what about my
birthday yes what I learned what you
learned so I used to think that it was
like really important to have like a ton
of friends which is fine yeah it's nice
to have a lot of friends but I think
it's even more important I'm like oh
it's just too much energy to have just a
ton of a ton of friends and way nicer to
have like once you could really really
count on hmm and sort of the last day of
my 28th year I got called a gun by some
god geez
I missed this story I mean it was
because I called a you you got called a
cop by your friend he wasn't my friend

copper think that guy is real hat I'm
sorry if any was a Copperfield fan no it
was terrible we wave phenomena I don't
know that's the best thing come up like
we went last year to Vegas shoot some
videos and it also was almost Kate's
birthday so we used that to buy tickets
to David Copperfield right and we got to
go we got did we pass away
we got one of the guys he was like boy I
was through a death row one of the guys
we really got him a jello shot so that
he would let us go up on stage and we
were gonna leave tech force we were
Hameed yeah Pete on a picture of him
yeah picture of this yeah yeah sign them
for us and then took you to the bathroom
there's a video of it it's in the class
I think one of the truest moments of my
life was standing on that stage when
David got like hammered out of the light
and Copperfield walks by me just go hi
David I remember I just remember looking
across the stage and you were standing
on the ammonite
I think I look different it is this time
going everything's different
yeah like how different a year makes I
was watching them I mean it's a mystery
but just now on Prozac yes
the real buzzer is are we going to start
that food fad after this cuz last times
we were kind of just dead laying out by
the worst hangover and we were just like
we need to start whole 13m right this is
a terrible idea
so I opted out but these two fools said
we're gonna start hole 30 today I know
when you start a thing with the person
you're like well we're gonna keep each
other accountable yeah sure I lasted
four days don't listen up but then you
like jars of almond butter the only
thing that gave me pleasure was the
almond butter having like a normal
amount of peanut butter he was eating
jars oh yeah yeah and I was really
letting you guys know about how I know
it I wasn't yeah just don't do it I'm
like no like eating seaweed wraps boys
also didn't drink right yeah so we're
all drinking this trip around oh my god

pissed at me if you even you've been
talking about it you've been like kind
of joking yeah we just need to do it go

all night Vegas baby and we're like
which we get come for a birthday we're
like maybe we're going on a nice bottle
of wine and I was like what if we give
you guys
you know what I'm so excited for it
because I think it's really important
about how to know like what friends to
keep around mmm you know I'm like we're
gonna really yeah Karen I think it's
also really important to be able to talk
about poop in front of your friends yeah
oh my god I get all drunk and we shared
a hotel room which they are sharing
another hotel the the beds were separate
like the bedroom was separated from the
bathroom only by a curtain like an
automatic curtain yes the Cosmo - I
don't know why the bathroom was Lincoln
modern paper that said what I heard cuz
I get that I don't throw up after
drinking - so your ships and I mean I
really thought I was gonna wake them up
with my torpedo and I like could not
sleep and then I told at one point I
said just even like for real I was like
stuff hold my beer it was gonna be a
minute that was the other thing is I
showed up like a few hours after you
guys because my flight got delayed and I
shut up and you guys were already on the
brink of blackout drunk oh yeah I've got
to the airport at 6:00 in the morning
and had three Bloody Marys each every
time we're doing a month yeah it's
always like that's the buyer we got
blackout drunk at 6:00 in the morning I
walk past them like you again yeah wait
so this is gonna be the first time I've
ever gone to Vegas while I'm in a
relationship so you do anything that's
the first I've done a novel same time
same place I'm always alone
if you can have you can have the
roommates double just cruise the strip
until you know you're yours that's what
we're doing this for for you to say that
this time we're gonna have Stephen with
us to make sure the sound sounds good
the ozone will be because the end will
be actually perfect as last time our
live show this little rhino you figured
I was the first show Callum stove you
know with the sound we could work
something out but like honestly like
they're doing this show for you yeah
you're mad that the sound sounded so bad
and I was like it was a live theater
well bar but it was a lie shiera nobody
with you yeah yeah also we were drunk so
we were yelling
yeah well that was well I know you have
to get back there shoot last question
what are your thoughts on calling a girl
 as a man yeah and say you heard a
guy call a girl country just like in
this situation do I know either the
people yeah yeah oh I'd be like I
wouldn't I certainly wouldn't be
comfortable being like laughing along
about it and I wouldn't I would
definitely like if it continued I would
be like yeah but if a guy just called
like one of us a while we were out
oh yeah oh yeah really chill the
out man
oh I don't know I think I could like
girls could use it yeah maybe that's why
I feel so I've used it not even directed
at people just shank on set when I was
playing a party game once at someone's
house and they were like favourite word
and I was like guns and then immediately
I read
and they're all like but it's such a
cutting word like could burn and then
it's also like if we're joking around
and we really want to call each other I
will be like you cut it but I
think I mean to be called it by this guy
who was like getting pretty aggressively
yeah but it was he wasn't like fully
aggressive it was just like I don't
trust this guy he used it to like sting
ya to try and hurt he was pretty hurt
- I think Brad - have already dealt out
the concurrent is something less he was
being pretty hey cuz I mean those wait
do it that guys have been called out on
their privilege just a basic observation
about that message bitch cuz I feel like
the same thing with bitch right like if
someone calls me bitch I'm like thank
you but if someone does it with like
vitriol with like you know anger behind
it then I'm that's what anywhere it just
yeah it depends on the delivery in the
context I mean you could be like see for
me though I'm already just because like
I would be hesitant to do that mad if he
called you a bitch no I don't think so I
think I was just so sure like it shocked
me so much that like my eyes welled up
and that's also bothered me that no one
said anything so I was like I'm not to
freaking cry how are you guys not gonna
say it yeah so yeah it's situations like
like that out of public I mean I'm you
have to your friends have to at some
point be like alright alright that's
okay like what got me is that a lot of
people were like he's just doing it to
get a rise out of you and I don't
understand how that's a good excuse if
you're like oh I'm just doing this to
get a rise out of somewhere it's like
it's you're still doing it why is it my
fault for dressing what you spend up
yeah like you can only stand up for
yourself so much before then I think
people would also start to attack you a
for like being sensitive or like then
you actually being a bitch or like if
you stand up for yourself too much then
you're being too much
it's tricky too cuz he did I mean he was
trying to get a rise out he was but what
could you have you know it's fighting
fire with fire
yeah you could have you could have gone
after him I mean you were the bigger
person it
it's it's I wanted a little cheese so
bad yeah well it's a cheap shot not in
that it actually matters that's just
word is a word but I think using that
that sort of anger talking you were
talking about like ethnicity you're
talking about like it's just like come
on and to like I to try and use moments
like that like I do this thing now and
I'm trying to be better about it but I
try and turn it into a teaching moment
right stuff you need to go back to your
to Graham if you want to see our Vegas
adventures oh that's my name it's Steven
Cantor also know that stove encounters
dolphins
they call me stove so you busy stove
next week okay episode well by sorrel
wait for him to shut the door and I was
funny that he just walked inside I know
because he like I knew he would be good
with it he really used about that did
Reese
bless you hell yeah I went I always talk
whatever saying was I always try and do
those moments and I try and turn them
into teaching moments and I have to be
better about like context and
environment because I'm like yeah
sometimes everyone's just drunken we
gotta like let things like be Johnny if
they are funny which in this case it was
not yeah and like not every moment has
to be like a history lesson I'm like I
just yeah I just think that it's the
he's a he's a jerk Yeah right he's like
jerk surgery he's just a jerk and if
that's what he does be well that's just
how he is it's like well I don't know
why that Matt like that's just how he is
okay so he's just a jerk yeah can't fix
that yes or whatever but I also was like
you know what good to never be in this
situation again if I could help it I'm
good I'm doing on all of these yeah I
will stay home like I just I know better
how to spend my time yeah like who I
want to spend my time is so like nice to
point out too because I feel like
especially when you're younger
and you're getting you get like involved
in these groups of friends right yeah
then like say there's always one person
that you don't get along with there's
that asshole of the group I feel like we
put ourselves in situations where we
force ourselves to be comfortable just
because oh yeah Alice's friends with
them
yeah and then I would all in high school
I would why are you guys friends with
this person they'd be like just because
you're not friends with them doesn't
mean we don't have to be friends I'm and
I'm like okay but as my friend if
there's something to hurt me like I
don't know and I think that's where like
adult friendships are a little bit
different than yeah high school college
friendships and and I think people will
figure it out but I'm sorry but you
didn't have anyone to in it's okay
I also like I told everyone about it and
I also think that a big fool because he
was being like pretty ignorant so I
think that like an important lesson is
just because you might like okay I was
in therapy Saturday morning I was
talking about how it's actually if
someone does something that's shitty I
would often not tell them mmm fully
called him out on it because I would
feel like I was create I was causing
them pain by telling them that they did
something shitty interesting so like
yeah you don't wanna like hurt their
feelings
yeah I sometimes I just try to protect
anyone from any unpleasant emotion I
just Haven jerks yeah and but then I was
talking about it I was like that's
actually terrible for everybody involved
because then they don't get oh they
don't get to find out that they're doing
something shitty yeah
and the key moments are so small - yeah
and it keeps you isolated manacle so I
was like yeah you just tell people why
you really feel and I think that that's
a really great lesson but I think a
point step further it's important to
know that you can't roll you can't
depend on how they're going to react I
wasn't gonna let it go like this stuff
he was saying even if he was just trying
to get a rise but that's like the price
you pay for saying something that was
pointed out to me people do like
especially comedians they do for
shock value like they just try and and
and good comedians - funny yes yeah yeah
that's why I mean like I don't think
this
whatever I've never seen him do his
comedy like I I know this type of person
yeah this type of guy where it's like he
thinks it's okay to call women
also it's like the same type of guy he's
like oh I'm just gonna play the devil's
advocate
my friend Mary was like the devil
doesn't need an advocate he's like good
on his book devil yeah he's good um you
said something that made me think of
something but then I forgot what it was
my brain has been all over the place
I've been in a farm have you been you've
been traveling a lot oh my god yeah that
nice Keith does this thing I'd love to
put the clip in if I could of when Kate
has to fart she goes wait did you hear
that and then I go white and I like pay
attention really closely and then she
farts video that video I'm gonna play it
right now hahaha god that was good
nailed it perfect time oh yes
traveling this week has been not so it's
not like see I don't know how much I can
say like yeah maybe not yeah it's not
I've been going through some but it
it's like a degree of separation away so
it's not really my to be talking
about but this week was incredibly
stressful and I'm sure one day I will
get to talk to you guys about it but
Kate it was like wonderful about letting
me like lean on her and Ryan just like
no your friends are too is wouldn't you
really do have some that comes in
your life that's completely out of your
hands yeah I have to say jesus take the
wheel and kind of yeah everything
you know like work comes second you know
friends come second like everything
comes second to whatever is happening
you know it's like who really helps you
through that that was you buddy
this week's thanks for even though it's
your birthday week
know how I feel about this shirt it cuts
in a weird place I like it makes your
Blue Book huge and I like this today are
huge yeah I need a good push-up bra we
need to go bra shopping for an episode
well we're sponsored by third love maybe
they could send us a bro hey third love
centered the bra look I don't
know would it be my boobs were just up
like this
look at look at this are you kidding my
ass sorry I keep saying joking my ass
it's not my quote but it's right I know
something else is very funny yeah I've
been having this thing about tits
recently because started me to gloss
over well that's why I'm done but I've
been having this thing about six lately
where I've talked about them so many
times on the podcast I love my small
tits but I know my boyfriend is into big
boobs like he just likes them and I'm
having a hard time because I have
someone that's like I want my small
boobs but they're like even though he
loves me and you look at every part of
me I can't help but be like what is that
what am I feeling Kate Oh Miami let me
see is it like there's something that I
don't have that he wants I think that's
a normal fear that people have but I
don't want big boobs because I think I
would look really strange with them
because I've had small tits my whole
life mm-hmm well I think also if you
like your boobs and I love my boobs then
you're good I guess yeah I think I'm
feeling insecure is that the feeling
yeah maybe you just have to tell them
like any like big boobs but he doesn't
say anything he's never like wow your
tips are small sounds like something
that you've learned to love but you at
one point insecure about and then
objecting on to him yes exactly because
I know like I have things that I like
about dudes that he doesn't have that I
never bring up and tales
I love tales on a guy like just a
straight up rat tail yeah and I'm not
talking about the hair I want my boys to
have the freedom to obtain a little
honor
oh I'm just sticking out the back of his
back now that's really weird I don't
know I'm all I feel like we're always
gonna be a pen speaking of offending
people oh yes you are apology of the
week we did up
when kid bell was on two weeks ago we
had talked about labiaplasty and I had
said that labiaplasty was just cosmetic
purposes it wasn't for health and I
spoke not knowing I had no clue
Yeah right or not it's just what I had
heard on what is that Miami plastic
surgery show anyways we were wrong uh
someone wrote in I'll keep the
monogamous just in case but I thought
this was really important to read
because yeah it's one of those things
that we didn't realize until you guys
pointed us out and thank you for doing
so dear King cause they eleven podcast
but I wanted to write to inform you that
what you said about labiaplasty isn't
true obviously some people use the
procedure to change the appearance of
their labia for purely aesthetic reasons
but that is not always the case I am a
seventeen year old girl who is planning
to get labiaplasty this summer you might
ask why I'm choosing to get this
elective procedure and I and thinking
it's a shame that I can't accept the
natural way things look down there
however your perception that labiaplasty
has no medical purpose is wrong my labia
have caused pain and discomfort for me
ever since puberty I have had an Audi
vagina it's difficult for me to walk
around or exercise that using some sort
of Lube down there
I've even experienced discomfort while
sitting down for long periods of time
because the pressure on my labia every
time I go out I have to consider if my
tight pants will cause the long labia
its twists uncomfortably I'm
self-conscious wearing bathing suits in
leggings because the labia just doesn't
fit that well in addition the logistics
of sex would be uncomfortable because
the labia gets twisted up and blocks the
opening of the vagina it's hella uncomfy
these issues make my daily life
unnecessarily difficult and even painful
so I'm choosing to surgically reduce the
size of the labia I'm not allowing this
as many people who choose to get the
surgery also experience similar physical
discomfort I'm really tired of hearing
from feminists acting like labiaplasty
is a nun feminist act which makes you
into a bar
I think this point of view is very
misinformed wanting to change your labia
to make you more physically or
emotionally comfortable shouldn't be
shamed obviously the procedure is
extreme but it sucks that this is this
choice I have to carefully research and
consider four years is dismissed by
other women are frowned upon in society
thanks for reading a still of the
podcast
abso-fucking-lutely yeah in my head it
was a why would you do something that
you don't need to do it you're perfect
where you are when I get Botox because I
don't like the way my makeup
sets in and yes I also get it for
medical reasons for my chronic headaches
but I totally smoke out of out of
something I wait a hypocritical thanks
for thanks for killing us yeah that's
important and you know it it also brings
up an issue of like it's a physical
discomfort like it's something that was
is really hard like I don't know the
idea of not being able to like work out
or something unless you use Lube when
you're younger to it really prevents you
from a lot of stuff and it's still
considered an elective surgery yeah
instead of like medically necessary
because it's only for women so thank you
for writing in and I'm sorry that's
happening and I hope everything goes
yeah yeah we'd love a follow-up let us
know how the surgery goes yeah yeah I'd
also be really interested in seeing how
that surgeries done you know like I
don't even know hey it's those things
like on physics
I follow physics something on Instagram
and they show you like how surgeries are
done oh wow like a hand transplant I do
it and like how they would remove like a
brain tumor yeah it's pretty cool I
wonder if they have one like that
that's me yeah um I feel like I also
after that question I was like what is
mine it doesn't hurt I'd have no
discomfort from it but I love to treat
Peaks out a little bit yeah I mean good
vaginas are skin it's an organ on the
inside but skin on the outside that's
how I look at it hmm
you know our arms don't look the same
whatever

to answer a question this week probably
the greatest with us what's a cold email
Heather subject lines the subject line
was we haven't read this question so
this is actually gonna be the first time
we've read it but the subject just
caught our attention we laughed so hard

they're now the subject Heather is help
I need to go poop on a really small boat
[Laughter]
hey Kelsey came from Australia yeah
certainly happy birthday Kate you are
wicked pretty and awesome you love the
podcast Leigh thank you so crazy story I
watch Netflix doc Oh late last year
called losing sight of shore
you guys should 100% watch it which is
about four women who wrote across the
Pacific Ocean I then thought hey that
would be great and awful so I found this
team that was growing an ocean and put
my name down what awesome it's
what we forgot about it didn't even last
weekend saying that one of their crew
members had dropped out which is where I
come into the equation so in just six
weeks
I'm flying to California to row to
Hawaii like on the ocean is not a drill
I repeat not a drill wait I just said to
pause to say is that legal you're so
cool can you just not know how to be on
a rowboat then do it hey girl
sure okay timing crazy excited so scared
and potentially relatively unprepared
anyway Kelsey this one's for you I mean
I need your help with the pooping
because holy shitballs this boat is so
small and I'm going to have to poop in a
bucket that is literally right next to
another person's head like less than a
meter probably I am a person that has
trouble what with the pooping at other
people's houses but I know from
listening your podcast and you leaving
to poop all the damn guy that you do not
have a problem with this anyway please
you're pooping tips a self-help xoxo
Eleanor PS of 28 the person who is going
to Rowan Ocean so you don't have to or
the person who print of poop in a bucket
so you don't have to I think this second
one has more of a link to it PB s I
listened to your podcast but I'm sitting
on the rowing machine it makes him go so
much faster desktop please make our
podcast ah larious Eleanor Wow that is
so funny
Wow I you know I'm so glad you're going
to freaking you're gonna row to Hawaii
just cuz II play weapon the out of
her let Eat Pray Love wild why not she
said why not why not we should all take
a page of Eleanor's book and sign up for
more crazy shoulder what does it know
what you're in California I just feel
like I've seen too many Eleanor don't
miss another part
Kingsman feet we also put our uh ad in
that spot future Kelsey black we took
that little break
I hate theater Kelsey hey what you're
doing good thanks coat so are you um I'm
glad that Eleanor wrote in about this
because I have some things to say about
pooping hello I need a small boat I
really saw about it okay here's my thing
about and I'm only speaking for women's
that have buttholes public restrooms
okay I have the thing and I don't know
if it's true would love to hear your
opinion on this if you go into a public
restroom and it's a smaller one say at
the office I'm not talking about like a
target where there's like 15 or the
airport if you're in a smaller public
restroom I'm talking like maybe two four
five six dolls oh yeah okay five five
and under stuff if you like three and
under okay fine three or four you just
hear a weird squeaking noise no I did
what was it I think it's a mouse huh I
don't have it
oh you looked down at me like I was
holding it
I think the fellas like going to do if
there was a mouse in here that would be
so amazing I love mice I would catch it
and make it my friend and then set it
off into the while in a sustainable
manner anyway five stall if you go into
the bathroom and you see feet under one
of the stalls and you don't hear
anything okay they're obviously taking a
Dookie I vote okay if they were changing
their tampon you would hear the ripping
up the paper you would hear them
pregnant shifting around therapy and
they'd appear but if there's no sound
and you just see feet they're probably
pooping right my thing is we're trying
to pull is they were there first so they
get to poop so if I go in and I got a
poop basta to God so sad I'm second tier
to that pooping hierarchy so I think you
know especially at the office here yeah
thank you
I go in and then I just pee and I wait
until they're done pooping in private
and then I'll go back in and poop I
think it's really rude when I'm clearly
pooping and then someone comes in knows
I'm pooping and then just goes and
starts pooping the way yeah and I don't
know if I feel like all right
teamwork or like rude you knew I was
pooping and I can't just explode asshole
with a stranger who I don't even know
and we all have that fear that they're
gonna see your feet and shoes and they
call you out later I don't know that
that's ever in the history of ever
pooping bathrooms ever imagine how as
adults if you were if that actually were
to play out like if someone were to
understand you were shooting in the
stall everyone be like you're a really
shitty person for even saying that like
hey gay Kate poke to the back there was
like at least it wasn't in the yard
again never gonna carry away when I did
that I would you poop at the same time
someone else pooping I've done it before
also I think like it's gonna be very
different cuz you're not you're gonna be
on a boat yeah I know when I went to
barter oh please we still are trying to
figure out if we're playing we don't
know I don't think they want us but we
should tweet at them guys keep tweeting
we got close yeah Kluber very much who
knows around the universe we're gonna
play Bonnaroo Hey
something okay but you're a boy yeah and
you just get really like you just you're
dirty you're dirty we're not showering
every day you're dirty and you get used
to it and then you like I don't know
everyone like their bodily functions
just happen to you pee with each other
yeah
behind a car then you're like oh I got a
I got a poop like when you're walking
you bring the toilet paper and
everyone's just like it's a poop yeah
but do you see a guy walking with toilet
paper he's more than an agenda um I got
toilets that matter where do you go
there porta-potties
it's awful but last time I got my period
the first day I go in I mean you've gone
for six weeks so unless she's taken
unless she is you know oh yeah what if
she'll do a Diva Cup but okay so about I
think I guess a tell you poop of your
like your nerves or whatever
chia seeds and water oh really mmm they
help you poop Isaiah help
stay hydrated so it helps flush it out
easier is to eat Jia seeds so that I
could poop hmm
also to come to Bonnaroo but also I
think that you're gonna get used to
other people pooping and it's just gonna
be six weeks you might have a bad first
wheat and but after that you're just
normal and it sounds like this this like
boating rowing team is a team and this
is so normal for them yeah that you know
maybe it'll be funny you know though the
rookies got a poop it's the first poop
bag yeah making it through a fun thing
your son team bonding thing
but I can promise you that everyone on
that boat wants you to poop mm-hmm
because if you don't mm-hmm that is far
worse yeah what happens is I didn't put
when I went to the bottom of the first
time I didn't poop for the first three
days I took a I finally I paid to
take it here to like pay to take a
shower so I finally took a shower I got
a nice coffee and then this was when I
was smoke just cigarette
I stink yarn I was like I also have an
irritable bowel syndrome Oh rocket ship
off the toilet is loaded into
the no I I ran to the bathroom multiple
times it was also 98 degrees
great band I do I do
okay but Manjula face it had before do
you breathe say to me when I went to
their car look every time I got quiet I
was lucky I was screaming at this just
shut me up there was a birthday on there
this one's for you and I turned around
to everyone 40 years old oh just what
but I was like really hot ahead I was I
kept running back and forth hmm and I
ripped I'm going the one time and I see
a guy and he's going for my stall and
there's a line I swear to God I body
checked him out of the way well that's
the other thing is like I have all done
this way to use our periods to the
advantage like we need to go sooner than
the other person and I've even done in a
women's restroom when I went to Disney
two weeks ago and got food poisoning or
three weeks ago whenever I was I skip
along the lines I said I'm sorry I'm
gonna vomit and they all were like go
you know women are nice though to in
front there's some tips what I was
thinking about yeah you guys wonder how
a laser it's not healthy
it's not the way that I do this is not
good I don't recommend this but if you
want to learn how to laser ship it came
from years of being on set and not being
able to leave and what I would do is I
would hold my poop because I had to and
then it kind of carried over into my
position now or now I just hold my poop
as long as I can and then I almost let
myself go like it's a reward like finish
this edit and then go poop because you
deserve it and so I'll hold it until the
 thing is coming out of me and
then I'll just run and then I laser poop
and it all just comes out yeah another
tip if you don't want it to splash throw
a little bull up some toilet paper throw
it in the toilet in the water and it'll
just nice soft landing a nice little
kind of like a like a like a pair of
shoes it's like a nice little parachute
laces up the water and the other thing I
do sometimes I do this thing when I'm
really constipated well this episode of
really turned into something else I mean
this is really important yeah uh I don't
think you guys can't see this if you're
only listening on on iTunes but if
you're watching on YouTube calm such as
is I do this thing where I push my hand
like this clasping your hands yeah yeah
there and I'm pushing my elbow into my
lower stomach and I'm using my other
hand sometimes I'll go this way and I'm
kind of yeah if you massage your neck
Sarge it out yeah the size real or
bagman oh my god I'm gonna say this and
I'm so sorry to any of the men who were
once sexually attracted to me ah
sometimes I'll squeeze my bottle really
tight and then I'll squeeze it squeeze
it squeeze it squeeze it squeeze it
you make your butthole inhale before
what it is if you can't get it out just
try and suck it up a little bad just
show them sometimes it needs a little
bit of what it was like a little okay
well such no anyway look when you pull
back to throw something forward oh I
don't know yeah it's got adrenaline
it's what adrenaline I know it's not a
journal it sort of sounds like the
adrenaline needs so many people are
screaming out the word source it needs
some sort of force you have to pick ups
acceleration no picking up like you have
to oh my god oh my god I have to google
it
uh yeah but sometimes that out so the
same way that like if you need to burp
sometimes like sucking in helps
sometimes yeah just suck your butt up in
and then push it but as far as like
going next to someone's head on this
boat that you're gonna be on Elinor that
seems a little weird maybe ask them to
move it away from someone's face that's
just my opinion I don't want you to get
your fecal matter in someone else's
mouth well they're people like bundles
all the time so who am i stood say you
know what there's people matter on
phones if you if you you type go on your
phone while you poop I'm just trying to
fill the air what case I think so weird
she's looking I need it's just it's are
you sure what is it again okay it's not
accelerate it's a ricochet no no no
they're close so sorry it's enough to
gain momentum maybe that's it is that it
needs some momentum yeah you need a gain
momentum
so yes it's yeah it's gained momentum
okay now that was it all themselves
oh I mean to UM gather momentum
consuming time accelerate open the
throttle open the throttle put the pedal
to the metal spring on here now so
flat-out nailing hey where's the
weirdest place you've taken a poop
I don't think of any place has been
weird we define weird
um I pooped in the ocean once hey maybe
that's another tip and start going in
this bucket just hop in the water just
take your little butt in the water yeah
and they flows yeah and then you just
let the ocean water clean your bones
yeah this actually sounds kind of nice
my friend did that they pooped and the
girl's friend they pooped in a river
yeah it's nuts what it like poop and
then wipe you yeah it's nice something
about pooping and peeing in the and
girls man we pee everywhere oh I
there I've never been to pull that
Indian okay natural koozies that's rude
yeah cuz there's so many people and
cause present me one time when I was in
high school it was the day before I was
leaving for our cruise and I went out
with my friends and got drunk and we
were at a bonfire in the woods and I
went to go pee and so I pulled my pants
down and I put my hands back behind me
to hold myself up stuck my hand right in
a fire ant pile and my hand I was so
drunk and it like I didn't know what to
do and so I tried to put it underneath
my pee stream that you try to pee on us
yeah I let her because I didn't have any
water I didn't have anything so I ran
back over and I got beer but by the time
like I had poured beer all over my hand
it was just like a balloon so
for seven days on this cruise I
had just like a look like I was wearing
a glove
ski gloves yeah I was looking then
didn't get on the poop man yeah true I
never have any thing cos P disasters and
oh yeah P disaster I mean weirdly always
at my friends I feel like I told this
story before I was at my friend's house
in eighth grade and oh no it was like
right before the beginning of eighth
grade since the last day of summer we
were swimming but I used to I used to
hate I would wear a one-piece I would
hate to like take it all the way down
mmm so just pull it over to the back
nice and pee but it slipped
it slipped and I peed right through my
meeting su and I was like oh I was
like I gotta go home and her mom's like
I'll Drive you I'm like no I I'm good
why do you have to leave like I got my
period and then the thing is no I hadn't
gotten it ever yet and then when I got
home I got my period
wow that's some weird universe I know my
pee being like you got to get out of
your Eyre
meghanadha so I'm gonna was looking up
maybe like get your period in the
comfort of your own home this episode
got a little manners do we have anything
else we need to cover yeah me check let
me check
Oh our adult thing oh yeah we kind of
heard we kind of forgot about that the
last couple weeks or we suggested like
one thing that's helping us try to be a
better adult
what's yours for this week oh I didn't
know it was one thing oh you can give a
couple I'm gonna give a couple okay a
couple things I like right now your
birthday if you ever the you want
uh yeah Margera what are you gonna do
 I want
remember Viva La Bam yeah who doesn't
man I loved him I I called information
to find out the restaurant that Don Vito
used to always go to so I could come
what I called the restaurant I was like
is Vito there and they're like you
or hung up osika cam did you see Johnny
Knoxville's coming out with a new movie
that has the guys in it no it's a
scripted movie I forget what it's called
but it's real stunts real
it's basically scripted jackass and it's
all of that like everything I wanted I
missed ya yeah it's talking about the
other day I missed jackass cuz I feel
like a bunch of people and Viner like
kind or like were ya then like kind of
doing Jeff but not really like jackass
really yeah did everyone in the movie
theater it was like our age everyone was
like oh yeah alright
this is so dumb but it's so true like
all of us will go see this movie look at
its sheared nostalgia I thought we were
talking about the other day about when
Stevo was in speaking of poop he put
himself in a porta potty I had to like
things on either side and a bungee cords
yeah I shot him up in the air and the
thing is is that he's gonna scream but
there even if he was like help I need he
would have gotten stuff in his mouth so
he couldn't even scream for help he was
getting sick anyway when they when you
landed and he crawls out like he fell
onto the ground and I'm pretty sure he
like army crawled over to a stream I
love Steve oh yeah he's still doing
stunts you know yeah he doesn't stand up
to I think oh good yeah I like him a
movie I watched recently on Netflix that
Adam Devine he's still he's still out
there good for him
yeah what's your things but they don't
things and what did we call these where
they call adult things just called our
adult hmm okay you okay I've been
listening to the Pete Holmes's podcast
called you made it weird you know what I
didn't like it at first but then I was
like wait this is the best pod it's so
good and had to go sometime I did yeah
it's really wine and I don't understand
why it is so long but then I was like oh
I get it you get you like really cool
things so I listened to the Garry
Shandling episode well among other ones
but from that I I know Garry Shandling
talked about the Zen of archery this
book that like changed a lot of stuff
whoa what is it about it's about the
idea of like in when you are I haven't
read it yet but this is just like the
synopsis that I heard is that it's not
just you it like against the target it's
you all are together like you the bow
the target are all one and you have to
let go of self so much so that you could
perform this thing like you're supposed
to happen and it's it's all very zen and
I'm like you just like lose yourself in
it it correlates with like many other
art forms yeah what
and how like you behave and stuff so I'm
excited to read that I just got it in
the mail I also love cardi B's new elbow
my god this song was so good I see my
own injure my god it's all my stuff now
it's on Spotify it's so good it's just
do it when like your with your
baddies and you guys just want some
the bump - she's I mean she was
that one little why - she goes I guess
this 15 minutes last of long as hell I
was like yeah she's so great and then
finally I was just reading I know a lot
of people who listen to this podcast
might relate to it it's a trigger
warning it's a this New Yorker article
about it's the most recent one with the
cult so it's called this silence the
legacy of childhood trauma and it's like
can you send it to me yeah it's amazing
I will link it to in the description
yeah it's like it's so how far
did I get it but anyway it's really good
it's about someone who had terrible
childhood trauma and how like you know
you try to run away from stuff that
happened you try to put a mask on and I
think a lot of people could relate to
that and just about how eventually the
truth comes out mmm out with it out of
it so those are those are my adult shits
sounds though um my adult things uh I've
been using this app called mint this is
not sponsored I wish it was it I've
never been like great with money I tend
to do things very spontaneously you yeah
I spend just when I see it in my bank I
don't think about the future
I don't think about savings so this app
has really been it's really easy like
especially with money I feel like things
get convoluted in with all the numbers
especially someone that has numbers
because Alexia I hate banking
apps
I hate budgeting I don't understand
spreadsheets I hate that so this
app mint has been really helpful
especially its taxis
I guess so or now you guys should have
done her taxes no it's not until the
15th oh there you go about it yeah I
haven't you haven't done I forgot until
you said it I swear to God I want to use
my tax lady she's like a hundred fifty
bucks just some tips no I'm just gonna
do it on turbo okay thank you and then
the second thing is I did something
yesterday that I never do I hate
hate hate hate hate me no I said I was
saying a name in between you said you
hate everyone hate hate scary movies oh
you go see the quiet I did and I never
in a million years would ever
agree but I loved John Krasinski I loved
Emily Blunt I hate what Sierra was it it
was uh no no I need to go see I saw it
sober and I thought you know I'm so
proud of myself after I saw it yesterday
oh I know I was gonna text you to say
like hey I'm going into a movie so if
you want to go out to dinner let me know
because I'm not gonna be available thing
exercise but you're at that festival
other enjoy uh I was sober I went
voluntarily and I sector the
whole thing and yes I got scared but it
was so where I felt so happy for myself
after thinking like a scary dog didn't
possess or something next I don't know I
feel like the whole genre of horror film
has now been opened up and this was a
reticular one though and it was
thrilling yeah and it's very scary it's
called a quiet place it's about like
these monsters that will hunt you if you
make a sound so now the world has gone
silent and so the whole like sound
design of the movie if they don't win
some sort of award for sound design like
really the Academy can go
themselves it's really good so not only
go see that movie but go do something
that normally scare is here this I think
we all should do something that you know
makes us our pants a little bit for
the week I want to give one to at appear
