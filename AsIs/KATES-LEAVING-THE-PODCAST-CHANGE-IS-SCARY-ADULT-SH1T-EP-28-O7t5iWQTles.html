accidentally joining this is pure
accident as well as pure accident
Kate walked right into the room and I
saw her out of the corner of my eye
wearing a green jacket black pants and
shoes and I said I'm wearing green pick
green jacket black pants and shoes and
she turned around oh well we're both new
this is total accent thank you for
supporting her fresh yeah you can get
this at kit builder comics that's
company only it's Kurt anywho lucky
unstuck guys it's happening the title
says it this is not quick bait this is
not a drill this is a big and a lot of
fake news this is not a fake news I
don't even feel comfortable saying it
I don't either anything else I'm sorry
don't apologize um I am leaving the
podcast blah and the truth of the matter
is the truth of the matter is the reason
why is because there was one mean
Internet should be I to be fair he told
me this well I kind of knew like there
was a I'm sure you guys probably knew -
I was kind of not myself for a little
while and well yeah and I just could
tell you we're having fun anymore so
Kate did tell me last week so this isn't
like a super shocker I kindness that
would be such a dick move would be a
dick move but I you know wouldn't be
surprised
set it on the y'all know I thought
I would be really sorry I would be
really pissed if I think you're joking
yes um yeah tell my coat well you know
a couple of things Hey okay don't freak
out we know you guys are probably
freaking about it yeah really literally
the one thing we were worried about was
like I was like dude I'm fine the pie
guy's gonna be fine
I don't think the fans are gonna be okay
with I think you guys will be fine
you'll be fine I'm still wrapping my
head around being fine with the fans now
realizing this but I'm scared yeah I
mean it's not because you guys that's
for sure
uh it's literally it's not you it's me
[Laughter]
you know I just I wasn't there's I think
we kind of live in an age right now
where when we share a whole bunch of
stuff it the more you share almost like
the more people reward you for sharing
like really private parts of yourself
and parts of your life and I'm not I'm
not even able to really do that in like
interpersonal relationships like I'm not
when I have like when I'm sitting here
on having an actual conversation with
someone I'm not as open as I am on this
podcast so I think that I was trying to
be more more vulnerable and open by
talking about stuff on this podcast and
I ended up turning something that I
wanted to do in my everyday life into a
job and then I don't do it in my
everyday life yeah and honestly that's
false and that's that's false that's
untrue to use me lying to you guys in a
big way by being like yeah just like be
honest and talk about them and stuff
when I'm not doing that in my own life
and I think that I kind of need I need
to separate and I think a lot of times
like it's hard to separate this is by
far the most successful thing I've done
a buzz for you this is like nuts yeah
intention of this being like as awesome
as it ended up being yeah so I think
it's important to to know that even
though something is successful and even
though something might be working it
might not be working for you and it
might not be right for you so that's
where I'm at right now and I was really
scared to tell Kelsey but I think then I
know what I was I don't want to hurt
anyone or make anyone feel bad yeah
especially my friends and I don't want
to I try to control other people's
feelings by keeping the truth from them
so but you also do this thing where you
like put your needs second to people
because you're trying to like to please
I mean not only me you have we have like
hundreds of thousands of listeners right
it was like you were keeping up this
like energy and yeah when you do that
like it's the metaphor we use last week
was like when your parent wants you to
play a sport like even though you could
be awesome it's like the classic
tales like a football player who wants
to be a painter it doesn't matter how
great a football he is if his heart I'm
the one saying he I played football in
high school
yeah yeah my football quarterback excuse
oh no I really don't forgive me Matt
Matt what are you trying to smash from
Friday Night Lights
oh I never watch it you know this Kate
it's been a contentious plane our
relationship into like we had I think
the thing I was most scared about was
like like Kate said it was the most
successful thing and it went in a
direction that we didn't intend it to
like when we started this podcast me
jokingly we're saying like it's a it's a
podcast where we up so you don't
have to but we didn't want to every week
be I like putting out like the
most vulnerable like scary parts or
stuff we really did intend for this
podcast to be about learning
and through like learning about other
people so like we wanted to do
interviews we wanted to like touch on
subjects that we felt scared to touch on
we wanted to you know up that way I
don't think we it kind of accidentally
tumbled into like okay how what
disastrous thing can we talk about that
happened to us this week it became like
us like sacrificing it became like an
emotional jackass which I love
Jax I got to talk about on why I love
jackass yeah but it became like I'm a
writer I want to write that's what I
want my focus to be out I don't want my
focus to be on almost it came to a point
where I felt like I was and - no one
else has fault literally just my own
like I was exploiting certain parts of
myself that I don't really let myself
take part in in my regular life so and
like you said like you want to be a
writer and you were talking about last
week like you give all yourself here
yeah so you it's like not authentic yeah
the way you used to self-care was like
through your writing yeah and you were
able to use your experience through
writing and now that you're coming here
like depleting your resources every week
it's like how do you write after you've
expunged all your sponge yes you wrung
out all the water from communication and
entertainment and what like I try to
make it it well anyway I try to make it
entertaining but yeah so I can't I just
I know that it's not good for me right
now
um and it's gonna be okay like we're
gonna we're not gonna just gonna never
hear from code again like we're still
gonna have I'm still gonna whether she
likes it or not make her listen to it
every week to make sure that I don't
 up saying things and then you know
I'm gonna still need her opinion on
stuff when I obviously have a very
specific point of view and I think
that's why this podcast works so well is
because of how different our points of
view are on things but like how we're
still able to be friends so tightly and
like I'm first wait sorry I just noticed
you have like seven
host it stuck to the camera on your
laptop she's showing it why do you have
like seven because when you put one you
could still see through it and I was Dan
I had a dance party the other day by
myself and I just love heard your I
didn't want the internet to know okay
simmer looking I paid to see that
quality content you were talking about
my mind went blank me too whoa I wonder
if something happened and like the guys
from men in black came in and we had a
little adventure an alien attack and
they just raised it yeah tired
it is Tuesday we know no it's because we
just bought a bunch of aliens but we
don't remember it
the other thing Tim was like I think the
thing that was most scary to me was that
we had all these plans like from the day
one of the podcast the only reason why
our old boss even let us do this was
because we had plans to write a book
tour make merch for you guys and try and
turn this into a fun show that could be
like sold in a different way that's not
just audio and so like in my head I was
like we have this very clear path and we
were on our way I mean we did our first
live show and we were you know trying to
plan more shows and we were getting like
sponsors in yada yada yada and in my
head I was like why I was like how are
we gonna do that now and I keep saying
we cuz I'm so like not letting and I
don't want it to be like just my thing
because we built this together and like
it will be a little different bit of a
podcast like it is gonna be different
just and I you know Kate looks like
maybe you should get someone else to
fill in for me and I don't know yet what
its gonna look like I mean it could be
you know two totally different people I
sit here I don't know but like it just
didn't feel right putting someone else
in because then just feel like I would
be and maybe the audience would be too
just comparing them to you and so even
my head I was like well maybe it would
just be fun to rotate like a coast out
every now and then like I know you guys
loved hearing Freddie Jasmine and like
our other friends but even still like
how do i navigate now all these plans
you know it's stupid but they always say
like what is it God last when you make
plans I believe really the traditional
idea of God anymore but I I do think
that state ministry like when you try
and make concrete plans of course the
universe is just gonna like pull the rug
because yeah that's not how it works so
I think that's what I was most nervous
about was like why why would you want to
like that up and then I'm like well
she's not that's not what she's doing
like she's doing it for herself and and
you have to like yeah you always are the
person who says like you have to put
your safety mask on first before you can
take care of someone else yeah and like
where it'll figure itself out you know I
think it'll be fun to get more
interviews which is what we set this
guy's out to be and then like still make
use do things don't make you come in and
answer questions or you know yeah be a
guest even I just yeah sure I don't know
I don't know what it because it doesn't
it's a very weird thing to be like why
why do you want it like look at what
you're what you're doing and I don't
normally ever take care of myself to a
point where it hurts someone else so I
don't want to like I don't know her I
think the audience is gonna be really we
have the we have plans ya know we had
all of these things but that it was kind
of from them
I guess not from the guy maybe from the
get-go or like kind of into it I was
like my vision of like I don't know
having a show or writing a book or doing
something like that wasn't it wasn't
this yeah and though I like it I really
like being there I like that people
reach out and they feel comfortable and
they feel like they found someone who's
going through the same thing that they
are um I can't there's like such a fine
line between artists
and activist and you became like the
poster child for something yeah and I
I'm I'm not like I know a lot of people
will ask advice and I don't know I ate I
thought it was only ate ice cream
sandwiches this weekend but from Friday
to Sunday I had 12 ice cream sandwiches
I stress ate ice cream sandwiches all
week it's just not about this really
because I could it's an uncomfortable
thing fair okay I guess I was like
mentally prepped yes last weird maybe
even before that I don't know but it
sounds like so sometimes all say stuff
on here and I'll look at the camera and
I'll be like okay we're gonna do like
this is what's going on with me and this
is you know whatever and some stuff in
the beginning I was distant like a firt
like I had a enough of a distance
between that I was able to like laugh
about it be like that's good that's a
good place for that story that's where
that could live but now that I've sort
of exhausted all those stories like the
things that I'm far enough from now I'm
like tapping into things that are
happening right now and I would walk
away from here and be like I wasn't
ready yeah to show that yet I wasn't
ready to do that and that's okay to do
that and I'm really grateful that that
you were that you are like responding in
a way that is the way that we would tell
like ask someone like if someone were to
write in yeah and say that they have
this thing I feel like this would be the
advice that we would be like it's not
fair to your co-host yada yada yada and
I'm just you know yeah sometimes you
make up in your head what will be worse
than it's actually yeah cuz I could tell
you were like nervous when you were
telling me and I was like I wanted to be
like I already know and I this
conversations not gonna go probably how
you think it will ya head yeah like I'm
sure I was there like I was like digging
my thumbnail you go like that's bad news
I was like oh wait did someone die are
you okay but I mean again like I would
be also a fraud if I were to like sit
there and be like whoa maybe give it
another chance and I think I presented a
lot options too I was like well what if
we like took a break or like what if we
ended season one you know today and we
took like the summer off and weekend I'm
gonna fall or like and I just wanted I
was like cool just the the producer side
in me was like make sure she knows like
that she's not stuck in this thing or
like it doesn't have to be this way like
what she comes in and we just
interviewed people and we don't tell
personal stories and then I was like why
am I trying to like negotiate in my own
head when like she's already made up her
mind I kind of already have made up my
mind that that's like the what the best
thing is yeah just let it be what it is
instead of trying to make something work
when like it's just not and I feel like
I wrote down friendship in our thing cuz
like I think it's also too important to
note that like when you're going into
business with something like if that's
what this is right like it's a business
and like I'm such a control freak and
you're still like laissez-faire and we
were like yeah and it just like it was
uneven in the way that we I was
stressing out with over things that you
had no control over and like I think it
affected our friendship and I people
were commenting on it that like I think
- it was just affecting the way that we
were being friends yeah and like we
almost weren't talking to each other
about things because we were like oh
we'll save her for the podcast and like
then it was like we weren't even really
hanging out anymore because we were
spending so much time together here and
I think it's important to note that like
sure we could have kept going and forced
to this but then we would have ended up
not being friends yes if we were touring
if it was still like how we did it in
Philly we would not be friends past like
a week because the feeling show I was
like we were just gonna go to Philly
yeah and just have a weekend there I
just have fun and then
let's do a show like yeah if you want to
do it yeah I didn't have to test you oh
 I emailed like a couple places and
then Kelsey literally carried the but
like the others and I like doing that
you know and I continue to do that yeah
it won't feel like you should feel bad
about you know yeah doing something that
you don't want to do okay yeah so um but
I don't thank you for thank you for
being so cool and doing this for his
lies you did and I don't even want to
get like a emotional about it because I
know like you'll we'll find a way
you know to keep being friends and
continuing to like work together and you
know people could be friends without
being business partners right can ya
look at the classic duo's you know Penn
&amp;amp; Teller that's the only duo's yeah they
wouldn't be friends without their magic
show
would they yes basically still be
friends I know but like if I I don't
know see that's that's the that's a big
reason why I'm I'm not a big reason but
that's like one of the things is that
like I don't want to just exist for a
work thing yeah like I want to I think
that it's really a I don't know I got I
think I get caught up I think a lot of
people do get caught up in the idea that
oh if this is working then the milk it
milk it dry like really go for it or
whatever but and kind of turning their
life into some sort of like business and
like that idea I hate the word
influencer I hate it so much I I
hate it I don't want to be it I started
to be it huh and I hate it I
don't want to be like hey guys check out
what I'm up to today I don't
care I go good some people will like
that cuz it's
but it makes me sick to my stomach and I
think that taught me a lesson - oh yeah
he talked about it last week that like I
built myself up here by putting myself
out there in videos and talking about
like being the messy one or the drunk
one yes I was able to also do that
through scripted videos and what this
turned into was like I was revealing
every single part of myself and so I
have a friend whose brother is weirdly
faint like super famous and she told me
once that he doesn't have any social
medias yes when you walk into his movie
he wants you to have no preconceived
notion and I feel like what a lot it's
like youtubers have done is they help
themselves up on these YouTube platforms
being unscripted and just being
themselves and then they cross over into
what they really want to do which is
like act and you know be on TV or in
movies or in you know scripted YouTube
red shows or Hulu whatever yeah and then
it's hard to separate yeah they are on
your YouTube channel from who they are
in this movie it comes it also becomes
pretty fake in Maya it becomes like you
become a caricature of yourself and I
didn't want to do that I don't want to
be like this is who I am right now and
now as well all you're ever gonna and
then there's no room because then I'll
be 30-something acting like us
you know what I mean yeah then you're
just playing a part and there's not a
whole lot of room for growth so and I
think that not everything has to last
forever yeah some things are like a fun
thing to do like that's why miniseries
this way this was a miniseries of Kate
on a and now we're moving it to
another miniseries yeah I think it's a
good lesson that you taught me too
because like again we are in the
entertainment business and when people
Google us the first thing that's gonna
pop up now is like facts dig down
note I thought about that yesterday I
was like I can't get a regular job no
well why would you I wouldn't but I'm
gonna I'm like if I were like if you
definitely can't like I feel
away I could go not do this and it's
good to keep something to yourself like
we want to be here for you guys in a way
that also doesn't jeopardize who we can
grow into right which it like I mean
this was fun for put on t7 whatever it
is that I'd also like to say do say
that's not what I wanted to say but
that's part of it um is that I think
it's really good to have like people
that you look up to and role models and
stuff like that oh god but it's coming
I'm gassy yeah but oh sorry it's my
several models if these have role models
and it's nice to be like oh I'm not
alone I'm not alone if there's anything
that you get from anything I've ever
said is that you don't need an example
to know you're not alone you're not
alone and whatever you're going through
you're not alone someone has been
through it too there are places and
people that you could find and also if
you feel you're strong enough to be
alone you know what I mean because I
think that role models are really cool
but I mean even the past like feet like
Louie was a role model of mine
yikes you know what I mean like Oh
 John Lasseter was a role model of
mine he didn't oyster in style but there
you know your role mark you can't don't
give too much power to role models yeah
or or even like Chelsea Handler right
like that was who I preached day night
that I wanted to follow in her footsteps
and she went from like drunk mess host
to like now she gave up a Netflix show
she gave up millions of dollars an
opportunity at a platform to go focus on
politics like yeah change like they
shift and to know that like you know you
don't have to have this idealized
version of what a hero is because
they're human and I think if anything is
also to what we're realizing in this yet
you
each day at night that were human and
like yeah we got to kind of take our own
advice a little bit here and realize
that like go to human guys she's a human
believe it or not a boat but should
there's feelings my temple dude my head
well I'm so I mean I I tell you this
every week like I I'm always and
especially when we like started editing
this in the first episodes like I just
was so proud of us yeah specifically
proud of you because I I think I thought
we were gonna go into this with one way
of yeah being like not not like meek but
like like less experienced or like let
less um confident yeah every week it was
like you became more and more I was just
like in awe of watching you grow and so
think I know it like sucks but thanks
for putting yourself out there for don't
give me out 5427 I don't even know what
number this is but you know I think he's
done any of this without you and buddy
myself boy wouldn't been as good but
people right in every week and like I
would tell you this all the time that
people with more so go I'm the Kate yeah
and like I'm just and they would write
that to me like I know
amazing and yeah like I said it's gonna
be a change and it's gonna be weird and
we might leave some some some
subscribers but do you guys want to know
a funny story I'm scared I don't know
this I didn't tell you ahead of time
I didn't mean to not tell you but I
don't forgot about it until now so uh
we're recording this on Tuesday morning
we normally record on Monday mornings
but yesterday I went to do a video where
I went to hypnotherapy Oh honestly
that's not Scottish what did I do
I don't know anyway uh we went to this
woman so that she hypnotized us it was
like hypno therapy past life regression
or whatever so like she hypnotized as
you and you get until is like
a comfortable state and then you tell
her who you were in a past life
Wow so I saw know how much I believe in
it uh-huh
because hey I was like oh yeah I'm
gonna figure out that I was a pirate I
was like a cool scrappy pirate on a boat
just little I'm like telling people who
like lies but you know everybody like
you yeah cool yeah but maybe like a
teenager
like I would be young and scrappy and
then just like my country I'd know this
scrappy and hungry sorry it's from
Hamilton maybe you've heard of it okay
oh sorry so anyway so I'm in the chair
everyone else went Joyce went curly wet
I'm not gonna spoil who they wear by I'm
gonna spoil who the I was because
I'm so embarrassed by it so I get on
this weightless chair and I'm going and
there's this a weightless chair I don't
know it's just like a recliner
so she said this is a good weight
everyone has a point of weightlessness
uh fine about you know whatever and uh
okay yeah and so then there's a therapy
cat that was on my lap it was the story
I was like where are you Malibu
awesome and after all this time boys do
you believe it can you believe okay so
so she's like she takes me down the
meditation or whatever in the trance
 and then you should be like okay
what do you see
turns out what I saw what would it be
like at a campfire with a bunch of
cowboys okay and I had three sons oh and
my husband was dead like he wasn't
around I don't even know it was a good
guy but the other Cowboys were like not
good to me they didn't believe it or not
men respected women even less in boy
times Wow
and so they were like me and you me and
I didn't want my son's to see that but I
knew that my sons would be a
okay so I left I love my head on your
side and in my head I abandoned my son
so that they would be like because they
would be respected I don't want them to
see them like seeing me get like
assaulted and stuff so I left and I went
and started to work in like linens I
were to attend to the died of heartbreak
oh well that is not a metaphor for what
is happening here what it sounds like a
like a very relaxing job yeah but that
gave me a lot of like calm time to think
about how I could have saved my boys but
I couldn't have they wouldn't know one
would respect it a single mom like that
times you have to do what's best for the
greater good even though it might hurt
you at the time maybe I gotta for
 - you dying of heartbreak so
what who is there was pregnant and I was
just like I'm sorry but I was looking
aware of what I was saying and there
were no assets dude it took everything
in me not to laugh cuz that one boy
she's like and what did you do and I was
like left up I cannot wait to see this
video I mean it's true that like yeah
there's there's a serious part of it
that's like well yeah there was a time
and still today women don't have a
choice here that sort of stuff and you
just have to you have to do it and a lot
of people could judge them from the
outside hmm all that sort of stuff did
you feel good about it no I feel like
 the whole day I had a we did this
for my series where she did the same
thing it might have been the same lady I
wonder is your name Lisa Knight on the
member was like a year and a half ago
but yeah but older no cut that part out
actually older than age exists she's
see I would say no this trip is probably
in our forties but she told me at my
nipple really hurts I don't know why I'm
here and that nobody thought she told me
that I was a Egyptian Prince but like a
bad one one that was like very
tyrannical tyrannical Kiran Kiran
earlier Tara ago I was that so why it
was like that I told you yeah oh oh it's
like it's all about like imagination and
stuff like that like that it I heard a
southern belle stir I don't know enough
about it to on it
or to believe in it but uh kind of funny
but I totally enjoyed yeah really enjoys
her but we're both like very innocent
and beautiful and like Carly's would be
 curly and then I'm just over

to do this below oh my god oh you could
do this I can do this it's just gonna be
more work I'm gonna have to like plan
things to talk about I think you should
also get like a little sound board with
sound effects oh so you could wedding
fun idea yeah maybe we could order it
today let's see sound
yeah cuz I think is then you could just
sort of be like when you're like feeling
weird just be like oh I don't know it's
fine that's gonna be fine all that today
good idea code yes it shows with your
friends for flexing but yes this is
gonna be my own fun idea you don't have
to use it
okay and leaving but if you want me to
it could also you can have a Kate stay
on board yeah that's just little
soundbites of things you say like oh man
oh wait I wanna see her today high on
her father I actually said your name
earlier because I was sweet this is
Kate's leaving episode I know sorry
buddy so I said things like I'm gonna
make our friends yeah and like jazz and
first of all look at this blazer good a
blazer where's that from after story oh
right right because then you're like
this never like works whenever
store know I'm such as what do you think
about change and friendship and who's
Gary nasai don't know sometimes it's
hard like I feel like this is something
similar to what people can relate to of
like going off to college
oh I know oh I'm far away from each
other yeah but you're real ones always
stay around and obviously you're a real
one oh and jazz you're gonna have to
come on oh and be like maybe we'll do
like a season of jazz I'm done I mean no
you don't it'll be a star blazing
nothing it's not very flexible you are
there's one thing I've learned from us
feet and Holloway I am nothing if not
replace to learn everyone
place the last 30 space my pictures
talking about how you're not very large
you really aren't you give great insight
see a great details no I think it's
gonna be fun to have a kid we're gonna
have a case sale Florida posters gonna
be like different but it could be long
to just be like you know you never
really art control on your own you don't
need that person in your life you guys
but we'll see jazz on soon because I am
going to freak out and fail and rely on
afraid a little while I'm scared that
it's fine let me talk about infinity war
I think the Cape board is really fun
it's like a lot of people I feel like a
lot of people are gonna be like oh I
think if anything people are gonna like
you more because of this I do not think
that's true because I have a very hard
time listening the podcasts alone when
I'm talking what is my saving grace is
when you try men yeah but that's how I
feel about the podcast interesting
I hate when I'm talking I think it just
comes down to a how you feel about
yourself yeah and you know we might we
might just do 30 episodes and then take
a break not you but I might do just so
the episodes and take a break and film a
bunch of stuff and figure out what works
we do have some guests line up that are
gonna be fun and exciting for you guys
sort of that ability war okay boiler
alert my old spoiler alerts I'm gonna be
honest I don't really know much about
Avengers in the Marvel world I've only
seen the movies so I don't know about
the comics I don't yeah the history I
really I don't also don't care my fandom
is Harry Potter fans ease so I went last
week I got my necklace replacement
Deathly Hollows necklace I lost mine in
a bathhouse a Russian bathhouse I don't
know why I matter said it was Russia but
it was where is there a Russian back out
in West Hollywood
what's a bathhouse um it's literally
where you strip down to your skinny
skivvies and they beat you with palm
fronds
they Don France I tan we miss you and
they they scrub you and they water you
down it's very confusing and it feels
very not very hygienic because I feel
like there's other people's skin cells
just lying around so I lost my Harry
Potter necklace there's they beat it off
yeah Jesus pray and I was like swimming
yeah I just you know I'm not for me for
some people not for me Chelsea did it in
an episode of Chelsea does your face
this is one of the funniest faces in the
world where you just hurl one lip like
your top lip up off to the side Hall oh
look at how ugly that is all but I do
love Harry Potter but so I saw the movie
uh-huh I fell asleep I went by myself on
a self-care Saturday okay got a phantom
on iSchool movie theater and I fell
asleep at the part where Gamora goes
with vanos you see the planet I have no
idea how they found the one stone okay
and I heard it's a big yeah
big thing but then I also don't believe
I felt like what they did this movie
around was that this was all just a
setup yeah for the second movie yeah so
this is the funny thing is I talk to
someone like like winch is a huge fan
like she is a marvel like fanatic yes
she's an avid she's a stand a Stanley
stand you guys I love that word because
you're teens so she was I know also like
my dad is a big Marvel fan and stuff and
they like people were like really really
impressed by how smart this movie was
cuz yeah because it's like connecting
all the world it's connecting all the
worlds but then also the fact that
they're going to make so much money and
loved doing this where is all set up and
like it's this is one story in its own
and then there's gonna be another one
next year and they have their movie
slated out til 2025 their movies yeah
yeah that's insane to plan that far
ahead
yeah yeah I know that
whoo damn I don't know if I should say
this what what is it about no it's bull
no because it's on IMDB but Captain
Marvel is gonna be in the next one
- girl of real arson yeah everyone knows
that I don't love that why I just feel
like so I heard again Quinta told me
that it was like she was cast a couple
years ago I really like brie Larson I
just feel like there are there could
have been other non-white women yeah
look I'm tired of seeing like small
pretty blonde hair blond hair blue eyes
white women kick an ass
yeah like I'm sick I'm really tired of
it like it could have been I don't know
it could but I'm sure she's gonna do
fine or whatever but I think it plays in
the I mean like it's one of those things
where JK Rowling like you know never
specified Hermione's race and then like
when they made curse child to play they
cast the black actress and yeah everyone
was like oh my god this is revolutionary
and I was like yeah that that you had a
plot that could be applicable to any I
never liked the storytelling that is
adapted yeah and I know that the comic
books it was like the she was blonde she
is blonde and white and the comics yes
but she also look at that I think
that like look at house like and she's
like bullet bigger and stronger I just
feel like it could have been someone
else
mm-hmm you know what I mean if she kind
of looks like Robin right from house of
cards when she had really short blonde
hair I just feel like she's I don't know
like super short hair I like that yeah
so that's a bisexual bob she should have
been a bisexual we have to Bob so I
don't know I'm I'm it's not me being
like oh this woman shouldn't have had it
like by all means women go for it get on
that looks is that MRSA yeah that's
pretty large now that looks like not
like that yeah
also what the is that we're looking
at pictures so that's an Aussie our
Zilla just weird too because like I mean
she's probably gonna do a great job yeah
if she's good I don't know it's just no
it makes sense that especially in like
the times we're living in where they're
slated to have movies for 2025 it's like
you've now given a white woman a
platform for the next you know seven
years know that it was like it was cast
a while ago and all that sort of stuff
whatever but I also think like it could
have been cool for someone who hasn't
been in anything big to whose name
people don't know yeah really and who's
I mean we'll see we'll see what happens
I just I'm just we I don't know well
there's so many movies where right women
kick ass watch any lifetime I don't know
maybe we should cut this part no I think
it's applicable I just feel like there's
a Arthur there's not a lot of like other
I just think it's weird to like look it
look at a cast and be like alright we
got one of these we got one of these we
got one of these and feels like they're
trying to check off boxes yeah so I
don't know I mean we have we have Black
Widow and we have Scarlet Witch yeah I'm
not saying that we that we that that's a
cap like we have a cap on it but like
yeah it's like look at you know all of
the superhero movies that you know it
feels dated almost like a da choice yeah
did you like the movie I did like the
movie yeah yeah hmm
yeah I guess it was cool to watch all
the superheroes me and it was fun to see
that writing like how the different
genres and like tones even collided yeah
they did a good job with that but
it was long how long was it half hours
but I took about a 15-minute nap and
then I woke up and I was like ah I
feel really big like a big part yeah
like a real
yeah because then like you know I
obviously had to play catch-up once the
scenes were playing out yeah like you
know with Chris Pratt's character
obviously there's another thing that
bothers me I've been thinking about that
okay so there are a lot of like the so
like the black women in the Marvel
Universe are up like almost all in
Wakanda like our in black panther right
yeah and then Zoe Saldana's character is
painted green yeah I'm like like she's
not the sheet is not like a little
eraser she's like I'm not I'm not trying
to make something into what it's not or
anything like that and even like the
other like the Falcon and Don
Cheadle's character are both kind of
side characters to Captain America and
as suits and they're like I just feel
like you there is a huge opportunity
that was missed and I think that that's
what's like upsetting is that I think
that a lot of times people and they
throw this around a lot like we need
more diversity and it's like well sure
yes that should be the the point that we
do need more diversity but it's also
like when you think of like a strong
kick-ass person is brie Larson the first
one that comes to mind
no you know yeah give me someone who
wasn't hot in elementary school do you
think I don't know I don't know either I
just I don't know also she exudes that
like every girl you know and I feel like
like that every girl can be captain
whatever the her name is Captain
Marvel uh Larson if you're listening but
you which you're not
please come on the podcast cuz I need
help yeah come on the Vegas but yeah man
I don't know it could have been I'm just
I don't know maybe this is just like Oh
Coleman it's not like this one movie
it's just a combination of like why why
like did huge numbers this weekend it
was like there's only been a hundred and
something movies
made more money than this opening
weekend which I feel like it's also
gonna it's gonna blow it out of the
water next movie yeah yeah um what
another movie we both saw that's great I
feel pretty Amy Schumer there was a lot
of backlash leading up to the movie's
release because this I'm talking
about yeah this is this I'm talking
about Calvi
okay so just break that even she ever
released a movie about in the trailer
basically what you see is a less than
perfect looking woman who's you know
people argue only would I deal I have
people arguing like well she's still hot
and pretty she's not that big people
were saying that she hits her head and
then all of a sudden she loves herself
in this confident but she's still in
this wretched body that people were like
yeah wow what a terrible message and
they were putting this watching a
 movie do you see the
movie
I will admit I also fell asleep but you
need to get my movie because I was in
New York and they have way down seats
okay lay down movie theater seats and
where am I not gonna fall asleep for the
void I'll see the nice cool theater dark
theater so I saw most of the movie but I
will be honest I fell asleep during the
pivotal speech at the end so like the
whole point of the movie but I got it
okay I would yeah and I read articles
about it and they I know what happens
and I just want to say it is not the
movie that Twitter had attacked her for
people love to hate her and you know she
was my money movie it was funny
it was Ella I at what point jarred I
went all over my boyfriend he and he
said that I woke up and when it's just
them for laughing people for laughing
over here
but yeah I think and it comes back to
what you always talk about was like drag
culture and I think people want to do
drag Amy Schumer because she is other
than the popular opinion with a lot of
things
and we wanted to discredit her for all
the amazing work that she has
done and I'm not just talking about her
movie work and her her sketch work but
just stuff with like gun reform and
women's issues in a hole just
because they interpreted the movie to be
away that it wasn't even that it wasn't
if she told her story to be quite honest
it's true she got up like at one point
she's on a date and she gets up on stage
to enter that's in the commercial or
like the trailer to that she gets up on
stage and competes in a bikini kind wet
shirt well it's not even a wet t-shirt
cause she just makes a makeshift bikini
out of her actual clothing and she gets
up on stage and everyone's sort of like
yeah what cuz it's normal
it really is normal for women to not be
that confident and we feel like you have
to look a certain way to be that
confident and they never said in the
movie what she saw herself at actly and
she said it in the in the Oprah she was
on Oprah's podcast yeah it was all
interview which oh yeah god everyone
please go so you guys tell me you know
more than Oprah yeah please Oprah liked
the movie yeah like loved them yeah yeah
and yeah she Amy said on Oprah's podcast
she was like they don't know what I was
looking at and to be honest I saw myself
yeah like she was thrilled to be
portraying herself as that confident
woman have you ever looked at like a
picture of yourself when it's taken and
you're like if you're feeling kind of
bad you're like oh this picture is
awful this is such a bad picture of me
even if you don't delete it or get rid
of it or whatever and then a couple of
years you could look back and be like
what the was I so yea upset about
yeah I looked good why was I so mean to
myself because you it really is the
perspective you would think that you
look different they did there's some in
a magazine a couple years ago about a
woman who took a picture of herself
every single day oh yeah a certain days
where she felt like fat or she fell ugly
or she felt like whatever and she looked
the same and every single one so
it really is about how you see yourself
exactly but I do think that
is a very real world that is sort of
pushing women to feel like they
shouldn't look a certain way
whether it's like body type or just any
way that you look on the outside and
that's sort of like celebrates a
traditional cookie cutter type of mold
and it's literally to sell products yeah
it's to sell it's why we haven't done
like a workout thing on here like I was
even a little skeptical about Fit fab
fun know for a second so it has fit in
it yeah and I don't like that I don't
like that like coz yeah be healthy or
whatever but like that's the thing is
like we we the thing people were also
attacking her for was like well she's
not even that big and it's like what
does that have to do with the
message of the movie that's the point if
it's gonna be funny that someone big
likes themselves that's not even funny
yeah you know what I mean it's the fact
that the funny thing was the fact that
we it was actually like a turning around
on everybody in being like we don't look
at people like that we it made more
sense for her to be shy and reserved and
if you like I don't belong here yeah I'm
sorry to even be around you beautiful
people so her being extra confident was
like it was like a refreshing yeah thing
and that's not even where the jokes are
the jokes are from like
misunderstandings and they're just
really good there's a little part where
she she's that killed me where
she's in the beginning where she falls
off the fight and hits her head but then
she gets up and they were like are you
okay she's got found if I don't find a
fighter fight she walks into the or
she's leaving goods when her pants split
right yeah and I think that's what it
was and then the guy in front of her go
like off to the side of her goes to the
hot girl in front of her are you okay
and it's the funniest part cuz
it's like those are jokes through the
whole thing but the point is is that
when you do see your it a lot of it is
how you present yourself and it was also
to like like I'm not attacking
the women who were tagging Amy Schumer
but it also looks like clearly those
women had some negative to say
about a be sure his body or like her
looks was alleyway we wanted to kind of
I mean we didn't like right dad but we
wanted to touch on Michele Walsh the
White House correspondent speech yeah
the same way that like people were then
attacking Michelle wolf over something
she wasn't even like saying about saris
Huckabee Sanders his body and she even
tweeted it out being like hey I didn't
attack anything about her weight but it
obviously seems like you has something
to say about her weight okay hey what
kind of piece of shirt is like she's not
even like it doesn't make sense because
she's not bad enough for this to be
funny oh so you don't like sad people is
that what you're saying Twitter you know
well you anyway and then also just
so that's like what bothered me about
the idea of like that she was even it
would be great to live in a world where
this movie would it would people would
be like what what do you have there
there's no there's nothing there but
there is something there there's
something there even by the backlash she
got from it and this was a movie to that
like I think everyone can enjoy I know
that Amy had talked about they rented
out of the theater for a bunch of
teenage girls to see the movie and they
had a talk afterwards and she felt like
it was one of the most impactful things
of her life that she'd ever done because
she was speaking to young women and that
was like her goal with this but I saw so
many dudes in that theater and they were
laughing and it wasn't you know this
like Pro women like feminist missing
 funny Muhammed II and then I
wanted to bring up I forgot to tell you
I watched it on Sunday with Jared was
another great movie that's on Netflix
called I'm not an easy man and it's
actually a French film
so there's subtitles but it is so funny
is about a guy who's like you know
kind of this stereotypical like
misogynist Pig who like you know spends
all day jeering at women and being you
know typical asshole and he hits his
head on a pole and wakes up where
everything is reversed so women run
everything women wear you know the suits
down to everything we're like they don't
shave their legs literally everything is
reversed so he has to learn how to fit
in a woman's world where like he has to
shave his legs and wear shorts sure and
he's the assistant to all these high
powerful women yeah and it's so funny
and they took everything so literally
and like that to me was an incredible as
soon as the movie was over Jared goes
and he's a pretty liberal feminist dude
yeah he goes whoa so that's what it's
like and I was kidding me Oh
every day like yeah telling you stories
isn't enough but it put it through the
lens of like Oh straight I think the guy
was white a powerful man that I was like
what a good recommendation for people to
watch with their right either you know
friends significant others husbands
whatever because at the end it provided
so much conversation and also it was
funny yeah I think it was so wild yeah
imagine this guy in a woman's world that
it was so funny but yes so outrageously
backwards yeah as much as it hurt me
watching it cuz I was like oh I wasn't
for sure like yeah even the women dried
the sports cars and that that I liked it
was so wildly opposite that it was a lol
comedy and it's weird the people kind of
get mad at the idea of something
changing and being like oh you're
pushing this feminist agenda it's like a
duck yeah of course I'm pushing the
feminist agenda oh oh that was the best
part was there was a part in the French
film where the guys band together to
form a small men
group where they go to the streets yeah
and they they they protest yeah about
how they aren't given the same
opportunities and they wear like fake
like plastic breasts in the end you know
they act ridiculous cuz that's how the
women are acting and then when you know
spoiler the world does reverse back you
see this big movement of women wearing
like the power hats and Trump yeah
signs and stuff and and it was kind of
getting in trouble yeah like like just
so standard women's March yeah and
you're like oh imagine if it was
the other way around because people are
like what do we need to March for women
for just like gender as a whole and like
that's that brings up a really good
point to the fact that like I think a
lot of times people think that just
because something is Pro something it
doesn't mean that it's anti to something
else so like even kind of going back to
because God forbid I have a
controversial opinion but going back to
like the Captain Marvel thing just
because I would like to see someone else
doesn't mean I'm not happy then yeah
real arsons working doesn't mean I'm not
happy that it's worth thrill about what
women are there and I think it's
important to be like and it doesn't mean
that I have to hate it doesn't mean that
you just really don't like something
you're like ah could've been better
doesn't mean you hate yeah what it is I
don't mean that at all but I feel like
you know maybe like look where we could
have improved yeah exactly and we've
done something isn't different and it
especially feels like well let's break
it in by giving a white woman the role
first and then we can break into women
of color it's like it's not dangerous to
give a white woman a role it's not like
revolutionary and it feels like it's
also like it's it feels yeah it's not
rebel but the thing is is it kind of is
another
he says like it yeah like was late night
right it was like oh let's give like
Samantha B she's a white woman a
platform and then we can take a risk
yeah and women of color perhaps or like
I don't know it's another example
like that means I guess that shows the
problem is that there's not actually
that many Shai exactly or like Michelle
wolf right yeah Michelle wolf is now
getting her own late night show and like
that awesome but like where are
the women of colors late night shows
yeah they don't exist in America right
and I think that yeah I mean there's
just there's so many Jimi's literally
like I don't hate them it's not it's
nothing like I watch it I watch them
it's entertained by it yeah it's not
saying that oh I'm stupid and so let's
 never see it again it's just
like oh god ah another you know it's
like if you know you love pasta
all right well pop but if you went to a
7-3 no problem but if you went to like a
seven-course meal and all of it was pot
that you'd be like pasta that's too much
pot so one really good pasta every now
and then okay lights yeah
it's just I don't know balance is I
guess the gate more pasta is eat more
pasta of give women of color or more
platforms a chance who as we say has two
white girls who don't really know
anything no um I think it's a bad thing
to say though no yeah I think it's
important to say yes in their sectional
yeah for the sake of being in a
sectional uh we have a fun game to end
on we figured well because Kate is so
good at giving advice to fans and we
usually answer fan question and Kate's
advice is always so much better than
mine that it's true uh ask anyone that
we would give our favorite email subject
headers from fan questions and just give
a quick we don't have kids are much
longer so let's just give a quick one
one or two words about what you think
about the headline okay
okay so sorry I listen to the fans floor
I'm getting like a super deep dive by
day yeah yeah beggars can't be choosers
Aaron says her subject line is Hermione
Granger and the diagnosis of fake herpes
boom thoughts thoughts I loved Hermione
Granger not as not a fan of herpes or
fake herpes or fake herpes could be an
ingrown hair yep
Bailey's headliner is guy knows sneezes
on my vagina and ultrasound tech inserts
wand in my asshole
find a new doctor next Siri says
sometimes I just want a quickie you know
I hear you girl do it Kyle says y'all
ready for the gay always Kyle next
Shauna says sensitive girl who loves
beer in your podcast hey buddy
crack one open for us yes says heard my
friend masturbating hey don't knock it
you know it's at a two-year if I'm
masturbating yeah I mean if they're
right in front of you masturbating
that's a different story if you heard
the masturbating and you would like to
not hear them again close your ears Oh
actually Harris whittles had a really
funny joke about masturbating in college
what that like him and his friend had
this same if you look it up you could
see the good joke of I'm just gonna get
hurry yeah but it's like him it is
basically it's just that when you have
the same schedule as someone you share a
room you have to make sure that they're
asleep so you have to keep checking on
them to make sure that they're asleep
because that's when you could masturbate
so essentially you end up just
masturbating to your roommate so we
basically said in all caps I got
called out for pooping at uni uni as
University in British speak so tell that
one person who called you out who never
poops maybe give them a little DVD of
what it means to poop or that little
book everybody poops there you go even
the queen poop so it just makes me laugh
when you just think if I'm like
squeezing out one gosh is there like oh
that's a relatable
okay think of someone that you're like
really intimidated by
just look there perfect dude it yeah
just doing this didn't do really well
but I was a crappy well what it just
said lol Beyonce poops lol yeah just
think about Beyonce the Beyonce pooping
I know they got his last one Claire said
everyone has thought at one point did I
get no oh is it time just a clean break
all these about poop Claire says pooped
and a helicopter landed next to me I
want to know more about that one we
better to open that why let's just open
that let's open it um let's see pooped
in a helicopter landed Xtreme Hey ladies
this week's ask me made me go oh I've
got to share the helicopter poop story
I'll find a story made me go oh I gotta
share the elephant so we were at the
Colorado River during the summer at a
sandbar I was about eight and realized
that I had to poop the problem with the
sandbar is that the only bathroom near
so across the river which means you'd
have to load up the boat push it out
blah blah blah basically I needed to
poop now so we need to find a spot this
is in the middle of summer so there were
a ton of people there we walked up a
little hill mom dug me a hole and I
squatted so pissed that I had to poop in
a hole so I'm halfway through
dump in the load and I hear a noise all
the sand around me starts why I'm
shaking as my poop cute strong big and
we look around to see what the is
that fly over me and all the people at
the sandbar climb up to my poop spot to
see it and ended up landing right next
to me I was crying my little eyes out
and I picked off the last nugget and ran
to the water to white so that's my poop
story hope you enjoyed Claire that's so
funny to think about cuz you're eight
it's not like you're 15 and can feel the
embarrassment you're just mortified as
an eight-year-old it's just it's too
much
pooping is hard enough when you're eight
you're like why is my body
fighting the thing that watched you do
did I ever tell you story about me being
terrified of automatic flushing toilets
you know quick story loving area very
young like maybe even younger than eight
went to Hawaii with my fam
I had to poop so bad and so I went to
the bathroom and the noise is with both
toilets were already going and it was
scaring me and so my mom took me into
the stall and I sat down and then all of
a sudden it started flushing and I
started hysterically crying but my mom
was like you know over 12 hours of
travel was just like Jeff oh yeah and so
I was screaming pooping trying to get
off the toilet and she literally like
had to scoop me by my knees and I was
holding her shoulders and I was hovering
over and she was holding me like this
over the toilet and I was screaming
crying just into this ottoman
and the toilet was watching because I
was terrified that these dudes yeah
that's the story
everyone's got poop stuff I didn't poop
for three days when I was at Bonnaroo oh
my god and then I took a cold shower or
took a hot shower no it doesn't matter I
took a shower I smoked a cigarette I got
a coffee and oh I had an ex wrestle
blown bowel attack we're at Bonnaroo I
had to go into the porta-potties that
well and it was 96 degrees so I was like
dying oh no I did body check someone out
of the way I kept running back and forth
between camp at the toilet and I finally
come back and I was like my butthole is
a fire kiss somebody roll me a joy
please they did it that I just sort of
laid down in the middle and I was like
ah you feel sick being a Bonnaroo I
guess we're not going well they never
they weren't gonna pay for our flight
