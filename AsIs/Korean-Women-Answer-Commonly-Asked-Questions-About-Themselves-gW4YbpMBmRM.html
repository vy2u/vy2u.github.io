now today we're gonna be answering
questions about Korean woman I graduated
high school from Korea and I came to
America and I was getting into college
so out of 10 I think I am 7 out of 10 no
I hurry inside of me I have something
I'm writing I was born in Korea but I
moved to America when I was 12 I can
still speak Korean fluently I did the
most growing up in America what do you
think I am three point five three point
eight I was actually born in the States
but then I lived in Korea for a while
and then I came back sometimes I think
in Korean and then sometimes I think in
English and it gets all like mumbles and
pull cell smack down the middle like
five yeah
if you see this one type of person and
that person is very like then they tend
to be a but then sometimes it doesn't
fall kiss me I'm I'm an a no one thinks
I'm an A everyone thinks I'm like B or
like oh where you get along with other
people more or like you say what you
want to say all the time but then I
guess and inside like when I get home
I'm like I know I I feel like it's like
so similar to horoscope it's not always
right right so that's how I see like but
I think I believe is it still yeah I am
oh and other people guess it pretty much
correct a lot of you're like oh yeah
yeah people say that but I wouldn't
think you're a yeah no one thinks I'm I
mean these are really quiet and really
insensitive what blood type are they
think yes B or o hello when I was in
Korea I used to be a big thing like what
blood type are you and then when I came
to America no one cared
I definitely feel pressured to be skinny
growing up in Korea your appearance is
really important it's so stressful for
girls in Korea to be like Luke certain
way they still feel like you should you
have to be skinny not skinny skinny but
healthy skinny now I don't care I mean
like I like work out and eat whatever I
want I went to elementary school in
Korea and we had this thing among the
girls like who was the skinniest in our
class and like me and this other girl
were the two skinniest and we would
compete like who else came here and
and whenever with like a waiting thing
and if she was like skinnier than me I
was like oh my god I need to like it has
to be number one and in this elementary
school it is like you know it's not
healthy in Korea you always like every
year or like certain days like they way
you yeah and then like oh but before
that day we wouldn't like it too much
and then we would take off like all the
clothes that that'll like add more
weight Korean Korean guys guys would be
like looking at girls like oh my gosh
tell me yeah doesn't mean and there is
this phrase girl shootin weighed more
than 50 kilogram yeah that's ridiculous
I 110 this high if you like if you're
taller that's like impossible it's best
to just love
over-exaggerated right sure yeah over
excess like we don't like go like this
and be like I wanna I want them to
totally over-exaggerated and like when
you kiss like no slow-mo
Korean dramas is always like the poor
girl like working at a cafe or something
and then like spill something over a guy
happens to be the richest person like in
Korea and then he buys her everything
when most people watch Korean dramas I
think it's becoming so popular because
they're like oh my god that's like a
life I can't have like winning the
lottery so I love dramas nowadays I got
shocked because whenever I go to Korea
elementary school kids they wear so much
makeup a lemon yeah let me just I
thought you weren't a lot they still do
it anyways really yeah back then like
eyeliner or anything if you just do like
curl your eyelashes it makes you look so
much prettier so back then like when you
when you're like walking in at the
entrance like the teacher would be like
holding us thick and like standing there
and be like hey what is that what is
that on your face or like pick it off
and then if you dye your hair they're
like no they like make you cut your hair
like really sure you can't have it long
but for sheree middle school kids they
start putting makeup a lot of makeup
actually in Korea
standard is kind of high I feel like
when I go to Korea like my skin is so
bad but all these Korean girls walking
around the language
it's like glowy skin carry Korea it's
like so much cheaper but here it's more
expensive so you can't really go as
often and you know American people don't
usually like even high schoolers or
college students or unless they're not
like oh I can I go get skin care but
come people are like gotta go this week
next week got a Coke I heard like
American skincare products and Korea
skincare products it's so much cheaper
in Korea but their ingredients are so
much better yeah yeah that's what I
heard I believe that yeah and like in
America if you say you're going to get
like a skin care thing that is a luxury
it's not like a everyday thing
wait is that a Korean thing I have it in
my blood so I have a German boyfriend
but I make him hold my butt yeah Matt
he's used to it now I actually don't
like guys holding my prices it's I want
to hold my own person looks weird
it doesn't weird but sometimes it's like
heavy sometimes like when I'm walking
with my boys awesome day and I have my
picture and they're like it boss but
we're like walking like this and then
it'll slightly over you know like let go
we have to carry bare stuff well usually
true I put his wallet his keys like
every day like come out of the house
yeah exactly
card so
for me I think forever function D Oh oh
my god see I only know the old k-pop
groups because that's when I was in
Korea so I like to munching gee I like
Super Junior it's because we are shorter
than what we are shorter than Western
people if you have small face it makes
you look taller if you have very light
proportionate yes all the Korean like
fashion stuff is like made so small so
even like hats these days they actually
make it bigger because we have big house
they name it like smaller looking head
heads like something like that all to
make your face look smaller because like
if you wear a bigger hats it makes your
face smaller yeah they make it that way
it makes your life better and happier I
think I would say too bit but don't
overdo it as long as you can kind of
like still look natural it's kind of
like getting bracelets like you're
changing things to look like better
I don't consider like Botox or like
laser treatments lots of surgery cuz
it's like that's just improving your
skin and stuff if it makes them like
feel happier about their life I'm
totally okay with it we definitely came
to the point where we all agree that the
Korean beauty center it's way too high
they want to know about these kind of
things because you know beauty products
even like kpop and all these stuff are
becoming so popular what like worldwide
people are more like where is this all
coming from and you know like that's why
they're more curious about these kind of
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
