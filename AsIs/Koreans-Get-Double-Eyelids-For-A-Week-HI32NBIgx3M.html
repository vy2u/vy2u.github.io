really complicated relationship with my
eyes I would say around 70 percent of
the time I'm like completely fine with
my eyes but the other times I feel like
I do feel the pressure of wanting double
eyelids when I was growing up I lived in
Korea for about three years and during
that time double eyelid surgery was all
the rage some people even suggested that
I then I try it like you know I I get it
as a gift for my birthday or something
even when I do makeup I don't even think
about it but instinctively try to fake a
crease whatever work you do on top of
your eyelids it just disappears as soon
as you open your eyes I used so much
eyeliner to make up for that lost gap
for one week we're gonna physically give
ourselves double eyelids using either
glue or tape you know what I'm just
gonna go for it I'm gonna see what
happens
oh okay okay so the glue comes up
alright I'm just gonna grab one so Oh
what the heck my eyelashes are caught in
the glue oh oh the things we do for
beauty my eyes do look a little bigger
the right eye is still intact which
gives me hope having a pair of scissors
so close to my eyes is a little bit
nerve-wracking okay I guess that worked
my eyes are very sticky it does make my
eyes look significantly bigger which is
kind of discouraging I kind of don't
look like myself I'm looking forward to
being surprised at how it affects my
life I kind of do like it one eyelid is
more visible than the other
so this is my sixth attempt it's 7:30 in
the morning I'm not having it nobody
should ever go to work late because they
were putting on an extra set of eyelids
I've attempted this like five times and
it's not sticking so I guess the first
few days was miserable because I was
still trying to figure out how to put
those on my eyes as I was trying to redo
this eye because it was uneven I cut a
little bit of the inner corner of my eye
but I guess that's fine because beauty
is pain so you can tell that your eyes
look bigger but it's not necessarily
like a better look nobody noticed
not a single person without me
mentioning it notice No do we make up I
thought it would actually be easier with
double eyelids but I just found it
incredibly difficult so I've learned how
to do my makeup based on the fact that I
have monolids I don't know it just
doesn't look right let it be said that
I've given up on putting my makeup on
altogether because it's just nice to
look like my eye is just like a little
bit bigger like a like the snapchat
filter no matter how many layers of glue
I put on it's still kind of unravels so
that's great
I'm so glad this week is over that was a
lot of work I thought I would come out
this week
wanting double eyelids more nothing
really changed nobody noticed
I stopped noticing the differences after
a while trends change all the time
I plucked all of my eyebrows when I was
young because I thought thin eyebrows
were like the coolest thing ever so
maybe there's something learn from that
I love my whole life wanting double
eyelids
it's not really a big deal it didn't
really make my life better it just made
it different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
