versus Kylie cosmetics can we put it on
and know exactly what's on our lives and
I say yes team colour-pop team Kylie
team Kylie team undecided team Caulerpa
team colour-pop but only because I
haven't tried team Kylie's I feel a
difference when I put them on I really
do wonder if I'll be able to tell the
difference I've heard that they're the
same formula on my lips I will know if
color cop is on there all right let's do
this
hold on what wait we can't smell them
color public has a distinct smell like
no I'm not gonna I'm still confident we
kind of thought more like the Kardashian
Kylie
I already know that this is Kylie
actually right off bat can you tell
ah
that's kind of silky when you rub your
lips together this is hard I might be
switching my answer to this is color
pump because color pop always looks
really purple on me I feel like this is
color pop it feels more liquid I think I
have this color
I think it's beeper did it dry really
quickly yeah I think this is our I feel
like that's color pop because this would
does it have the pigmentation that color
pop typically has but it does feel
smoother I think this one is Kylie
because it feels very different than
color pop color pop it feel is thicker I
was weird color pop earlier this morning
and if you have it for a while it starts
to get a little sticky when you're first
putting it on Exodus let's starting to
get a little sticky this is color pop I
think this is color pop because it's so
purpley haha oh wow this is candy cane
I'm gonna say color pop for this I was
definitely gonna say Kylie for this one
screw Brad K this is Carly so you got
amazing this oh yes I believe that this
is Kylie's lip stuff I think I have
color pow
we were right honestly I'm kind of like
this better than this is quite a creepy
formula
oh I feel like they do Kylie also this
color is really pretty I'm gonna lie I
think I have Kylie again cuz I feel like
I can always get one solid sleep with
color pop with this one I have to go
over it a few times so try I think I got
color Papa gab just let me color pop I
just feels a little bit more like crispy
yeah that guy of Carly by just feels a
little bit like lighter place told me
it's Kylie are we busted Kylie Kylie
well one of us will be right
oh I buy this color I really dig it it's
great I do and it's a great dupe yeah
it's not as thick this color pop
typically is Kylie color pop oh I'm
right I'm right right we're great at
this game
Zelda yeah what does this say about us
wow it's so hard to tell the difference
they are really similar I think this
might be color pop though just because I
can already feel my lips like chapping I
have Kylie we guessed right we're
geniuses my confidence in myself is
lower than when I started I thought I
knew my not having my sense of
smell was definitely the most difficult
part kind of banking on that but like I
mean we still guessed it without it oh
it's fine
it's I think it was really nice
especially because I've always heard
people are like oh color pop and Kylie
they're from the same company and so
we're basically just paying for Kylie's
name but you are actually paying for a
higher quality lipstick just in terms of
how they felt on I was like this is very
significantly different color pop so I
wished I was surprised that it was easy
fill team color pop yeah just can't beat
that I can get like 20 lipsticks hashtag
team Kylie
hashtag undeclared team color pop color
pop looks purple on me Kylie's looks
like different colors that's what I'm
into this is super fun like people
should try this themselves and like see
if they can guess the difference yeah
whatever you want
yeah your lips will still be Baba's
that's what should really matter at the
end of the day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
