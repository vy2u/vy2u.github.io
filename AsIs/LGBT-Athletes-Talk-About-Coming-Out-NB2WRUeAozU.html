gateway to my queerness
in high school it was dating guys going
to prom with my boyfriend but I was
definitely I would say in the closet in
college like when I did start like you
know dating and talking to guys then I
had to like hi a lot of closeted gay men
we could tell you this that they're not
total in touch with all their emotions
when they're afraid to to really touch
base with those feelings I had to be
really close with someone for me to talk
about like who I am and my background
that was having a lot of gender
dysphoria I felt that I needed to
identify as a woman basically in order
to be able to compete in my sport I've
heard homophobic things my whole life
and lock groups I remember being on a
long training run and my coach telling a
couple of gay jokes I would walk by my
coach's office okay this is the day that
I'm gonna go in there and try to just
tell her what was on my mind it's hard
to have a relationship that you feel
comfortable with when you obviously are
hiding something
I came out after showing who I wasn't an
athlete my teammate were welcoming and
they they were essentially my second
family I did confide in some of my best
friends on the team and they told me oh
we already knew things I've heard from
guys that were just the most ridiculous
insane you know ignorant things were the
same guys that showed me so much love
and compassion and word reassuring me to
stay in the sport all these years I had
separated these two things my sexual
orientation sports in my head the team I
trained with now and wart day is super
supportive I never have to explain
anything about my transition to them now
I'm in the locker room I don't hear any
of that stuff and we discuss you know
it's called marriage equality and
obviously what's been passed we just
talk about it casually Oh what are you
doing tonight or are you dating anyone
and all that no I'm not a gay athlete
I'm nothing and no one stream you
differently we want the same fair fair
shot definitely get involved Sports from
my experience people are very accepting
I don't know if I would have come to the
same awareness or same comfort in my own
body if I hadn't been through sports if
you're struggling with your sexual
orientation in sports there are so many
people to talk to actually talk to talk
to your coach give the ghost a chance to
do the right thing
observe your surrounding and see if that
community is the right community for you
to come out and I never to tell one like
a person that they should come out and
not come out but definitely find someone
you can speak to if there's never a
right time to come out people say oh I
shoulda came out in college in order to
publicly come out to be whole in your
life but whether you start to tell
people and it builds confidence if there
is a sense of fear then that implies
that there is something wrong I'm the
only out soccer player I think the world
so it's kind of weird and I think when
we remove it as being something that's
something that's considered brave then
we remove the danger from it and I think
the fact that some people are still very
fearful of coming out and might not be
in a great environment that that implies
that there's still a long way to go
