the world I'm hoping that it's done like
in a very elegant and beautiful way my
only concern is that they're gonna tell
the story in a way that doesn't really
reflect what actually happened but you
know it's Hollywood things are you know
exaggerated this is great so far women
separation who are here Obama speaking
that's interesting mm-hmm gay is good
that's cool that's a very powerful intro
New York City looks good
big-budget this is really cool I like
the fashion I like the music so far cops
looking scary it's really graphic oh my
god unfortunately I don't think it's far
from the truth of what happened back
then though it's hard not to watch a
trailer like that and be somewhat moved
and also to be very affected by people
shouting the f-word and hitting people I
was good chills and I think about like
what they had to go through and like I
don't even have the balls to like
jaywalk let alone throw a brick at
somebody okay okay hold on I got to stop
there there's images of this main
character who from what I know is a
fictional character throwing like the
first brick and that's not true at all
where's silver Vera where's miss major
where's Marsha Johnson where all the
butch lesbians and the Queens and the
people of color oh cool a white guy
blond-haired square-jawed seemingly
blue-eyed hero so sad to say but I feel
like more people are going to watch it
because it's a white guy this is Dee
centering the people who were actually
at the center about this very riot in
general when we learn about our past we
learn it through a very like white male
says you know perspective the white man
wasn't the hero of stonewall
I'm sorry they could have shown a lot
more people of color and that that would
have made it more relatable for for me
personally so I hope that that was just
a glimmer of what you know is actually
in the film I'm excited to see it I know
a lot of people want to boycott it a lot
of people are really upset by it but you
can't really judge a book by its cover
