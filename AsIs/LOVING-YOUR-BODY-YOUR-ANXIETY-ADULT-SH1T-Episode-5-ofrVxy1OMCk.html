nut screw thing one of those things
called with the thing with the the
oh okay wait but so it's dick shaped
white house but it doesn't the whole
thing doesn't vibrate it's just it's a

so be so bad for November over for 20
 three days and Kate how many
days have you made so my friend I've
been sober since Wednesday so many
people called it out on my Instagram
stories where I
instagrammed Kate out of dinner we were
out last week and Kate literally goes
I'm drunk everyone started messaging me
like wow I guess whenever those gate
here's what happens
I haven't what happy fall when I was
going to do it with you because I wanted
to save money and then I had a lot of
opportunities to drink for free mmm no I
did that you drink because you have a
lot of free alcohol and what are you
gonna do say no right yeah that's that's
that's what that was also today's topic
is in fact mental health yeah so by the
way many trigger oh my god yeah maybe if
you're triggered easily this is not this
is not the podcast for you Andy this is
for sure not the episode if you're
looking for a pick-me-up in terms of
just comedy on this Thanksgiving morn
this is not it however if you're looking
for people to be like oh I'm not
the craziest person in the world boom
we're here for you are here for you baby
what are you doing today on Thanksgiving
I am at a friend's house having a
friendsgiving that is what I'm doing
right now how about you I am in Missouri
wait you're going to Missouri
yeah or misery as they call it oh yeah
my whole family is there and this is the
part where I carefully try to say that
my family isn't garbage and that
they're good people and that family is
important and not everyone is a bad
person and I'm promised Lee if I was
gonna drink today would be the day that
I'm drunk but your past that was my I
did give myself one pass but I think I'm
gonna actually try not to drink okay
here's the thing is people on the
internet want to call me an alcoholic
but this has been the easiest 23 days of
my life I've had no problems doing that
alcohol I've had no problem going to
places I haven't had sober sex yet but I
have hooked up quite a few times yes
there's still a couple days left so
we'll see what happens hmm I
think I'm going to and I make no
guarantees
but I think I'm going to lay off
drinking for a little bit only because
she's laughing at me you i dude I
 love you and I would never I
would never excuse me I would never
 on your tries to it's just better
your same medicine I just I've heard you
say this six times this month yes every
time I wake up hungover I'm like that's
it this is it but I'm like uber and I'm
not hungover right now yeah but you you
always anyways I I'm glad that you're
thinking about your medication because
you really shouldn't the first time
you're taking mood stabilizers you
really should give them a chance to
stabilize your mood yeah until I figure
out so my whole thing is I just want you
I'm not going to stop drinking forever I
don't believe but I do want to figure
out how to like onto the topic of mental
health I do want to figure out how to
say the things I want to say in my sober
life so that they don't come flying out
in my drunk life you know what they say
a sober man's words no over man's a
drunk man's words are sober man's
thoughts that's just normal it's just
like ah I'm just gonna tell you
what I really think but not always
sometimes I just say how is
therapy going fine I think I get I get
really tied to the fact where I'm like
oh I think that like I want perfection
if I have any sort of like slip up or
anything like that like I'm a bad person
hmm you are so flame oh my god okay
constant yeah I don't want to tell you
what's wrong with you
but as your friend I see this pattern in
you and we're all guilty of it but hey
no pun intended anything ever happens
bad you go to yourself first yeah like
you kind of go like how did I this
up where did I go wrong
rather than being like oh wow I should
look at the situation as a whole and I
don't know I wish you were nicer to
yourself yeah thank you it's really hard
when you have a friend with mental
health issues and I mean both of us have
mental illness everyone yeah I would
agree has you know like I see a lot of
thing I project a lot of things onto you
and I also see a lot of the things that
I went through like when I first started
on medication and first started going to
care
that you're going through and so my
initial reaction is to like help in my
version of helping is by like telling
and teaching I don't do a lot of like
sitting back and listening because I do
feel like I someone who's been in and
out of the health care system for mental
illness for the last ten plus years so
ultimately underlying messages I want to
tell you how much better it does get
yeah and how much I hate it when
people say that because you just want to
shake them and smack them and go like
bitch you have no idea what I'm going
through but like my way of helping out
is to always just like share my
experience with you and I don't think
that that's always like the healthiest
thing to do and to like you also have
you're going through different stuff
like you're a different age than and
when I was going through it you
different circumstances different life
things I mean it does help it's also a
nice thing to have something be free of
judgement I think that's like that's
kind of been a harder thing in getting
better or like trying to get better is
that I've sort of created this
personality for myself started at a very
young age which was if there's any
tension or any sort of unease in the
room or in a situation I'll take it all
on to make everyone feel better and be
like yeah but you might be upset but
look at me I'm a stupid idiot you know
and then it makes other people feel
better it makes people laugh and then
I'll go home and go to my room and just
be alone and then just like really
retreat it's just sacrifice and then
retreat and it worked as like a survival
tactic when I was like younger and I'm
realizing that when I retreat I don't
retreat home to a I retreat home alone I
retreat oh could like fully away from
you everyone so I think that's what's
been kind of hard is that all of these
things that protected me are now the
things that are keeping me alone yeah
and don't get me wrong like there
definitely is comfort in being alone
sometimes like sometimes you do need to
get away from everyone in all the
triggers that are happening on
Twitter and in the news the media and to
your friends even like I know sometimes
if the group chat is going off about
something and it gives me anxiety I'll
just like step away for a little bang
there's a difference between struggling
and then going home and feeling like you
are fundamentally broken and up
and that this is not a thing that you
can talk to your friend it's not just
like oh I had a fight with you know my
friend or my lover or we're gonna my
the only word I give you they don't like
a gender or whatever I ate with my lover
and ice going over it's really hard to
go home and be like wow trigger warning
be like I don't want to be alive right
now and I know those feelings like I for
sure I was never I never fully attempted
with an intent of killing myself but I
definitely would have ideologies of just
wanting to not be here right now and not
feel the anxiety or the discussion oh
yeah and so I would sleep for like 16
hours a day and then the time that I was
awake I was drinking and then going back
to sleep and I lost like an assload of
weight I was on a million different
pills I mean I talked about this a lot
on BuzzFeed and iíve done a couple
videos about it if you really want to go
like in depth of the amounts of
medication but over the last 10 years
I've probably been on thirty different
medications and seen now I don't
even know like ten different therapists
and tried a million different things and
it really was only the past year I would
say that I've fully feel like I'm out of
the worst of it and I can never see
myself going back like I have armored
myself with tools and techniques over
the past 10 years that I don't ever see
myself dropping back down to like the
lowest of my lows and man now I see why
people say you're 20s are like
your hardest your most selfish man well
you could not pay me to redo year 21
through 24 I think like not a
billion dollars would make me go redo
that it's a lot of those
classic things like meditating and
breathing exercises and doing the work
and going to therapy but like I can see
sometimes the thick of it that you're
going through and part of me wants to
just like drive to your apartment and go
pick you up and be like let me get you
out of the house but I know that you
need to go through like figuring out
what works for you because what works
for me isn't gonna work for you yeah I
mean I think that I got very used to
taking everyone like I said before
taking everyone else's stuff and putting
it on me and when I take all of the
blame and I don't really say what I'm
actually feeling because I never put
my needs first look I harbored that in
it festers and stuff and then I start to
believe that I am this like terrible
person who does these terrible things
and whatnot and then I then because of
that this is how it sort of ties into my
eating disorder it's like the only thing
I can control like you could only ask
for the things that you want if you look
a certain way and your needs only matter
if you look this certain way interesting
what do you mean by like look a certain
way um like thinner and so like you
don't deserve help because you don't
think you're thin yeah Wow
that's how it's like okay so I don't
know that is like a voice that I've
never gone through I mean I definitely
have a weird relationship with food and
so like yeah but what you're saying is
something that I've never thought yeah
it's a terrible pattern to be in and
it's really hard to like okay for
example I talked about someone a couple
of podcasts ago I felt bad for not
giving him a heads up that he was gonna
be mentioned on the podcast a little
bird told me that maybe he had heard it
and maybe he was mad and then I know
they do listen guys but he did it so
when I called him and I was like hey man
did you listen he was like no I
didn't tell ya I kind of had to tell
this person that I like had a crush on
them and stuff would you like sucks
it wasn't mean it was super nice it was
very like caring and thoughtful or
whatever but it was just not what I
wanted to hear Mac and so immediately
upon like hanging up the phone and
getting home I was just like it's
because I'm disgusting it's because I if
you like me as a person then the only
reason you wouldn't want to date me is
because of how I look and then because
of that I drank a whole lot the next
night and then my eating has been kind
of like out of whack I've been eating
disorder which is like I like to joke
about it because it makes me feel better
saying it's like the lamest super which
is it fair or healthy or whatever but
it's just when I feel like out of
control sometimes this like disorder is
so powerful that it'll put you in a
place where you into situations with
certain people even that feed off of
that it's a nice thing to have someone
who's just like yeah let me put
everything else aside and then that's
become my personality
people who have had something similar
had mental health issues that are within
the same vein that are able to recognize
it in me and not see it as oh that's my
personality but you also doing it to
become thing where become something
where it's your only identity right yeah
yeah and I want to be able to start like
asking for things when I need it and
just be like I'm uncomfortable with this
or I don't like this or that identifying
my own needs and whatnot and I think
that that truly does tie into coming
believe it or not no it totally does I
don't think I'd which is crazy but you
don't deserve become oh my god I didn't
even if I if I'm at a restaurant this is
how up that's eating if I'm at a
restaurant and remember when we were out
with your mom her mom took us out her
mom's amazing amazing guys we'll meet
her over the holiday podcast yeah so she
took us out and I was like I said one
thing I was like oh that looks good I
think I'm gonna get this other thing
yeah and she was like what she was a
gift at what she was like so many
lectures I get it treat yourself or
whatever and I know my mom would do the
same thing it's just that in my head
it's this terrible disorder that's just
like that's what you want but you're not
gonna have it settle for something that
you don't want because you can't deserve
it if you eat that you will gain 500
pounds and that to me has always been
synonymous with being unlovable so I
keep eating and keep taking all this
stuff on and keep these habits because
that's the voice that's in my head tying
that back to you talking about talking
to this guy and having to like confess
he had a crush on him I said something
once in the the video if you guys want
to check out just so you can get my
background I did a video called my pill
journey you can google it on youtube
google it on YouTube and you can watch
it just to see all the that
I am talking about but there's a line
that I love not patting myself on the
back but maybe but the threat of
unpredictability is the scariest thing
that can happen just when something
depressing happens to someone with
depression yeah so like the idea that
you had to a confess your
feelings to someone yeah B not knowing
how they actually felt and then C
getting like sort of a rejection e it
was like a rejection e response wasn't a
flight out I don't like you right but I
think he's a nice person who wouldn't
yeah like having having something
already waking up is really hard like
you have to take the little wins like
yay I woke up today yeah I only hit my
snooze button four times yeah I got it
on to work on time
like that's already it's really hard
just like living and then something
really sad happens or something really
 up happens that is when it gets
scary and then to feel like you don't
deserve help or don't deserve someone to
lean on or can only talk about it with
your therapist that's the other thing is
I think I know at least for me there
were times where I would fold things in
all week guys I'm like well I'll
get it out of therapy and I didn't have
healthy coping mechanisms I mean I drank
a lot and yeah I would have a lot of sex
or I would you know use my ativan or I
would abuse my ativan to a point where I
would just numb myself until I could go
to therapy and then you know sometimes
the therapy it takes a while to like get
into it I I would feel guilty I wouldn't
want to make my therapist feel bad I
would sit down and be like oh I know how
was your weekend and he would be like so
good how was yours I'm like okay we're
not talking about you okay let me see
how he can dance around this once it's
like I opened my mouth I was like laying
the floodgates out and therapy
became this place we're like that was
the only place I would cry and sometimes
I would sit there and cry for an hour
straight not saying anything and I would
apologize the entire time being like I'm
so sorry I'm so sorry and he's like this
isn't a bad thing you need to be so what
if you cry that's what he would always
say is you'd be like so what if you want
attention so what if you want help why
wouldn't you want help why wouldn't
someone who is struggling and clearly
nothing scared frankly I was scared all
the time because I outwardly presented
this really happy outgoing person who
you know gets done and and runs the
world and I have to put that front on
because if I truly let out the anxieties
and fears that I had I like I genuinely
don't think I would be here I I was not
someone who was comfortable being
vulnerable oh there it is yeah it's it
really is it's a really scary thing
because then you tie that into like
making new friends or or working on a
new project or dating someone new where
you don't feel comfortable being like
hey by the way I'm wildly up on
and I would talk to my therapist a lot
about that where I always just felt
broken and I felt up and I felt
like something was wrong with me yeah
now I know you know 10 years of being in
therapy like how 99% of the rest of the
world feels that way this is up
okay I know this is up I used to
say like I wish I had like a cooler vise
like a cooler disorder like what
anything to be thin anything to be thin
so it's like if I had a drinking problem
or a drug problem or if I was like fully
restrictive which is takes away any of
like the mental turmoil that people go
through and they have those addictions
it's just the grass is greener and it's
crazy how it influences every part of my
life everyone everywhere has
problems and also I would never wish
this upon my worst enemy the feeling of
like waking up and the first thought is
like something you can't control and you
know deep down you're like I'm I know
I'm a happy person I know I want to be
alive but there was there's some force
some cloud you know they didn't use that
metaphor a lot is like a I mean a cloud
follow you around but it really is it's
like you're desperately trying to get
into the Sun and no matter where you
move this cloud follows you and
not knowing how to get rid of that and
and accepting I mean here goes me into
all of my work books that here we go to
get better but I mean again I'm only
showing my experience for what has
worked we're giving I think this is
pretty important that needs to be said
we are not giving you advice on how to
deal with what you're wheeling with if
you're dealing with something go to a
doctor don't get out all we're doing is
sharing our experience and letting you
know that you're not alone there is help
out there most people are dealing with
something in this all people are dealing
with something yeah just about all
people eyes so just know that you're not
alone and if you need help please bc we
should definitely say that okay but what
has worked for me recently I mean I've
been to every type of therapist
psychologist psychiatrist hypnotherapist
the thing that has been working a lot
for me is accepting these feelings and
accepting that you are not your thoughts
after being like misdiagnosed bipolar
and mood disorder I still haven't really
settled on exactly what I have and also
having someone tell me what I had really
 me up because then I carried this
as a full identity and that's also why I
don't like love
hay is because when I used to go today
hay they would make you feel like you
are either an alcoholic or you are
nothing it just became too much
all-encompassing of my identity so I
didn't you know go to the program that's
 up to you work it if it works if
we work it or whatever the I'm
saying is point being III didn't like
the idea of all these therapists and
doctors telling me what I had and sure
maybe that will give you some peace of
mind but having them tell me what I was
and then it not being fixed me up
more because I didn't know how to fix it
I'm like I'm trying everything you guys
are telling me to do I'm doing the
therapy I'm doing the meds I'm
 eating better I'm exercising and
nothing is goddamn working so something
that has really helped me is accepting
that you know what I might not know
exactly what is wrong with my brain and
and you know what I'm gonna call it what
is right with my brain because I think
it has helped me shape me who to be Who
I am it helps me as a creative and I've
accepted that this is what I am right
and in accepting my thoughts and
accepting my anxieties and not labeling
them and just letting my thoughts pass
through and knowing that like my
depression is always gonna be there
there will always be a depressing thing
happening in the world or to me and to
someone I love and I get to choose if
I'm gonna let that take over me and sure
some days there are days where it's just
too strong and I have to accept it but
not letting that consume me and
not letting that be all that I am about
I am so much more than anxiety and
depression I am so much more full and
there are so many other great things
about me that are really hard to
see when it's the whole shitty in many I
was fine like I said I feel fine for the
first time in nine years I can handle it
now but maybe like two years ago I
probably would have been really
up about that anyways my point being is
that what has helped me is realizing
that like
in this world of tumblr Twitter
emotional vulnerability and how it can
be a really good shared experience and
can be really helpful in finding your
community it also doesn't have to be all
that you are free and how to escape that
does not come easily it takes many many
many many years of I think also your
 hormones need to balance
yourself out your brain isn't fully
developed in the parent mode so we
actually don't know how to parent
ourselves slowly until we're thirty like
our brains just aren't develop every
time you're like feeling really upset
like or wherever I'm feeling upset or
feeling like no you're not good enough
or this is you know whatever I have to
recognize that it's not my voice
because it's not the voice that I would
tell other people you know I mean like I
wouldn't give I wouldn't be like you're
too stupid or whatever if it was someone
that I loved so treat yourself like a
mess yeah and that's hard because I mean
it's not there yeah I am again trigger
warning but I have really disassociative
anxiety so it's actually a feeling of
like things not feeling real and feeling
unreal I think is the word they use
where like there was a point where in my
anxiety I would like look down at my
hands and my hands felt like someone I
was looking at someone else's hands
there would be times I was driving and
it felt like my body was like outside of
my own body
and it was I thought I was going
cause have been really scary it was so
and I didn't want to say anything to
anyone because I was like it would
happen on and off like you know the
feeling of being high when it was like
being high without smoking any weed and
it being really unexpected so I would
just be like driving down the highway
and then all of a sudden I feel like I
wasn't driving Jesus and it was
terrifying because I thought that meant
that I had like schizophrenia or
I think that's probably where the
bipolar diagnosis came from but talking
about like that voicing in your head
that like alternative eating disorder
self I would have liked a literal other
self sometimes that's about like someone
else was controlling what I was doing or
controlling my thoughts and it was so
scary but I realized that that wasn't
good
Freni or bipolar it was a type of
anxiety it's a very real common effect
of panic disorder and I lived with that
I was afraid like to ever tell anyone
yeah because it sounds crazy
it's also really easy I think this is
like really upsetting and just a very
sad truth though when you do talk about
something that is wrong with you or me
rephrase that my therapist would be
upset when you talk about something that
you're struggling with and then you tell
it to someone else that's a that's being
vulnerable by letting it out there and
then sometimes the truth is that
sometimes people will come back at you
with sort of they will dismiss what
you're saying as like oh that's not you
talking or it's a very dismissive like
back and forth and so it's like you have
to find the safe areas to let stuff out
so I could totally see why you would be
scared to tell someone what you're going
through because then someone could just
be like oh well I don't want you on the
road you're not going to drive your
enough which is you know whatever it's a
natural fear if you've never dealt with
it you're not okay so that's why you
have to that's why I'd like help is so
important is because something that
might seem to me something like oh
that's scary that's so out of yeah well
like we can kind of get into a little
bit of like dating with an eating
disorder and dating with things I I was
in a relationship with someone who it
was a couple years and if he's listening
to this he knows who he is and I will
always you know appreciate you and love
our relationship and I'm so grateful for
the time we had but I went through the
worst of my anxiety and depression when
I was with him and it happened right
when we were breaking up and I never
fully got like I never got to fully
confide in him about how scared I was
and when I did he had never had a panic
attack he had never had anxiety and
depression about it that much especially
then I mean people talk about it a lot
more now yeah it was part me it was part
me being ashamed to tell him because I
obviously wanted to project my best self
I didn't want to you know we had been
dating for like a year at this point and
to then all of a sudden have this like
new side of me and to be frank I don't
think that like he knew how to handle it
yeah and that's part of your personality
and yeah it smarted me out of your
personality and when
you say yeah a big part of this has been
a front and I know we've been like
having this relationship for some time
but but I needed this to be a front
because it's how I survive he exactly
that's how I get up in the morning and I
know that it could feel very like oh I
was keeping this from you and being
withholding but really it and also like
that I didn't know what was
happening to me is a genuinely scared I
was a up I was like you know I he
just didn't know and in turn it looked
that like he would go to work and then I
would sleep all day and he just he
didn't know what was happening and he
would be there for as much as he could
but it me up in the sense that
like I am terrified now to introduce
like my mental illness to people that I
am sexually or emotionally interested in
and it will a lot of times come off as
like a joke or I'll throw it out there
as like you know a little blip in
conversation and see how they react to
it but it me up because I thought
like wow if this guy that I loved and
who loved me and we're an adult and
we're in an adult loving relationship
couldn't handle it who the would
want to I I would say this all the time
in therapy I wouldn't want to
date me when I'm going through like my
worst panic or my worst of depression
like why would anyone else love me well
oh yeah can you be loved when you're
locked up as we are it's funny because I
the advice I'm about to give you is
definitely or like my take from it is a
hundred percent what I need to tell
myself too but it's a you were
technically adult but you weren't an
adult in your own so you weren't an
adult with this you didn't know how to
talk about this you didn't have the
vocabulary and have the tools you have
the tools now and I think a lot of it
comes from knowing who you are what
different parts there are to you whether
that means you know your disorder or
whatever it is you're dealing with and
then a big thing is knowing like your
worth and knowing your needs and that's
something that I'm like really
struggling with now but I think that
once you know what you are worth and
that you are worth someone else being a
little patient with things and being
like hey this is what I when I go
through some times and I have the tools
so here here's the vocab
here's how I need someone to love me and
I deserve to be loved like that feel
like that's the best way to get into
that relationship but for me I could I
could tell you to do that all day and be
like yeah cuz the I would look because I
think you're a fantastic person like I
really would you look you have so much
to offer I thought about that the other
day Kelsey let me borrow one of the most
generous people that I know yes bitch
oh I do love to give head to that's a
side note I'm a Jay I'm a giving person
what were you saying about a piano being
like I like you here's a great blowjob
please don't cut this out you're gonna
get a million Warmack great Kelsey's
gonna copy I already gave she let me
borrow her keyboard and then when I
brought it back he started like playing
all these songs you could play stuff by
ear you know you just have so much to
offer yourself yeah no problem
you're great too but you have like you
know you I know you're sorry
any do this doesn't have to come into
like a circle jerk other thing is that
you do have I mean it's kind of like one
of those things were like oh there's
restaurants really good I'll deal with
the line you know what I mean there's a
metaphor yeah whoa yeah I love that and
I look I love food sorry if that was
true no man I don't I don't you think do
you think it's funny it's just hilarious
how I have my anxiety and depression
under control for the first time you are
going through it you're going through it
for the first time yet we both are still
so withholding of how we let other
people see it like with dating I can't
imagine what that conversation must be
like to have you even had to have that
conversation to introduce your eating
disorder to something
here's the thing what do you think about
that no way because I've never had
someone interested long enough to have
that conversation and one could argue
that they haven't like people that have
been interested haven't stuck around
long enough because
and I'm withholding and I immediately
try to make it like a friendly sort of
thing and I'm like so pull back like
fully pull back and I'm just sort of
like I project all the things that I'm
insecure about onto them and I'm just
like there's two but for this that or
the other thing so I get like way
friendly and like you it's like a shell
you can't crack and people will
try and they'll ask me questions and I
just refuse to be vulnerable with them
or well my eating disorder self would
say is that I'm just heinous and no-one
wants to get close to me so I'm like
disgusting and like repellent and all of
this sort of stuff and that's how I feel
most of the time so when I when I am not
feeling good and I'm talking to someone
who I might be interested in the the
discussion I'm having in my head I'm
just like yeah they don't like you like
that they're being nice don't be
vulnerable with them because you'll make
them feel uncomfortable they want
someone who's like thin and hot and you
know they want they want this standard
and what you think is a type that
someone wants records is like you just
actually being a whole person right like
because I even think about like I won't
even go out on dates with people
sometimes like if I'm on like a dating
site or something I won't go out on a
date if I'm like people will see us
together and be like wow he's with her
or she's with hers it's crazy yeah it's
really really hard and it keeps me like
super alone odd but you know
what gate like I do that too yes I don't
have an eating disorder and I go god
this person could have anyone in LA
thank you guys
cute little Instagram models and like
they could literally choose anyone but
me rather than going like wow I can
totally see why they are with me yeah
I'm like ah then because of that because
you were hurting like you're harboring
all of those feelings then when you
actually are talking to said person or
any person or whatever you those
feelings come out in the way that
they've come out your entire life which
is to be fully guarded and just
be like no these are the things that if
you were to be like no you're too fat
I'm not gonna be with you that would
break my heart so I won't even
let you get that opportunity to make
that judgment oh but in my head so
that's like that's my survival that's
like this little fighter that I had for
my whole life to keep me safe yeah and
now it's keeping me alone
and after like the phone call I was just
like oh you're so
to have even told him you should have
just lied so that he never would have
known but there was also a part of me
like this very small voice that's
growing which is great yeah this is like
huge for you we were so proud I
wasn't drunk when I said it we were like
see and guess what you're still kicking
I just fell alive you went through the
work I mean I love this quote it's like
you have been through the worst of your
worst and are still alive you know like
you have to congratulate yourself yeah
I'm the little things we've gone deep
yes but I think it's necessary every so
often we should have these little check
I think we should because it's
Thanksgiving and this can bring dredge
up a lot of oh yeah okay well for
anyone out there Thanksgiving and
holidays like that for someone with an
eating disorder and any sort of like you
know mental mental illness going home to
your family or whatever could really
trigger it baby
yeah so I remember I would go like I
remember like being at like parties or
holiday gatherings or anything like that
and just feeling like I was under a
microscope with every bite that I took
and I would look at food and get sad and
just be like what does eating disorder
on Thanksgiving like horse
what do you do true hard because then
every like I mean I just I do it and
then I that's when I'm like the loudest
like I'm loud and I'm joking and stuff
like that and I just sort of like try to
all your deflectors yeah oh baby I'm
just one walking mirror and yeah so I
would just be a reflector anyways anywho
it was it's just uncomfortable all day
it's just an ongoing like feeling of
things that you know cuz it's supposed
to be like oh you it's fine one day
you're allowed to be what yeah and you
know and then everyone at the end is
just like oh man I'm really full-on like
oh man again I hate myself again there
it is again
form and with different people and now
and then afterwards always after what
I'm like I will think about that meal
for like the whole next few weeks being
like you better get up and like run or
do this or whatever and I'm trying not
to do that now I'm trying to like
stabilize my eating before I get super
into fitness I'm excited like overdo it
with it
and then if you don't do the fitness
that's another way that you get mad at
yourself like well if I would have just
yes signed up today rather than sleeping
in yeah it's just about
listening to yourself and taking care of
yourself but it's been it's getting not
easier yet but it's getting doable it's
super good yeah it took then I would
share that again this is Kelsey
self-help book 101 but that I and
especially for Thanksgiving because if I
were struggling with just you know being
out in a social setting or being around
all that alcohol or whatever
family doing dumb my my normal
defense would be to drink and that
wouldn't not my anxiety and my
insecurities and I would be able to get
through it no problem but something that
has been wearing for me that I would
really like to share with people and I
know I've said this to you before is
anxiety is about thinking too much into
the past or future so like you're
thinking about the mistakes you made or
the arguments you lost or like
yesterday's failures or not relationship
ten years ago or you're thinking about
what am I gonna do about this thing
tomorrow or how am I gonna
oh it's like my job in the past in the
future and forget and putting it all in
the present and none of it is actually
happening it's about thinking about like
what am I gonna do about this oh my god
I have this big thing coming up or like
I have to get on the plane and I'm
scared of planes or I have to confront
my family or I have to see you now
whatever is yeah and it's that's what
anxiety is it's about thinking about the
past or the future and instead I would
HIGHLY this is my biggest advice of the
podcast this is my wrap-up is to really
fully live in the present and I
would rather be living in a mediocre
moment of like present that beating my
 self up about something that
happened in the past or something that
is gonna happen it might not happen or
might not happen exactly like I'm
already thinking about all the shitty
 but like my advice is to truly stop
 letting your mind take over and
and bring yourself back just
focus on the present and I know it's
super hard and easier said than done but
that's what's gonna get me through right
now and that's what's gonna get me
through this next second and tomorrow
and next week and yeah wait what's your
tip instead of a tip I'm just gonna for
anyone who's like currently struggling
with stuff like that it's more of just
gonna share my goal I guess maybe for
this week besides coming
I'm sure okay my goal is to focus on
more of like what I want and letting
that be enough sort of easing up on the
judgment and trying to mindfully keep
myself out of situations where I feel
like I'm being judged I like that yeah
just be kinder kinder to yourself it is
really hard to be nice to yourself
mm-hmm but at the end of the day you're
only with you for the rest of eternity
so why not try and make it as good as
possible with whatever control you do
have it was such a nice thing that you
were saying in such a scary way that
gave me a lot of anxiety guys I know
what this got a little serious but a lot
of you asked for us to talk about this
stuff we could do a million more
episodes about this yeah let us know
what you would like to hear more about
because I do think the more we talk
about it and the more open we are even
in stupid little podcast like
this the easier it's gonna be for other
people loved to hear this when I
was last like 10 years ago I would love
to hear it so yeah so we'll keep talking
about it as long as you guys want us to

there's no way tipping is kind of not a
good holiday
yeah there's no way to like wrap up a
mental health discussion like that we
could end on high notes and some care
tips and sure we could do that
but I feel like this whole podcast has
been little tidbits of advice and
self-care situations
hopefully examples of how your Natalie

if you're struggling know that both of
us have been to the pits of darkness and
hell and are still struggling and will
always struggle but how are so alive and
that's an anxiety burp but that that it
is it's it does get better and I swear
to god I hate when people tell
me that but it does get better it does
get better there is help out there
nothing's perfect everything's in cycles
you'll feel bad again but it's just it's
a new life you have the ability to have
a community of people around you who
care if you have shitty people around
you stop talking to them if you
have people that don't understand your
mountainous or your disorder or just
know where they fit in your life yeah
yeah maybe it's not in your life just
know that you are not alone you're not
