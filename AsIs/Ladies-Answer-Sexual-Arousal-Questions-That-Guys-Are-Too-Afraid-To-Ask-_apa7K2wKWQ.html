confusing I agree and there's like a
thousand factors that go into like a guy
could just pop a boner there's a million
factors that go into when a woman would
feel aroused and now ladies and sexual
arousal questions that guys are too
afraid to ask what does it feel like
metaphorically it feels like an itch you
have to scratch when you're really
aroused you get very wet like yeah it
gets real it's like exercise but without
hating their sweat and endorphins and
happy excitement and your hearts racing
feels like a vagina tingle on the inside
like mmm to me like being turned on
literally feels like like magic what
turns you on eyebrows if your eyebrows
are on fleek it's done
when you see buffy the vampire good
sense of humor good style the
relationship between Buffy and Spike
it's pretty great a nice I could
not like something one day and then love
it the next day or all of a sudden
you're like totally not into it and then
you see a good ankle talent it at
anything you could be like the world's
best actor and I'm gonna be just as
attracted to you as if you're like the
world's whistling champion like a lot of
times like if you're leaning if you're
reading like a sexy book or something
and then you're just like enjoying that
sexy book you're not necessarily gonna
like finish the book and masturbate how
does it happen it happens gradually like
it's not as night and day it's like a
journey so it doesn't need to hit the
like ice like mildly horny yeah it's
kind of our there and you enjoy it how
often do you get sexually aroused in a
day I don't get aroused during the
workweek because I'm too busy
it depends on how bored I am it depends
on the day some days not at all and then
some days that's all day
it used to be a lot more than I started
birth control and I was like oh I don't
do that thing is that you Stu I'm like
that's kind of sad once a day
too few times a day are you for real
I would say hydrogen starts a day why is
that I don't know what if other people
would say what do you do if you get
aroused in public it's not uncomfortable
the same way I feel like it is for guys
because they have to like physically
hide a boner where we're just like haha
no one knows I'm horny it's more just
like you feel slightly like in amusia
really like what I practice for me I
think I just like carried home and tell
them about the place where I can put it
in the spank bank machines women I know
what that is if you just kind of like
keep it in the back of your head oh yeah
then you're like I'll bring this up
again at a more relevant time this thing
is what you masturbate to oh you've a
baby of like you keeping your head think
of that situation where you're aroused
thank ya is arousal more mental or
physical sex is like a 90 percent mental
like 10 percent physical all in the
brain a good makeout session can turn me
on more than other kinds of foreplay on
rhymes like it's a very mental thing yes
for me I think like mental or physical
either could be activated first but I
sort of need them both on the same page
and feeling and feeling wanted and
feeling like the other person like
really wants you that's like more of the
game that any physical stimulation the
right answer for me at least is it's
50/50 like a good good chat and it in a
good and a good bond and a good feel up
at the same time I'll be the trick the
physical part is the most boring part
about it for me which is I think why
guys get so confused and frustrated
because they're like I'm doing all these
cool tricks and I'm like I'll need you
to do a cool trick like I think Jeff I
don't I was go slow
oh my god like I hate
one of guys like this lows good for like
30 seconds I was like you don't get it
problem it's like eight and a half
minutes at least</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
