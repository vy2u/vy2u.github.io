back with another idk I wonder if we
could just do today we'll be answering
just about you don't need to be right
today we're going to be answering
questions about Soph your mic is being
cut ring true do that again we're gonna
be answering questions about adulting
and work and periods well this is a
separate sorry
it's ladylike and here we are again with
another idk I am NOT gonna have this no
I just eats right on Jen I have to catch
a second that's right on Jen okay I just
kidding like it just glitched so
nevermind I'm gonna put that away how
did you get the confidence pursue a
creative career I think there's nothing
comfortable about pursuing creative
career creative careers are like a
tournament like there's lots of people
who start out and the key succeeding is
the outlast the people who quit a
writing professor once tell me that the
people that make it are not necessarily
the best writers they're the people that
are the most persistent with my family
it was a huge fight like my mom never
really wanted me to like do anything
like this I think I was just really
determined and I was pretty combative at
times where I was like I will be doing
this I'm going to do it if you ask
yourself like what I'd be happy doing
anything else and the answer is no then
like it's not a matter of making a
choice because there is no choice how do
you get comfortable suiting up for
yourself you know workplace environment
a lot of it is just like sort of having
like a script you want to be able to
like walk into a room and if you have
sort of a concern to talk about you you
know what to say sometimes I lay out
bullet points and say like what is
making me unhappy what do I want to
change because what do I wish was
actually happening it's just important
to remember that like you are a person
and you deserve to be treated with
respect regardless of the environment
how do you handle stress and or anxiety
while at work or school something that
I've found as I've existed in the
working world a little bit longer is
that once you leave work you've left
work once I go home for the night I'm
just like watching How I Met Your Mother
everyone needs breaks and sometimes when
you're at work
you have a lot of things to do you don't
necessarily put yourself first but
sometimes breaks make you even more
productive school eventually ends I
think like tough situations in school
like it will eventually be like a
distant memory so like kind of keeping
in mind that like it's okay I'll get
through this time will pass what's the
best advice you can give for people who
don't know that they want to do I know
50 year olds who still don't know what
they want to do I feel like sometimes
you're like I don't know what I want to
do kind of means like I don't know where
I want to be at the end of my career
looking back to see all of my
accomplishment setting short-term goals
could help like maybe or for like oh I'm
living at home but within a year I want
to be in my own apartment one of my old
professors said like it's almost more
important to figure out what you don't
want to do and what you do want to do
there were times like I remember
thinking I want to go into development
and then I had an internship in that and
I was like I don't want to do
development people have several
different like types of careers in a
lifetime just be yourself
even if it's gay my advice all right
guys yeah cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
