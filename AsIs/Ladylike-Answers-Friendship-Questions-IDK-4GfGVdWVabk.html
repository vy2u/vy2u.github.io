episode but this bed is still broken
we're back at it with another episode of
idk and we're going to talk about
friendships I tweet it if anyone had any
questions about friendships or lack
thereof and so we're gonna answer some
of those today we love friendship we
love holding them we love honoring them
we love memorializing them
alright cool let's do it how do I make
friends I mostly see if someone likes it
when I lightly make fun of them and then
I pursue that that's a great way if
someone like likes it when you tease
them it's like oh this person wants to
be my friend exactly one thing that's
always kind of worked for me is finding
a group or organization that has a
shared interest I've made most of my
friends just based on proximity alone
sitting next to people at work or
sitting next to people at school and
then there's a collective movement to
another location like oh we are in math
class it's time for lunch
hey want to walk to lunch together what
do you do if you're stuck at a one-sided
friendship in a lot of friend groups
there is like kind of one person who's
like impetus for the planning you and
I'm saying and if they just think you're
that friend then maybe they are just
like waiting for you to make plans
anyway sometimes it's okay I think to
have friendships like that it just sort
of means like you have to be on the same
page about it I mean a lot of people
like don't text first and don't call
first and don't make plans because they
feel like if they put themselves out
there then they will get shot down it's
boring advice but you just got to talk
to people how do you cut off toxic
people I think you just kind of have to
like not be around them and if you're in
situations where you have to be around
them being civil being kind but like not
giving them like an opening to be
emotionally involved in your life yeah
you can distance people without icing
them out ghost them sometimes it's not
worth it to expose yourself so it could
be a really nasty confrontation so you
should ghost people is it possible to be
friends with someone you've once dated
my immediate
now say no with most of my exes I'm
friendly but I'm not friends with them
it makes it so much stickier yeah
when you get into a future relationship
if you're still friends with your ex I
think that it's possible and it really
depends on how the relationship ended
and why as you get older and you have
more relationships under your belt it's
easier to differentiate between like
exes where it's like Oh a venture will
be chilled to be friends and exes where
it's like oh there's too much resentment
or sadness or weirdness and it just
wouldn't work what are you supposed to
do when you're the only single friend
when I was in high school in college I
would just forego yeah and I've never
built it all the time it looks like all
the time I think it's only a problem if
your friends are making it so that you
can't be included if you don't have a
boyfriend or a girlfriend
being the only single friend has
advantages because you were the friend
who was always available to hang out and
like you're the friend who like never
brings like a significant other along
like I think that like being like a safe
space and being like a fun space is kind
of an advantage at one time my friend's
boyfriend just felt so bad for me that
he bought my dinner to see and then you
get free dinner out of it that's a good
perk communication is like the backbone
to any solid friendship but just getting
to a point where you're comfortable
having those talks is really hard Thanks
sometimes they can be hard but usually
it's a great part of life the best chip
there is hey I'll click on that post
over there see more videos from our
Channel
some of our favorites are in there and
some we like just okay but watch anyway
because we love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
