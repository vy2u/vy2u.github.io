we broke the bed are we rolling we
really broke this bed and like the least
sexual way possible to Jenny you ready
yeah hey what's up you guys it's
ladylike and we're coming at you with
another idk today we're talking about
Russia's how to get them how to find
them how to make sure you don't get
anything from them cool yeah let's do it
how can you tell if someone likes you
when I like someone I go out of my way
to run into them they're returning your
calls yeah I text you back yeah they
want to hang out with you as much as you
want to hang out with them I'll be like
oh you were gonna go see this movie at
8:10 p.m. Wow here I am more compliments
than usual if they touch your upper arm
if they're just like hi how are you
doing yeah the girl I liked in high
school I just sat next to her every day
at lunch and slowly but surely leaned in
to like her shoulder and then one day
she leaned back and I was like oh okay
we're dating now what's your best
pick-up line let's rearrange the
alphabet so I can put you and I together
I can tell anyone that didn't work for
me
Hey I just wanted to let you know that I
think you're really attractive here's my
aim screen name and I wrote my aim
screen name on his hand with a pen that
I had brought with me and then I walked
away and I thought I had nailed it and
it would never worked out Chauncey
doesn't have pickup lines she's just
very straightforward and you just you
know what you want and you just make it
known every that's pretty man why has it
not worked though how do you know if a
nice guy likes you what if you take it
as flirting but they're just being nice
if you really can't tell if they're
being nice or being flirty then you
should be 100% flirtier grab their face
yeah and caress it it took me until
maybe like six months ago to be aware
that I was a flirty person I was floored
when I found this out when people were
telling me I was like oh I think I'm
just like nice and people are like you
are the biggest flirt that I know when I
like someone I knew hands
now that I liked them and so there's
never any question in their mind if I
liked them if they have a boyfriend or a
girlfriend they're just being nice they
don't like you how old were you when you
had your first crush there was a boy in
my kindergarten class his name was Kelly
and I used to have dreams that he was a
mermaid oh and that's how I knew that it
was love love yeah rocky from the
cartoon Rocky and Bullwinkle so squirrel
and yes the squirrel I mean I definitely
had my fair share of animated crushes
one of them being Aladdin also also
Simba Simba was so funny
I just remember my first crush when we
were in third grade she always got
pulled out of class to go to advanced
math and every time she walked by her
hair would bounce nine-year-old me was
like she's smart and she has bouncy hair
how do you deal with unrequited love
when I was little I really thought there
was something romantic about pining but
it really just made me more miserable
time it's the best thing time and
distance yeah I was getting married I am
getting married to someone I love and
I'm attracted to like so not all crushes
are gonna be unrequited forever
when I was younger I used to just
torture myself constantly by like seeing
if their minds would change and like
writing poems and like listening to
Evanescence and they might like you as a
person but if they're not like into you
you can't really change their mind if
you're in my life and you're making me
sad mad frustrated or just generally
unhappy I shouldn't be putting myself
around you
crushes crushes rushes they're things
that happen to you know what you deserve
and allow yourself to get that hey I'll
click on that post over there see more
