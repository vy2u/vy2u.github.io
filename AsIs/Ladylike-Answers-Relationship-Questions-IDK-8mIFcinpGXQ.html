girls in a room in everyone welcome to
my bedroom so it's ladylike and today
we're answering your questions on a show
maybe that's going to be called idk yeah
because we don't know either
we don't know somebody tell me what
making out means today's topic is
relationships or lack thereof so it's
you can post mates ice cream right yeah
alright so let's first question is how
do I slay my semi-formal without a date
I've gone to a few dances some with a
date and some without a date and I'll
say I had way more fun just going with
my friends I got dumped in the school
parking lot right before my first prom
and I went with a group of girls and it
was so much fun I was a third wheel but
it was fine
I love third-wheeling I do find the
right couple third-wheeling can be great
slayage and date have no correlation and
I opinion precisely looks like if you
have a date you might have to grind with
them how do you approach an extremely
attractive person that you've never met
before but really what to get to know I
just walked up to my fiancee and said hi
and I thought it was more attractive
than me but I was like you know what
let's just do it put on your big-girl
shoes and your big-girl panties and just
walk across the room so when I was like
15 I thought I was really hot so I
like would go up to guys and be like pay
I think you're really attractive got
obviously never panned out because
that's the most awkward thing to
say of all time it's just like what do
you say to that yeah exactly
someone told me this acronym when you're
trying to talk to somebody but it's Ford
family occupation recreation dreams
where it's like those are the four
things you talk to someone new about
that's so smart and you just like
remember Ford what do I do I have a
gorgeous straight friend who gets all
the boys the problem is I want to ask
her out but she's straight I don't know
what to do it kills me whenever she
brings up a boy because all I want to do
is hold her hand and kiss her cheek I
definitely think it's a very very common
thing for friends to start feeling at
some point you have to like kind of come
clean and whatever point that is I think
it's gonna be awkward regardless if that
friendship is supposed to continue on in
your life then it will people's
sexualities can and do like evolve and
change as you grow and figure yourself
out but also I do really believe that
you sort of have to take people at their
word so if someone says that they're
straight then I think you know
unfortunately what that means is that it
might be time to figure out ways to move
on and that's also really hard but it's
like you know you're not gonna be happy
pining there was one time a boy that
definitely didn't like me who I really
liked who I literally wrote poems about
I mean we always like you know journal
entries and stuff like one I was twenty
I met a guy around two years ago on a
summer program and we both really liked
each other three months ago he messaged
me and we've been talking every single
day since then but sometimes I'm not
sure if he likes talking to me I have a
couple reasons but the big one is the
fact that we've talked on the phone
about three times in three months but
now he always makes an excuse to not
talk on the phone
and went to visit him sometimes soon but
I'm afraid that he might feel like I'm
coming on too strong do you think it's
worth it
you know if someone wants to talk to you
or hang out with your be with you they
will be the thing that bothers me the
most about stuff like that is when
people say that they're busy because
everyone is busy
if you flip into think about how much
you like him and how much you want to
talk to him like you are gonna be making
time for that but if he's not doing that
for you I have been in that situation so
many times and I always am disappointed
I always felt like I liked someone so
much more than they liked me and it was
always so painful and I was like I asked
this is what relationships are like but
it's really not there are people who
want you so much that you won't be able
to believe how much they like you it
will shock you you'll feel their boners
through the pan okay all right yeah
question for you guys oh god what is it
what is making out oh my I've done the
cheek and then let it rip anything
coming really see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
