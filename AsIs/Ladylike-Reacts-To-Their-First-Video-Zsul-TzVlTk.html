the same snack okay I wanna go to we
film our first video we shot this in
early November of last year I think it
doesn't sound like a very long time but
it is and it was a struggle to shoot
this cuz I was leaving for Thailand the
next day this was a journey I'm just
looking at myself oh stop I have
jet-black hair and this aren't you I
like it already and I start yeah are you
can you say everyone say do we need
popcorn I'm just kidding my lips
honestly feel like like this
that's a spongebob thing oh that's when
lady like was to separate one so he they
were wearing longer long hair ah we all
have a youthful glow I feel like now in
videos I'm like oil gold plate yeah I
feel like this was the beginning of
liquid lipsticks for me I didn't know
that much about them I was like it's so
dry and now I'm look for I can't eat all
of these things I'm drinking tea because
I don't drink coffee

love Brooks Tara look Stone West Elm

that's more I feel like thank you for
bringing wheelhouse into this country go
OK look at pretty face can we also talk
about the fact that none of us really
knew each other that well
let me shadow Vidya like this is the
first time we had ever really worked
with Candace and Chantelle we jumped
into this very intense video and like
found out lots of things about who we
were working with I remember sitting
there being like am I gonna be able to
make conversation I'm really nervous too
next event eat a damn taco oh god these
tacos we were this was like at 9:30 at
night yeah we were starving we started
shooting we thought we were gonna start
shooting at 1:00 we didn't actually
start shooting until like 3:30 after the
light said ethanol yeah and we looked at
four different shooting locations to see
where to shoot this we'd set lights up
in like a random conference room so
we're just shooting this we're a tasty
video should be shot we just put
ourselves in our Taco Bell event number
three case a boy I know him and we're
gonna kiss I guess Oh kissing the boys
my god I've gotten is Jack cringe-worthy
are all stories oh so cute
when we were coming up with the
different categories to test for the
Olympics this one came up south was
taken care of she had a longtime
boyfriend at the time and she still does
I have completely zero prospects Freddie
had a friend boy I had dinner at a new
prospect now an old prospect now yes now
he's been in the game for a minute
I remember Shanti and I were like
texting back and forth like we have a
boy and I know do you have a boy I'm
like kind of like I don't know what to
do I had been dating jack or one date I
text him and I was like hey you wanna be
in a BuzzFeed video and he was like very
weirdly okay with that he was like of
course yeah and so he came out and our
second date was this my friend who had
been friends with since I was like 12
and so I like texted it was like hey

from now he was fine with it he was like
yeah okay he was into it yeah oh come on
he was into it was not a heavy make out
with you y'all were making out more than
me and my longtime boyfriend he then
proceeded to move out of state
a week later I ended up asking Paul to
kiss me on camera and he ended up you
know agreeing to do it but then the
timing didn't work out because he was
shooting something else
mm-hmm so then I had to just pull
Garrett from from the second floor my
favorite things that Garrett pretends to
literally not even know who you are yeah
he shakes your hand at the beginning I
like these daughters beside him here we
go my god he's are you in here being so
uh okay see this is the steamiest nuts
