yeah Lina welcome to ladies hey what's
up
it's ladylike and we're back with
another idk yeah cuz we don't know
either
and today we're answered questions about
periods Oh is anybody on their food
might just finished mine and it was a
nightmare I'm eight days away and the
countdown begins as I got all these
questions I was like some of these are
real questions for real doctors so if
you have an actual problem please go see
a doctor
all right cool let's do it period when
you got your first period did you use
tampons or pads
how can someone become more comfortable
using tampons I was 13 when I got my
period honestly have been using pads
consistently for most of my life when I
was a kid I thought that tampons worked
like hot dogs and that like the Volvo
was like the hot dog bun and then you
just stuck the tampon in mikkel and said
I'm going up you went you just said it
gently in between yes I didn't realize
we're supposed to go in because I
thought it worked like a pad when I
first got my period funding exec got my
period the next month I was on my period
was during swim camp and it was I could
not figure out how to use a tampon or I
just couldn't figure out the proper
direction unity is gonna get angry you
have to get an angle I was just like
running to the bathroom running and it
was a week-long sleepaway camp and you
were swimming three times a day I think
I only started using tampons because my
friends were using them and
they were just like oh it's so much more
convenient and it took me like two
rounds of peering in order to figure out
how to actually do it then really fine I
didn't really know the good tampons
plastic applicators are bad for the
environment but good for the soul soul
and good for my whole to describe your
working experience using only three
words my low key might have been not
swim camp this is forward that's okay I
think that's okay
bloody tampon public bathroom oh oh I
know that story friend's mother leaking
I guess new person sheets office chair
explosion I feel like I understand yeah
where it's like what do you do you just
still have to get to change your name
what are we feels really bad period
cramps painting pads also I take
excedrin I get littered cetera you can't
accept it has caffeine in it South gets
extremely hyper I didn't even know that
I just I think I had a headache right
yeah and Freddie gave me an excedrin and
I was like what's in this baby great I
love my the most one I've ever had and
Freddie was like I'm never doing that
again hot baths too hot showers again we
are not doctors sometimes people will
try and like dismiss period pain and be
like it's not that bad or like get over
it or whatever but if something feels
really painful and really wrong like you
know better than anyone if it's not
right so trust yourself if you're having
really really painful cramps you should
probably go see a doctor
where'd you put the band
a what so this question was submitted
I'm I don't know by who on Twitter but I
thought it was so funny that I thought
we should put it in but there there's no
bandaid what do you do to prevent blood
from staining your veggies peroxide
peroxide works on anything you go to Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond a lot what else are you
supposed to do you're gonna stay in your
bedsheets there's no God yeah it's
pillaged its cost of doing business I've
heard from people who use period panties
in a video that I made that period
panties are very good for sleeping in if
you put a bandaid on your vagina you're
never gonna get blood on your sheets so
why are we even answering this question
you shove it up then you take a little
bit of cause you wrap it around twice a
little let me just flip it all around
you sew it up with a little bit of fire
you RC a hermetically sealed together
for good that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
