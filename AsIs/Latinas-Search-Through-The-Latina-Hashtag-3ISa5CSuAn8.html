can it's like a bird's eye view of
breasts yeah but what size is that's on
Instagram okay just hashtag Athena on
Instagram nudity color on tumblr legs

just have a row of pictures of only
boobs and it's not even like Oh hashtag
my latin boobs and not Deena's warning
not made for weakness thing up is like
poor guy tied to the ground i got a link
that way if you want to take big booty
pictures of yourself that's fine i feel
like a lot of these were like not meant
for us they probably meant for one
person to see and not like oh they're
benzenes so who knows if this was like
money Lacy's who took a photo for her
boyfriend Pablo and father got pissed

boobs I think in terms of colors they
have all that Athena's down they have
afro Latinas they got light skinned ones
they got tan ones all in guru sauce I
mean everyone looks great yeah but I
feel a certain kind of way
this I'm not gonna lie I love how we see
Dora the Explorer followed by girls
something I'm surprised because I
honestly this is the first time I've
I've looked up by hashtag Latinas those
girls look great like they're doing
their thing it's not really about them
and what they're doing I think it's just
like let's show kind of like everything
that we're about and not just like one
really kind of narrow piece most of the
time there are accounts from outsiders
you can tell because they do not
represent everyone imagine if our moms
like searched hashtag latina my mom
would have a heart attack
mommy I whele don't search love you this
is what Latinas really write hashtag
Latinas hey it's here it's here Karen
