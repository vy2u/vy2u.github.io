and I identify as a Cuban American
Mexican and I'm half Mexican even though
I do not look the part
I consider myself chikkanna with an X
identify as Salvadorian Latino Hispanic
uh American in my opinion I do not look
Mexican
so I do not get a lot of people
approaching me calling me Latino or
Hispanic or asking me even that because
I doesn't even into their mind
I'm definitely I wouldn't say Spanish
because in Brazil we don't speak Spanish
but definitely latina because I'm from
Latin America my whole life I referred
to myself as Hispanic most people in
Miami do and I think that's because a
lot of us are Cuban and have Spanish
descent
latina just because I grew up with like
Salvi friends and Whovian friends and he
got a winces and it makes me like
identify with my friends it wasn't until
I moved recently to Los Angeles that a
lot of folks were just saying oh I'm
Latino and Latina oh yeah I'm latina
like it's just weird this is when I
started getting confused the general
consensus is that Latinos people that
are born like on the Americas right yeah
it's anything below like the United
States and like the Caribbean because
Hispanic again is like I feel a little
yeah little chunk of the big piece you
know like a Latino Hispanic yeah that's
true when I had some friends they would
say I don't know about Latino and I was
like that we are we are from Latin
America but we've from Brazil still
associate that a lot with
spanish-speaking
like supposed to be like Oh
spanish-speaking people but it just
carries like a certain privilege that I
feel like I don't have even though I
speak Spanish people in Latin America
were mixed with like indigenous and
Spanish and African by just saying
Hispanic we're only like recognizing
Spain but I do feel that when I call
someone from Latin America a Hispanic
that I might be misplacing that I'm not
offended if for somebody to go Hispanic
I'm like oh yeah yeah I don't really
take offense to any of those terms
Hispanic Latino Mexican I mean it is
what it is as long as you're not saying
something negative along with those
things for me it doesn't matter
I mean I'm Latino I'm Hispanic I mean it
shouldn't be that much of an issue for
people that aren't Latino they should
just address us in a way that maybe you
can ask first like oh like what are you
like I don't know yeah cuz I don't
expect everybody to know all these like
labels like trust me like I don't know
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
