hi my name is Kristen and like many
women I often have problems where my
shirts gap at my boobs now if you look
online there's lots of solutions out
there that work if you have a lot of
time or money or a tailor or if you care
a lot but I don't have any of those
things
so instead I'm going to try out for
quick easy solutions and see if any of
them work
okay so we're gonna try these four
things sticky back velcro Hollywood
fashion tape safety pins and special
pink spins alright so I'm gonna try to
use a good old-fashioned safety pin and
see if I can make this work that old
tried-and-true try it in true piece of
 I hate this already this is as good
as it's gonna get I bet I could struggle
with this for about fifteen more minutes
and it might look nominally better if
probably will not like your drawing more
attention to the gap than like just
having the gap you might as well just be
proud and have like a big hole in your
shirt now we're gonna try the fashion
tape why won't this cut get me some tape
okay yes let's do some shirt surgery the
cool thing about this tape is that it
has these little things that you can
peel off once you've applied it to the
shirt amount know to seal it shut and
see if it works I don't know how long
you're supposed to do this for so I'm
just gonna wing it
okay so it seems to have created another
gap so I'm going to address this little
hole as well it is really hard to see
over your own boobs okay so it looks
like it's pretty safe but I feel like
given enough time it when I pop right
open okay so the next thing I'm going to
try is the special pink safety pin that
supposed to make it easier to use a
safety pin on your shirt it's very
special it costs $3 which means I've
already lost all of them except for this
one the first thing you're supposed to
do is stick the pin facedown on the
inside of your shirt so that you don't
see it after you poke it out you're
supposed to flip it so it acts like a
little invisible button on the inside
the hard part is figuring out where
you're supposed to line it up on this
side and I don't know how to do that so
we're just gonna pray okay alright so it
should work like that except that it
causes all your other buttons to come on
button I feel like I don't do a lot of
punching in my everyday life but
no just the case Oh yep see okay we've
already come free I mean this parts fine
but it doesn't really secure you all
that well sticky back velcro is all the
power of velcro and none of the power of
sewing you have to line this up which is
a lot harder than it looks actually
close enough okay now I don't have
scissors here they're in the bathroom
okay now I'm gonna figure out how much I
need to cut oh sure the world's hardest
sticker and we're gonna line this up
yeah so you're supposed to hold this
down for 24 hours according to the
instructions so I'm gonna hold it down
for about 30 seconds okay I'm bored
let's do the other one here fighting
with stickers just a normal day fighting
with stickers this feels pretty good
honestly this feels more secure than the
buttons which is saying something about
modern shirt design I don't know what do
people do look like I'm feeling pretty
good in this like I just want to do this
to every shirt I own and the winner is
sticky back velcro surprise I know
they're probably better ways to do this
if you have a tailor or more than five
dollars but if you have less than five
dollars a sticky back velcro is your
girl or your boy or whatever gender it
happens to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
