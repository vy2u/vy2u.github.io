when my parts are within my ladies parts
I think people can define sex as they
see fit I think there has to be one
standard for me sex is when a penis goes
into a vagina and back out a minute
again I hate seeing that a woman feel
that that is what sex is because it's
obviously so much more than that but
insertion is just half way getting the
girl off
I don't like when women just describe it
as like the penis in and out because I
think like you know it's a lot more than
that bro
like there's more to an experience with
somebody if I serious in a second out
homosexual I mean they're it's it's love
with somebody that you care about
absolutely not just I don't know if it
was like that then it would be as
mundane as being like hey how you doing
Oh what would need a cigarette
heavy foreplay maybe there's more
adventurous oral a lot of oral some of
these guys I mean I've heard of
scissoring I don't know I think the
reason why it's so mysterious is because
no one knows that no one's telling
though it's educating and no one showing
what it actually is about when people
are like how the lesbians do it I'm like
it's not that hard like use your
imagination I don't honestly like I
don't think anyone has an idea because
not a lot of people are talking about
and do it like you do it's just slightly
different penetration is like now you're
not a virgin but with lesbian sex I I
don't know buy the old school of thought
yeah I guess so if you haven't been
penetrated by a penis that would mean
you're a virgin
I don't know now that I'm thinking of
help it's not it makes any sense for men
to think somehow that they have to be
involved in some way to like take a
woman's virginity when they have nothing
to do with that person just seems so
selfish everything revolves around the
dick the world revolves around the dick
my world does not revolve around the
dick it is like very centered around
like phallic shape things I'll you if
you're not gonna have a man there you
didn't have something that is least
phallic men think that if that's not
there then that's all the way they can
please a woman when there's like a
million other ways I don't feel like
anybody else should decide when you had
sex I think the individual should get to
decide when they had sex
to be honest with you I have no idea
what lesbian sex is I don't really know
so here's the big secret sex is so much
about the feeling you're having and how
you express that with a partner so the
thought that sex is just man woman
penetration is actually really limiting
for anybody
there's a lot more to sleds bein sex and
sex in general than just penetration
like finger stuff fisting it's gentle
though play some Enya outside the body
we've got oral we've got hand stuff I
mean just humping less music is not a
goal-oriented activity like sex
shouldn't be generally sex is about fun
and connection you're always told to
have a goal like you have to get
somewhere into order to succeed you
succeed once you get to the bedroom when
you find someone you like to hang out
with and make feel good that's the point
of lesbian sex and that should be the
point of anybody sex boom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
