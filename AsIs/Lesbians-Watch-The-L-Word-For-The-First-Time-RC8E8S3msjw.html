interested in other things and then I
also didn't really come out until two
years ago and then by that time there
was a lot of other shows that I could
have watched so I'm expecting a lot of
drama from what my friends told me lots
of sex a lot of women being pretty and
beautiful in Los Angeles very campy this
is a really really long theme song ok so
there's like some people of color
already that's not bad I don't know what
the I just watched I feel like the
singer was literally given a notepad of
the lyrics and goes just go with it so
long that's like the thing about cable
TV we're like we're going to make our
intro songs an hour chuckling oh we're
having fun we're just flirty lesbian
marinas hot she one of those like
characters it's totally like oh I can
make you gay the girl the middle I fire
her I would already be gone I'd be like
these two we're gonna bang I'm out so
straight girl is not straight Hulan and
I'm just like are really great middle
and now they're making out in the
bathroom someone is peed in there is
that not disgusting it's funny it's so
sexy but my my thing is like if anyone
followed me into a bath and I might be
like oh ho you'd run the out
of course it's a mini-cooper Oh PLUS
loan Oh basically like spies trying to
figure out if this woman is clear what's
with all the power suits this is like
fun because it's sort of like people do
very tone down versions of this with
their friends yes away you get a
lesbians attention is to be more lesbian
in front of them well of course they
send chaining to figure out she's into
girls
she's very subtly shutting her down a
lot of people do experience anxiety
about approaching other good women
because they don't know if the other
person likes women
so I'm glad that the show exists I
understand the problems with it I think
you know it's not a perfect show people
think the keek as much as they want I
think it's admirable that they tried to
include as much diversity as they can
could they have added more sure no I
don't think I would go back and watch
the series there isn't that many shows
that focus on women that like other
women and I think that's like a shame
everybody wants like some mindless like
entertainment and if like ladies got to
have sex it's like even better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
