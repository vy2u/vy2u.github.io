their true feelings for another person
baffled confused just completely
astounded it's not so much an unrequited
love as it is a despite in kind of love
because so many people would rather live
in spite of their love than to fight for
their love and I don't know about y'all
but when I think I'm in love with
someone I just can't hold that in
and never let the other person know and
if you're lucky enough to have me fall
in love with you best believe there will
be a show because love is too grand and
too exciting to be trapped in the depths
of your heart lurking and hiding and I
don't know I just I can't understand
people who hold in their true feelings
wasting all that time when you could be
getting sexual hailing so when I think
about that there's absolutely no way I
can hold my feelings back woo damn
I mean really when you love someone
there touches just feel like fire
burning through your veins and there's
just something so cute and special about
how they say your name and the thought
of their lips gently pressed up against
your lips and their hands running up and
down your hips and good lord help me
because I'm getting hot and bothered
just thinking about it so really I can't
understand why anyone would be content
with living in a fantasy why wouldn't
you want to take that next step unless
you're okay with living a life of
what-ifs and regrets I know I can't I at
least need to know what could possibly
happen next even if it's not the outcome
I wanted I would at least have to try
because you never know if that girl or
guy could be the one
so don't let them get away just believe
in yourself stop overthinking it and
just
let that out hey oh hey hey nothing
you know just thirsty yeah and I feel
yeah what's it what's that oh this
nothing okay okay yeah this uh just so
many options sort of choose it's so many
that like I think I'm gonna like go back
to my desk simply think about it okay
I'll see you yeah yeah yeah okay
actually we go out with me I'm rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
