understand birth control I recently
asked a few high schoolers what they
knew about it I've never talked about
birth control I'm a little bit unsure
about what birth control even is I know
that birth control is a pill that you
take I don't really know anything about
it obviously and then I ask them in my
co-workers what they need I don't have a
lot of experience talking or researching
or thinking about birth control I've
never used birth control how did I learn
about birth control I'd say I didn't I
think this is what everyone thinks that
was like the most basic form of birth
control somehow these magical tablets
keep you from getting pregnant I don't
know what's in it I feel like you gotta
have some instructions how does this
work is it the coil that like doesn't
make you pregnant that's like magic like
how does it do that it turns out we all
had a bunch of questions so I called in
some experts I'm dr. Regina Edmund I'm
dr. Yvonne bone and were OBGYN in order
to understand birth control first you
have to understand two basic concepts
menstruation which is when the uterine
lining sheds and a woman breathes
monthly and the second is ovulation
that's when the ovary releases an egg so
the way hormonal birth control works is
it prevents you from ovulating by
interrupting the signal from your brain
you do not ovulate at the end of the
cycle the pills the hormones in the
pills or the lack of them causes you to
have a quote fake menstrual cycle whose
birth control make you gain weight so
when we're talking about birth control
right now we're talking about the
combined birth control pills the ones
you take every day risk of weight gain
with these types of pills is extremely
low if you're gaining more than five
pounds then you should let the doctor
know what happens if I have one
cigarette if I'm on the pill there is an
increased risk of blood clots if you're
smoking while you take the pill if
you're over 35 we absolutely do not want
you to smoke this doesn't apply to
smoking weed we really do not encourage
cigarette use at all for so many other
reasons but if you're out one night and
you have one cigarette you're probably
gonna be okay this is a I u D I'm really
confused about this line I don't
understand what this is this is the
copper IUD as you can see the device is
lined with copper wire and the copper in
the IUD is toxic to the sperm so the
sperm cannot fertilize the egg
does not inhibit ovulation and it does
not affect your menstrual cycle what
will the effect of having been on birth
control for a decade be when I want to
get pregnant women always worry they've
been on the pill for 10 years how is
that gonna affect their fertility are
they going to be able to have a baby
when they want to and the answer is yes
because of the low dose of most birth
control pills there is little risk to
future fertility after stopping once you
stop your pills or once you take your
placebo pills within a very short period
of time the hormones that have regulated
or prevented your pregnancy will be gone
and you should be able to resume a
normal menstrual cycle very quickly
sometimes as rapidly as in one month for
other women it may take a little bit
longer why isn't there a dude pill we do
have the male condom and vasectomy I
don't see that there will be a hormonal
form of contraception for men because in
order to help them stop producing sperm
we would have to affect their
testosterone levels and I don't think
most men would be willing to deal with
the side effects of low testosterone I
don't know which option to go with the
best form of birth control is the one
that you'll remember to take whatever
you're using it has to be consistent you
have to be compliant so whether it's
condoms whether it's a diaphragm whether
it's a pill that you take every day or a
ring that you put in the vagina you have
to be compliant a lot of people take
birth control so that they don't get
pregnant but a lot of people take birth
control for other reasons too the
hormones in the birth control health to
regulate your hormones so that you have
possibly less acne less bleeding when
you have your menstrual cycle and
possibly less cramping so we use it for
medical problems - it seems like a lot
of our confusion stem from the fact that
we hadn't really been talking about
birth control I definitely think we
should open up the conversation about
birth control and it's like many uses a
lot earlier you can't be bashful you
have to know what it is that you're
putting inside of your body otherwise
you just like hear about it through
other people and you don't really know
what you're doing a lot of women are
raised to be modest and to be ashamed
and because of that they really don't
understand what's going on in their body
every month I think it's important that
a lot of young girls like know more
about it we think of birth control as a
political thing or a religious
non-religious thing but so much of it
just has to do with women's bodies there
should be open conversation it doesn't
have to be so scary I think
that if it were talked about more it
wouldn't seem so like wrong so let's
actually talk about birth control let's
talk about birth control let's talk
about birth control let's talk about
birth control let's talk about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
