of a pubic hair anthropology project
where she talks to a bunch of women
takes pictures and videotapes of their
pubic hair and learns about what I've
learned there's no expectation of what a
woman's pubic hair will look like based
on what she looks like no age where she
grew up it can be surprising the
interesting thing to me is why people
are removing their pubic hair and for a
lot of women I've talked to they start
really young like twelve or thirteen
just kind of you know in the shower just
taking a little off there but the word I
hear most come up is clean so just the
idea that having hair is somehow dirty
don't think it's dirty it's not dirty if
you wash it let's talk about some
different styles yes I'm gonna try to do
my best to walk us through the different
styles that I've encountered so we have
full bush which is like I don't do
anything to my pubic hair and it's
growing like crazy and I don't care then
you have I guess you could call it just
bush if you just sort of trim it
manicured manicured Bush that's a very
popular style there's a style and I
don't there's those different terms for
it but basically it's bush on top and
then stripped like around the lip and
butt crack yeah I like that style
actually one would just be like a
landing strip classic landing strip the
classic landing strip which is just like
pubic hair down the center we got
Brazilian that's nothing I don't know
what you'd call just people that strip
the sides and have bush in between like
keep that that's just like a bikini wax
maybe yeah just like bikini wax and then
there's the Dorito which would just be
is that something you've come up with no
you don't call it the Dorito which now
sounds like it's just an advertising
campaign for Doritos but not what they
want it to be the Dorito would just be a
triangle in the shape of the vagina not
like a reverse Illuminati situation that
would be called the Illuminati something
you've seen in your work or no no I
haven't seen anyone with an Illuminati
yet but I've seen people with smiley
faces and lightning strikes how are
these patterns coming just like freeform
artists you can do stencils but you can
go to someone to kind of wax with the
stencil but the people I met just kind
of have shaved in that shape and just
been able to like it's a basic if it's
like a simple smile and like two eyes
they just easily are able to make that
that does not seem easy nothing about
that seems easy to me I don't know so I
met people that have done that
people that have dyed their pubic hair
maile doing that big thing yeah so what
do you think is like the best pubic
hairstyle well I'd say that the best
pubic hair styles whatever works for you
who makes you comfortable and there's no
right or wrong pubic hair style your
experience is there one style that you
think should be like avoided yeah I'd
say to avoid complete laser hair removal
because you could regret that decision
later you may want that hair back and to
have that brought back via implants hair
implants which some women have done can
be very expensive and also not the best
procedure to do in such a sensitive area
you're sort of pursuing this because
nobody's talking about it and you want
to talk about it I want to talk about it
do you think it's important that people
talk about their pubic hair I figure why
not I mean if you're curious what other
people are doing it's a fun topic it's
nice to have a conversation with someone
to know you know like that your pubic
hair is if you care yeah and then at the
end of the day just be like well doesn't
matter because I dig how I look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
