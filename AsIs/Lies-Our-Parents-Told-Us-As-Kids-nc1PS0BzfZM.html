unhealthy my dad told me that if I had
too many eggs
one of them would grow into a chicken in
my stomach I think the main reason my
parents lied to me is because I was a
dumbass it's a very gullible right like
you can get away telling OK'd anything
they lie to me to get me to do stuff
that I didn't want to over they thought
I sure do oh my dad was a major troll so
I think sometimes just lied to me to
like have fun it's like the misguided
Indian attempt to make them more
productive members of society the Vitara
Bakshi was a gigantic board my grand mom
would always threaten me with she would
say if I didn't eat cauliflower all the
Patara box she would come swoop in and
eat me alive
we didn't know what decimals were so he
told us that we are paying a fortune
each time we bought junk food at home we
look at that Happy Meal toy like it was
the most baller thing in the world our
first dog was a hush puppy whose name
will be Tobin he was sent off to his
side which is a village near New Delhi
because we were told that you know
there's a bigger farmhouse and his
brothers there and he's going to be a
happier dog I got to know that he passed
away long back
there were so many things that my
parents passed off as do this or God
will be pissed and I would always be
like okay how would God be concerned
about me watching Pokemon at five
o'clock
and if I misbehave she would tell that
uncle and he would take me to boarding
school pee coffee any kind of of
beverage with caffeine always made you
light dark I am a shameful thing I was
pretty old I think my sister told me
that the Tooth Fairy doesn't exist and I
went to my mom and my mom's like no no
she's very real I was like okay sure
even if it might be a really minor lie
or it's not something really big it does
affect the child and it stays in there
this is why I'm up I need to restart
therapy session some day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
