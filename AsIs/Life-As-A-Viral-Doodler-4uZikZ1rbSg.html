my face
I've doodled my whole life I was in
class I was drawing I'm like out to eat
and I'm drawing back in 2013 a drawing I
did of Walter White on my leg went viral
on Reddit and that's pretty much how
this whole thing started on my Facebook
page as of today I have a hundred and
eighty nine thousand likes in this day
and age I think it's really important to
be connected to social media and really
put yourself out there i freelance
Photoshop and like concept art for
advertising and special effects studios
see I would say every job I've gotten so
far has been because of the internet
whether or not that's a good or bad
thing I don't know this is Chris Madsen
we went to college together and he goes
by glitch doctah as a music artist
recently I've started trying to tailor
the songs that make for Jody's videos to
fit the theme that she's working on
could you uh sure yeah
right now we are setting up to do the
time-lapse one day I'll have a studio
we're in the kitchen this is my primary
human canvas I also had known for feats
of strength I'm going to be drawing him
ripping open his back with a dinosaur
eating his fine I think what separates
the time lapses for like other art that
I do is it's for entertainment like I'm
drawing them to entertain people that's
why they're in the form of videos and I
guess it's less serious and you know
like drawing and painting on like
permanent canvases can be but it's fun
and I think that's always what it's been
for me it's a lot of fun so so yeah this
is our setup and we're pretty much ready
to go
boy
respecting word
um this time-lapse took about 45 minutes
and it's going to take about 10 minutes
to wash off the most rewarding part of
going viral is kind of the small things
that I try not to take for granted like
getting an email from a little girl like
she likes my art even though some of its
scary and to keep drawing probably the
most rewarding thing is inspiring other
people so if I can continue to do that
that'd be really cool
