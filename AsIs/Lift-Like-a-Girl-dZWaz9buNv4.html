compete about everything that comes with
it like you be so prepared both mentally
and physically I'm from Toronto area in
Canada but we fit into this way too low
CEO you gonna pick the five girls they
think look the best and they're going to
call them out and they're going to stand
in a row and then do these ones together
the same exact pose they came out in the
first 30 seconds relax tomorrow's is
called
where is that and the judge is going to
say quarter tune to the right there in
the middle that's the best spot that
means they're comparing everyone against
the person in the middle and not in the
middle and you're pushed to the outside
kind of every morning you wake up
and you like discover a new Bayon or a
new line or you're just that much leaner
so it's fun but it gets to a point which
is
Saturday where you can't go any further
30 minutes to drive for direct contact
with clothes or water and get more inch
you
to do these wonders in your pen come on
hey guys going I'm just like a tomboy I
always have been
I like track dance and buns on the top
of my head hmm
but it is fun to get girly every now and
then it's easy to forget to have balance
and to have fun and makes it extra hard
when you're in a relationship okay so
that's Justin tonight on our wedding day
laying here feeling sticky on our
anniversary reflecting about how do SH
like I've been this prep I thought I was
doing a good job balancing life the gym
and my work but thinking back I've
actually truly sucked a big D about it
Justin got the shaft and even though I
love the gym the gym without him is
nothing but a bunch of metal and Bo
we're best friends and have so much fun
together and Hardy together laugh
together get high together go eat 25
pounds of food and like food comb
ourselves together and yeah i was just
neglecting the fun stuff and the stuff
that makes our relationship our
relationship it look like I'm from Texas
this is the meanest I've seen your face
yeah it's weird
you still look adorable though so we
took a diuretic the night before so that
pulls up the water at the same time we
um we eat a lot of carbohydrates so that
also pulls water from underneath the
skin into the muscle and then it fills
up the muscle and then presses against
the skin appearing harder and fuller but
at the same time it also pulls all the
water out of your face the more carbon
you eat the more up your face
looks but the better your body looks
mineral yeah hey guys happy Valentine's
Day
hmm yeah easy way out
I find that bloodshot's everyone are
either wants to lose five pounds or gain
five pounds or I want my butt bigger I
want my boobs to be fake like think
everyone's always wanting to change
something yeah it messes with your head
a little bit like you have to have
balance you have to have fun there's
more to life than just the gym and just
being lean and having abs
I went around what are you guys looking
at every third laugh look at me though
done 16 weeks of training for 16 seconds
of of just like a joke he could have
been maybe she was too hard for the Uzi
and then they don't really like abs and
dads are pretty junky it was just for
fun and that's that's what this is all
about
so like this bull should not even
comparing yourself down a people most
people shouldn't compare themselves to
her and that's how it always should be I
think the main thing is just always love
what you have and love your body and if
you're not happy with it you can't
change it but love doing that because
the process is fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
