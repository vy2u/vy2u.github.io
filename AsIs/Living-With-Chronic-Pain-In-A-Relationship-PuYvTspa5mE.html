going away for two weeks essentially
just Lara and I on what's supposed to be
a life-changing $91 just to be
comfortable feels like there's an ice
pick
fire-breathing dragon
pretty much just want to stay in bed all
day and I don't want to go do this at
all so we'll see all right so we are
here at the is it just the Carmen Lee
Carmen Carmen Cara laser so we treat
paint the laser companies are putting
out there yeah just treat your patients
six or eight times and then if it
doesn't work after that it doesn't work
well that's not true
when chronic illness and chronic pain
I've been to I mean every kind of
therapy you can imagine for this I've
had so many patients that come to me
that have been to several physicians
they're great physicians but they're
limited it's like surgery or medication
I've been told since I was like 19 years
old to just get a hysterectomy
I think that's insane or should we think
surgery is as an answer there yeah we
think that is not the route that I ever
choose to take with this we can think
out of the box and if you think out of
the box and there are other options for
you there are natural options I'm really
excited to show you the t3 protocol that
we've developed the t3 stands for
treating the trauma the toxins and the
thought so we treat the trauma that's
happened to the body toxins that can be
involved in not being able to get better
and then the thoughts as well let's set
some goals that would be realistic that
we could say you know what I can do this
versus this when I came right right
let's say drinking and eating yeah so
every time you eat every time you drink
you have pain yeah my goal would kind of
just be to be able to go out to dinner
with my boyfriend or go out with friends
and not have to go home immediately
afterward because of how uncomfortable I
am I used to be really hesitant to date
because I'm like okay I would go out you
know how there's like all these memes
about girls who eat salads instead of
eating steak and it's like I always get
so mad cuz I'm like well some people
have dietary restrictions like
sorry I don't want to have extreme
diarrhea on my date because I'm eating
steak just to impress you my therapist
told me that I should try and write a
letter to
the doctor who did this to me I haven't
spoken to him since the surgery we tried
to sue and we couldn't because of the
statute of limitations so my therapist
suggested write a letter that I'm gonna
like burn so I'm gonna do that as part
of this but like and what we'll do in
the side K is we're just gonna forgive
that I know how hard that is I'm gonna
cry yes why but you know what it's just
the only way to go yeah right the only
way to go people are skeptical because
it's just not out there and that's why
I'm so excited about this because this
will change the world as can change the
understanding that laser can help you
with pain and let's hope we can do that
so this is a the detox area which I love
doing it we love the word detox that's
like our favorite way yeah I have these
vials back here and they have a specific
frequency of the talks end of it
this is a signal enhancer I'm just gonna
put this on your stomach because these
actually transfers the signal as well so
I'm gonna ask you to hold your arm up so
you don't want to push back or push for
you just wanna really have a steady hold
and I'm always gonna say hold for me and
I'm gonna push down and you just hold
your own in the position when you feel
something that's weak you're gonna feel
like in muscles like you're gonna be
able to not hold it up then then just
let it go down because that's the way
we're gonna communicate that your body
has a toxin or it doesn't what we found
is when we do this muscle testing we can
find substances that have a toxic
overload in your body so just put your
arm up for me please
I can hold my arm up for every freaking
thing for every sulfate for every
chemical and then the second she put
that trigeminal everyone in my hand it's
my arm clad hold for me alright so you
can that you can barely hold right do
you know what that is no it's the dioxin
we can find dioxin and today's food in
the milk in meats and it's really a
herbicide that is sprayed everywhere and
it's just coming and showing up in all
different areas of our life there are
some studies that link dioxins
endometriosis everybody that I treated
with the dioxin
they all had fantastic results it's like
not bananas science like it's just like
simple testing it's like when you were
talking about doing testing we're like
oh she's gonna take blood so this all
this you're holding in your hand is
the bad stuff yeah like look at the
difference between mine in your I mean
it makes so much sense to me yeah
whatever I think so what we're doing
here is we're taking a pulsed laser and
we're putting that toxin that we found
through the laser when you understand
how it works you're gonna understand
that it doesn't matter what you have
that vibration matches the vibration
that's on your cells or in yourselves
and it releases that's all we are
ourselves and the laser goes directly
into the mitochondria of these cells and
stimulates their regeneration their
growth that's what laser is all about
it's just you doing the healing and
we're giving you energy to do that so
like we've seen so many people that have
tried to heal us and in a weird way
being here is like we're healing
ourselves yes I want to believe so bad
that in a month two months from now I
will be better sometimes I'm like really
positive and sometimes I just get into
my head and I'm like is this a waste of
time like am I just buying into this the
way people buy into like pyramid schemes
on Facebook and start selling you
leggings like I don't know day two this
is the newest machine that we have the
VelaShape and what I really love about
this this you put on like a nice suit
very specific patented technology where
it sucks up your skin
gives laser and light hmm it stimulates
your lymphatic drainage this like
bodysuit is like very 2017 fashion it's
interesting being with Kelsey because
you never know when she's in pain but
with me like you know when I'm in pain
so this is the other room that no great
you guys - we're gonna have a treatment
that stimulates your immune system so we
do the carotid arteries the adrenal
glands the heart so we're just gonna
give your body energy to start healing
my body always tends a little bit when
anyone gets near that area force
it is very hard for me to feel any sort
of like touching around that area
because it will just my body only
remembers pain so on a scale of 0 and 10
being extreme what would you have that
as of today if I actually tried to have
sex it would be like attend well just
like they say their understanding about
like oh you have pelvic pain I won't do
too much but like even touching me with
like a q-tip is doing too much you know
I'm spending 4 hours a day minimum at
this treatment center getting treatment
like I'm still having pain Suzie Easy's
treatment I've had like what I yeah
this is the area I'm most interested in
seeing what's gonna happen with it hi
sexy Barry and Frank's cars I want to
feel what it's like to have my face back
so this is a laser with a massage ball a
glass fall so as soon as I press this
the laser goes off and now you're
getting the double you're getting the
massage and laser and it feels amazing
incredible just like a water bed but IRL
not only does this treatment not hurt it
feels good
the massage was amazing but now I feel
like so who knows
that's what's tricky about this process
is it doesn't we're just laying there
and then you go home and you're like why
do I feel like I got hit by a
truck you're just having a light on you
but it's doing so much
you turn to the side it's also good
detoxing stone detoxing dioxin today so
I think I'm like Bonnie we like clearing
up with crazy cuz of all the
meanwhile pepper just mean her this is
the true love story thankful we never
wear pants anymore I would like them I
don't even want it to excited but I'm
not having any bad burning in my chin
which is where it's always localized all
the time
I'm feeling a little bit better today
but to be honest I'm still not 100% I'm
still very sad and I'm just kind of
burnt out so what we're gonna do in this
segment is addressing your belief system
addressing the emotional part if you're
a person that has had such chronic pain
you've seen so many doctors and I'm not
putting doctors down at all but you've
seen so many physicians you're
researching you're seeing you know I
can't help there's no help I have too
much pain nobody can help me so your
belief system becomes weakened and every
time you see somebody every time there's
a result where I thought this was gonna
help and it didn't help now what's the
belief system this didn't help either
when you say you have a hard time are
you forgiving the doctor or that you
just don't you don't mean like going
there would that be okay if we go there
yeah I mean I I'm sure like all that
comes up is like anger and sadness
mm-hmm so just can you imagine the
freedom you'd have if you'd forgive him
right yeah I just don't know what
dumping all of this back onto him would
make me feel right look I don't know if
I feel better but I also him like he
deserves to know like that's why I I I
just I shut down cuz I go is there a
time where you remember being pain free
I don't know if I really truly remember
it just feels like so bad now I remember
being happier and that makes me sad it's
hard to explain but one of my biggest
fears is kind of like
letting the pain win I kind of feel like
I'm always teetering on the edge of just
complete darkness
so I guess my fear is falling into that
darkness muddy in the cloud like
overtake me forever on my bad mental
health days I see myself as like a
monster who's just this like really
difficult person to deal with who's like
always sad and always in pain and just
like always depressed and I'm just this
like elephant that goes into the rooms
and just like knocks everything over it
just reminds people of like sadness like
I don't know it's just like I just
convinced myself that I don't know
people just don't want to hear about it
sometimes so the best would be for us to
find a statement that would let you deal
with it
yeah you know that would think even just
like I forgive you
right that would be the easiest yeah
it's just I forgive you even at
wholeheartedly because it really wants
to come from a place of love and like
even you saying that I want to vomit
just think about and thinking about
things how because I like I almost don't
believe it you're afraid of the darkness
so we say I am light I am light do you
think it's all just like
do it I don't I don't think it's all
 but I also do it makes it very
much I forgive all heartedly I don't
even remember much something came in the
mail for Lara and pepper Parker and I
have no idea what it is and the only
person I can think that would send it
would be my boyfriend Patrick talk about
Pat dating someone who has a chronic
illness is not easy but he's just a
great guy like I don't know how I got so
lucky sometimes I don't feel like I
deserve it he was like my what is it
like your safety blanket or whatever
like he is that to me my favorite
chocolate I just wishing this year like
I wish I could just have a distraction I
wish I get just hot again look datings
already hard enough there's so
many conversations that need to be had
about like intimate the same way
endometriosis does just like kissing or
like blowjob and it's embarrassing and
it sucks and I don't want people to feel
sad for me and I want people feel sorry
for me and I feel like as soon as I
introduce TN into the relationship it
becomes like this like oh it's important
for us to show people in our lives that
we love what we actually go through
because otherwise they're just never
gonna get it and we're gonna get
frustrated at them for not getting it
but we're refusing to show them so I
just don't wake up every morning
and like my face is really red and then
everything feels block
she's been lasering like all around my
vagina and like my lower back and like
my pelvic floor muscles and stuff and
that makes sense to me but in order to
have the inside of my vagina healed and
be able to possibly you know do all the
things that I can't do right now like
insert large tampons or you know have
penetration like it makes sense to me
that it needs to go inside to do the
work I am now going to try this baby yes
this will be going inside my vagina if I
can get it there I have my handy dandy
from coconut oil here to help get this
 in and we're just going to
see how it goes and I'm obviously not
gonna film it because this isn't a porno
guess who the just entered the
probe for 20 minutes you rich 20 minutes
20 minutes and it didn't even
hurt
I didn't even hurt I like regret so much
since I got Botox I hadn't been going to
physical therapy
I get laser aim 15 treatments in ten
minutes and it's still in two weeks no
if I didn't cert mine I later and I
couldn't so something's changed
I don't want to say it cuz I'm scared to
jinx it but I think the lasers work I
mean the proof is in my vagina right now
I'm so excited for you dude that's crazy
you know but you're nice
just imagine if I could insert super
tampons without excruciating pain if I
could orgasm without excruciating pain
if I could have sex I've never done that
I've never done that I've never done
that and I might be able to go that's
 crazy
next time on can we cure how the tides
have chained I just started in my period
and it'll be really interesting to see
how this goes
we leave tomorrow and I still haven't
written this letter to the
doctor I'm hoping that this is the new
normal
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
