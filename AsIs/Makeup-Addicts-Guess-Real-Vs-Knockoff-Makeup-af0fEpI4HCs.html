will get you today we're going to
distinguish between real and knockoff
makeup we're going to find the fake
totally worked at Ulta have this in the
bag I will know what's real I will know
it's fake I am quite confident that I'll
be able to tell what is fake and what is
real all right you ready for this I'm
ready let's do this there's a difference
in the images if you look at like this
person's weight Tanner do you see how
like goofy - yeah its water that's what
I'm thinking coming up chunky this is
the dud this is the real thing this one
is real and this one is phony oh my god
thanks Ivan I think yours is the real
one hello yes what I'm looking for is if
it lends well into the skin or if it's a
little like Oh lumpy Waller this
wouldn't feel softer yeah but I don't
know does that mean it's like real or
the powder is not as smooth as this one
I believe that this one's a fake one
this one's the real one guys
I think it might be the real one we
think this one's real these are raised
more this is higher production value
already coming through the damn brush
yeah I know this one definitely feels
like the real thing is that it yeah
yours is real okay blush yes you think
it's this one I agree with her
the font looks like it was made on like
WordArt this is what all her other ones
look like yeah but this is really
glittery like who's gonna put like
glitter central on their feet oh
this is so cheap looking this is the
real one this is real I know that's the
real one
I'm confident three four four I'm bomb
calm the only reason why I didn't get
math is because I never sold it so today
we got three out of four correct we're
pretty happy this was a lot harder than
I thought it was gonna be some of the
fake stuff was good quality when you
actually put on your skin it was just
the packaging that like meat made it
stand out yeah whatever
oh you guys if you got this we got this
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
