today we are trying the Rihanna Donna
lipstick in a video prior to this one I
tried Rihanna's entire makeup line I'm
obsessed with her lip gloss I use it
every single day so I wonder how I'm
gonna feel about the lip paint I'm not
like the biggest makeup person like like
I have lipsticks right but they don't
get you I'm going to make sure it's
waterproof is it kiss proof perhaps more
importantly is it gonna come off on
their face well they have one of those
awkward marks throughout their day can I
eat with it one everyone's got to eat
last but not least will it last but not
least Wow
thank you I do think it's modeled after
her style which is a tag they should
start turning makeup products into
actual weapons could you imagine not
calling I'm a when I'll handle it here
myself it's applying like paint
the it's too much it's everywhere come
down let me just come down and figure
out how to control it the fact that I
have yet to dump it back in like that to
me it's pretty dull I think I should
stop because I don't get real clarity or
fast I should stop mom click on the head
I'm poppin y'all like Rihanna where you
got me stunting over here with this done
everyone knows this in the makeup world
I guess except for me that was very hard
to apply it is all over my hands and it
was at a point off mic on my face ladies
and gentlemen this is something so as
you can see Exhibit A there is a lip
mark there so this was like my man when
I was young that's Morris y'all I was
little kissing but let me get some
privacy let me you know Phelan let me do
my thang it definitely rubbed off a
little bit not a lot or enough though
for you to get your ass whooped if you
go home and you have one of these on
your shirt on your on your cheek we just
let me try drinking I mean Missy
did it come off on the cup yes does it
still look pretty good on my mouth
yes so I just finished eating like a
full meal it's gone is gone yeah and
look at my lips they're not bleeding
they're not like no lipstick on the
teeth it's still like I just applied it
still my lips a plus they stole my lips
not as beautiful as it was in the
beginning but it's still like if you in
a club or in a bar who's gonna notice
that your lips are not popping like you
don't have to apply anything you can
have your drinks are you straight still
pop and I think this is an interesting
test me trying to wipe it off
you really got to put in some effort
this was only one application and it's
still the bottom ellipse as you can see
it does not look good but I don't think
it was made for long-wear and Yasuhara
plating I only applied it once that
didn't do extra so a minus for my girl
Ruby so this is the honest to goodness
truth yesterday I could not have this
red lip on all day I couldn't take it I
felt embarrassed because it was to read
for me and embarrassment is the feeling
I felt that being said the lipstick is
great I like it it's for the holiday
party for me but walking around into
different restaurants and whatnot
clothes a little bit strange I could see
people looking at my mouth and going
this a hard mouth normally looks that
being said it's a very good lip sync
