swap morning routines for a week it's
really terrifying I have never been more
over anything in my entire life
so today kind of sucks going to be
swapping beauty routines with tan and I
don't know what hers is but I don't
think it involves much makeup at all
which is kind of scary
I'm kind of concerned for you as well
because when I started wearing makeup I
don't know you start with the basics but
I feel like the amount that I wear like
isn't the basics right all right let's
go okay so next that make sense
yeah I do like it relatively yeah
where's your notebook oh sorry hey kiddo
please pour it looks okay it's pretty
complicated so I'll wake up you can you
keeping up with all this information
yeah I'm just trying yeah good luck
young when I imagine what I look like I
have makeup on so it's kind of like a
bit of a sense of identity thing I guess
like when I don't have makeup on I just
don't feel like myself I just don't feel
like me ready I'm really scared about
what my colleagues and friends are gonna
say I'm gonna have to explain myself to
everyone this is way too much perfect
even a did it like me knows that but who
knows there might be aspects of it that
I enjoy I've never tried it so far so
good I don't feel like I've completely
changed as an individual
I'd have to blend you
that I don't wrong I'm not wrong you
just didn't blend I was just having a
drink with a friend who kept saying it's
different about you all I could think
about on the way home was how good it
would be to just lie down in bed and
fall asleep this glove huh
I just want to go to bed so one good
thing about my new makeup free lifestyle
is that I can just press my face on
anything in anyone I want my housemates
teasing me
I'm so done with this challenge at this
point I feel like I'm missing a part of
my identity and a step and how I get
ready to face the world every morning so
it's only day two and I've been teased
by through the closest people in my life
it shouldn't matter so much to them when
I write when a couple donphan obviously
people are really affected by it I
really like this eyebrow part okay one
good thing about no wearing makeup is
that if you get an itchy eyebrow you can
actually scratch it that is one perk and
that's all I'm giving you tan oh I'm
running right I'm already supposed to
have left the house I know but I've
gotta come to our done this snapchat
filter has been getting such around this
week I've never left the house so late
in my life
eyebrows on point though so I have a
beauty launch tonight I have to leave in
a few minutes and I just don't know if I
can go without makeup
what a week we're halfway through now
it's been interesting I just hate it I
hate it so much I was trying to be a
little bit like I just like a bland
boring version of myself I'm getting the
strangest looks everyone's kind of doing
double takes mostly like 9 out of 10
people are laughing at me and teasing me
who are you being bullied I feel like it
shouldn't matter what
someone's wearing makeup on our oh not
again I have never been more over
anything in my entire life
so today kind of sucks I'm starting a
art course tonight I'm going to my mom's
house for family lunch she's never seen
me makeup I feel like I don't know I
just like I'm giving off this weird
first impression isn't actually me you
don't look like yourself I'm pretty over
it today to be honest it just sucks
out of about 50 interactions only one
person has said a nice thing about my
makeup this is not normal I'm freaking
out right now
what you have lipstick on this is very
different
I should probably highlight each other
no no I'm uncomfortable I feel like I
prefer you we have it I don't think that
I've ever seen you go out though so did
I know with no makeup on do I look okay
yeah you look good
how is my makeup free week thing oh yeah
it's been really good I really enjoyed
it
why I think it's good to see that the
rest of the world gets to see what you
actually look like it's weird but no one
has actually said anything to me about
the fact I've stopped wearing makeup and
I seriously think it's because they
don't to offend me this is me trying to
put liquid eyeliner on and ruining
liquid eyeliner for the whole entire
world I'm coming for you tomorrow
daybreak I'll miss you guys
but the last day of the makeup challenge
I'm stuffy in four hours I can go back
to looking pimple-faced and Tyler's
I felt like I'm not myself I felt really
boring and dull it was kind of a good
realization that I actually wear makeup
for me it's been fun like it's been kind
of nice not having to do it and having
that extra time in the morning but I've
missed it at the same time to be honest
I kind of had a love-hate relationship
with it I just love these eyebrows I'm
going to miss these eyebrows just so big
like I really actually enjoyed sitting
down every morning and having time to
myself but at the same time people in my
life
reacted really negatively toward it so
pretty much everyone from like my ex to
my best friends even my mom it really
goes to show how much makeup and clothes
and generally the way we present
ourselves affects how other people see
us don't you love this happening to you
know and I think they in the same vein
it showed me how much the way I present
myself to others makes me feel about
myself and like my identity yeah I guess
at the end of the day each to their own
we all do things for ourselves and it's
not up to anyone else it is fun
sometimes stepping out of the bubble and
trying new things but essentially we
present how we feel inside and that's
all that should matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
