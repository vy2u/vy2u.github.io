it's like a Mediterranean dish I'm
really into makeup I spend all my money
on so for an Ulta I want makeup every
day I like a full face I pretty much use
everything but the kitchen sink it's a
concern of mine what's going on my face
which is why I try to use higher in
makeups cuz I assume that because
they're higher-end they'll have better
ingredients or probably won't kill me
but that might be wrong I've never tried
organic makeup actually quite the
opposite I literally buy my makeup on
Amazon most of the time does worry me
sometimes that I don't know what's in it
and I know my skin is the largest organ
I have and it's probably taking in a lot
of chemicals so for organic make of I
just always assumed that if they
wouldn't have anything in my foundation
shade range no I like kind of a beet
looking face an organic feels natural
if I pass by like an organic makeup
store I feel like it's probably I don't
know like a fad or something that's like
super overprized and doesn't really do
anything maybe I'm wrong I'm often wrong
so
hi nice to meet you I'm Susie I'm so
glad you guys are here to find out more
about 100% pure 100% pure is exactly
that it's skincare and color cosmetics
and hair care products that are truly
100% pure when you read our ingredients
you'll actually notice oh I know this
herb I know this fruit I know this
ingredient the only process that's
happened to the ingredient is by natural
fermentation you know when you're using
birth control patches or nicotine
patches all the drugs is actually like
being delivered through your skin so
whatever you put on your skin it does
get absorbed into our bodies I feel like
I'm gonna get scared in this literally
bought makeup on Amazon
people love matte lipsticks right the
reason why matte lipsticks are so dry is
because there's this petro chemical in
it like a Teflon Teflon is the same
material that's in like or tex jackets
to repel water when I used to work for
these big cosmetic brands what I do know
is that they care about profits one
misconception is that organic products
they're not gonna be as good but in
actuality they're better because we're
not using like cheap fillers I guess
when I saw the store I assumed that I
wouldn't be able to find anything in my
skin shade anyways
and if I did then they would have
undertones that were incorrect or
something colored tons in your range
could oxidize and then it could get ashy
right ray and almost his look lavender
so it took us many many years to get
like beautiful shades are very
complementary we're launching these new
range of foundations in about 30 colors
or so in a few months all colored from
cocoa bean like peach pigments fruit
pigments are you guys ready to see how
amazing fruit pigments are
so after visiting 100% pure I have a lot
to think about
I'm happy to hear that organic makeup
uses through pigments I don't really
know what fruit has sparkles but they
figured it out alright it's time to take
off my normal look and put on organic
makeup I'm gonna start with the luminous
primer how do you make an organic primer
I can't read that first thing oh okay so
I'm reading the French version my face
feels really soft that doesn't feel like
what I was anticipating which I'm not
mad at now we can do foundation this is
pretty big my head like there's a lot of
color in here that is lighter than I was
anticipating it being I honestly feel
like I don't even need a setting powder
kind of just dried onto my face okay so
it's blended it's not it's not bad I'm
gonna now go in with the concealer
blending blending it doesn't really look
like a hive on makeup which is beside
the point I'm supposed to look like I
have a makeup I'm pretty pleased
actually with the amount of like
coverage that this makeup has I'm a
little shocked now on to my eyebrows
which don't exist without makeup there's
a fiber brow builder it's made out of
green tea fiber which is interesting so
this doesn't look bad I think I'm just
not used to this for some reason my left
eyebrow is so much harder to put off
with my right eye brows for the Lib this
is the part I'm most excited for this
lip color looks perfect prickly pear and
it's a matte lipstick I am obsessed with
like liquid matte lipsticks this
lipstick is super moisturizing like it
feels really good on my mouth I tend to
eat a lot of my lipstick so actually
this might be good for me because it is
made out of fruits I am gonna be
surprised if I end up liking this
particularly if I end up liking it more
than what I normally use I sit here for
eight hours a day so I needed to last
for at least eight hours and
you know if I go to a happy hour after
work or something I need my makeup to
stay on this looks pretty much like my
everyday face okay I gotta go live my
life with this new organic look
I just finished my lunch ideas salad I
was a little worried that my lipstick
wouldn't look up but and actually it's
looking pretty good
how do you think my makeup was quite
natural actually yeah well guess what
it's made out of
don't say bugs this week I'm wearing
makeup made out of fruit so you so today
I'm gonna try this lip caramel hmm it
smells really nice yes build me up I
think I'm dying every five seconds I
think I have a terminal disease and I'm
dying so this is one less thing that I
think that'll kill me so that's peace of
mind that I need
Sally it's my favorite person today
because she just complimented me on my
lipstick this week I'm wearing makeup
that's 100 percent pure and natural
everything yes I don't think I can do
that
probably not would you wear organic
makeup yeah I'll try it out I just yeah
I think what I'm wearing right now it
might be organic I didn't end up having
any time to retouch my makeup at all so
this is just how it sits after the day
nothing else has come
you're like my skin has gotten better I
haven't had any breakouts or any
problems and my previous blemishes have
pretty much cleared up the one thing I
really liked and we're gonna continue
using our dye brows I've actually gotten
a few compliments on my makeup today
which I'm super stoked about I'm glad I
get to wear my regular makeup again I am
a lot more cautious of what I'm putting
on my face now and much more aware since
I know all these facts that I wish I
didn't know this lip color man has just
served me well
