Joe's basket-case eyeliner by Kat Von D
I love eyeliner eyeliner is actually one
of the few things that I feel like I can
just wear that and walk out and feel
super feminine so every day I have like
a very very like cousin cat eye eye line
on and I just I don't know how to do ass
21 and that's kind of why I won't try
this just to see if I can smudge it oh
I'm a huge makeup junkie and I love
eyeliner more so on the bottom then on
the top this is also involving Green Day
and Billie Joe Armstrong which is my
favorite thing on the planet
it looks like Dookie you know them vegan
marker super important so trick it's
getting all up in there
okay but I expect to look just like
Billy Joe when this is done like when
you guys look like Al Bundy if I don't
look like handi and walk my money back I
mean it guys all nice big nice it's not
even like following my eye line I really
wanted to try and like have like a
punk-rock attitude towards this which is
just like Nessie is good and you just
kind of want to black out the eyes this
is very convenient though having a
sharpener at the bottom like I lose my
sharpeners all the time that's what
these are for yeah I always think
eyeliner things are like what is the
sharpener okay see I'm even trying to
make a wing
why am I trying to do that assuming you
should do it Howard because it's a
decision it's not to note real nice yes
it's appointment whoo look at this we'll
smoke it up here we go you'd probably
use it as lipstick to your knowing cat
oh I'm about to try that it's ready
creamy Oh what the list bad boy I feel
like a basket case so I feel like if you
know how to apply it you'll probably
kill it with this thing I'm mostly here
because I support Kat Von D and I buy
anything with Green Bay's name on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
