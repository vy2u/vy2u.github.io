we're in downtown we're currently
scouting for cool spots for me to do my
OTD outfit of the day because I had a
consistent quality content Instagram
featured me on this suggested user list
too so that helped boost my numbers by
like a quarter of what you see now I
started a couple months after instagrams
inception so I had no idea what I was
doing when I'm searching for the perfect
spot to take a photo if I'm at home I
look for really clean crisp architecture
and if I'm abroad then I look for
architecture that fits the vibe of
whatever city I'm in and OTD is a
hashtag use mostly on Instagram but it
means outfit of the day I do owe TVs
almost every day okay so I'm actually
five three possibly five two but I'm in
denial so whenever people take pictures
of me I always ask that they squat and I
take a picture of me angled up so I look
taller or else I get little tiny legs we
don't want
the people who take my photos if it's on
the iPhone its whoever I'm with even my
mom my dad but if it's on through DSLR
then I have my photographer Randy to
take my photos
okay
he's got it he's got it when I was like
18 I thought I wanted to be photographer
but that's before I knew I was really
bad at it and I quit
but being an instagramer has really
opened my eyes to new perspectives and I
can't say I'm anywhere near as talented
as a photographer but it has opened my
eyes to how the photographer sees the
world I had been calling my hair since I
was 15 I did all the crazy colours in
high school I had like dip dyed hair
before it wasn't even a faint
I recently stopped a couple months ago
because I wanted to go back to blonde
and I noticed that people didn't like it
as much I think my friends know what
looks good on me though I have colored
hair again I think people used to be
surprised that you can make money off
Instagram but I find that nowadays less
and less people are surprised because
Instagram such a huge part of
everybody's life you know some brands
I've worked with our Acuras W hotels
whom nowadays I blog maybe every other
day because I'm so busy but I think you
should Instagram every single day I'm
gonna try to get a good Instagram sweet
photo for you
I don't like placemats we're taking the
placemats out the cups the condensation
has left like rings on the table so you
want to clean that up and it doesn't
need to be like super lined up parallel
to the table or anything it's kind of
nice to see it a little askew and I like
to get it from
and eagles I'd point-of-view unedited so
I like to edit my photos through this go
cam my favorite filters are s2 and a6
the biggest hurdle for this photo was
retouching all the little specks on the
table because the dust was really
prominent in this photo i retouched the
stains on the silverware the dust on the
table it's just like photography in
general you know nothing's gonna be
perfect right when you capture the photo
so I figured that if you can make a
photo better than why not
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
