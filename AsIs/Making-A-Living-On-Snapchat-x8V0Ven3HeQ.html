awesome snapchat story today I've got a
buddy coming over and you guys are gonna
help us make a snapchat story all right
so app you can film stuff Hey look
you're on camera you can draw on it and
then goes on your story here you can see
I wrote please give me a candy because I
wanted candy last night and then it
disappears it's gone forever that's
what's so cool about snapchat got
BuzzFeed video got Evan garbage they're
all on their phones and there are
filters so you can say the time or you
hang out but there it goes and put on
your story good to go
you're alive we're having fun on
snapchat right now high five most my
friends on snapchat would probably
describe me as ping I don't know like
hyped on life so that's what I'm trying
to do on Sanchez like share like a
positive message to like go out live
life do something exciting I flew in a
helicopter in Alaska like snapchatted
the whole thing and it's just like
people are pumped every day like oh my
gosh I love your septa stories every day
after watching because it's like my
little escape for the day
maybe yeah that's a cool story so my
name is Sean I went to Honduras on a
mission for my church two years came
home everyone's like Sean's back from
Honduras Sean Burris and just kind of
stuff so now I'm Sean Burris it's
actually funny two kids kids will send
me snapchats all the time be like oh my
gosh you're in my history book and
they'll draw a little ass in front of
the Honduras like you know there's a
country that's like your name I'm like
yeah so we're explaining to them before
we start any snapchat story shonduras
story starts with cereal so we're gonna
sit down with must be non vult zero
right now you're out of milk that's not
good I'm trying to explain to BuzzFeed
why it's so important that we have to
have cereal and before we make a
snapchat story it just is in all honesty
like cereal actually is a food that I
love and I eat it all the time multiple
times a day
and I think it's also something that the
people who watch my snapchat stories can
understand and relate to because
everyone loves a good bowl of cereal
right so that's why I always put on
snapchat all right we've got our milk
here in our cereal and we are
you know we're almost ready to start
making the snapchat story and we've only
been here for like an hour so you know
this is the process all right the
snapchat story has officially started
getting you some cereal sometimes I'm
just walking you're out and people get
oh my gosh
you're the snapchat guy when they come
up and get a selfie with me and it's
awesome and then it disappears forever
but it's fun while happens it's way
weird like I ain't downloading snapchat
a little over a year ago and I
definitely didn't think it would like
send me the different parts of the world
like I just went to Bangkok Thailand and
made a snapchat story
I rode elephants and played with tires
and there's like crazy fun and it was by
Marriott hotels they set me there and
never thought that would have happened
just by trying pictures on my phone so
learned how to draw fun adventures
combine them cool drawings fun
adventures people love that they told
their friends at school the friends told
friends we got featured on reddit this
that southern exploded and now I have
like hundreds of thousands of people who
just like love checking out my stories
every day I don't know we're going to go
beach or something haven't been a beach
since I mean Californian so we'll just
go the beach and start making snapchats
and something cool happen
what's up snapchat we're on the beach we
made it to the beach
we're gonna take a picture ready
I gotta get barefooting at the water can
me up there
got to get in the water cuz I don't have
beaches in Utah
oh we're actually sitting in the wings
we just went and played in the water it
feels very warm and it makes for a fun
snapchat I think I'm eating my hair I
want you guys to be a part of this
BuzzFeed video so send me a snap of you
at the beach so it's super fun because
my goal every day is just to like make
people enjoy life like for 10 seconds
make someone smile and then it
disappears but that's an awesome job to
have right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
