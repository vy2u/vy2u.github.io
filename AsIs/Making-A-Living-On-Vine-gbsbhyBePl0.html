yeah I have 1.3 million yeah I would say
that's famous I'm Marissa main I'm Joey
I'm Paige
and we're Mentor Ohio no my definition
of being famous would be just having a
good following being kind of popular
whether you're popular in like physical
life or on the in the cyber world
basically like my condo they know me
because I'm really loud and everything
act out like it bounces off the walls so
um yeah pretty much everyone knows me do
it first ready ready 1 2 3
good that's right
one two you can like drag clips and you
can crop clips and you can move these
ones over and when you add it to your
channel which is comedy
Shem was like what the it was like
I love this for some sort of reason
sometimes if it's like a good vine it'll
get like within the 15-minute cycle
it'll get like 500 likes and then if it
gets like 2,000 within an hour or two
then that means that gets doing kind of
really good for me is more into socks I
never wear matching socks you caught me
I'm day where I bought a fresh pack of
socks but I do have cool socks
underneath them I've been doing vine for
about two years and may it'll be two
years how did this get started um I made
a video mouthing like sounds to Nicki
Minaj's songs and it like went viral and
then I just kept making videos and I
just went and I just grew really fast
I like vine because it's just quick and
it just if I have something in my head I
could post it I'd had no intention of
being famous on vine I um just made a
couple vines and then the one that did
go viral it had like a whole bunch of
likes and then I made more and then I
just keep kept getting like a ton of
followers yeah there's a couple ways you
can make money online you can do
promotions for companies you can do
product placements I do a side job um I
work with special needs adults so I do
that and I do vine but vine is where
most of my income comes from
but people are buying like sewing to
like your fat and then feel a little
like don't come to my so I'll beat your
ass and then people will be like don't
talk to Marissa like that it'll be like
you're just jealous you're a hater and
it's a whole bunch of people just coming
back at that person so hater comments
are just from people trying to get
attention or trying to get followers or
just people who just are naturally
hateful in general I know you see all of
these my hater layer it's the haters out
and the warmth eat that's how I felt
about hater i don't care they make me
fabulous be yourself just do what makes
you happy and you know don't try to be
anything that you aren't because it's a
waste of time
and it's not worth it so if you're
trying to be famous on any kind of
social platform just be yourself
you
so awkwardly people play your vines
around you and you have to hear your
voice it is just so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
