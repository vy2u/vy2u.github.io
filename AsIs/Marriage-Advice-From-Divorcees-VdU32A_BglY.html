love yourself and take care of yourself
be happy within yourself and by yourself
before you can be happy with someone
else you have to already be happy
because nobody can give you that get
premarital counseling cuz you need to
talk about money you need to talk about
religion you talk about how you're gonna
raise kids you don't have to be exactly
the same but you have to have a common
ground if you have a problem and you
have an issue work it out gonna have to
learn how to fight fairly without having
to feel that one person is right or one
person is wrong it's okay to tell
someone they disappointed you
most important thing is respect so
choose your words wisely coz you can
never take them back and once you hurt
someone I think you have to be friends
first try to be each other's best friend
be sensitive to each other trust each
other
lean to each other for support just let
them be who they are they may not be
perfect and they don't have to be
perfect but you have to accept that they
are imperfect and actually love them for
their imperfections it's the small
things that an aggregate comprise a
really healthy and fun relationship to
always give compliments tell your
partner you love them every day close
the door when you take a dump
be spontaneous give gifts when they're
not expected don't stop having sex if
you're keeping track of how often you're
having sex you're not having sex enough
you have to have time together to be
able to always just continually
reconnect don't get married unless you
really want I'm not sure I really wanted
to get married so the whole divorce
thing was like oh God um it's uh it's
it's not fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
