Kelsey that we have a show not that word
on Ned and I'm married I'm Kelsey and
I'm very single you've submitted
relationship questions but we are not
qualified to answer them but we're gonna
try to anyways so today when to make it
official
so there's Facebook official Instagram
snapchat if I'm featuring you in my
snapchat story it's getting real do you
make a visual with like a talk right
when do you DTR there is a thing about
feeling like someone's broadcast in the
relationship it makes you feel kind of
special but also if that's not important
to you maybe I think you have to have
the talk right inside for yourself have
the talk
meeting the friends and family friends
is probably about the same time as
Instagram yeah if you've met the parents
no super a fish unless your mom is your
best friend like mine hi love and then
Facebook official so our friend Chris is
dating someone but they're not Facebook
official so we wanted to find out from
him why was your phone and here he is he
looked on Facebook and we saw that it
wasn't official I think sometimes you
want to cherish relationship about
broadcasting that that relationship is
most important for you to not most
important for everybody else how long
did you guys date before you had right
what the talk three dates was it five
days have you met her parents yeah oh
yes you have yeah you tell me a fish so
how long into the relationship did you
guys define that it was official come
one point you go like you know I might
love this person Wow are you love this
person yeah yeah dated why like seven
months
oh okay good question when did you make
official how many months weeks I think
it was like three months from that it
was gonna fit me hand job and the like
brief mouth stuff I like that
well so are you ever gonna make it FB oh
that's Facebook official eNOS
honestly never occurred to me to make a
facebook official it's a statement
you're kind of saying like yes we are
now public with this would you want to
send a FBO request to her right now
no haha the people who are in my life do
now I have 1,300 Facebook friends those
aren't today the relationship is about
you and that other person yes one thing
that we always say is the wedding was
for everyone else but the marriage is
for else Oh God
okay bye I think we areas paler if you
don't want all the questions from your
aunts and your uncles and all the
strangers you don't get him fine I heard
you have a new girlfriend
I would unfriend that person what if
it's your aunt though I have unfriended
me ha ha ha
I'm not even kidding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
