hi I'm Ned and I'm married I'm Kelsey
and I'm very single you've submitted
relationship questions we are not
qualified to answer them but we're gonna
anyways all of them can see no
soundwaves says when is the right time
to say I love you when you can't go
through your day without thinking about
that person when you can't breathe
without wanting to say I love you make
sure you don't do that when you're high
on ecstasy yet like a music festival
because you usually never mean it that
it doesn't have to be like the movie
what's a good relationship movie Harry
Potter book happy if someone says I
love you and you don't love them what do
you do well you would really want to say
is I don't know that I love you I'm
really excited to see where this goes
you just say thank you I remember the
first time I told my wife though I loved
her we're holding hands
eating dinner something came over me
where I couldn't I couldn't say anything
but I love you mom did I just blurted it
out but I loved it
well there's also like no pressure to
say it at all that was one of the main
plot points of Gossip Girl
so good Chuck and Blair
first time I said I love you I drank a
six-pack of Budweiser and I was on the
beach I was by myself love yourself
before you can love someone if you're
going to commit to another person
emotionally what sexually or sexually
then you have to know yourself first I
don't think you can find self-love by
just masturbating yes you don't know
what I do on the weekend I don't know
it's good to go nobody can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
