masturbating why you can't just say that
not like I said I was murdering somebody
right in the next room there's a
structure between us everyone
masturbates you masturbate I masturbate
Obama mess for me yeah but at least I
lie about it I'm taking a shower I'm on
the phone with my mom I'm making a
life-size statue of you out of q-tips
and I don't want you to see what I got
why do you have to lie about it I've all
seen the Pearl I'm dialing the rotary
phone finger boom like start some crap

that's what all this since then don't
you need like an ambience or something

figured that when women touch themselves
romantic rose petals
lens flare like a lovemaking session for
one we're like in pitch black when I'm
listening to music and checking my
Twitter huh that's what I'm talking
about guys would not listen to music
what else would I listen to the sound of
my own instability no thank you
let me guess to listen to porn no you're
so free I don't leave a trace I lower my
volume as low as I can and I'm still
paranoid that people can hear the grunts
and moans Oh ever since I was eight
years old I've been told masturbation is
wrong because it's desire of the flesh
you forgot your is Catholic yeah so how
do you expect me not to attach paranoia
with jerking off so you're wearing is
that what you're wearing it's an
anything but clothes party yeah is that
the she just masturbate on no no no I
was actually masturbating on a bed of
roses and I figured that'd be way too
hard to turn into a dress how are you so
open about this I'm like you I was
sexually wakened in a very young age I
discovered inanimate objects should I
say I discovered me eighth grade was
cool yet this is weird I've never had a
conversation about this can we do this I
don't know sometimes I do it for 20
minutes sometimes it's only
second so I'm at a consistent eight
minutes transcontinental flight last 14
