not me not good
most guys a steak but like some chicken
this tofu tofurkey stuff you're not
gonna fool me I know what meat is
come you can taste our I don't know
that's a good thing in fact no tastes
like baby food mushed into one little
long hot dog isn't it me no that's what
I'm too real for this test I'm too let's
give it a go okay this is actually
checking it's good it's chicken oh look
again I'm happy for them yeah I bet this
is I don't even I don't even know if I
have to try this one I know it's not me
it's not me
hello grill lines and make it look like
kicking butt dry but wet at the same
time I don't know what that is
look I'm a grown man and this kind of
makes me nervous
you're not fooling me that ain't nice
all right here we go oh yeah it tastes
the depth to it that I enjoy this is
actually not bad but it's chicken tastes
like chicken doesn't mean this is
definitely me
you're lying are you telling me it's not
about me
what the hell no that used to be a
burden
for the most part they're kind of weird
but there are a few want good ones out
there but one did fool me I'd rather
have a filet but I'd be happy with this
tip it looked like chicken though I've
let America down sorry fellow
meat-eaters I think for the most part we
proved though that you generally can't
trick me on me
I'm if I was really hungry if I was like
starving and there was nothing else I
think it but I probably eat one of you
too so I mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
