producer of the fan film Raiders of the
Lost Ark the adaptation I also played
Indiana Jones back in the 1980s armed
with a Betamax camera my friend Eric
Zale and Jason lamb and myself along
with many of our friends got together on
the Mississippi Gulf Coast and spent the
next seven years doing a shot-for-shot
recreation of the Spielberg classic
Raiders of the Lost Ark
that was the driving thing for me I just
wanted to play Indy and see what it felt
like to get chased from a boulder and
wear the leather jacket and the hat and
learn how to use a bullwhip and play
with snakes and save the girl and fight
the bad guys and drag behind the truck
and light stuff on fire you know it
seemed fun Eric and I worked from memory
for the first three years and then Eric
sat down one summer of the hand drew
over six hundred throw boards that we
used as our shooting Bible and there was
no guide books there wasn't like
filmmaking for teens that you can
download off of the internet we were
completely left to our own in the most
rudimentary way
we had our pipe dreams you know nerding
out in the basement while spray-painting
hieroglyphics on the walls of like you
know one day Steven Spielberg is gonna
see this and be really proud of us but
it was just like these ridiculous
faraway dreams but every step of the way
it's been surreal article in Vanity Fair
and there's a book about us and a
documentary being done all these people
that have come into our lives and the
positive energy that sort of happened
around it it's just cool
the only scene that we didn't do was the
famous flying-wing scene where Indy
fights the big bald German guy under the
airplane we didn't want it to look fake
so we skipped it all together and for
the last ten years when we were touring
people joked you guys should go back and
redo that scene and it was always like
ha ha ha you know I thought it would be
a good idea to go back and try it and
we're going back and putting the band
back together and returning back to our
hometown to build an airplane and then
blow it up it all comes down to being
resourceful filmmaking is still about
getting out there and getting the
trenches and putting people in from the
camera and telling a good story and that
means getting your hands dirty you know
and getting out there and and you know
maybe getting into a little trouble and
asking for things that are a little
uncomfortable and going out there and
digging through the dumpster of life to
make stuff happen go ask for stuff and
don't ever let any buddy tell you that
you can't do something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
