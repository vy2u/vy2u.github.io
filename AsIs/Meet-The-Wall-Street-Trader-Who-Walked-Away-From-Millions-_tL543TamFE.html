internship at Credit Suisse first Boston
and I was 22 and I was like a total mess
I was doing a lot of Ritalin and cocaine
and ecstasy and also drinking a lot I
ended up getting sober from drugs and
alcohol and calling this counselor who
started kind of working with me on this
spiritual path I started on Wall Street
and my first bonus was $40,000 and I was
so excited I mean you know can you
imagine like for the first time getting
this check that all of a sudden it means
that I'm not living paycheck to paycheck
and I just felt like okay for the first
time in my life I had this super cool
life and I was kind of making more and
more money and rising up the ranks but
at the same time you know five years
into my career on Wall Street I'd come
in and I'd sit at my desk and I would
just be consumed with like envy and
jealousy and I would look at these guys
around me that made so much more money
than I did and even though all of a
sudden I was making you know five
hundred thousand dollars or a million
dollars that year I'd look at the guys
that were making two million or ten
million and I just like burn with envy
so that's when I started to get a sense
that like oh like maybe this is like an
addiction so what's the point of this
you know you're spending your whole life
being really smart and making these
really crucial decisions but at the end
of the day all you're doing is sort of
making more money with money when I was
on Wall Street the most important thing
in the world for me was whether or not I
was going to make one or two million
dollars a year and the longer I've spent
away from Wall Street the more I've come
to see how sort of distorted that was
and I'm not saying that money is bad
like money is great and it's always
better to have more money than less
money if you're like me and you have
this hole in your heart this sort of
brokenness inside and are trying to fix
it by proving to the world that you or I
is valuable it just doesn't work the
first year away from Wall Street was
like I really can't describe it as
anything other than like withdrawal
symptoms you know I would really wake up
in the middle of the night like panicked
I would wake up sweating
