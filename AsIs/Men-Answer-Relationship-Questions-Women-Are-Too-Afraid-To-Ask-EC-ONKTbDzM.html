like I'll just like Instagram myself
with other people's kids why are so many
guys afraid of commitment people are
constantly waiting for the next best
thing like an end to possibilities it's
full now I think it's less work to
remain uncommitted men tend to be
slightly lazier
they're like bumble bee if we need to go
from flower to flower maybe being loved
is amazing Mila for a long time is
really amazing but falling in love with
someone new it's tight
I think everybody's afraid of commitment
I'm not afraid of commitment I'm a guy
I think it's a stronger question is why
are women all for commitment what is
their I feel marrying age 28 our early
thirties is a good time I think by then
I'll probably have my together I
got married at 25 29 to 33 35 to 40 guy
40 girl 28 whenever it happens it
happens I'm still looking for a guy with
a good credit score cha I ain't never
get married let's be real when do you
want to have kids how many oh man
relatively soon you know like mid-30s I
feel like that's a solid dad age yeah
I'd say like late 30s for me I would
like to be an active father I think
that's a big thing yeah I want to be
like geriatric by the time they're
playing sports or you know need
something yeah teach them how to ride a
bike I have two to three kids I probably
want two kids I think I'm like three I
don't know if I want kids or not I like
saying hi to other people's kids a lot
then I hang out with children and I'm
like you guys are like cute for like
half an hour and then it's what's
happening with you if I could have kids
today and be able to afford life I'd
have known Suzy Orman says $100,000
saved for every child
oh no I can't possibly keep it other
thing alive right now how can I keep a
couple alive so many told me one time a
night and it was kind like a hot moment
they said you won't want to have kids
until you meet the person that makes you
want to have kids
and then I was like oh what is one
specific deal-breaker for you someone's
like super smelly obviously I just don't
like people who are like haters a lot of
people get by in their lives by being
like hey that thing sucks if somebody
has the caustic an attitude or it's just
rude and like you can't roll with me
we're not the same hating animals bad
dental hygiene I like floss like crazy
I love flossing can't love horses I'm
serious though like a girl who loves
horses loves horses more than anybody
else ever and I don't mean that man
gross we're bestiality wait I just mean
that they love horses and I cannot
dedicate any of my life to going to
stables pretending to love horses I
think a big deal breaker is someone's
expectation of your masculinity you in a
relationship and you guys get this like
oh you're gonna be sweet nice and really
yeah and the more submissive boyfriend
yeah have a little ambition like you
don't have to have like the best job
right now but at least be like how
dreams complaining bothers me when
someone complains and that's all they do
imagine if they had a horse that was
sick yeah I'd be like Oh horses oh yeah
we got to go back to the stable to see
my horse what happened he with a horse
for you to talk about horses nothing I
just know that girls who love horses
only love horses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
