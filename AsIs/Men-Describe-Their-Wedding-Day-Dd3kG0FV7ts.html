like my mind was racing I'm sure that I
teared up a bit welcome people to this
wedding we like got got shaves and
sandwiches in the morning our original
photographer bailed and we had to find a
new photographer fairly last-minute you
know I was kind of hoping that wouldn't
be too hot or you know rain or anything
like that it starts hailing the day or
to get married in the middle of the
summer when it hasn't had any
precipitation in like something like
nine months or something there was a
nice good-looking zip that appeared
right on my forehead note to self don't
choose the cheap photographer in the
future I think when you're a kid you
think about getting married and you have
this idea in your head and you know that
that wedding dress is just this iconic
thing so to be in that moment and seeing
the person that you love as a bride you
know there's that visual right there in
front of you it's it's really
overwhelming I was just like so excited
I just wanted to go in like grab her
face basically she appears her this
white sepulchral figure walking down the
aisle next to her father I was in the
first time that I saw that he was
wearing a bow tie didn't know that it
was gonna wear a bow tie I walk into the
lobby and I see my my wife standing
there so our first look is in the lobby
of the hotel she turns around and I see
her for the first time we brought just
like ah there was one of the most
slow-motion scenes I could say in my
life I think that's the moment where it
really felt like oh right okay I'm
getting married now I hardly remembered
what the priest was saying I was just
like all I could see was Ariel
thank you for everything I love you so
much and I want to get married to you
all over again
guys stop it
