and by the way this is a date do you
want to go with me or not
well I've been in this situation before
and I handled it terribly yeah I haven't
been in this situation right here it's
hard because I don't want to ruin a
friendship I would just go for it to be
honest and if it didn't work out you're
like no offense I've had a lot of
success sleeping with my friends and try
to get things to be more flirty than
normal but the problem with friends that
are girls is eat flirt that's what
that's what goes on right yeah I use a
lot more hearts I'll use a lot more
dirty emojis I'll use a lot more
eggplant analysis is paralysis mm-hmm so
if I think too much about something it's
gonna end disastrously for me the
friendliness turns into like cute
flirtiness and you just start replacing
that you see like 5050 it shines like
80/20 ninety ten I feel like my strategy
would also just be to go for a kiss I
always want to be drunk if I'm gonna go
in that to that rock because then you
could just blame it on alcohol I had
coffee with an old friend I told her hey
let's get dinner sometime I'd love to
take you on a date she said no I don't
think I'm comfortable with that and I
said okay cool
circle back if you want to I think like
the probably the simplest way is just to
like tell them like hey I have a
romantic interest for you if you don't
like me that's fine I can get over I can
get over it I just wanted to let you
know
if you want to sleep with somebody they
don't want to sleep with you you're not
going to just like maintain this like
healthy platonic frame friendship that's
gonna like go south at some point so if
it in the but if it's intense enough
that you want to do something about it
then your friendship is probably
weakened by that anyway I would probably
just like hope the feelings went away
unless I felt it from them and then I
feel like alright alright that but no
I'm scared I'm scared of rejection
nothing's more catastrophic than the
what could have been yeah where is the
like well that didn't work out you just
then you can just move the sex will
complicate things but the relationships
it's just gonna complicate anything
always so like might as well just roll
with it but if you don't have sex with
them then it's not complicated but then
you're not gonna be real friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
