I'm just imagining a lot of like blood
and like stuff just kind of just like
floating around and all of these little
different cavities and stuff uterine
walls of the uterus me if I know which
one's the uterus shed their lining
I'm assuming it's one of the summons
some up here and it just like it's
coated in this nice stuff that's ready
to hold the baby a potential baby of
women's like are we gonna get pregnant
is that it's like nope if it is if it
it's like dang it why did we do all this
stuff and it just sheds all the whining
just shuts it out just shoots it out
sometimes there's pieces most of the
time it's just like I've never touched
or seen these things used in real life
this is a pad you put it into your
underwear and then it catches your
debris I mean I've seen the commercials
where they pour the blue liquid as you
graduate from that and you want
something less clunky you might want to
consider inserting something up inside
of you I mean I guess you like stick
these things like in your coochie right
it looks like one of the party poppers
that people open this cotton expands to
the size of your vagina this is like
modern technology whoa it's so except
the vaginal fluid that comes out this
would be perfect for my nosebleeds when
I was a kid there's three basic options
only two of them are presented here if
you'd like to be more caring for the
environment you can stick a weird cup
inside of yourself and catch it like a
little drink
a pint let me say a pint I would say
like five ounces of blood that still
seems like a lot cuz that's almost a
pound of blood like half a cup is it a
lot like huh I would hope it's just like
a few drops wait how many times a day
does that happen it just keeps coming
out oh hell no is it because the egg is
big a little like clumps of stuff like
going through these small holes if you
have flesh inside of you and it's just
ripping itself off it's gonna hurt
cramps are caused by the muscle
contractions that are forcing the fluid
out of the uterus it'd be like when
you're at your friend's house and you
like clogged their toilet and you're
like wow I do I don't want to tell
anyone but I don't know how to fix this
I would think that an organ is like
popped bitch about it
I would probably do exactly what women
do I would go through my day pretending
like nothing was wrong with me despite
the fact that I'm in a lot of pain and
bitch about it all the time I don't even
know what I would do I'd probably have
to like move away from like all of my
friends cuz they probably like hate I'm
sorry that it happens to you but on plus
side if you want a baby someday you get
to make one and that's a whole new level
of pain you get to endure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
