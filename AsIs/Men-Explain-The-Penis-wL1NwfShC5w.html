meat stay over
you
well it's the male growth hormone
testosterone is what fills up your penis
when you have an erection I think it's
like a way of keeping the body energized
it makes the hair grow I think it helps
regulate semen it's like guy juice it
makes you like like a guy with sperm it
starts in here inside the testicles they
are little it's like a sperm Factory
they sort of like go like on like a
crazy waterslide ride it travels through
through the pink tube as its
scientifically called and out through
the erection the most sensitive part of
the penis is the tip the head the tip
the head the tip of the penis a lot of
people think that it's the tip of the
penis but it's actually the shaft of the
penis
it's like in-between part right here
pretty sensitive the penis comes
equipped with like a flap over it the
skin goes over like this like a
turtleneck and circumcision is like when
you cut off that ring they sew it back
down the shaft it's like an American
thing or a Jewish thing it's mostly a
sanitary thing it's controversial the
vas deferens is also known as the taint
is that like your urethra is it a part
of the penis the vas deferens is the
tube that connects the scrotum to the
shaft that's where you get clipped when
you get a vasectomy
like saying what what does your arm feel
like like a good strong dark cup of
coffee like an impatient little like sex
gremlin in your pants a like a who
concert girls you don't know how fun it
is that would be nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
