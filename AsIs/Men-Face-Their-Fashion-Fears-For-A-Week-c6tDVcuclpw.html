a pharaoh I feel that my chest is a
little bit bigger than I would like it
to be it definitely influences the kind
of shorts I pick out the shirt I'm
wearing now is bit in a way that you
can't really see an outline of my chest
and that's the most important thing to
me it's not that I'm necessarily afraid
of crop tops
I love crop tops as I got older I kind
of stopped working out as much and kind
of got a little bit of a stomach that's
natural for some guys to have chest
they're a little bit larger I have this
term that I would always explain to my
friends I'm straight skinny I'm gay fat
there's not really a space for guys who
are kind of maybe just in between my
goal for this week is to be a little bit
more comfortable in my own skin I'm
expecting by the end of this to be
completely a hundred percent confident
in my body
but this is the most bearing the most
shortest I want you to do it first so
that we rip you out of your comfort zone
Amedeo okay this is the front that's the
fastest book right so if you're insecure
we will all see this does not look like
it's from like this decade or the last
one or the one before that wow that is a
lot of stomach this is not a shirt I
don't think I'd like this after a big
Italian meal it's just very shiny
is this how Gaga feel let's go show
people my stomach what do you guys think
of my my crop top comment in the cutest
it's cute it's interesting I'm gonna be
real it's like not my favorite look that
bends ever done I'm headed to a wig and
hat party so I felt like this was the
best time to dive in headfirst I'm going
to drink until I forget what I'm wearing
so we had a couple comments on my outfit
one friend said that they actually
really liked the see-through tank top
and the other friend said that I look
like a pokemon trainer and taking both
those as complements I'm a little
hungover from last night even though it
was a pretty queer friendly Club I felt
a little more self-conscious than I
usually did as cheesy as it sounds it
doesn't really matter what you're
wearing it's more of how you present
yourself my confidence was the
determining factor of the attention I
was getting and so I think going forward
into this week I'm gonna hold on to that
I don't think anything in my life has
prepared me for this Tommy pickles here
we come today I am a fair of the past
two days wearing clothes that very much
showed what it is that I usually
normally like to mask I feel good
Seattle Venice Beach
I mean why am I even wearing a shirt
alright so I'm about to go it's a tie
first like public place of this outfit I
think it's this is probably gonna be
like the biggest test of my confidence
here we go got my stuff from the store
and I don't know I didn't really feel
like anyone was looking at me weird
honestly they were probably just more
confused with like the nature of this
outfit
and an antenna it's day five and I'm
wearing the uncle shirt which is made of
silk a material I never wear what in
God's name I'm feeling okay about it
other than the fact that I look way too
festive to be going to target after
wearing that see-through tank I feel
just fine all right so we just saw a
play say hello Maya
not gonna lie I have my sweater around
the entire time I'm wearing the the dad
polo in the Dave jacket the more I wear
these clothes the more I realize that I
pay a lot more attention to these things
than anyone else does I don't know how
like people wear like half of a shirt on
the regular like that's crazy you ladies
like profession we do it women make
sacrifices I am ready for this challenge
to be over and for me to get back to
wearing my own clothes after this week's
challenge
I definitely feel less insecure about my
chest and my body in general I think
that I feel a lot more confident in my
body after this week to anyone else
struggling with body and security I
think it's just important to remember
that it's really something that a lot of
people struggle with
I think it's empowering to know that
you're not in it alone people are more
focused on themselves than they are on
what is on your body and people who are
focused on your body em em
