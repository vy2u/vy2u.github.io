women we called them wa manicures
whatever manicure I get today cannot
compare to what I can do with my teeth
not really excited about an old lady
scraping dead skin from my own nails
honestly I just ready to have my hands
take it to the next level
it's like a haircut for your fingers I
think I may have found out I have some
weird personal boundaries of my fingers
I don't know what it is I'm like super
stiff she's already caught all 10 of my
nails and I didn't bleed which is more
than I can say for my own ability
cuticle ninja down the item she hasn't
hit one bit of skin that you're in very
capable and professional hands somehow I
suddenly had the sensation like I'm
about to fall asleep yeah I was a little
worried when she stuck my hand in the
bowl of warm water well I've already
started peeing you've had a guy against
girlfriend force him to come here I
can't look at it I'm a little scared
she put juice on my fingers I feels good
thank you
like look at all that crap that's on
there goodness what have I been doing to
myself dude she's gonna put me to sleep
she's tranquilized me right there
fingers right now it's amazing
you just promote nail growth see the
benefit of this now I take back
everything else I was saying this feels
amazing that magic hot lotion Oh was
this okay this is what my girlfriend is
doing when she gets her nails done she's
like oh I had to get my nails done and
so I was late to get home like well of
course you were you're having the time
of your life clear or you just leave
your
what do you guys think you guys getting
polish over there I'm gonna get my nails
done black is it toxic if I were to say
bite my nails immediately after that
it's okay okay that's just like the
fumes of the
oils and the juices and paint get so
sleepy from everything is happening it's
very cool sometimes at the end of like
these kind of things I don't know what
it is but I get that warm fuzzy feeling
inside I almost start crying I got a
little fam check it and dry them out you
know the
I mean guys just don't normally do this
but maybe they should I don't know I
understand why women go do this this is
great don't regret this decision a
little bit I wonder how long the shine
is going to last though all in all five
