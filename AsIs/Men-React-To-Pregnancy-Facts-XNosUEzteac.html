they're like human making factories
that's crazy
a woman's uterus can expand about 500
times in size during her pregnancy
nineteen five times not fifty times five
hundred times it's normal size Wow ah
that's a lot what happens to all the the
innards feels like a uterus 500 times
it's normal size this is the size of me
this is my uterus hello is that how big
I normal ones here with it in addition
to her uterus a woman's feet and heart
can increase in size during pregnancy I
thought her feet increased in size just
cuz like you know swelling I would
imagine that the feet have to be bigger
so that you can balance while you're
carrying a person inside of you the feet
mean we just think yeah cool feet grow
but your heart grows is that a good
thing if you heard yeah your heart can
pump more blood so they should be better
at exercise there's just too much love
and blood flow from the second trimester
onwards babies pee in the uterus then
they drink it then they pee again then
they drink it the circle that reads like
a horror movie script
are you giving birth to Bear Grylls I
think babies even after they're out of
the uterus they still drink their own
pee we have pea brains and here we go
the miracle of life got some body
producing hormones otherwise known as
fairy dust apparently something just
exploded in her butt the bladder is just
getting crushed right now that's a baby
growing oh it's lower than I thought
look we're the intestines go you think
the woman's stomach could not possibly
expand anymore but then it does it's
really scary I don't want any of my
organs to move at all oh there goes
that's what looks like when neo gets
plugged out of matrix how do babies fit
through women's pelvises yeah this just
seems unpleasant
are you sure this is a face this looks
like a bad elementary school pottery
project said I sock it if that nose
it's a nose right no I don't know the
forehead is becoming the nose it's like
a weird-ass Pokemon and turns into a pig
and now it looks like et Oh baby
it is beautiful it's it's strange to
look at I don't envy this at all I feel
like you have to say I'm really sorry I
want to have a baby we get so amazed by
like our iPhones and by all these other
like trivial technological advances but
like the most advanced thing in the
world are our bodies some crazy shits
gonna go down when my wife and I have a
baby
why isn't maternity leave better in the
United States
that's my question it's just so sad
what's happening over there oh yeah you
don't know the half of it this is what
just happened to that baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
