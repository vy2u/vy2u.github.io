that okay while I am different a small
comment in such a short period of time
can stick with you yeah I was definitely
picked on as a kid oh yeah look at me of
course I got picked on I think you
always dream about going back to a
situation especially when it's recent
and being able to say what you really
wanted to say to the people that that
hurt you or tormented you when I was
eight I was on the playground one of my
friends told me I had elf ears which
isn't really even that me but it like
stuck with me I response now Abby never
heard a Legolas I had to wear a leg
braces because I was pigeon toed and I
had boat legs and there was a new
student in my class and the first thing
out of her mouth that she said when she
saw me was that I walk funny that I walk
like a duck if by document mighty duck
then you are correct in fifth grade I
was told that I have fat wrinkly hands
and I'm not gonna lie it's it's a little
bit true well you know what fifth grade
bullies I went to a palm reader in high
school and she told me that all the
wrinkles on my fat hands mean that I
have wise hands not fat wrinkly hands
wise hands I was wearing this like
really red shirt and my sister said you
shouldn't wear red because it brings out
your pimples people would make fun of me
for my hair all the time just because it
grows up naturally
let the hate away it love yourself and
leave everybody alone I've always kind
of had a baby face so it was my first
day of middle school in a new school
we're talking about what fake football
jersey name you would have this kid said
hey on the back of your Jersey it should
say little bitch I came home in tears
and said I wanted to go back to my old
school a group of kids would call me
chinky eyes somehow my eyes equated to
being ugly and I didn't quite understand
that it was just an ethnic difference I
was overweight and I was depressed
there's a certain number of my family
that everybody is very afraid of she
just came after me kept telling me I was
fat kept telling you to lose weight kept
telling me I was fat I think the best I
could do is be above all of it and the
worst you can do is believe what
they say guess I would just say I don't
believe you that stuck with me and has
made me not want to feel weak I ain't no
bitch gives them net I do what I want
they might fear you but I don't to
anyone out there is being picked on her
Boyd you can't change the way others
think but you can control how you think
about yourself when you're younger you
just want to look like everybody else
and when you get older we all want to
look different there are other people
out there who are just like you who are
going through the same things and
sometimes you can take a weakness and
turn it into a strength just a little
bit of wisdom I got from these guys
boom mic drop what's up you're welcome
Internet that felt great I did that
really did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
