personally think that I can take a pill
once a day at the same time oh I forgot
my birth control this is infuriating
it's just bothering me oh no
pill alright I'm officially sick and
tired of like many women living in 2017
I'm on birth control
specifically the birth control pill so
since we're living through some pretty
trying gas times right now with women's
access to birth control always being a
topic of discussion but really a topic
of discussion held by women and I can
tell you this is most troubling this is
disturbing
I felt like now was a really great time
to challenge some of my male co-workers
to an experiment birth control is the
ultimate gift that came out of science
it's a wonderful way to be able to plan
your life out the women I've dated have
had had many complaints about the
different types of birth control they'd
been on so while the women of BuzzFeed
were extremely excited to see a video
like this getting made I literally have
no idea what happened to the men it was
dead silent on that email thread I was
hesitant to do this video because I was
afraid it was gonna be some weird
placebo pills after knowing that it's
gonna be tic tacs I feel a little better
that can't be as simple as I think it is
and that's how guys view birth control
right cuz they view it as being very
simple what's the big deal because
believe me if there was a pill I could
take it all means
I will be not potent at all this would
be a Sahara Desert my girlfriend does
things for me and one of these things is
taking birth control and I really want
to know what she's going through
let's go over the rules so while I
couldn't give them a key and weight gain
and mood swings and all the other
 that we go through I figured we
could at least simulate the
inconvenience rule number one is you
have to pick up your birth control from
me on Sunday between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
okay Super Bowl Sunday this is not a
good time you can only take your birth
control from the original pack of Tic
Tacs that you are given there is no
buying of another pack of Tic Tacs just
because you don't have your pack with
you and you need to take it what if I
forget it what I have what happens if
you miss a pill
aka if you're over an hour late taking
your pill you will have to refrain from
sexual activity that night and that's
partnered sex or masturbation what yeah
what do you even masturbate no fair
enough we're not done okay
you have to wear a pad with a period
like subsidy what is that the reason for
that is that when a woman misses her
birth control pill for a lot of people
that will mess up her cycle deal that's
actually more incentive to never miss
this I'm feeling more nervous now than I
did at the start of this but also
confidence
time right it's dead I had an idea that
in order to make this experience even
more relatable to women I should give
them insurance cards but they have to
present when they pick up their birth
control I have a gift for you what is it
so I have an insurance card specialist
copay 25 30
I know this is some bomb-ass I can't
give you your pills unless you present
your insurance card on Sunday so don't
forget it
you just really trying to make this more
difficult huh we're talking about this
whatever you can to just chance I think
you're afraid that we're gonna crush
this no we're gonna get it 21 days 21
days same our immune one thing first we
I hope there isn't a real you don't have
a copay so right now you're okay because
under the ACA birth control is free
I'll be seeing you on Sunday it's almost
11:30 I'm going I'm on my way now to get
my birth control from the pharmacist I
made it in time and now I got to wait 15
to 20 minutes probably a little bit
longer to get my birth control
that's what normally happens right I'm
really nervous because the pharmacist
just asked me if it was my first time
picking up which means I'm in for some
more I am pretty sure that they
just thought that they were going to
walk up in here and just take a packet
tic tacs and go about their day and I
said hell no we're really going through
this experience he's looking at the
conference card as if this is it for
position button oh yeah it looks like
you have a prescription for male birth
control is that correct yes okay so we
give me about 15-20 minutes I should be
able to fill it for you this is
infuriating that's a pharmacy with only
three people I go to it yeah look at
this this is very thorough let me tell
you how much work I put into this I'm
also waiting for other other
I'm used to that I guess I don't have to
just do it everyone I can female that's
true women are amazing creatures don't
review them
such a struggle all right taking my
first bill I have the option taking
starting ticket tonight or tomorrow
morning I'm gonna prefer tomorrow
morning because I think that's better
for me when I wake up and take all my
other meds 10 p.m.
day watch 21 day to 2 / 2 so far killing
the game and my alarm just went off and
I like oh good I'm gonna take my pill
and I realize that my pills are in my
car
it's pill still going strong
it's just bothering me I freaked out so
I thought I lost it I'm always worried
when I don't have it sucks
some people said I shouldn't suck on it
because that's something good that girls
don't get to do they don't get to enjoy
it then I have to dry swallow it so I'll
just dry swallow this one no I forgot my
birth control so I have to go back and
there's a lot of traffic on this side
I'm doing it on time but it just sucks
that I have to keep doing it it's gonna
be come on Monday and I was feeling as I
get better at it okay I'm currently here
flying Ireland and I don't know how I'm
gonna figure out what time have to take
a while I'm up in the air cuz
zone is literally changing concept I got
into an argument with my girlfriend I
can't imagine she's going through a
being on her or birth control and you
know if this was actually like male
birth control the hormones that I would
feel and you know it's not made me think
and I cried a little bit about it you
know
not because of taking this but just
knowing there is hormones being pumped
into her body that she probably doesn't
want to have I definitely didn't
anticipate how hard it was going to be
to take this pill every day and it's
really hard to explain why we haven't
experienced the weight gain the hormones
and all that stuff and I've been going
through some emotional stuff so I can't
imagine what I would actually feel like
if I had extra hormones pumped into my
body
this is annoying the constant
worry if you're not thinking about it
ahead of time you're gonna be in trouble
so you've got to constantly have it on
your mind I will say that the first week
especially every time I successfully
take it I feel immortal I thought that
it was important for the boys to learn
as much as they could about birth
control while being on this journey so
we invited a doctor to come in and sit
down with them first week I screwed up
almost every day it was like oh shoot
I'm out and I don't have my pills
luckily I'm two blocks away from my
house you were in between bars and you
went back to your house to take yeah we
left the house party I paid for the lift
to go to the bar and I told the lyft
driver to stop at my house and then
everybody sat in lift and I ran inside
my house that is dedication got no other
option now I don't want to get pregnant
but it sounds like for all of you taking
the pill on a consistent basis every day
at the same time was challenging yes
yeah yeah yeah I was a pain in the ass
that's basically all we have to do and
yeah it was very difficult that what
women also have to deal with is all the
side effects that sometimes can happen
when they take the pill headaches nausea
rest tenderness bloating and all of
those things you guys didn't have only
other convenience that we had and women
have to go through is going to the
pharmacist yeah at pharmacist
I'm getting a new pharmacist is the
worst pharmacy yeah they were like oh I
can't wait to give this pharmacist a bad
yelp review I'm like I wish you would so
could you imagine a situation where
every single month you're having to deal
with that and remembering remembering
ahead of time that you need to do that
because if you're starting your new pack
on Sunday that you have to go in on
Friday so what are the developments of
birth control from that well men are
it's really tricky to have birth control
for a men men produce millions of sperm
every day so in order to prevent
pregnancy you have to prevent the
production of all the millions of sperm
and you have to do it every day that's a
lot of sperm versus actually just
preventing one egg from ovulating which
is what the birth control pill does
alright so in order to do that you need
pretty strong levels of hormone all
right and oftentimes strong levels of
hormone are associated with pretty bad
side effects and in fact an oral
formulation of the hormone that you
would need to take men would clear that
hormone so quickly they would actually
have to take a pill multiple times a day
oh no way it'd be hard right couple my
guy friends were like I I don't even if
that was a real thing I don't know if I
would do it because hormones and I was
like well that's kind of up
because your girls taking it why should
the onus be put on just the females and
not the males sometimes I take the pill
and I'll think like oh my god imagine if
you knew you were doing this for next 15
years I was just like has to become part
of your life because right now it's like
definitely inconveniencing me and it's
making me appreciate how hard it is but
I'm also aware that it's just for like a
video I'm pretty ready to get this
over with two more days easy peasy
you win ladies I apologize for ever
doubting you
it sucks this wasn't as easy as I
thought and I know we didn't have even
like more than half of the issues that
you ladies have but just you know
picking that time trying to stick with
that time it's difficult my last day of
sales salty
I did it I did all 21 days didn't mrs. s
proud of myself one guy that didn't I
don't be admitted to it yet are you sure
there's nothing else you want to tell me
what do you mean there's nothing else I
want to tell you what Eli's little lyin
ass you I didn't miss a day you have no
proof okay but he didn't know that I had
receipts
my home so Eli is running from us we're
trying to find them
yeah oh I was right Eli captain seat
there are receipts Wow this is French
Street and black boulevard darling
people like the last part of his name is
so significant what do I did you out in
her you shoe
when I set out to do this video I didn't
want it to be a we appreciate women so
much for what they do for us kind of
video because this is about so much more
than appreciation women are very aware
of how amazing and that ass they are for
taking on the risk and the social stigma
that comes with taking birth control I
think what women are really looking for
from the men in their lives is
solidarity not sympathy yeah when it
comes to baby prevention and all those
other things this whole project made me
realize how easy I have it I never knew
exactly how expensive birth control was
you don't realize that even though it
might be a $20 $30 $50 copay each month
depending on your provider or if you
have health insurance that adds up
significantly over time I mean that's
what I spent on groceries every month so
if I have to double that for like a pill
that frustrates me to begin with and
makes me feel bad sometimes it's like
man the sucks need guys that are willing
to help us pay for it or if you're not
willing to help us pay for it help us
protect things like the ACA that are
making it inexpensive or advocate for
scientists to make more progress on male
birth control we need you guys to stand
with us and not against us guys don't
pressure your female partner to be on
the pill just so you can have that extra
sensation you know let them decide let
them decide the pill that they want let
them decide they even want to be in the
pill it's their body it's their choice
just be cool with it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
