girlfriend like could be Facebook
official actually we all make pre child
is pretty much a high school kind of
thing everyone wanted to brag about hey
I've got a girlfriend hey I've got a
boyfriend etc etc if you're doing in
high school way the way you still have
to do it now personally I think it's
 I think that Facebook official
is something that is a little bit more
outdated these days I think that young
people anyway don't really worry about
the Facebook turning of the status if
you need Facebook official like
confirmation I don't think you should be
dating I think that's just like the
Facebook thing because everyone puts so
much on social media but people assume
that it's their business never ever been
a fan of the whole has to be on Facebook
it's good though when your Facebook
stalking someone it's like are they
single but I don't think you really need
to do a Facebook confirmation to say
that you're in a relationship
your friends will know you're in a
relationship or not I think maybe much
what's more important is maybe when you
start going out actually having a photo
of you two on Instagram or on Facebook
together showing some sort of love
because if you don't if you've been
dating for like a couple of weeks and it
isn't a photo of you and them together
online whether it's Facebook or
Instagram I think you probably are
starting to ask questions
I've done it once in my life when I was
a teenager and it lasted a week and that
was pretty embarrassing I have only ever
had one official Facebook relationship
and I was a dick and I didn't say who
was what because I would thought I was
keeping it we like to keep it private in
the first time I went Facebook official
we'd already been dating like a month so
it doesn't make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
