no I think it's like communism it's
great in theory but that don't work
I think friends with benefits can work
if at the beginning of everything you
lay down the ground rules
I don't believe friends with benefits
can work I think sex complicates things
but if you're both on the right page
yeah I think it does work I mean depends
on how many friends with benefits you
have at the time what sex is is an
expression of lust and passion and
connection and I've never been able to
have sex with anyone that's just some
sort of physical transaction the only
murky thing with friends with benefits
is as one person start developing
feelings for the other then that can
kind of get a bit too weird
the problem of like not being on the
same page you don't know what that
person is doing and telling their
friends because they might be going
around and saying oh we're together
think sometimes in the end it's
inevitable that it might not work out
the way that your first intended to work
out as long as you're open at the
beginning and you stop things when it
gets weird yeah it can work it doesn't
work because this your brain always gets
in the way of your body and I think that
that's a good thing a lot of ways
because it means that sex is supposed to
be something that is a little bit more
special
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
