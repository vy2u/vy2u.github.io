the day and you can't make me who
doesn't want abs or a six-pack I think
that having a six-pack is a sign of
health I did p90x last year and so I've
like been in good shape before but I'd
still like don't get really defined abs
or anything like that I might have had a
beer or two which I shouldn't have had
but we're gonna fix that today I didn't
even know advil was a thing yeah it
kind of tickles
I'm also very ticklish this is like a
lot of pain on me now I'm trying to see
how it's going to look when it's done
yes I'm about it two or three times but
like we own two some over here I feel
like if you were too close to this you
would be able to see right away that
it's not real I don't want to look down
I just want to wait till she's finished
and I'm gonna look at it and be like oh
I'm Jack I didn't know that your abs go
up this high I'm sort of wondering if
it's gonna make me look taller maybe I
would say that I have a love/hate
relationship with my body my family
assumes that I'm very sick now because I
lost his way to them actually like at a
healthy weight
yeah and so like this is like Texas
Southern families who love to eat and I
was like a very scrawny kid in middle
school I was just like the tiniest
person and so I didn't like my body that
much then I was like I'm still a child
so we're not being able to get girls as
we're doing like like a woman and um and
she not want anything to do with you
just because of like your size if girls
were like uh we don't like abs anymore
for some reason would I still want abs
yes oh wait but it actually made my life
easier actually were able to dismiss the
women that were after just a physical
for the things that I actually admire in
a woman which is the mincer stimulation
I don't have a lot of hang-ups with my
body now I don't think
all right let's do this holy this
looks awesome
oh damn oh my god damn I didn't think it
would look this realistic oh haha there
we go man I don't know my abs always
look like this to me
oh he loved it I do so much
this hasn't made me want to like contour
my abs on a regular basis or anything
but this is getting to see like what you
would look like it's sort of motivating
it's like okay this is what I could have
if I work for it maybe I should go to
the gym today you know what I want to
see what the camera does I want to see
what it looks like going on you guys in
but for me it looks as I always have
I feel like I have had I don't think
much of it I just have them they just
they're so I just love Who I am overall
and I'll leave it at that
strange you are me
hypnotizing when you poking hit alpha me
kidding Mina get lost in it building up
man I can't admit it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
