once in my life it was a one-time thing
yeah every now and then I'll put on some
bronzer or like a little eye makeup
every now and then why not right
just last week I did 90s makeup I don't
know what I was doing I think Robin it's
just much to his hair cutter and then
makeup is perfect for him he has really
good face structure too and then it's
really fixed to his personality David
Bowie is one of my style icons if he can
wear makeup I think it's good enough for
me
for hobby he has a natural cool
personality already so the makeup which
is you know suits him is just naturally
I've seen a new spokesperson for
Maybelline and covergirl those guys look
fantastic and they own and it's
empowering so last one is gonna be Nick
he has like kind of sassy personality
and then the flower makes it hit like
right up to women are definitely the
only ones that you can really see
wearing makeup and like a lot of like
mainstream media but I mean I don't
think that's like a no-no for a man to
wear makeup my heart's like beating out
of its just oh damn what looks great
look at that that is interesting there's
a forest on my face I wear the same
thing every day
I look the same all the time this is not
how I usually look I don't anywhere I'm
gonna go out I feel like there's some
explaining to do people are gonna calm
it I'm gonna feel uncomfortable yeah I'm
probably gonna see a lot of people's
faces go crazy like let's do it I'm
about to step into the office for the
first time I don't want as many people
to see me and I'm just I'm really
nervous what do you think man let's give
it
you asking Black Swan and intrusion
there most people didn't give me a hard
time they're just like all right Robins
got boss ass makeup on his face okay
let's move on with our day you got it
I was ripping and running a lot of
places and I was just in this massive
room of about 50 people I really like it
you know I tell you if you look
up right I think you look good have a
meeting with one of the teams I'm
involved with so I'm gonna see how they
react by the way are you serious I think
I look good I do I think I look good I
got a good name
like the stars I wasn't the radio
typical reaction I was getting they
weren't used to seeing me this way so it
was like maybe a little bit off-putting
for them and I think I kind of got a
little touchy and defended myself so
it's a little warm today and I'm
sweating so that's not a good thing
other than that it's going okay though I
actually don't feel self-conscious at
all I think the key is to really not
give a and own the look I mean the
day was fine everybody was definitely
giving me weird looks if a guy wants to
walk down the street wearing flowers on
his face so be it I got a few smiles a
few people stopping their tracks but it
didn't affect my day negatively in any
way who are they to get to define
masculinity I was really really nervous
at first but it ended up turning out
well I felt gorgeous and I'll do it
again
