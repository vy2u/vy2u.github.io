I know absolutely nothing about
contouring I think contouring is just
drastic form of makeup where you make
yourself look like clown and then you
just blend out of your face until you're
not anymore I don't see myself doing a
lot of contouring in my future but who
knows maybe this will be the beginning
to a drag story contouring is about
highlights and shadows where the Sun
would hit the most high cheekbones
forehead you're gonna make a lighter
wear on your forehead on your under your
cheekbones chin is gonna be darker there
not be a prank where I look weird like
so when you first see your face you're
gonna be like this is obviously a
product well I've always been told that
I was a pretty boy so we'll see how
pretty great boy be you ready to see
yourself pre bun yeah ready let's do it
yo me the Beast Oh what is what oh my
god it kinda looks like you smeared poop
on my face but I mean if it makes me
pretty let's blend
whoa oh my gosh hello wow that's crazy I
did say you look like a Ken doll yeah
yeah absolutely oh my god oh I will
absolutely not do contouring I don't
think does it look like me I don't feel
like I like me anymore the only reason
that I don't do it is because it's not
really a thing that's required of me by
society now I have a lot more respect
for people who contour and artists who
um do this for a living I think it
really makes a difference on people's
faces it can make people feel a
completely different way look at me look
how gorgeous I am don't deny it in the
comments
don't deny it like I'm pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
