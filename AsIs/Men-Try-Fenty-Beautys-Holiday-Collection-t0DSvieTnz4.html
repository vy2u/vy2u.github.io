snack when I first started when I wake
up was two years ago I was watching
RuPaul's Drag Race that's how I started
I would hope my friends out with fair
makeup so I just decided why don't I try
it I think now I have gained a lot of
confidence from wearing makeup but I
don't think makeup is confidence I don't
really think I'm like beautiful with and
without makeup so generally it's been
kind of hard finding foundation yes my
hard for me personally but I definitely
think for like darker skin tones it is a
lot harder I have heard all great things
about Fenty beauty products they have a
like amazing like shade range of
foundations and it's like revolutionary
basically I do think that after trying
them I would be in love with it I think
it's called the galaxy collection I
don't know cuz the packaging really it's
just so pretty I'm choosing ozone with
these eyeshadows I don't even think that
you need eyeliner for this look has a
nice like go letter to it so like it's
sick it's like a little extra but like
it's still like that natural like look
you just want it's important to put
shadow and the under eye because it
really makes the iPod it completes the
island
Packaging is really nice it's glass
cattell is a high-end makeup brand isn't
plying smoothly I've heard in mixed
reviews on it ever that full coverage
I've heard it's not full coverage I've
heard that it's glowy and like dewy
feeling but I've heard it's off man I'm
happy that this foundation is as full
coverage as I had thought it would be
and matches my skin tone perfectly which
is the hard part
I have three of the fancy beauty lip
glosses I'm going to you space-suit lip
gloss I really like the name Esther Nadi
because it really fits the theme of the
galaxy collection this lip gloss goes on
really smooth it's extremely sheer I
really like it because the psychic board
is purple but it has like that glitter
in it so it's definitely a lip gloss
either cute it's so hard to choose
what's my favorite product but if I had
to and my back is against the wall and
the wall is against my back I think I'm
gonna just go with the foundation right
now I really like the foundation because
it is soft matte and I have dry skin but
it doesn't feel like super dry on my
skin it feels good my favorite product
from this look is the eye shadow I love
the colors and I love glitter I get a
lot of messages on Instagram about men
that are like insecure and like scared
almost to start wearing makeup I think
take it slowly like I did I started out
just doing my eyebrows and then can
definitely work your way up
oh these eyeshadows could get me through
the whole holiday I'm talking Christmas
Kwanzaa New Year's Eve New Year's Day
Valentine's Day Thanksgiving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
