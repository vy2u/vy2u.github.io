cuz I don't think I could do this every
day you're definitely doing things to me
that have never been done
oh my god this is a nightmare today I'm
going to become a Katy Perry Lady Gaga
Lord Ariana Grande
previous experience with makeup minimal
to none right now my nose is getting
painted now that it odd I think that I'm
gonna look a lot like Lorde it's kind of
relaxing actually now that we're
starting to get closer to the hi it's
not as relaxing as before if this is
common for ladies to do every morning
I certainly have tougher eyelids than I
do she's like slowly turning me into my
grandfather he was a thick eyebrow man
good she'd be acceptable for guys to
cover up zits or like even out their
tone because we could all look nicer how
do you think my brows compared to Lords
my brows are a lot juicier than Lords
brows so you know I do see your brows
guys this is about already eight times
as long as I would ever spend on my face
and appearance if I was a girl I was
gonna be named Elizabeth so my mom it's
me Elizabeth
okay yes there are a time wake up I'm
going to start crying
yeah I can tell
what should we do women do their makeup
in the car I don't think this is safe
like this makeup comes with a desire to
pout feel a little pretty
hello YouTube it's crazy how you can
just paint somebody else's face onto
someone's face can make someone as
gorgeous as me look like someone whose
average is maybe period Here I am
basically with my lord look everything
except for the wig I'm scaring myself
right now too much hair in the way what
is that like a hot bath I literally I
just came out of a garbage can but I get
in there so then the how does it look
how about how's this look when I like
what past this is Lord hears me you guys
can't tell the difference
do I feel good that I make the best
woman out of us for men I'm gonna get
back to you on that
look like a female a grid' I look like
Chewbacca got a perm I look like a metal
dude from like the 80s on steroids I
look like a giant cocker spaniel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
