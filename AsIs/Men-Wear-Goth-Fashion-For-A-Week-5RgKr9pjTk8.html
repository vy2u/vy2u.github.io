and this is about as different as you
can get I've always wanted to be gone I
think it's very beautiful I just was a
little shy to try it out because of
social pressures no I never felt
compelled to try a goth look because I
like color too much I'm like just doing
it oh my god someone's gonna do it for
me oh mercy
this is really really hard for me
because I don't like going anywhere near
my eyeballs
there's deathly levels of expression
going on here probably people that are
much more talented at makeup and design
and art than I am anyone who can commit
100% to their creativity and their
identity like that's awesome you groom
yourself for you when you're dressing
goth
so you look at yourself in the mirror
and you're like oh I look cool I have a
whole new respect for people who do this
because it's difficult and they make it
look good and I can I feel awesome I
feel cool it's fun I don't get to look
like this all the time so it's cool to
just look different for a change I don't
dislike this look I would never be mean
to someone in this look but I just hate
it on myself I think there are a lot of
people out there who secretly want to
try out this whole goth thing it's
pretty badass forget about doing a week
like this I mean realistically you'll be
lucky if I do this for 10 minutes
I look like mime who got drunk and slept
over a girl's house and is now making a
walk of shame I just looked terrible and
I think that's why it was bitter it's
because everyone else looked great as a
god it's Sunday
I'm golf and I'm about to play some
squash
I did play some squash which is about
the Ungava thing you can do went to the
movies I went to the gym so I'm walking
a Starbucks and I could totally feel
people's eyes on me like just like the
weight of their glances on me you can
feel it
I felt very self-aware I was very aware
of where people's eyeballs were focused
on my body I noticed a lot of people are
a lot more polite like if I held the
door open for someone they would be like
why thank you and I told people like oh
hey like I'm gothic don't worry this is
for video people like why did you even
tell us that like it's all good it's a
positive experience for me I'm very glad
I did it
I felt really cool is cool we're black
I'm still wearing the fingernail polish
looking back on it I put on way too much
makeup you should celebrate creative
freedom and that's what goth people are
doing is celebrating their creative
freedom people thought I was fun and
cool to look at but they didn't want to
approach me they didn't really want to
hang out I guess that's the price you
pay for looking like a badass
