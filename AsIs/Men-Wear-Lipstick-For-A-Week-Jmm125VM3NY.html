just stays on and looks great all day
even lunch with it and it still looks
this good I do not commonly associate
men in lipstick other than in drag
scenarios there was never really a
situation where it was acceptable for
men to wear makeup unless it was
Halloween I suppose because men just
don't wear makeup as much so I was just
so like as a young boy I assumed that
men who aren't supposed to wear makeup
and then there is always that sort of
gender binary growing up for boys do
this and girls do this I think I'm most
nervous about people's reactions and how
people will perceive me a lot of men
wear makeup we don't realize they're
wearing makeup like for example Brad
Pitt wears makeup in all these movies so
I think then do wear makeup and we just
don't realize it I think I'm gonna wind
up doing a lot of social stuff that I'm
not super happy about wearing lipstick
for I was not expecting like a lip
eyeliner I don't know how I did to be
honest I can't I definitely got it on
there but I'm I'm realizing that I need
to do some manscaping a little bit
I'm nervous about all of them except for
nude this is my first meal since wearing
lipstick and the shit's all coming off
on this can can't even tell him wearing
it I like this one
I hope lipstick is edible because I've
been like licking my lips all day I
think I've looked off like almost all
the lipstick I don't apply this purple
lipstick but I will say this isn't
exactly like a get ready quick in the
morning type thing this is fun I feel
like Rihanna and this Kyle
and I've gotten a lot of compliments so
far so I'm way more into this color than
the other ones if I were able to like
totally throw at social norms and
masculinity aside I kind of see myself
wearing like this do you like them yeah
does it look weird
they're overdrawn - I like it
well I guess I'm going to have to ask
all the girls in the office a bit of
makeup wipes because I can't get this up
hey lady like you guys have any makeup
removers I tried it in the car
this type of lipstick is really dry yeah
I don't like I'm actually I've been
worried to go get the drinks I don't
want to mess up my face much so I'm just
seeing myself for the first time after
hours in headphones and my hair would be
kinda crazy and this lipstick I love
this straight up I just wore this red
lipstick out in public I wore to my bank
and I seen my banker and he told me
lady he told me I look like a bearded
lady walk lesson dudes who seemed like
very masculine and I realized that I am
like super uncomfortable having my
masculinity this compromised around
dudes who I perceived to be more
masculine than me yesterday when you had
it on mm-hmm I think for a damn minute I
didn't really even I didn't think about
it I wasn't like cubs wear makeup today
I'm just like that thank you that's what
I thought I don't know what I've noticed
today is that I've been getting a few
more dirty looks or aversion as many
compliments I think it's color based
honestly you
Thanks I don't feel super-confident feel
pretty embarrassed go unchallenged a
little bit of your color I think it
looks good and I'm not mad at it
I don't know she can taste men I mean
I'm mad at the color and like the
product of this lipstick but the act of
wearing lipstick I'm not so like mad at
after a lot of walking around nobody
seems to care anymore
so I don't care whatever it's just a
fashion choice I wore lipstick for a
week and it wasn't that bad I think a
lot of the problems that I had were
mental problems and to my surprise a lot
of people don't care in fact I got more
compliments than I got weird stares
my hands were often covered in lipstick
by the end of the day and it was just a
nuisance to keep up with also walking
down the street I was very uncomfortable
it was more enjoyable and insightful
than I thought to it I got
recommendations for lip colors I've
learned a lot about lipstick I learned
tricks and hacks I have fun I hope that
one day I live in a world where I would
feel comfortable even considering
incorporating this into my everyday look
but right now I just feel like if I wore
lipstick every day it would just look
like I was trying to get looked at all
the time I don't know I don't think it's
this big a deal as people make it out to
be
you know what I mean it's just paint I
don't know if I will incorporate like
hardcore lipstick into my future but
there was a moment when I was walking to
work I was like this is one of those
moments where you have talked your whole
life about how it's okay to you know do
whatever you want and be the person you
want to be but I was practicing what I
was preaching and it felt great just
pushed your envelope you know your your
boundaries a little more because I mean
I'm not someone that would actively go
and like wear makeup all the time but
like this was fun and I was open to it
and now I you know I'm more accepting
with the whole thing I tried to put it
on blind no it looks pretty good I don't
think no I think where's it where's it
that it shouldn't be
that's my lips
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
