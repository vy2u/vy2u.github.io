it in the right position what when I
finally got my period I remember I
started crying a lot for some reason I
thought I was in trouble forgetting it
because it's such a taboo for instance
have you ever been stopped into going
into your aunt's kitchen or from hugging
your grandfather or touching a male
member female member of your family
because of any reason guess what so many
of us have you've probably never seen
this packet before because it's usually
covered in black contraband first thing
you have to do is put your chutney the
way it needs to be where are you going
to put it how does it go and logically
where does it go I don't really know
little plastic wrapper of women secrets
know how do I do it
is it like a band-aid that's really
painful image in my head so this green
thing doesn't come off it's an additive
it should be like a chips packages to
opener comes out and it can just stick
to the lining of your underwear so what
are these called you know what these are
called wings oh I imagine something like
a high-tech version of velcro away oh
yeah no you see I'm not doing it
you know I'm gonna edit I'll do it my
way would I know when I have to change
it like I would know right yeah when
it's red all over and can't take even
one more drop of blood oh okay this is
not comfortable there's no healthy
breeze around my privates anymore kind
of weird because I've never had
something pressed against my junk so
much it's not much either
like is it clearly a jig do you have a
pad wedgie yeah but does that happen a
lot
yep does your manhood come in the way no
my man was very comfortable with the
standard feel on the cloth sometimes
when you remove oil drip out there's
gonna be dripping and okay stating
is a different well yeah that's the
school I can do this it's fine
that's what I do just
line it up okay good it's doable I can
do Oh let Yahoo are not breathe for five
days straight what I can even hear what
you're saying like I can just feel it
every time that I am NOT okay or I'm
Moody you don't have to you know sort of
mock me and say that how you're PMSing
or whatever amazing again or whatever
Fame I seek to go to punch me or what
yeah okay the reason I'm feeling so icky
about it is because men never talk about
it now that I think of it my mother like
I had never seen a pair of my house and
I always saw them somewhere hidden
underneath her clothes like a cousin or
someone asks us we should be able to
answer don't just go like go talk to
mommy no but do you know the other words
are the core do it cuz unblurred there
is Doctor Zhivago Doctor Zhivago is
coming to town</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
