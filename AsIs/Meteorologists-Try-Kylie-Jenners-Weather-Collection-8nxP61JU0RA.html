get a pop a highlight and then later on
in the afternoon you're gonna see a
little bit of contour on fleek there as
you head on out this evening we're going
to be trying the Kylie cosmetics weather
collection as meteorologists we're out
in the field
this is Ocean Avenue in Freeport chasing
those storms we have to read Doppler
radar winds snow how that affects the
roads we really know the weather Kylie's
a style icon it's original it's in honor
of her daughter so we're here to see if
this collection is lightning hot or not
the packaging so cute we have some
streaks of lightning I love the Navy I
think it's a real bold statement
especially if you're going out and you
want to do something kind of smoky going
out with your friends um before the
storm and I have a crystal house slash
palette these aren't exactly as
pigmented as I would hope finger let's
wash that baby oh yeah celestial and
electric are obviously standing on my
arm see the green at that's hot I'm
gonna do some green she's also giving an
option of if you don't like the shimmer
I have it and the bat
I love anything that's like a nude tone
I'm not a black lipstick person but for
this shoot and because it's the weather
collection why not
would you wear this on air no well it
definitely makes my teeth look whiter
this is the Nova I would wear this I
would wear this going out to the ball
and you can even get away with this
being kind of casual the pigment is very
very vibrant it's very thick and okay
there you go you could really see the
iridescence yeah how it changes colors
that's really pretty what I love about
highlighter I feel like it's like the
icing on the cake you do your whole face
of makeup and then a nice highlighter
everything just glows the only thing
about this collection is I wish there
were some brushes what are the names too
on the back of one we have loud nine
stratus daydream and Golden Hour take
the sky right here do that one here we
go I'm gonna juice Betty gratis oh
that's pretty
and this is the violet moon you know
what I think my color is more twinkle
twinkle let me see I think I'm more of a
twinkle twinkle girl I'm Pro glitter
last product of the weather collection
this is the Kylie Jenner loose powder
highlighter it comes in beautiful yellow
iridescent Kylie packaging obviously
light you're inspired my hands are so
sparkly alright so loose pop oh wait
this is a highlighter and it's super
dark boom done seal it with blood the
weather collection does the Kylie
cosmetics whether makeup collection past
the meteorologist test I say yes I'm
blown away with the colors the way
everything applies so nicely and then as
someone that covers whether something
like the Nova that goes so smooth across
your lips when it's the pigment the
color comes out the highlighters are
just so bright like when you're doing
storm coverage and the Sun is beating
down on you and I'm about it based off
of the colors and based off of how she
placed them - with each palette I really
do believe this past every kind of
weather meteorologist astronomy weather
enthusiastic test whether we like it or
not this collection is really cute and
coming up with a collection dedicated to
her daughter is just absolutely adorable
and original so I guess today's forecast
is stormy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
