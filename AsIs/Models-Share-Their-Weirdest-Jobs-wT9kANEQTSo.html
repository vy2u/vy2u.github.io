a lot of times you are walking into
environments and meeting people for the
first time and then you have to stick
your hands in their mouth one time I was
doing a body shaper infomercial okay so
there was a before and after I did not
know there was a before my agency sent
me up for a shoot
I met the photographer two days
beforehand one time I went to do a job
and I walked in and it turns out I was
going to be the hands for Andy Sandberg
they told me I'd be a reporter for like
some on sale which means a hotspring
second natural hot springs had to
photograph um topless with a snake had
to be in a speedo while the buyers from
Mexico came to look at the new apparel
apparently I was not unflattering enough
in the normal body shaping thing product
they were shaming so they took rubber
bands and put them along my thighs and
my waist to create roles they actually
asked me to grow my hair out two days
before and I was Balder than this so
basically what I had to do was sit
behind him wrap my arm around his way so
that I wouldn't fall over and get bend
and get my head out of the way well my
other arm came up between his to rest on
his face like that they gave me this
like white fluffy bikini and they give
me a little bunny ear and they just
decided me to be like the little snow
bunny it's not really reporting hot
springs or anything and so they put on
my shoulders so his head started going
like this and I was like don't look him
in the eyes don't like I'm in the hi
City cat I looking you have to take the
snake away so they had to keep taking
the snake off me nobody spoke a lick of
English they were all just looking at me
asking me to turn they just give the
hand signal asking me to turn and they
wouldn't say anything and then they chew
me away I'd go try it another swimsuit
go back trying another swimsuit nothing
was ever said until the end it was
thanks by you know with acting you
prepare there's this character that
you're in and then you show up to a
modeling audition and it's like okay
just take off your clothes and pose in
your bra and underwear the heck am I
gonna do try and push it out of that my
hair looks like a mocha stain like is it
what I don't know like okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
