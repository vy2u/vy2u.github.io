know about Kylie Jenner I was thinking
her name was Kylie Kardashian so today
we're getting Kylie makeovers I don't
know much about Kylie so I really don't
know what I'm getting into which makes
me nervous which is why I don't really
know if I want to do it she's the new
Kim apparently she was like the kid
there's always a wealthy teenager who's
sort of this it girl the Kardashian like
Empire has kept that within their family
for like the last I don't know 15 years
I mean that's pretty impressive
I expect my makeover to involve lots of
articles of clothing or not that exposed
my body in ways that do not make me feel
comfortable are they gonna give us lip
injections because that would be kind of
into that everything I know about kylie
jenner comes from BuzzFeed
it's just headlines yeah is like
confident with the capital C on
Instagram okay so we're here at Sam and
Laura who are BuzzFeed's foremost
experts on Kylie Jenner and they're
going to help us figure out how to live
like Kylie will take it outside your
comfort zone a little bit
you have to show off your body everyone
should want to show off their body I
will say after having two kids showing
off my body is like the last thing I
want to do well you're gonna step into
Kylie's shoes and you're gonna figure
out okay Kylie is like into these weird
like what even color is this would you
say it's like easy we sometimes forget
that she's 19 well I didn't forget she's
19 I wore a bra today Morgan and I did a
little shopping based on what we figured
from Instagram and snapchat
Kylie either wears sweats or she's
wearing a body-hugging type of dress
with heels are you ready
why what's wrong with my Bergen stop
you're about to go up like six inches
the experience was weird
what's so weird I mean getting a
makeover is fun and getting to have new
clothes was fun but I didn't feel really
comfortable in them and even in the
makeover like this experience didn't
feel comfortable to me because it's just
so far removed from Who I am that I
really struggled with it I'm really
happy that I'm not 19 anymore
I wonder our young girls growing up now
thinking I need to put myself on social
media because that equals confidence I
feel more confident as Kylee no I felt
like it was a performance but it was fun
are you smiling don't smile alright we
walked through the office which was
horrifying horrifying we are grown-ass
women we worked here for years to
Kylie's here who comes earth Court Nana
Chloe
Dona caught us like I was having the
best time
like we had a runway show so we walked
down the aisle and everyone was cheering
and it felt so good
and then the moment we walked out those
doors like what the hell oh my god it
was like my inner child started being
like run oh no I got home last night and
I was just like you know what I learned
I love myself I'm awesome I'm
low-maintenance my sweats fit I really
struggled with it and I feel like I
needed to pose a certain way and have my
makeup perfect and the clothes perfect
and some sort of nonchalant attitude
about everything it's not easy
my daughter up at school and I button
myself all the way up because I didn't
feel confident I felt embarrassed right
while I went to back-to-school night and
I like completely stripped it down like
I took it all off because I was just
saying my daughter started a new school
two weeks ago like I can't show up
dressed this way to school and like on
the one hand why not you know why can't
I be a woman who puts that much effort
into myself and have a child work and go
to back-to-school night but on the flip
side like at home I felt like for a day
I stopped being bummed out about the
weight I put on and I rocked my curves
so thank you for that Kylie you know
