Shannon I have a two-year-old his name
is Adan he knows exactly what he wants
it gets kind of crazy sometimes and it
becomes like a little bit of a battle my
name is Jennifer my son is Elliot
he's three and a half he's super sweet
kid but he's so curious about everything
my name is Audra and I have four kids
Jayla Keith Isaiah and aundrea they are
wild and creative my name is Christine
and I have seven kids
Elijah Elizabeth Ethan Olivia Emily
Ezra and Enoch is two it's crazy it's
fun it's very very messy but
exhilarating the biggest mess on record
is a muffin incident they like to do
smoothies sometimes they take their own
initiative I asked everyone to help me
make some tomato sauce I put the
chocolate milk in the wrong Cup
apparently he was not having it the
banana peels are all over the floors the
Wold is hair on the ground it's just a
hot mess my life is a perpetual cleaning
up of my son's mess that is my life so
go ahead and move move your hand and
open your eyes
yay this is great oh I get to make the
vents
I feel free good thank you I don't even
feel guilty like to be a kid it's very
liberating if you have to clean up a
mess like this just make sure you deep
clean and disinfect all those parents
out there I would say it's always
important to be prepared I'd rather
actually clean this mess than what I got
to go home
can I have the Clorox now because I'll
just start here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
