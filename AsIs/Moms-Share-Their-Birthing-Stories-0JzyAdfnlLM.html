and we're led to believe so when your
baby's born they turn face down to come
out my baby did not turn face down so he
was uh they called him stargazer as he
was just face-up and not doing the turn
to come out I was put in the operating
room she's in there with the forceps and
she's like says to me I'm trying really
hard not to tear your perineum and I was
like just cut it and so she was
like okay cut boom baby out because I
didn't feel anything and at that point I
was like I don't give a about my
for anybody but my baby out the concept
of a home birth was so appealing to me
because I loved the way my midwives
wanted to empower me and my home birth
experience was incredible it was far and
away one of the best days of my life
the Ring of Fire is referred to lovingly
in natural birth as the moment when the
child's head comes right out of the
vagina and you feel it my midwife's like
alright grab the belly band then we're
like what's the belly band for and she
takes the belly band she like wraps it
around my belly and she and my sister
lifted my daughter up like on the
outside lifted her and then just shoved
her over into my birth canal technically
when they want you to give birth you
know they want you to give birth at 38
weeks like 38 to 40 well I was at 41
weeks in 3 days they wanted to send me
in for a stress test so when I went to
go leave for the hospital I actually sat
in the car and my water broke when my
contractions first started that's like
putting on a super-tight waist trainer
and not being able to take it off and
kind of having to break through the lace
trainer to relieve the pain I had two
kids that were born at 28 weeks who
lungs weren't developed and off who
needed assistance for ventilators when
the first baby came out there was just
like four or five people just my job
like on just getting him all worked up
because he had be on a ventilator he was
well I found this out later but 2 pounds
4 ounces he was really sick baby be who
we named because we knew it was two boys
his name was Jacob he came out and again
it was just that swarm of
getting him ready and saving his life my
son stated a negative one which wasn't
coming past the birth canal so at nine
and a half centimeters she goes okay
well he hasn't moved down I think we're
asked to be back for a c-section she
said well you know your temperature's
rising your heart rate is lowering the
baby's heart rate is lowering they're
developing an infection in your in your
uterus and we don't want it to pass on
to baby but doctor came in and said that
one of their lungs had collapsed so they
needed to insert a chest tube to try to
build it back up and then a few hours
later we find out the second baby had
the same thing they put these clamps in
your stomach and when they reach your
abdomen they use these clamps to stretch
open your abdominal walls and when they
put this clamps in and they stretched I
felt everything the second I saw my son
you forget they're going through these
massive amounts of pain and these
massive amounts of anxiety you see the
one love of your life you've been
waiting for your entire life I reach
down and I got to feel my daughter
coming out and pull her out and look at
her and see her eyes open for the very
first time to see me he got handed to
Daddy for us no way he got to see him
first it came home March late 2009 and I
was fortunate they never had to go back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
