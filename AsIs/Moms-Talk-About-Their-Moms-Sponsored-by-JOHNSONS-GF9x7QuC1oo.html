my mom that I'm sorry
I actually respect my mom a lot more now
I used to think she was a total psycho
I am so much more loving to my mom since
I became a mom I knew that she
sacrificed a lot for us but I didn't
know how much she's a Christ my
perception of my mother when I was
younger was why is she not doing that
why is she not doing this and my
perception now is how did she do all of
that I know now that everything she did
really was for my own good
I will always have respect for her that
she always did the best she could with
what she had and that's all I can ever
ask of myself to I see her humanity I
see her as a person you know it's
different the the lens it just changes
when you become a mother because you
understand more she still sends me crazy
emails but I'm like I'm gonna do that
someday
like I'm gonna send my son the crazy
emails like have you looked at your feet
and you might have some corns thanks mom
Thanks yeah I appreciate her so much
more I actually called her from the
hospital after I had my first kid as I
was laying there holding my baby and I
had to tell her that now I get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
