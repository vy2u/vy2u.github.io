this this breakup mag and I'm zeyneb and
I would G hi I'm Sarah I'm Lina and I'll
be styling her for under $75 don't worry
I got you you look good you look the
best you ever looked
I have no Nina for about a year now
my fashion I was like 90s tomboy lazy
fashionista I'm inspired by like Danny I
see pictures of them I'm like wow I have
a leather jacket but am I gonna do
everything else with a low jacket no so
you're literally inspired because they
both wear clothes thank you for close to
SATA is like always in a jean jacket
which is cool I'm like okay good like
you're in some sort of like good
direction but then she'll like
underneath it have like a random t-shirt
I'm no graphic - you're like a badge
here Chloe
it's literally those t-shirts to get
from college for free we met when we
were five I think when I moved from
Pakistan to the US I would describe my
style as kind of accidentally business
casual things you would wear at work but
dress down a little bit maybe like one
notch above rolling out of bed and going
to class in my pajamas my style
inspirations obviously Rihanna that's
like a no-brainer I really like you know
style I think she was like one of the
first Muslim women that I saw like kind
of sort of mainstream she has her like
phases but I think it's mostly like
grandma she's like the cool auntie or
like your cool baby sitter kind of vibe
but I haven't seen you in anything too
crazy where I'm like don't don't
why are you going outside on that I've
never seen that I'm not that adventurous
with my stylist like I have a lane and I
like to stay in it
you know I seldom swear out of it I just
feel like in the fashion world like
growing up there was no Muslim woman out
there really that's why I was so
influenced by the next closest thing to
me which were like my brothers I think
social media has really changed the game
hey job ease on Instagram killing it
Halima Aden recently got signed to IMG
Models and was on the cover of Vogue and
you know that's a huge deal I think
there's like a lot of young Muslim girls
in this next generation that are gonna
see that and it's gonna be really
amazing and groundbreaking for them okay
well I'm gonna go so I can buy you a
cute outfit wish me luck don't up
so I'm at the mall I'm about to grab
some stuff for Z I'm currently on my way
to a few different shops the shop for
sada I want her to wear something edgy
something that she wouldn't normally
think to wear my biggest challenge I
guess is gonna be the $75 limit
tough to put together an outfit
so yeah let's do this all right team I
did it it was really hard like as soon
as I got in it felt real it was actually
a lot harder than I thought it would be
to put it together I would say that the
hardest part was not imposing my style
and my fashion on to what I was choosing
which I think I definitely did hopefully
it turns out well I actually don't know
if she's gonna like it like at all
I think she's gonna rock it we're gonna
see how this turns out if you like it or
not I have no idea what to expect I
don't know let's just get to it I'm
actually excited to see how SATA looks
it might turn out pretty well after all
I feel like I'm seeing my bride for the
first time on our wedding day
all right SATA are you ready for us no
oh my god you look so good see myself
you look so cute oh okay
that's a lot of glitter okay oh oh I
feel like Selena any day you feel like
Selena is a good day so the vinyl
jackets actually from my closet along
with the shoes she's wearing they're
sparkly as well and the outfit set
itself is from Eden sky on Melrose and I
like the fact that it was like two
pieces and she can get like mix and
match these but it's like a nice like
pop statement and together it is alright
when I first walked into forever 21 this
romper caught my eye I did want to see
the in some kind of like romper overalls
just because I haven't seen her in that
I did some shopping around for the fur
coats
there were like quite a few options this
color
I thought matched really well and I
hadn't seen her net before if I was to
see this outfit like in a store or
something I probably would pick out like
a similar type of romper I've been
looking for a good romper for a while
now it's on me there's no going back
I'm excited to see what people think I
think people will probably for the most
part be like really into it it's pretty
stylish high five
yeah representation for me is more about
that all happening and not being
remarkable at all like I want to see a
day where we can see like different
types of people and it's not like oh did
you see like that one Muslim model like
what a bigger like texting all your
friends like this I mean the griot
everywhere on Twitter it's like I want
to get to a point where that's just the
norm yeah and you know I think that we
are taking the steps to get there and
that is happening but you know I'm happy
that we are where we are yeah I agree
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
