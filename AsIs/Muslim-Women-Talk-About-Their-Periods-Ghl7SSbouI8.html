she was like oh my god we're gonna throw
a party and I was like excuse me first
almost a woman talking about periods
openly can at times be taboo thanks to
impart to some religious interpretations
as well as culture however conversations
about menstruation are stigmatized
across many communities not just for
Muslims today
these women are sharing stories about
their periods I remember the day I got
my period I was 12 I was March 12th come
on oh my diary and then I called my best
friend my dad sat me down and said
travina you know you're now capable of
having children I first realized I got
my period
I was around 10 or 11 and so the concept
of it was very scary and shocking but my
mom she was like we're gonna throw a
party just sort of to happy see oh my
god congratulations I had to show up to
this party and act like everything was
okay okay thank you thank you for
showing up for my period party hmm I got
my period I didn't know anything about
it I came home from school and told my
mom that I thought I was bleeding to
death and she just kind of walked away
came back with a pad handed it to me and
that was it and we never spoke about
periods again so like during Ramadan I
would sometimes like wait for all my
family to be upstairs and I was just
like sneak downstairs this one time I
went to get chips eating and like really
quickly all of a sudden my brother comes
out of nowhere and he's just like what
are you doing and I was like I'm sick
there are times where we've gotten up
and just kind of nibbled on something
and pretended like we're fasting the
next day and then
they throw parties pretend that you're
sick yeah that turn oh no I would sleep
in I would not wake up within my own
family it was quite an open discussion
so my dad would always go get me
chocolate and make sure I was stocked up
on pads if I needed it my mom would tell
me to just like not talk about it if I
was on it for the first like couple
years I feel like so embarrassed I would
literally pretend to like make hoodoo
even worse is when like period starts on
the day of Eid sometimes I'm like but is
it on for real because like you always
say the sister during the prayer they're
just sitting down you're like turn cycle
traditionally in my house tampons are
like not allowed our masala so as these
pads stay away from tampons tampons
always freak me out
I think people believe that tampons are
haram because it might break the hymen
medically they're okay to use along with
pads I know there are women who say that
they've heard people getting like toxic
shock syndrome from it and that actually
I haven't seen that in my practice if
you're using it properly that shouldn't
really be a concern I don't think that
menstruating women are impure according
to Islam not only having your period
stops you from praying doing basic body
ly like human functions and these aren't
considered good or bad besides women who
are menstruating and people who are
exempt from fasting are people who are
traveling pregnant women young kids
people who are sick I can't really get
out of bed so this tanta for printer
it's actually a beautiful thing and a
blessing that we are exempt from that
girls do feel like maybe they're not as
clean or they're dirty during their
cycle it's sad that that little girls
have to feel that way this is your body
like functioning the way it should be
it's just something natural that happens
to mostly every woman as a mom of a
six-month-old the fact that our bodies
can even do that is pretty miraculous a
rahmanir rahim those are two names of
the 99 names of God and one of them was
dedicated to a female's womb all
freaking beautiful is that
because Islam is such a way of life
people sometimes blend culture and
religion with in their religions it's
very open the rules are very clearly
stated if anything it's Islamic to talk
like it's stigma in society in general
not just in the Muslim community to make
the situation better I feel like we as a
community definitely should be more open
about it our younger brother is kind of
going through that like you were no 8
yeah so when you talk about it with him
all the time yeah I want him to feel
like he isn't aware of what's going on
you see your Muslim friend and she is
eating during Ramadan you don't address
it in an aggressive way by any means for
all the lovers out there stay in your
lane
stop asking me why I'm not praying I
definitely think it's okay for girls to
feel like shy and like modest to like
talk about the subject I totally get
that the important thing to ask is why
are you behaving that way to make the
men in the space more comfortable or are
you more comfortable there are certain
scholars that will take things and twist
it and misinterpret it and I say this
respectfully I love a lot of our male
leaders but we don't have enough female
leaders in the community this is the
time woman needs to step up let's do
this I want to be the female version
with me men be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
