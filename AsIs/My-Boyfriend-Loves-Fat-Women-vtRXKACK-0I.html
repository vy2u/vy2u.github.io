loves fat women ironically enough I met
my boyfriend during the thinnest month
of my life I was at a friend's birthday
party at a bar when I saw my future
boyfriend Brian from across the room
Brian was the type of guy I spent most
of my life pining after and never
getting slim with dark hair and glasses
his jeans torn in all the right places
if I had still been at my heaviest
weight I never would have approached
Brian but I was feeling brave and I
walked that crazy all the way to the
other side of the bar and introduced
myself to him there was a three-hour
period after Brian first kissed me where
I felt like I could do anything in my
mind I had done the impossible at some
point that night I remember lying next
to him still feeling unbelievably coffee
from my victory when Brian mentioned you
aren't normally my type oh god I thought
is this the part where he lets me know
how nice he is for throwing my chubby
ass a bone what's normally your type I
asked I like bigger ladies very big
ladies actually he said but I am your
type I thought sadly Brian was attracted
to fat girls and I was one of them this
of course did not take away from how
into Brian I was we started dating
almost immediately and became
inseparable it was also during this time
that I started slowly putting a lot of
weight back on I put on the sundress
that I thought might be a little too
backless for my current weight Brian
however loved the dress maybe even a
little bit too much I spent a lot of
time swatting his hands away from the
open back
I felt happy wearing it beautiful then I
wore it to a bar Brian turned to a
mutual friend of ours and eagerly
drunkenly opined doesn't Kristen look
amazing in that dress the silence that
followed felt like the moment before
someone hits the button on a dunk tank I
realized that too Brian
I did look amazing in that dress because
I looked fat it got to the point where
compliments from Brian were actually
painful to hear every time he said you
look beautiful all I could ever hear was
you look fat
Brian would carefully say I love your
body
because Kristen lives in your body and
the worst part was that the more I poked
at myself the more Brian would poke at
himself too
one morning I saw Brian looking at
himself in the mirror grabbing the small
Pudge from his stomach how many times
had Brian felt like this frustrated
annoyed and helpless as he watched me
tear down a thing he loved I wish I
could say that I'm a hundred percent
okay with myself I'm trying to
understand that just like I am NOT just
a fat girl brian is not just a person
who likes fat girls two years ago I
didn't even realize they made bikinis in
a size 18 turns out that they do and
this year I intend to buy one and wear
it to the beach I will enjoy how excited
that makes Brian to see me happy in my
own skin I will let him enjoy the thing
that he loves without paring it down but
most importantly I will work to our love
from me who will always play the hardest
to get I will flirt as hard as I can and
I will win myself back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
