(guy laughs)
I'm about to shave my head.
- Yeah!
- Today, my boyfriend
Kyle is shaving my head.
And I'm super nervous.
And scared to see what
it's gonna look like.
- It is long and lucious
but soon it will be on the ground.
- I've dyed it a lot
and straightened it a lot
and it doesn't look like
what I was born with.
I finally have a partner,
who is so supportive
and wants me to do it
and thinks I will look good, with no hair!
So, hell yeah!
This is the time that I should do it.
(upbeat music)
- Final handshake goodbye.
Nice working with you.
(clippers buzz)
(laughs)
- Ow!
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts my feelings.
Ow, that hurts!
- Sorry.
- I feel like I'm not even
experiencing this anymore.
It's somebody else.
I better look like Amber Rose.
- I'm having a great time.
You can make it sort of go back to before.
By wiping it over a little bit.
- Yeah, that's what Trump does.
Wow, I'm committed now.
- Well, yeah.
I think if I part it.
I'm actually getting the hang of this now.
Of how your hair grows.
I think I can do it with
minimal pain from now on.
- I look like Angelica's
doll from Rugrats.
It's the last little strand.
This is wild!
This is a whole trash can of my hair!
I am so happy with the way it turned out.
You literally, physically feel liberated.
Thank you!
- I'm so happy and honored to have gotten
to share in this with you.
- I was scared that my partner
would find me less attractive
but now I just don't care
because I feel like I look hot.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
