2007 at my dress ready I had like my
makeup done I was super tan I look like
I was 40 years old but really I was 18
so someone suggests it
let's do weed brownies I didn't even
smoke I maybe had smoked once or twice
in my life me and my friend went to like
Walmart or something and we grabbed some
the box recipes that you just need like
an egg and oil we add everything we made
our brownies like decorated with like
sprinkles I'm like icing to make a cuter
I don't know we make a batch so it's
like special brownies and we put it in
like a red tray and then we got a blue
tray for like the munchies brownies so
those brownies were just just brownies
no weed so we get to this party we pass
out the weed brownies everybody's eating
them I don't know like an hour passed my
owner is like nothing's happening I'm
not high I don't feel anything so I'm
like I'm gonna eat another one so that's
two weed brownies and no one they're
smart enough to tell me like you need to
digest it for it to hit you so I was
like oh whatever - it's gonna be fine
for someone who doesn't smoke ever all
of a sudden we get to prom I was in
student government or something I had to
be up there with my other best friend
who was like the most judgmental friend
I have I was on stage with her and she
goes we have to crown the Queen and
whatever and I'm like great yeah let's
do it
all of a sudden I looked out I'm on
stage and it hits me I was so high
mm-hmm
my high logic was I couldn't raise my
arms because if I raised my arms people
wouldn't know I was high so I was
freaking out because I was supposed to
crown this girl and I couldn't lift my
arms to do it and then I was also scared
that when I put this like the little
massage on her I was gonna pin it to my
finger so I had these two crazy fears
and I couldn't do it so I just turned to
my friend I tell her you need to crown
her for me she's like why what's wrong
with you and I'm like I'm so
high you need to ground her she crowns
the Queen everyone's confused cuz I was
gonna do it I thought they were gonna
call the cops and tell my mom and arrest
me and then comes the after-party
I was so high by this time and it's like
a body high where I just wanted to be
sitting now
she's like I'm just not enjoying this I
want to be sober again I tell my friend
I'm like hey I feel like like I'm
way too high I need to go to sleep and
she's like you know what why don't we
give you some food so I go into the
kitchen and I ask my friends like where
are the brownies and he goes they're
over there and there was a two trays but
one of them was empty so I believe the
one where the three brownies were was
empty and the one where the regular
brownies were had like four six brownies
so I ate like three or four I was like I
need to be sober all of a sudden my
friend comes it's like yo slow down was
wrong with you why are you getting so
many weed brownies this is in the safe
trade this is not the weed brownie tray
and he's like oh no I switched them to
make room for I don't know I didn't even
hear what he said cuz I was so mad I had
just eaten four weed brownies so that's
six six weed brownies so I skip the
after party I go home
and my mom's like why are you here like
what happened just like asking me all
these questions I'm like I'm walking
towards the fridge because I'm starving
and I open the fridge if she's like what
are you doing why are you eating again
like didn't just come from dinner and I
just slammed the fridge door and I look
at her and I'm like mom you don't even
know my life
my mom is so Navy because I can't
believe she couldn't tell that I was so
high I go into my room and then I just
stayed in bed for the next three days it
was a weekend so it was perfect and I
just told my mom I had the flu and I
swear to God I was high for 30 days I
lost one station in one hand so this was
my crazy prom story all because I ate
the wrong tray of brownies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
