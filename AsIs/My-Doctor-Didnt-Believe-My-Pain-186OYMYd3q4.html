doctors have not believed me when I've
told them that I was in pain the first
one happened when I was 15 years old
during basketball practice while running
wins friends I started to feel this
horrible horrible pain in my abdomen you
know how they say your body can't
remember pain but like I almost remember
this pain so vividly I just thought I
was dying
there was a big period of my life where
I was in chronic pain and went to my
doctor time and time again just wasn't
taken seriously at all about two years
ago I had surgery to correct some of my
jaw problems after I woke up out of
surgery I immediately knew something was
wrong I had just installed my air
conditioner turned it on and I was
talking to a friend that was completely
fine
after we hung up and I tried to stand up
I like got really woozy like literally
the floor and everything kind of flipped
upside down my chest started getting
like really tight and I just felt like I
couldn't get up off the floor like I was
on the floor for maybe like 15 minutes
just trying to figure out what do I do
about two years ago I started to develop
a little pain in my vagina mostly during
sex I didn't really think anything of it
when it started a couple months later it
became almost unbearable the first
gynecologist said I went to I asked her
if anything looked abnormal and she just
laughed at me basically I was getting
very bad abdominal pain to the point
where sometimes I would be paralyzed by
pain there was one time I just was
struck by this pain and I couldn't move
I just laid down and on the airport
floor and they had to call the ambulance
I was having a ton of pain even though I
was on a ton of morphine and I told
the doctor this and he said well let's
up the dosage of morphine and he just
got out of surgery there's gonna be pain
but I knew something was I knew
something was wrong I laid off sex for a
little bit and hope that the pain would
just go away and it didn't it just kept
getting worse over the next year my mom
took me to the ER I had my Letterman on
the chair next to me
and I had an in memory button for a
classmate that had passed away and the
doctor saw the button on my coat and
asked me what it was for and I told her
that my friend had passed away
immediately her tone changed and she
looked at my mom and said I know what's
going on here four days later when I
went back into post surgical checkup the
doctor and went huh and he told me hey
in the 20-something years that I've been
practicing this has never happened
before so he actually had to go back in
four days later on New Year's Day and
redo the surgery generally the pain was
brushed off as just being period pain
and I was just losing it because I was
like is this really just my period like
is this how it's gonna be for the rest
of my life she listed my mom and then
looked at me and said your daughter is
just sad this is very common for teens
to go through after one of their
classmates passes away or goes through a
tragedy she then took the button off of
my Letterman which held it up to my face
and told me to say goodbye to my friend
oh there was like a whole crew of them
there was maybe like ten EMTs the first
thing that they said to me they were
like did you go through a bad breakup
are you sure you're not pregnant
all of these like belittling demeaning
things to say that like I think that
you're overreacting I noticed I couldn't
feel my face and the doctor said oh
sometimes post anesthesia that can
happen the feeling will come back cut to
three months later still having this
intense pain can't feel my face I go in
for a check-in and the doctor says oh
well sometimes it takes up to six months
so six months go by I come back in six
months later and he says well no no it's
for sure just the anesthesia wearing off
it's kind of like your face fell asleep
what okay I'm listening to this guy I
haven't he's such a specialized field I
had no one else to listen to so I look
at the button and I'm like goodbye and
she said say it like you mean it so I
looked at the button and tried to do
whatever she was asking even though I
still wasn't totally sure and just tried
to say goodbye to this button once I got
through that I kind of just looked at
her and waited for her to tell me what
test she was gonna run or what she was
gonna do to figure out what had caused
my pain but instead she left the room
because she thought that she had figured
out why I had the pain eventually they
were just kind of like well you know if
you were actually all of these things
you'd be this than the other kind of
wooden attitude and I was like listen
like I called you because I need help I
didn't need you to chastise me about
what I'm going through and so they
decided not to take me to the hospital
and they just kind of like walking back
upstairs and I think one more time they
had asked me like if I was sure I wasn't
pregnant even when we were paying top
dollar to see specialists who you would
assume would give you more time and more
care it was like two hundred and fifty
dollars three hundred dollars to see
this person for five minutes and they
said very similar things and it was only
until I really broke down and demanded
that I get ultrasounds that they saw
that there was there was a bigger
problem at hand
it wasn't my period after all over the
next year I saw four additional doctors
two of them also told me nothing was
wrong with me one of them treated me for
herpes but then when that didn't work
she said nothing was wrong with me the
fourth one wanted to put me on
antidepressants because she thought it
was all in my head a year goes by I
still have no feeling in my face and the
doctor says you have what's called
trigeminal neuralgia
it's a trigeminal nerve during surgery
either the first one or the second one
we're not sure he cut the nerve that
controls all the feeling in my face so
not only will that feeling ever return
to my face but the signals are all
screwy
coming from the brain so now I get
intense excruciating pain in other areas
of my face it ended up being a cyst that
was the size of about 13 to 15
centimeters and I was just sitting there
that whole time getting worse because I
wasn't being treated because apparently
it was just period pain
it was the most infuriating thing and it
honestly is like five years of my life
that I see is missing less than four
years later I had very similar extreme
pain this time I was running on a
treadmill and the pain became so bad
that I ended up basically falling off
the treadmill and crawling my way to the
women's bathroom to bomb it my friend
heard called 9-1-1 at the hospital my
dad met me there we waited hours to be
seen by the time he came to see me and
at that point he told me it's PMS and
take advil next time I didn't know at
the time but I know now that both of
those instances I actually had ovarian
cyst burst they gave me some pamphlets
there's not really a lot of information
about the vagina what I learned in my
own research is that there's just
blanket terms vestibule ena vestibule
itis vulva Dena and they're all just
blanket terms for there's pain in
different parts of your vagina but
there's no cure so the pamphlets say use
Lube or try to think of something else
other than sex I started going to see
some other doctors and as soon as I went
in and explained the situation another
doctor said I cannot believe that that
doctor did that technique on you people
haven't done that in years the one
emotion I remember feeling the most is
just shame and embarrassment I felt
stupid for going to the hospital both
times I felt like I was being a crybaby
and I felt like I was imagining the pain
that I had gone through even though deep
down I knew that the pain I was
experiencing was real and so the next
time that it happened to me I didn't
want to go to the doctor I just wanted
to lay alone in my room and die if
that's what it took these are the people
that are supposed to fix you they're the
people that are supposed to help you and
while I know what he did was an
intentional
when I decided to take legal action I
was told that the statute of limitations
for this kind of surgery was one year
guess how long he had told me wait he
kept saying wait six months later year
just wait a year come back after a year
I'm just so gobsmacked that doctors
don't know more about female anatomy
because I've spoken to so many women
about this and they've all had very
similar experiences so even once we
found out that it was a cyst they told
me everything under the Sun they said it
could be cancer I've heard countless
women's stories about bad gynecology
when I was finally diagnosed with
endometriosis and also told that I had
ovarian cysts quite often on my ovaries
I felt vindicated but also angry I
wanted to go back in time and look those
doctors in the eye and say you know what
something is wrong with me and if you
actually did your freaking job you could
have told me that I just find it so
crazy it's like would you have asked a
man or are you going through some
did you have a really bad breakup with
your girlfriend or I guys I can't
imagine them asking those series of
questions to a man the hard thing about
biases is that it's so subconscious it's
so just like rolls off of your tongue
maybe because you did deal with someone
that was having a problem in that
particular area but why does that then
demean whatever it is that they're going
through sometimes women don't want to be
seen as complaining or dramatic or
attention-seeking but why wouldn't you
want attention when you're in pain like
why do we make ourselves feel bad that
we want someone to listen to us why do
we get pushed aside
don't get me wrong I know doctors that
they have the hardest jobs in the world
but their job is also changes people's
lives and that can also mean for the
worse so I think you got to stop get
that idea of being like a complainer or
an attention seeker or a hypochondriac
out of your head because your
health when you lose that what else do
you have
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
