else taking care of you my name is
Branson I'm 24 years old
I live in New York and recently I had
Top surgery in order to alleviate my
gender dysphoria and align my body with
my identity as a non-binary trans person
and one of the people there with me
every step of the way was my mom since I
first told her that I was getting Top
surgery in the spring of 2017 my mom and
I had a lot of conversations over the
phone Skype and in-person about my
gender identity and why top surgery was
right for me
although these conversations were
difficult and sometimes hurtful we kept
talking with the hope that we would
better understand where the other was
coming from I knew I wanted her there
for Top surgery and to accept me fully
for the person that I am but for my mom
it was difficult for her to let go of
the person she thought it would grow to
be
I grew up in Southern California and was
raised by my mom and my dad mommy's
waiting to scare I kind of feel guilty
about what we did but it was so much fun
right and you liked it too my mom was a
stay-at-home mom for most of my life and
I remember spending a lot of time
playing outside and just being a kid
overall I had a really happy childhood
you know I loved being pregnant I loved
when you were born I loved when you were
a toddler you know I loved all of that I
was raised Christian but as I grew older
I ended up distancing myself from
organized religion
my mom remained connected to her faith
and it's an important part of her life
an identity today high school was a
rough period for both my mom and I
things got a lot better when I started
college in 2012 distance brought my mom
and I closer and we called each other at
least once a week but even though we
were on better terms and talking more I
soon found out I couldn't talk freely
with her about my newly discovered queer
identity queerness clearly made her
uncomfortable she would tense up when I
brought up girlfriends and she couldn't
even say the word lesbian for a long
time eventually I just stopped bringing
it up soon after I graduated college in
2015 I began exploring my gender
identity I would spend hours watching
youtube videos at night about Top
surgery reveals and testosterone updates
I found myself really relating to other
people when they would talk about how
they never felt like they fit their
ascribed gender socially transitioning
was a relatively painless process I
changed my name on Facebook and I
started a new job in New York where
people knew me as Branson my chosen name
I never felt like I needed to come out
as trans or non-binary because of my
mom's discomfort surrounding my
queerness I kept my gender identity a
secret from her at the time it was
simply easier to put up with being
called my give
and the wrong pronouns but it was a
temporary solution to something that I
knew I would need to face eventually
then in April of 2017 I received the
news that my insurance had approved my
top surgery I immediately set a date for
December and I received an overwhelming
amount of support from everyone that I
told I knew I would need to tell my mom
about my upcoming surgery a part of me
felt that I was confident enough in my
decision that it didn't matter what my
mom would say in response to the news
but looking back I knew deep down that I
wanted my mom's validation and for her
to be with me for the surgery so I
remember I got off work and I was
walking through the little park by my
work and I just kind of told you that I
was getting Top surgery how did that
make you feel I don't want to say it was
just it's really really hard dad and I
you know we created you you know when
you say to us that you don't like what
you have that we made a mistake that's
that's hard after that phone call in the
park a little less than a year ago our
conversations got more difficult when
you say it to me that you're non-binary
that you're not identifying female or
male but then you want a surgery so that
tells me you are identifying as
something well to me like chests and and
breasts aren't gendered anyone can have
a flat chest or anyone can have breasts
it's
it goes against against my beliefs it
goes against your religious beliefs
absolutely I love you but you want me to
agree with something that I'm not there
yet you know as a parent we want the
best for our children dad and I planned
everything out the way we felt your life
was gonna unfold changed at the same
time we as parents want our children to
be happy it was really difficult to hear
that my mom disagreed with something
that was so much the core of my identity
I understood that my mom's religious
beliefs made her think that I should be
happy with a body that I was given and
that it was tough for her to think that
there was something wrong with the body
that she had given birth to but in the
end this was something that I needed to
validate my identity it was gonna make
me more whole not less so as the days
grew closer to my surgery date my mom
began to watch top surgery videos
herself
I think these videos gave my mom a sense
of what my future might look like and
also gave her the peace of mind that I
would be okay I thought I was gonna have
a middle seat
I just got upgraded to a window seat
soon enough it was the day of my top
surgery I flew to San Francisco from New
York and my mom and dad drove from
Southern California
let's take us 101 North Leavenworth
Street San Francisco today is December
14th and it is the day of my top surgery
so it's seven o'clock right now and my
surgery will be happening at 9:30 a.m.
at around 7:15 we arrived at the
surgical center and I was prepped for
surgery I was feeling pure excitement
after years of binding my chest and
dreaming about the day that I could
simply throw on a t-shirt I was so calm
and completely ready for my surgery but
my mom was still feeling uneasy and
above all concerned for my safety as I
was getting prepped for surgery I wanted
my mom to understand why I was feeling
so happy earlier this year she had
undergone some surgeries of her own to
remove a hernia that was causing her a
lot of pain I hope that our shared
experience would allow us to relate to
each other better this year when I went
through my surgeries and I knew that
this was going to relieve my pain I was
happy about that
in a way like this is also like gonna be
removing life
Lauria but i feel every day we stop and
then it was time for a surgery
wait can I give one last hug love you
and I'm not crying because I'm sad I
said goodbye to my mom and my dad
and I was wheeled into the operating
room they told us that everything went
well and so when I saw you I remember
just telling you that you were going to
be ok and that you made the right
decision
throughout my recovery my mom took care
of me she helped me with my surgical
drains gave me my medication and washed
my hair when I wasn't able to shower
I know it's my job as your mother I feel
I had to be there I didn't want anyone
else taking care of you
I felt cared for and grateful but at the
same time she was still calling me by
the wrong pronouns and by the wrong name
I knew that my mom had taken great care
in picking out the name that she had
given me at birth and that she had grown
emotionally attached to it
Lauren Lauren Lauren eating oatmeal and
orange juice Lauren I still wish that
she would try harder to call me by my
preferred name and realize how damaging
it can be when trans people are
misgendered especially by people they
love then eventually little by little
she did start trying harder by the end
of my first week in recovery she had
started calling me by by initials lb ten
days after my surgery I had my post-op
appointment where dr. Masur would remove
my bandages as we drove to dr. monsters
office I wondered how my mom would react
to my scars I was preparing myself for
the worst because I watched a bunch of
YouTube videos right right and I was
pleasantly surprised that it wasn't the
worst
is this experience how you thought it
was going to turn out it turned out
better than what I thought maybe your
life isn't unfolding like dad and I had
thought it would but it's just different
and we love you it was difficult for my
mom to accept the person that I am today
and there are still times that we grow
frustrated with one another but it's
getting easier with every conversation
that we have this whole experience has
made me see my mom not just as a parent
but as a person trying to navigate
something outside of her comfort zone
our journey to understand each other
hasn't always been easy and there are
still things that she doesn't fully
understand and some that she probably
never will but one thing that I do know
is that she loves me and that even when
she struggles to understand my identity
and the choices I make to live my life
authentically she'll keep on loving me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
