passive-aggressive it seems like you
just want to hide chips and Danny with
his fun
plaintiff miss danny sullivan is suing
lifelong friend miss re jackson for
hiding things are on the house not
saying what she means and overall just
being very passive-aggressive okay let's
see what we got here so let's see Danny
you'd like Ari to stop hiding your
things birth weight you want Ari to stop
hiding her things yes Ari is hiding her
things from you yes okay it's not cool
we've been friends since like fourth
grade like we share everything oh my God
why do you keep hiding the I'm
gonna find it anyways and use it right
that's why do you think she would be
doing like that we I share everything I
come from a family of sisters like she's
an only child so that's her ish you know
that's not my issue but that's her issue
but like we were sharing like this blush
thing but she wasn't even using by the
way and I learned a new way to use it
and then so she started using it that
way normally that would bother friends
that didn't bother me but it sounds like
it bothered you
I mean I feel like I want to hear you
say with a straight face that it didn't
bother you it bothered her it's okay
okay so I see there's some there's some
bubbling up resentment here have you
been telling Ari
when this happens just say what you mean
bitch if you don't want me to use it but
 say what you mean likewise when
Ari hide something from you or when Ari
doesn't want to share something with you
do you tell her at that moment that it
bothers you yes I tell her it hurts my
soul and then she giggles and says
you'll never find it ari you giggle
she's fabricating started just like that
you see her giggling right now that's
the bitch giving what she does okay okay
okay okay everyone calm down Brazilian
accent can I say something yes I feel
like sharing is an important part of any
friendship and I like to share do it
things that you don't want to share and
I make clear the things I don't want to
share no you don't yes my expensive face
cream or oil and my underwear underwear
what are your answer I find it very
reasonable
well that I do not want to share this
thing I stopped using your underwear
hold on
wet re speak Diddy of the junii laundry
and then she doesn't have any underwear
and then she goes into my room and she
takes my underwear especially there's
certain underwear I do not want to share
namely full back underwear cuz that's
great for dresses and I wear a lot of
dresses and so then I go in and I don't
have any underwear and then it gets lost
into the vacuum of the dirty laundry and
I never get them back
I had to tell you multiple multiple
times not to use mine where I had really
really hassle her about this so this
it's understandable that already has
private items that she just doesn't want
to share that's not the problem okay
hold on now let's hear from Danny what
is the it what's the core issue okay so
the face cream and it was a boy I
know many so let's talk about how when I
have my expensive face screen out you
get to use mine all the time like I look
at it I'm like it's gone oh you need
space because it's your way of like
rubbing in the sharing it's because I'm
sharing with you so West wouldn't
you want to share with me that's hurtful
that hurts my feelings for Ari why do
you hide things instead of telling Danny
just not to use them because I've
already told her no you haven't she does
not respect him that I hide so you're
playing a game if someone doesn't
respect what am I supposed to do okay so
let me ask you something when was the
last time someone played a game with you
to teach you a lesson and it worked I
don't know maybe I didn't even know they
were playing a game and the lesson was
taught I'm glad we don't have that kind
of answer man do you see what I'm
dealing with here that was evil I have
to admit that's a little diabolical of
he'll Jorge okay all right how many
times have you asked Danny to stop using
something before you hit it once exactly
it only took you one time and then you
hit something that sounds like you it
sounds like you're not even
passive-aggressive it seems like you
just want the hide from Danny cause
it's fun and she enjoys it too I'm gonna
ask a question and just answer as
honestly as you both can I'm always okay
re-do and
hiding stuff from Danny and what follows
a little bit yeah okay Danny knew Annie
do you like trying to find re stuff and
on the bottom of it no I don't i
actually really bothers me I've heard a
lot today alright ladies and gentlemen
of the jury you must consider all of the
evidence presented today and the court
will await your verdict
has the jury reached a verdict we find
the defendant not guilty okay all right
the jury finds you not guilty it's
bittersweet it's okay guys bottom line
is here just be friends be cool with
each other
Ari's got private stuff Danny likes to
share already tell her that you don't
want to share sometimes Danny be cool
with that geez you guys are friends not
enemies right be chill do you guys feel
like better friends or what yeah yeah oh
my god that's another case pose for
Frank or boundries Rick tell us about
boundaries so you gotta set boundaries
like the Great Wall of China very
extreme boundary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
