up in Hawaii where people accepting yes
my personality I've always been out
there like growing up like I could I've
been like wearing dresses to school when
I was like the third grade I were my
first time ever wearing makeup was like
third grade
like I never took from anyone
because I've always knew that I was gay
and everyone knows one that I was gay I
could literally pull up in a bikini at
school and it just be a regular day oh

yes
fake like me with someone you'd switch
lives with I don't know I kind of want

dagger this is live so if it didn't say
for a day
oh girl you'd be married to Donald Trump
but I did for our divorce and while I'm
I'm the first lady what's your favorite
decade and why um I want to say 90s I
just like the energy like the 90 feels
like very colorful
Britney and in seeing
