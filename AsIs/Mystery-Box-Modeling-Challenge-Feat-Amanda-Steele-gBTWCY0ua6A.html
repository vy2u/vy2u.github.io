these people is about to become feed
famous last week our competitors had to
show us their best no filter challenge
Victoria won she posed in a river and
looked great but unfortunately we had to
say goodbye to Katie now we only have
five competitors and here they are hello
hey it's Anthony hello beautiful people
hi this is busy this week I'm hella
excited because I want to propose a last
week's challenge was a little
challenging for me because I am so used
to using a professional camera to get my
shots last week I really wanted to
introduce myself in the most honest way
I feel like I was myself but I wasn't
really myself myself I think I did
pretty good on that challenge and i
showcase all of the insecurities that i
wanted to showcase i was happy with it
because I felt it was true to my
aesthetic and who I am I felt that I
could do better to be honest I really
feel that it could have done better but
I was happy at the end this week I want
to serve looks I want to serve
creativity
I want to serve everything this week's
celebrity guest judge got her start on
YouTube and now has over 2.8 million
subscribers she's a model with one of
the largest modeling agencies in the
world and she stars in the hulu series
freakish
please welcome Amanda Steele thank you
so much for being here
for having me of course I thought we
could use your expertise because these
people want to be social media stars and
you are a social media star thank ya to
be here this week's challenge was
hashtag unboxing and here's what we sent
the competitors this week the challenges
hashtag unboxing and shipping you all a
special little box with three items in
it and it's up to you guys to get
creative the three items I'm sending you
are a flower garland some little tiny
sunglasses and some makeup I want you
guys to take these ordinary
and make an extraordinary picture
remember these three items have to be in
your picture and you can only take it
with your phone good luck
this week's challenge is all about
getting a little creative and why I
wanted you here personally is because
you are an amazing Beauty influencer you
get sent stuff I'm sure all the time and
you have to stay true to you and your
fans but you also have to show products
how do you feel about the challenge this
week I think it's awesome I'm really
excited to see how everyone's style
comes through yeah all the photos and if
they can make it seem natural and not
too product focus for sure that would be
great I like the sunglasses a lot that
should be easy for everyone
makeup is always easier I'm creative
with I think the garland is kind of like
the one that's out there I'm really
interested in seeing that this week we
are judging the competitors on three
categories the first category is
composition composition meaning lighting
opposing the framing of the actual
picture the second category is creative
did they really go outside of the box
with these three items that we sent them
I want to see them push themselves the
third category is feed worthiness would
you scroll past this picture would you
save it would you send it to your
friends we need to know which one we
would do and why it's feed worthy the
first competitor Anthony last week posed
and photoshopped himself into being a
literal angel I wish I was kidding right
now so I'm excited to see what Anthony
brings this week let's see it
hey it's Anthony and it's the unboxing
challenge so I'm advice if annually
it's a box got some sunglasses eyeliner
and it gave me a garland oh this could
be a look within it solved last week I
really wanted to introduce myself in the
most honest way so going into this week
I'm feeling a little more comfortable so
I'm gonna try to do like a little
mermaid super fish oh I like a very
editorial high-fashion mermaid nomes
saying I'm gonna take another picture of
myself just as a boy with the sunglasses
so it can be like my version of the
Little Mermaid but like super
high-fashion my drag name is always this
water so basically always as waters it's
come to light well now they're like a I
want a no foam so it lacks a please oh
my god that was
oh great early Wow
that looks like a poster when he was
saying like he wants it to be a high
fashion he nailed it I am here for Oh
ASA swatters composition wise even
seeing how symmetrical everything is it
looks like he really put the work in the
lighting looks beautiful I like the fade
in the background - it all looks really
great this look is so different so I'm
glad that he stayed really creative with
the makeup and then the garland I never
would have thought to do that Italy
didn't make it seem product heavy at all
I almost had to search where the
sunglasses were because like they're
just so naturally their feed worthiness
definitely would stop and look at it for
longer this is amazing hey a way to kick
off the beginning
rosie is our oldest competitor at 48
years old last week for the nofilter
challenge she went out in West Hollywood
and a lace one-piece and a fur coat and
took a picture oh my god I know so I am
really excited to see what she brings us
yeah this week is the unboxing challenge
here is the Box unnies I got the roses
for bosey and I got makeup
the possibilities are endless you know
the ideas that really came to me because
of the gorgeous flowers was like wood
named fairy or even creation goddess and
so I went to one of my second-hand
stores that's literally around the
corner from where I live well I'll
behold I found a Grecian goddess dress
Cloris was the Grecian goddess of
flowers I know inside I have a goddess
this I never what if I'm like Dalton you
oh my godness the shot really super
exceeded any expectation oh did it done
check unboxing challenge
okay I liked how passionate she sounded
when she was talking it came from a
creative place in her which is amazing
to see Rosie for sure looks like a
goddess composition wise I think this
looks good lighting I'm guessing like in
the middle of the day because it looks
very harsh but I'm okay with it I feel
like there could have been more focused
on her versus her big dress I do love
that for the creative aspect that she
drew on her arm rather than just wearing
the makeup and then feed worthiness I
think I would probably like this picture
I would like it for the extreme she went
for it so I'm like yes I don't know if
it was something that I would say for
inspiration exactly I feel like the
sunglasses maybe could have been used in
a different way just because I feel like
Greek goddesses if you're gonna go for
it then like go for that I don't think
the sunglasses go with the full look
yeah I feel like this is all very tough
to me and then here just some sunglasses
this next competitor divinity showed us
her with her wigs on and then like took
it off and took this beautiful picture
in her bedroom with no way gone and no
makeup for the nofilter challenge
so this week I'm expecting to see
something new come out of her hello
Megan so I'm feeling really good about
this exchange and I can't wait to get
into it what I got a little pile going
no darling I wasn't talking to you
really like High Noon ones that you get
downtown an alley like Missy Elliott um
it's just giving me some Grace Jones
vibes I think I should take it in that
way direction but uh yeah that way I
mean my lips look like the same color as
the sky and I'm wearing this beautiful
yellow jacket in the shiny shoes just
kind of gives like this high fashion
edge I feel or it could be a hot mess
but I liked it
this is so good this is the same
fountain from Rosie's burger in a much
different way I don't want to compare
them yet but this is really really good
yeah
the first category composition this
lighting is beautiful the lighting is
very balanced yes it looks really
high-quality
I think the framing is good I really
loved how she used the garland and her
hair
in a different way other than like
here's a flower crown I feel like she's
so beautiful and I feel like if she
toned it down a little bit then she
would be more Wow but it is an amazing
photo and I love it feed worthiness I
definitely think I would like and
probably comment on this photo I would
definitely stop like it tell her that
she's so fierce right Victoria
won last week's competition the nofilter
challenge she liked post and a ribbon
something you should know about Victoria
when she posts she posts three across so
she sends us three photos and we will
judge them all as one so let's see what
she did hello beautiful people Vickie
here as you know we got a box with three
items and we have to incorporate them
all in our picture so the blue crayon
inspired me to dye my hair I think it's
the perfect color the roses are for sure
my biggest challenge this week after
giving a lot of thought the best thing
that I could come up with was to wrap
their roses around the hula hoop I
really like her idea he's gonna bring it
to that next level
this week's challenge is gonna be crazy
and amazing
what I really enjoy is that she really
goes out for it
I like her jacket too it like fits the
vibe it really shows how creative she is
the aesthetic of all the photos are
really cool so composition wise I think
I like the framing of all of them
actually I like the weird lighting I
love that lighting the one in the middle
though I feel like doesn't have as much
effort yeah I feel like if the one in
the middle was like the other two it
would look more like a full spread as
far as creativity I like that she
randomly through that garland on Hulu
yeah she dyed her hair to match the cran
that we sent her she really got so
creative with this yeah I love feed
worthiness I would honestly like these
pictures and comment on them - I feel
like definitely if they all went
together seeing these on her page would
look really really great someone that's
easy to like click follow yes last week
oh so bear it at all for us so I'm
excited to see what also brings this way
this week I'm hella excited because I
want to represent so this week is the
unboxing challenge I'm gonna have to
make these work y'all colorful shadow
and liner what is this
quacks my sister and I don't know what
the hell I'm gonna do with this so my
concept right now I want to do like a
wild party kind of thing you don't know
like what parties are over and you're
like what just happened with my picture
yes this is awesome
it looks like an ad what I really like
about this is that you can tell this is
his aesthetic composition wise if he use
filters I think it's pulling a little
bit really warm to me I think it could
be cooler otherwise I think the
Lighting's great and I really like this
angle to creativity I personally really
love that he just threw the garland up
there he used the other things what they
were meant for so it's all pretty
standard yeah this is pretty simple but
he made it himself which is what's most
important with the product kind of
placement yeah
feed worthiness I definitely think I
would want to post something like yes I
would definitely post this photo on my
own Instagram what I really like overall
is that this is just like a vibe those
were our five competitors for this week
now we need to pick who was staying on
the feed and who gets kicked off the
feed so talk to I'm thinking oh so and
Anthony yes two totally different vibes
but both went over and beyond like he
looks like a queen in the middle this is
literal artwork I really love the feet
worthiness both of them I would be
inspired to do my own the weird thing is
that Rosie and divinity were both at the
same place
I feel like divinity did matter Rosie
did Rosie's was just a little costumey
yes but she tried I liked
Victoria I really liked the side of
yours looks super high quality it's so
good we've made our decisions let's give
them a call
