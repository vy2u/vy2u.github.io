ugly oh no hey so long what have I done
once the skin gets really long I'll
either like rip it off or sometimes I'll
rip the skin off with my teeth I think
the best way to describe it is I just
pick out them and I take my cuticles I
try to stop all the time you know
knowing Kylie Jenner I'm now starting to
realize this might not be a discreet
solution are these ladies mine I don't
know let's try it out these nails being
this length looks very silly to me this
is not subtle I do feel like a witch so
it's like a cool hip wish I kind of feel
like a villain or something actually I'm
almost proud of myself for doing this
because my nails are one of the things
I'm most insecure about so the fact that
I'm doing something that draws this much
attention to my nails is a little crazy
for me
how are you dealing with because I bite
my nails it's very hard I can't bite my
nails obviously but it's hard just to do
everything my biggest thing is like
wiping your ass try not to poop burn a
day like I can't there we go
so I'm now gonna attempt to open a can I
can't do it
hey would you mind opening this can for
me I was gonna be a prank
know that maybe like snakes would come
out of here something I had a girl
cancel dinner plans on me she doesn't
know what she's missing out on
it's definitely prohibiting me from
picking the extent that I normally would
yesterday when I was doing now um I said
to the people producing the video I was
like oh my god it'd be so hard to put in
the tampon like thank God it on my
period and today my period came one week
early yeah yay I'm free alright hands
have been liberated one of the doors I
couldn't open because you have to like
put pressure you use your fingertips a
lot to like hold things to pull things I
did love the feel of it like I love
scratching my skin and like I loved
doing this on tables it's scratching I
really liked its scratching felt really
good and I was peeing it was definitely
more just like I was nervous about it
and I would like use way more toilet
paper than I had to so I wouldn't have
to like feel my nails I could just like
stab I can't believe how ten little tiny
things on your hands impacted my night
so much this is definitely a good way to
stop biting your nails I do sort of miss
them though I do think I want to go get
some nice fake nails that'll last me a
little longer whenever I see someone out
there in the future he's wearing
long fancy nails like that give them a
world nod but yeah my nails look so sad
but oh man is it good to be able to
touch things and I'm gonna send a
picture
