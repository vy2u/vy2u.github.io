have like a Southwestern theme to go
with it dusty rose or something I'm
gonna call it Prairie rose painted
Canyon oh I don't know if I would have
chosen that name and there's actually
the Painted Desert which is on the
Navajo Nation so try think of something
really red in the desert I think it's
just red painted sunset okay um okay the
painted sunset just it seems more orange
imus it's probably painted something I'm
assuming colors of the desert a name
that sounds kind of generic but between
the colors and the packaging and the
names the whole thing as a package is
evocative of southwestern native tribes
native cultures it seems to kind of feed
into that mythical magical medicine man
like persona looks like fiery sunset
it's almost like a dark pomegranate red
adobe brick is not that color at all I'm
from New Mexico and that's not what a
dhobi looks like a common building
material used amongst other uses by
native peoples throughout their history
going along with this whole nature theme
it's gonna be like desert rose desert
blush Wow I I'm kind of speechless oh
the color Arrowhead would be more like
grayish or slay obviously Arrowhead is a
Native American reckon the names
themselves for the most part aren't that
offensive but when you combine
everything the packaging the names the
marketing campaign and
the name of the line it's very clear
that this is all a reference to Native
American culture well any kind of time I
hear try that makes me think of Native
Americans just kind of one of those
things like didn't somebody make sure
that this is okay to do right now far as
the packaging them saying it's not
Native American just go to any kind of
Native American Art Museum or festival
or anything and you'll see these exact
designs repeated over and over again
because it fit is native</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
