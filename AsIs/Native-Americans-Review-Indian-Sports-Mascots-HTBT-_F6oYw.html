we do ridiculous caricature like that
people get a right away that's racist
but for some reason when they see this
one everyone's like well yeah that's our
team I was a band geek in high school so
I'm not really familiar I know of it I
watched a fair amount of ESPN
SportsCenter in my day I don't think is
very historically accurate don't
understand why we need to be a mascot
Native American people don't look like
this I don't understand what the hair is
it looks nice yeah he looks really kind
um that looks like a child did it they
don't do this with anyone else
but animals and Native Americans it
bothers me that like one of the symbols
that people recognize about our people
is a weapon this is this weird outdated
view of what it means to be Native we
only brought those out in defense of
ourselves our land our people do you see
the Atlantic games and they're doing
they
perpetuates one very specific and very
outdated image all the Redskins this is
a dictionary defined racial slur
literally painted in red you may have
eagle feathers on here and those are
very sacred to a lot of tribes I can't
imagine any other race where that would
be considered acceptable having a team
named after a racial slur will say yeah
but we have such a strong history with
the Washington Redskins we can have a
history to get him free dates that it
makes me gonna cry
I don't even know where to begin he
looks like mr. burns got open and he's
completely red are you kidding me that's
the color of a fire truck he looks like
the Indian guy who's about to sneak into
camp and steal your horses this is
another one that really do personalizes
our people in fact they a people group
is your mascot like that's just not okay
it's just weird because then everybody
shows up acting like a stereotypical
version of that race they're really not
trying to be mean in any way it's still
contributing the fact that people are
supporting this team looking like this
when I look at those pictures
it just it breaks my heart we don't need
to have like human beings represented at
mascot they're like ah you don't know
what you're talking about a lot of them
say they're just honoring us I don't
feel honored I don't think it's honoring
us in the least it's very hurtful it's
not always just about you and how you
feel it's about it's about the people
who are involved it's about the people
whose feelings are being affected by
