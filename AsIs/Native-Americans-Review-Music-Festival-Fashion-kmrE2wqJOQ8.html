my goodness my great-grandma was a
Cherokee princess by the way we didn't
have princesses
I'm actually like a big music festival
fan I have never been to Coachella or
anything like it oh right well then he
isn't his in his headdress oh my god
I was fully prepared to marry this man
it's just kind of like so unnecessary I
don't know why he has to wear that this
is not what it's for
I will teach you everything you need to
know Tara baby you just give me a call
mmm what the heck of this this looks
like a little girl playing dress-up she
went all out her is this really trying
here it's like five different cultures
going on we got these little doodad
things that look like belly dancing then
we have beadwork which looks like Native
American and we got the carnival
feathers powers are not the Renaissance
Fair you don't just go and just show up
and dressed up like that she has no idea
what she's representing how many people
are gonna get whoa like that's awesome I
want that style without kind of really
knowing what it's about oh no I would
what is what is why this is like dollar
store regalia if you're gonna
appropriate my imagery like do a better
job yeah please do it well like the
worst Halloween costume in the Halloween
store if you go to a powwow and someone
is wearing a headdress that means
something every single feather on there
has been blessed every single bead has
been meticulously placed there are
symbols on there that have deep
spiritual meaning like the drunk moms
out of five-year-olds birthday party
that's what they are it was a joke to
her and for us to have bought for
hundreds of years to maintain that
identity and then just to make us a joke
like this it's hurtful oh my god that's
just inappropriate I'm very certain this
guy's loincloth Donita me that long
looks like he lost in bed it looks like
a faulty apron yeah his commerce does
not match his loin wash you can afford
to get a better guy stippling the
pictures that I've seen are why I don't
go to these music festivals we've become
sort of mythologized and we're actually
people you're not dressed
up like a sixteenth century Prince you
know this is this is still very real to
us you just makes it feel exotic sighs
not realizing how an image like a
headdress can continue to keep an entire
race of people down if you have
interests in our culture feel free to
ask I will be more than happy to share
try to get to know the culture before
just using what you think looks pretty
but the way that it makes us feel when
we see our spirituality being mocked it
doesn't feel good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
