never really been a big fan of Halloween
I love Halloween who doesn't love
getting dressed up I sort of always
dread this time of year because of
racist costumes I'm so nervous I'm so
nervous oh my god what rival temptation
oh sweet Jesus well right off the bat
the first thing I notice is the axe cuz
we're savages chief hottie body I don't
even want to say that like that feels
wrong yeah
Indian brave and I love the fact that
the Indian brave is portrayed by
somebody who looks incredibly like like
Arnold Schwarzenegger this is ridiculous
I just it's like a little black dress I
feel like I need a really big shower
after wearing this crap okay I can't I
can't I don't I can't say anything I
feel frustrated that this costume exists
what is this even made of I think it's
supposed to look like suede or like
animal skin accuracy on a scale of 1 to
10 is like negative 4,000 don't believe
there are any events I have the feather
in the front like this when you see
beads on an actual powwow dress every
single pattern means something a costume
like this keeps Native Americans in the
past as if we're not real people today
there's a medicine a jingle dress and
everything on that dress means something
they put a prayer into every cone before
they attach it to the dress they're
actually feels like there's something
pretty disrespectful about wearing a
people group as a costume you're not
dressing up as a Viking or an ancient
Roman but those people aren't around
anymore LAN this is still very real to
us because it's so inaccurate it almost
feels like a joke like someone's making
fun of me and all the things that my
people fought and died to hold on to I
actually belong to the Sioux Nation and
you don't get to tell me that this isn't
offensive I don't think anybody is
making these costumes to be deliberately
racist I actually think I have more of
an authority to tell you when it's
offensive and that sort of thing because
I've lived with this my entire life
so if somebody of the people group is
telling you that it's wrong that should
be enough for you dad I'm sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
