braids out man I don't know maybe I'll
just wear it in a puff for a little
while I'll but then I have to go
vacation next week I don't know think
I'm like twist but braids and stuff a
bit hard on the edges oh maybe I'll just
twisted tonight but yeah I don't know me
and the stuff is stressing me out Quinta
hold on girl somebody just call me
Quinta what's that who's there it's me
permit yeah that's right what the hell
yes I can talk
what's the matter you've never seen a
box talk No
Oh what do you want well I overheard you
talking about not knowing what to do
with your natural hair and I thought I'd
offer a solution me please you cannot be
serious please no seriously you know how
much easier I'd make everything there'd
be no more suffering
no more heartache what do you mean well
when you go to sleep at night there'd be
no twisting your hair so you can have a
good night's rest I'd get enough sleep
thank you very much and it's okay I make
time to twist my hair no more broken
combs
so much wasted money no only two dollars
it's not that bad no more shrinkage what
that's right your hair will stay the
same length from when you wash it to
when you dry it Quinta shut up I'm
thinking sorry it's okay no no you know
what you're wrong about this perm box I
have a name
Oh what is it Shanice oh that's a pretty
name that's my cousin's name listen you
talk a good game but I used to get you
when I was younger and you made my hair
fall out you sick bitch you need to know
the truth Shanice you need to know it
okay I mean that wasn't me and I made
you feel better before all of that you
have to admit wasn't it nice to have
straight hair that was just super sleek
and easy to manage and pretty you know I
won't lie it was nice being with you but
ignorance is bliss and I don't know how
bad you were from my hair back then
I didn't know my hair without you heck I
didn't even know myself and guess what
she needs I'm not going back I know me
without you and it feels good
and I'm determined to work with what the
Lord gave me and to make it work so that
the world sees it as acceptable besides
I like twisting my hair it's kind of fun
sometimes I watch the office while I do
it's pretty nice I love the office me
too oh okay maybe you're right I I don't
know I've always been a perm and people
are starting to buy me less you know
it's been it's been pretty hard you know
the times they change and we have to
acknowledge it move on evolve Shanice I
know there are thousands of shea butter
shampoo bottles that would love to have
your face on them your minute of course
in the meantime someone will buy you
SHINee's people so we're perms you were
so look girl okay it just won't be me
