chokers for the first time in our adult
lives I haven't seen a choker in a
really long time are they back in style
I feel like they look good on everyone
else except for me just Kylie wear a
choker you have to be really stylish or
just have like tons of cool points to
pull them off I just don't wear a lot of
jewelry I also dress a lot like a
toddler so I feel like chokers are maybe
a little too sexual I wore one once as a
kid and I didn't understand the concept
of a choker so when I had that choking
feeling I took it off immediately and
like I never pushed my mom to buy wine
who do I want something like strap
around my throat do I want to like oh
yeah if you want that feeling of like
being being strangled
I feel like chokers well like reach my
inner sexiness I feel like people look
you with it though so maybe it's not so
bad oh we're making the chokers today
I'm really horrible at crafts really bad
with my hands it's just a necklace I
mean it's not like we're building a
house let's let's go for it with you
this we are grown-ass women we got this
high five I'm going to make a kind of a
velvet choker with a little key charm
right where your finger is yeah I'm so
scared okay it's fun I feel like what I
need to account for is when you're like
swallowing water right now doing it so
tight have a nice neck it's a normal
neck
oh women wore chokers to remember people
who are killed with a guillotine okay
hardcore I think it's a lot more stylish
than like pins and stuff you know what
always helps in times like this tiny
hands Lou it looks a little crooked
respect see this is very therapeutic
aren't some crass well man a was
probably French right so mayonnaise
painting ladies and he's like chokers
these are very French I feel like they
always wear them in like new memories
people have their different opinions
about prostitution but like in Europe
it's legal chokers start with
guillotines then maeín a paint a lady
one prostitute then like royal people
something relatable started wearing them
which is insane
which always got a steal this is that
always the way
starts to something for like a
lower-class and then they're like and
the we did this now they're making a
comeback now though it's like a big
thing yeah all the teens where do you
like your choker I love my choker it's
so cute I guess we'll see how we like it
the rest of the day got a whole day
ahead of us it's cute you look so 90 I
do like it you look very like African
goddess woman or you wearing that
earlier no like a Victorian badass thank
you little bo-peep
and Rihanna it's great it looks very uh
the craft oh I'm into that yeah I'm a
little wait Utah Armen Frost oh thank
you yeah that's awesome I think you look
sexy
still not super used to it yet I had to
take my choker off because it was
restricting my breathing
the original choker that I had on was
choking me and so I decided to put the
second one on that I made and this one
feels a lot better there's a lot more
space so I've come to the conclusion
that I might have made it a little too
tight as I was trying to eat Cheetos
it's kind of a cool accessory it's just
really easy it's really simple little
lopsided but otherwise I I think it's
cool for back after a long day of
wearing these chokers it went a lot
better than I expected I thought people
would be staring at it like why are you
trying to pull this off
I hate this it makes me feel like I'm
going to die it was like a pimple on
your face and like how you're the only
one who really notices it but nobody
else really does that's what it felt
like I just really I'm excited to take
it off I actually took it off earlier
cuz I I'm bad when I first had it I felt
really self-conscious like I can't do
this I can't pull this off and I was
super negative and it wasn't until I got
feedback from other people it was like
actually it looks really good it's
really nice you look like this and
that's when I started getting a really
big boost like you can rock this maybe I
am secretly like a sexy badass on the
inside and I just never knew it you know
I don't normally wear jewelry but it was
really cool actually trying this cuz now
I think I like wearing chokers I don't
know what making them but definitely I'm
down to purchase a few chokers oh it
feels so good
