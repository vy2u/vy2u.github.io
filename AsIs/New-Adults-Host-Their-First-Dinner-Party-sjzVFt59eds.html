on Pinterest right now Oh - right going
with the California is themed yeah the
theme is is fresh we spent two hours at
Trader Joe's for still hours I Trader
Joe's we have to throw it in ur party
for a video okay so after buying like
the most random assortment of things at
Target like you know anyone tell me like
which one is a serving tray I'm on my
way to Kane's house and we're gonna do
this thing all right we're starting to
cook down we have all our stuff ready we
move the table down I think we start off
slow we did take a 20-minute nap earlier
because we were tired
I honestly think things have been going
pretty smoothly like I feel like we
divvied up everything pretty equally and
like we've gotten along really well
oh my god we can use this tried a new
recipe that I'm not used to
are you supposed to be cleaning is this
okay yeah why not oh maybe not wait what
everyone's gonna get drunk just kidding
everything right now
do you know weights behind you behind
that door right there yeah a dinner
party thrown by interns them just trying
is probably enough but we'll see I don't
know maybe it'll be a disaster yeah I'm
curious what we're gonna talk about you
know what like what do the interns have
to say hey guys you are dinner party
feel free to grab a seat we made some
Moscow meals for you okay oh the
fire still on so what are these things
here these are mini quiches yes and they
are made of spinach and artichoke and
Parmesan and monsura mozzarella is there
a gossamer gear that's the name yeah
that means you're gonna crush their like
they are crustless they're hustlers so
this is salad I'm trying to get the rest
of the food together so that you know
when it's time for dinner could happen
seamlessly and they don't have to wait
you know
Henry's a tough one how do you get going
I think it's going well I mean it's got
to get the combo flowing a little bit
once they finish those Moscow meals I
think everyone will be hey okay this is
our big finish we have the salmon and
the rice and then the vegetable is
amazing you guys are being too polite
but thank you
you think of this Hammond guys really
great like nice and subtle this is a lot
of food won't work I am so proud of
these I've never used a little like
pastry frosting thing before like my
friend happy idea over one time so I do
this a sorry I was like yes yeah I find
out be honest with you
Sofia made this with love and then we
have a fun game after this oh yeah yeah
yeah you can't use me oh wait the hog ah
okay okay
I mean you're killing it you're filling
drinks right yeah we're definitely
feeling a drink they were like four more
courses than I thought like I thought it
was just Keisha I've been like a
freaking awesome good job kids good job
guys but no it just kept going and
that's what was great about the vibes
are good the food was good and it was
just all about having a good time and
being together I can't believe this is
your first time doing this thank you so
much so what was the most stressful part
for you guys I think there was a moment
when it was like close to the time when
people were coming and we were just all
in the kitchen like and my eggs burned
the eggs and the onions burning was
Kane's like low
like pour it all out like redo the rice
it was a pleasant evening I feel like
