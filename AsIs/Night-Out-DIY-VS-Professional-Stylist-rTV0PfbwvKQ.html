thing ah
is it better to do everything on your
own or hire squad one of us will get a
stylist and professional hair and makeup
and one of us will thrift shop and do
our own hair and makeup did you dig
we're gonna find out which option is
more worth it
Hey with them I'm excited yeah I am
nervous why are you nervous
ah well there's a 50/50 chance one of
our days is not gonna be real fun I'm
excited for both options yeah I like I'm
not someone who is very good at their
own makeup so all the assistance I can
get I generally feel like I can use I
have insecurities that like I need to
like deal with on my own
and I don't need a stylist bring them to
light tell me that you would rather do
stuff yourself I would I think because I
need to be in control are you guys all
ready to find out who's getting what yes
let's do it okay so um Nina you're
getting professional Oh
did you just decide that because I said
I didn't watch wait good luck to you I
don't think you Leah I think you'll turn
out very lovely and I yeah good luck to
you but you will be fine because you
want to do it yeah all right I'll do it
yes yep let's do it boom
my name is Nadya Beeman I'm a fashion
stylist based in Los Angeles and today
I'll be styling Nina for her night out
hi I'm Nina Nina and Nadia it's so nice
to meet you you too I've put a few
selections for your night out okay I
feel like I'm seeing a lot of very nice
pieces here they're all also things that
like I couldn't like never Wicker how
would you describe your personal style
my personal style is like pretty subdued
I wear 90% black crop tubs are probably
like the trendiest thing that I do well
I think I have some things that'll
really push you today you're gonna push
me yeah yeah do you trust me I trust you
possum I trust you because you look cool
so our first stop is to find me an
outfit we're here at Iguana clothing a
vintage clothing store
I have vintage shop before it's a little
tough when you're a bigger size there's
a lot of these places don't sort by size
sometimes they don't even have tags so
I'm just going to go into that jungle
there and see if I can't pull out me a
dress
you
the tough part about vintage shopping
when you're plus-size that plus size
clothes only got good in the last five
years or so before that it was a lot of
stuff like this they're like okay we'll
just give you like a swatch of thing sew
it together and then give you pockets
and you'll buy it right and we had to
because we didn't have other options but
now we do so stuff like this is
relegated to the sale rack at the
vintage store
so we just left iguana I got myself a
dress it was $65 it was kind of a dive
into the rough I don't think I would
have found this if I'd gone to this the
normal store while we had to invest
about an hour to find this dress it was
worth it
it just got my outfit picked out by
Nadia and now I'm about to go get a
blowout they don't wash it because if
that's why they call it like dry bar
right so do they wash it I've never
gotten a blowout before so I'm excited
to see what it's all about
hi I'm Leanne I am currently a blower
slash manager at blow Hollywood in the
heart of Hollywood Lea nice to meet you
I want to suggest our Hollywood glam I
don't know wow that's really pretty
come on over I'm going for a classic
blowout Nina's actually blow right now
getting her hair done blowing up for her
so I'm gonna see if I could maybe make
the same thing happen for my hair but
with no help at all
I don't know if I achieve like the
blowout look I don't it doesn't feel
like bouncy to me it just feels very
straight but like it could be worse
so we're sinking straight here pretty
shiny oh my god like my hair is so
beautiful I have a very small head and I
really like the volume to my hair which
they don't normally have you know what I
didn't have to do anything I did nothing
i sat in a chair and then I sat in a
different chair it was great
so it's makeup time and I'm going to
attempt a full face with golden glittery
eyeshadow and a red lip I'm not very
experienced with makeup I've gotten
better my knowledge I'm still at the
very bottom of that mountain I think I
know what half the stuff does I don't
know what any of these eyeshadows do
next we are off to Flushing tune where
I'm gonna get my makeup done I like
doing makeup but I know that I'm not the
best at it and I know that I'm not
perfect at it if I'm getting all this
stuff done that I want something that I
could never possibly do myself hi I'm
jasmine I'm Leigh trainer of California
blushing ttan and tonight I'm gonna be
giving Nina look for a night out
hi I know I'm in the Blessington and job
you go out and have a seat okay so we're
gonna be giving you a look for a night
out tonight yes what did you have in
mind
I don't I don't live a night out a smoky
eye would be really pretty obvious yeah
I'm like really bronzy I think it's
gonna really bring out the colors in
your eyes and it's just look really
pretty and gonna go with anything yes
that sounds great cuz I can like barely
do a smoky eye myself so it's great to
get it done it's advanced technique so
don't worry about it that's what we're
here for so I'm gonna start with my
brows actually I'm gonna get my hair out
of my face so I don't ruin it
hello clippy's
good enough so I'm going to start with a
little bit of moisturizer fur cool I'm
just picturing Kristin right now like in
a dark room in front of her laptop now
we're gonna do concealer on my ass I
think I'm doing this right oh yeah oh
wow I can't see very well but this
already seems to be making a difference
Here I am just sitting lazily having
jasmine treat me like a queen this is
like how it should be everyday eyeliner
is very hard without your glasses the
stakes are very high
if you mess oh shoot keep your eyes
closed I'm just gonna keep my eyes
closed it's like a nightmare
all right makeup is done this probably
took me about an hour it's a solid hour
of doing it and then redoing it and then
mistakes this was an investment this was
a whole episode of Law &amp;amp; Order all right
Nina you're all set with your look how
do you feel I feel amazing I feel like a
glamorous witch because I've got like
this crazy smoky eye that's also like
you know kind of shimmery and I've got
this lipstick shade in blood rose which
I feel like is very sultry and evil I'm
honestly just like so excited to go out
into the world how I look I could spend
eight hours do my makeup and it would
never look anything even remotely close
to this
one two three Oh like that how do we
both know to get first I think we look
and he's a good equally good look
definitely we learned a lot it was
obviously not the easiest thing in the
world there's a little bit of suffering
but then we got a nice fun look at the
end this is the celebs like you know I'm
gonna have other people do for you
yeah sounds great they gave me water in
a champagne glass
that's how fans we've got eight Pizza
standing up a night out do it yourself
versus doing it professionally is it
worth it I think that parts of it are
worth it yeah parts of it depending on
how much money then what you're good at
most of us don't have the money to like
you know basically put someone else in
charge of our bodies but I'll be setting
up a GoFundMe helped me with getting
that money for my future self
