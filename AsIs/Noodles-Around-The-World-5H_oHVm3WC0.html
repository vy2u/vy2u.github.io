tie town to get breakfast noodle
breakfast we're getting noodles for
breakfast right now put the camera down
so we can go do that okay check this out
you can choose your noodle 1 2 3 4 5
different styles there's an egg a glass
wide flat noodle a small flat pad thai
style and a vermicelli style rice noodle
oh my god it smells so crabby there's a
shredded crab in there that's sugar
crunchy peanuts I see scallions and
cilantro
there's a wedge of lime which I'm going
to squeeze right now in photograph
let me see each J dude okay I'm going to
do all of them into one face
if you have never put sugar in your
pasta today is the day to start it's
sweet and salty really good okay so now
we're in Los Feliz and we're eating
Italian food say cheese
that's so pretty I'm gonna take a photo
I didn't think I like pepper this much
here we are in Greece or Pico Boulevard
we are at this giant Emporium full of
great food pop Christos who's a
restaurant sections I got my pasta to go
here it is a cozy crusty bread it's uh
let's eat it in the car they just give
me regular pasta it's not the great
class day I read it the wrong thing
sorry this is Greek pasta it's plain
okay let's see if it tastes any
different than other pasta I don't think
it does because they ordered the wrong
pasta guys sorry noodle fail the noodles
themselves are a little bit crispy which
makes me wonder what did they do did
they like pan fry it a little bit I'm
about to eat some I had eaten vivid
I think I said that right
I'm gonna get me some pepper on there a
little bit of onion on there slightly
sour like there's vinegar in it or
something but it's really fresh and
homemade
the noodles kind of remind me of like a
Chinese noodle like a palm yen
don't try this at home
good step up this is actually the very
first place I ever had fun ever so kind
of touching
a little emotional for me here we are
the best of the restaurant is steaming
up my lens okay here we go
first I'm going to dive in and get the
noodles for you to see I just get myself
blender
hmm this is big bullet cozy okay
we've reached the end of the line down
the street in Koreatown to a Korean
noodle place okay let's get out of the
way tomato and just to get out of the
way
acorn noodles
lay it all some of this
cold south on top
so when you think noodles you're not
excitedly thinking hold and a white
milky broth but this works works for me
I've never had a dish like this before
it's very unique right now they're all
sitting at my stomach I don't know what
I like better but I have to really pick
it probably was the first one for
Thailand yeah but I don't know we have a
lot of other countries to explore
noodles around the world - great four
five there's so many countries if it's
something you know it alls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
