say happy how do people really wear this
for Halloween I'm a registered nurse I'm
an oncology nurse and I work in the
emergency room and I work on the how
much a unit and sometimes afloat to ICU
we are gonna be trying on nursing
Halloween costumes it's gonna be fun
it's gonna be exciting
I actually I don't know oh it's gonna be
what I wear everyday is usually very
comfortable not sexy at all I'm wanting
to see the difference so this outfit
where do I even begin I don't know my
scrubs don't look like this there's
nowhere to put stuff I mean this is
flimsy it's see-through our male
co-workers I don't think they would
really want to wear this every day just
remind me of pajamas I'm diggin it it's
way more comfortable than what I'm used
to I would wear these if I could we do
wear all sorts of colors depending on
the hospital and there are a lot of
nurses that like pink let's just do
something generic like a blue or
something if I were to ever wear this in
the hospital and if I got any bodily
fluids on me it'll go straight through
this is an old thermometer I'm not going
to use you know how long it'll take to
take some temperature in the ER is very
comfortable and it's comparable to what
we normally wear adds definitely you
know kind of accurate oh this is a scrub
nurse for surgery so nurses stop wearing
dresses I don't know how many like
decades ago it just reads hospital but
diner I'm confused I guess you know if
you're back in the 1950s and I can never
be very appropriate well actually there
are some nurses I have seen a couple
that still do wear these outfits I'm
just kind of like doing a double-take
like where did you come from
I like it I like skirt you get a little
peekaboo chute right there that is not
professional we're not at work to be
cute especially in the emergency room
who makes these uniforms I want to talk
to
I just feel like that as silly in it
this is a joke it's not even a costume
oh my gosh
I'd even know I don't even know what to
say about this I like that it's
form-fitting a little bit more kind of
like fantasy I think I don't have hearts
on my uniform
this nurse would cause a heart attack I
already get a lot of perverted patients
this uh-uh-oh really like it that much
oh my gut if I showed up to work like
this they'll die on the floor laughing I
think it's both silly and fun it's
complete trash to me I mean there's
nothing really to say except them I
wouldn't wear them being a nurse and
putting on all these nursing costumes
insulted me actually as a nurse I didn't
think they were that bad I think I've
seen worse I mean every profession I
guess you could it up you know I'd
be Pro sexy male nurse costume I'm glad
that our profession is on a costume rack
that's kind of cool I would feel honored
they don't want to be a nurse no matter
what favor
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah you don't know the half of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
