really say that it's hoes ever
accomplished but I I have been having
say I've been lying to you guys yep
ooh baby baby baby baby baby baby I see
something up with I didn't think it was
worth talking about because it's not a
new person it's just somebody that I'm
casually having sex with who also
happens to be my neighbor and that's why
it's easy and convenient listen I just
want you to live your best life okay I
inviting my best life it's by listen
listen I'm here for you whatever you
want to do then here for you the same
way I'm not judging you about drinking
again this is different don't judge me I
know what a good friend listen Kate if
you had good dick a block away you'd be
doing by the way dad I know you're
listening to these podcasts please no
tonight off Kelsey's dad said I'm trying
my dad told me over the holiday break
that he tries to listen to me but he
just doesn't think we're the
demographics for the fuck's fuck's sake
dad turn it off and turn back on CNN
whatever Kate why aren't you coming huh
why didn't you master me by the
time you have time a really good weekend
experiencing a lot of art yep yeah I did
so he did fricking karaoke and then we
had a friendsgiving which was so much
fun and then on Friday I went to this
show put on by Queens of the New Age and
it was honest to god Quinta hosted it
quince is another BuzzFeed I'm sure you
guys all know who she is she describes
the show as medicine that you needed
even though you didn't know you were
sick mmm and then you saw another show
last night you were just
Bart this guy saw my friends show at The
Groundlings it was really good how was
that ha ha ha Freddie we're gonna ask
that I already know I can't wait
for you guys to know I'm just gonna give
the highlights and buy highlights I mean
the low like last week they talked about
how my family is just a little off
kilter hey last week oh did I I think
you do my brain is going and about my
brain is going to Missouri I'm not from
Missouri but a lot of my family lives
there we've got a mixture of different
types of people we got a lot of like
hardcore liberal New Yorkers mixed with
middle American Republicans it was a lot
of emotional energy spent but hey that's
how you know most of the America has to
live every single day so I was glad to
do the work that I need to do I was
there ok I got in the car my hair is
shorter my uncle asked first thing
are you more lesbian now because I have
shorter hair
how do you know it's not even like a hi
how are you but does that visa are you
more lesbian like are you like the
shorter haircut makes me gay also he
didn't say are you more of a lesbian now
yeah are you more fluent now like it was
are you more lesbian oh that was on the
the car ride from the airport but my
favorite story is Kona
then we decided by the way I got a
mention i iy the time this comes out I
will have been sober for 30 days I
stayed sober throughout all of this then
my cousin's proceeded to play cocaine
and catchphrase which is where you play
the game catchphrase and also do cocaine
just imagine those two things together
I've never heard someone scream then
mind you I was watching all of this I
wasn't partaking in any of the
festivities so much fun for me oh then
we went to spread my cousin's ashes and
my aunt proceeded to dump the ashes
right as my grandfather's dog jumped in
the air if you bite them and a little
white dog became grey covered in foot of
my dead cousin
so that was I stayed so be though stayed
sober my god anyway that's how my
Thanksgiving went speaking of how
embarrassing my Thanksgiving wise we
should get into today's theme
I'm the episode baby adult with a 1
the podcast oh my god so you don't have
to today's theme is
today's theme is a two-part theme we
just because here's what happens when
you're talking about themes tell me we
thought it was guilty pleasures and I
thought it was just embarrassing stories
so we're gonna combine both to tell you
some guilty pleasures and embarrassing
stories the reason why we're doing this
because last week's episode we got so
much god damn feedback breathing like
response was people being like it made
me feel like I'm not alone which is
really important that's what we that's
what we want we want to know yes I heard
my mom subscribe a meme is I just like
them because they make me feel less
alone which is it's just that idea of
being able to relate to other people so
we figured 8 you're not alone you're
never we all have everyone has
yeah and everyone feels honestly God
everyone feels the same way so open up
if you can yeah people are there people
want to connect yeah but then going off
of that we figured we could share some
embarrassing story slash guilty
pleasures that might make you guys also
feel like you're not alone not alone
things get weird and listen my my life
is an embarrassment okay you gotta learn
that no it's never gonna learn how to
laugh in the rain or some white girl
saying like that I like the like the
snow isn't I love that Amy Schumer joke
where she says as problematic as she is
I love her bits where she says she's
like dance like no one's watching
well dance like a few people
I love Amy see ya yeah I she well I
don't think she I don't think she's as
problematic as people think I think she
has good intentions I think she got
caught up in the Lena Dunham she could
say anything in that interview she
didn't say Lena Dunham said all the
yeah and that interview that's and
everybody got dragged for it yeah yeah I
think it kept her in there and why
would you even keep all of your stuff in
there when it's a minute I mean she's
got to just step away for a minute and
I'm I'm sick of having to make
statements every time she does something
you know like at this point I've hoped
that I've like removed my opinions
enough far away from her that yeah as a
white female I feel like every time she
does something I have to remind people
like she doesn't speak for all white
women but she does speak for a giant
 majority of white women who
don't know what the they're doing
yeah I have a theory that I think it's
important for people to up so that
we can learn because I think she speaks
to a greater population than we want to
admit and I think that a weird trend
that happened was a bunch of other like
non famous white women were like that's
not me
not all white women it's like chill for
a second yeah though yeah you have
 up like that I up like
that you up like that she said it
in the public eye I'm not defending her
at all specifically with the last
thing she said Christ just be aware I
think that it's really important to talk
about times when you do up and be
like I think it's also important to to
listen to other people when they're
 up and be like where is this
coming from so it's kind of like instead
of feeling like there's a leak there's a
leak in the house this whole houses
shits like no finding the pipe
do you have yourself good at
metaphors man thank you you had a great
metaphor last week when me and a friend
got into a little tiff and it was like
it was more emotional yeah and then like
we weren't mad at each other yeah motion
alee Tift and Kate had this incredible
metaphor because I felt like I kept
trying to defend myself and the other
person was defending herself yeah I did
intentionally hurt someone yeah and Kate
great that's great metaphor that was
like it's like when you swing your arms
out and you hit someone behind you you
obviously didn't mean to hit them but
you did and you have to acknowledge that
you hit someone even if it was
unintentional and that person is hurt
and yeah it doesn't matter how many
times you said it was an accident was an
accident or anything - it's like now I'm
still her I feel like it's also
we live in a
weird culture right now where people
just are like cut yeah cut out a toxic
person but I think some people are bad
people I think that some people are so
 up and they're and they're you
know beyond you know whatever but I
think majority of people are sellable
yeah no one's perfect
I know Twitter leads you to believe that
people are perfect and there's like the
right thing to say and everybody's woke
and that's just not true
specifically if you're white dude you
don't know more then you're white that's
it done you that's it you could be you
could be an ally the best you can but
the main thing is don't try to separate
yourself from the fact that you're white
because if you were to step back and
really look people and every other like
race gender ethnicity whatever they are
people are being judged all the time or
something they can't control so welcome
welcome to levelling out and it's like
we're just so we're so conditioned to
see the world as we've seen it which has
catered to white faces oh my people yeah
that like when someone goes oh wow it be
cool if someone of a different race was
in this movie and we're like well what
what what's wrong with the white person
doing it and it's like because you've
been conditioned to believe that that's
whatever normal is I just finished an
incredible book over Thanksgiving break
called the hate you give by Angie Thomas
it's being made into a movie and there's
a great section where a black family is
explaining to a white boy how like the
the white guy asked why are black
people's names so so complicated and
weird and they're like they're not you
just have plain ass boring names that
you've been hearing forever like Chris
is you know and a lot of black
names come from like a American
historical like meaningful names and and
that's like just I up Anor the way that
you can be like oh wow I've just been
led to believe that what is
quote-unquote normal her name's like
 Chris and Brian and Jane and you
know you have to open up your eyes to
that that's normal for you and what's
normal for the rest of the world like
most of the world is Spanish speaking
and we're so healthy to think that like
yeah it is you know yeah the dominant
language or whatever like
moral of the story is we could only
speak to the white experience yeah
obviously I'm never going to try to
speak for any other experience other
than you know what I've been through
just as other for other white women
listening okay Melissa listen just keep
listening listen to me listen to other
women know that you're not perfect
yeah and don't turn your like I mean
yeah we in a up this last time
but I think that everyone and this
is not being like Lina's okay this is
not me saying that it's just you have
 up too so learn from that that's
our big just were sort of leap fix your
 week speaking of being an
embarrassing white woman oh and if we
 up let us know please yeah we will
should we talk about embarrassing
stories yes okay
so when I was younger I thought that
like the cool I really what's happened
you're already laughing we haven't even
gotten into the story
it's just I'm oh I really thought I was
nailing it like I really really thought
I was doing a good job at presenting
myself to the world
I was however you were 14 when I guess
so I was 14 I would slick my hair back
in a ponytail and put about roughly 3000
of those little clips in the bottom so
that there would be smooth there were no
bumps I need it to be smooth
yeah we have 90s girls we'll remember
and I would wear shirts that I used to
have my grandma take me to the Salvation
Army to get these like I would loved
funny shirts so it's amazing that I'm
wearing this shirt and I would just she
hate my grandma used to say all the time
like hey please let me brush your hair
down there's a wouldn't let her mind you
it was amazing how my cheeks very subtly
just became my chest because no it was
just soft it's just a soft blend from
cheek okay there's not much of it it's
just a rotunda you were a goofy-looking
team I was just this rotund little great
word I was like a little meatball
anyway but in my head I was like I'm
 Jennifer Lopez look I really
thought I was like killing at night okay
anyway
so my one friend was super hot like my
one friend and she still is but she is a
friend you showed me yeah Carly's
 beautiful literally like the
hottest forgot my line I've ever seen
and that was her best friend growing up
yeah one of them yeah I know
really hard look at me I know oh my gosh
she would always like older guys loved
her so this one kid who was like a guy
who was a couple years older who had his
license she wasn't as break and we were
in eighth so he went to high school we
were still in middle school and I was
like yeah let me tighten up my velcro
 sandals I had the adidas sandals
that like massage your feet holy socks
Oh
colorful toe socks I like just show my
personality through my toe socks I had
on adidas pants with the stripes down
the side and a shirt that had dolphins
airbrushed on it with my hair pulled
back please for the love of God if any
of our listeners draw can you please
make some fanart of eighth grade cane
and tag us in it mind you what I
normally did in eighth grade was go to
my grandmother's house after school and
play Scrabble with her that's what I did
so this one day is when I went out I
know very different and we'd have
grilled cheese it was great but anyway
so we go again in his car we're driving
around and I am terrified
I remember watching grease and the part
where friend she goes the only tire
crooked depends on is the daddy and my
dad was like that's right
never garbage was through that the devil
will get you he didn't actually say it
like that but he really instilled the
fear of God when it came to guys so I
thought all guys were trying to either
 me or kill me oh wow what a lens
I'm in the car just shake it in my
little toe sock hanging out with this
guy in your face yeah and so for
whatever reason I'm like but I still
felt really hot like I really felt I was
JLo so I was like look you guys want to
go to the park
and my my first reaction I just spazzed
out just I know where there's guns guys
like you're gonna shoot him yelling you
better not try funny business buddy and
you didn't you were sober oh I spent a
lot of money and he was just like okay
and it was like Marigold wait what is it
about parks that's like where we all
hung out like middle school high there's
no cuz it's free what was your nickname
that you have in high school and this
wasn't middles it was it wasn't until
high school that I got this nickname so
like I said my friend was really hot and
guys would come up and try to like flirt
with her all the time and then I
acquired the name block they called
me CB for sure oh my god funnily enough
I never had a date to prom well I never
had anyone asking me to prom I actually
had someone turned me down when I asked
you wasn't even in my grade it wasn't
even like he was waiting for someone
else to ask him you just turned me down
how did you ask him he said do you want
to come to prom with me and I'm just
like oh my mom's not gonna let me know I
was like cool cool and then he was that
problem so oh no but I took my musical
theater friends which were way better
cuz they dance dude musical theater
friends in high school are the
 tits they're weird they
don't give a what anyone thinks oh
that was my that wasn't my people those
are my people too I was super super
balls-deep in high school I wasn't in
the I was in a couple plays in high
school and musicals but I was mainly I
did community theater so I wouldn't even
like in high school you kind of had to
pay your dues be like I'm Hannibal I was
like I'm not staying for hours every
night to do ensemble work and I did I
peeked in high school who had
friends galore I way I went to junior
prom when I was a sophomore ah very
differently most likely to succeed I
also sold weed with a bunch of seniors I
was a little white girl who would sell
weed to teachers Jesus Christ Florida is
a real place I
really I will stand by that's even when
I say I peaked in high school luckily I
did not thank god this is my nickname in
high school was the dead giveaway we
would get high all the time and everyone
else knew how to like hold their weed I
guess and I knew how to hold it my
physical structure just couldn't hold it
my eyes would glass over so bad and like
we'd go to Chili's or something and all
my friends would be acting chill and
then the waitress would be like what can
I get you and so my friends all called
me the dead giveaway it's hard to be in
a restaurant like that when you're high
though I don't smoke anymore I well I
don't smoke anymore I take CBD for my
pain mm-hmm but I don't smoke weed
because I have had too many embarrassing
moments I went from smoking every single
day in high school every single day
wake-and-bake
after school after musical theater
practice - something changed in my
chemical makeup in college where I
started to freak the out I
think it was just the fact that I like
had responsibilities now yeah and I took
a gravity bong hit on 4/20 my freshman
year of college and was high for three
days
decided I'm not gonna have smoke
anymore and then a few years went by and
I would try it hearing there again and
it never panned out well for my anxiety
yeah and even a couple laughs I would
say was last year a year ago some when I
BuzzFeed he was like oh I can get you
weed that is so chill it's just for pain
so he don't know he brings a joint
pre-roll for me and I'm like ah can't
wait tonight I'm just gonna have a
self-care and I I'm gonna get in the
bathtub I'm gonna smoke this weed gonna
have some chicken nuggets everything's
gonna be great well I sat on the toilet
and smoke the entire joint to myself
because I was a girl anything and I used
to smoke a lot back yeah she's not gonna
join it was nothing like is really still
 like definitely it's different
yeah and so I got all so that was Tampa
weed yeah it's like straight-up la cush
I got so high I almost drove myself to
the hospital I think I got behind
you know I could not drive I was puking
my brains out because I was I think my
days yeah I'd like my nerves just got
really high then I was my pants
like puking and at the same
time I called my sister in Florida it's
also uncomfortable to just sit on the
toilet yeah and pee in the trash can
we've all been there we've all done it
oh man Wyatt out of both I called my
sister and made her stay on the phone
with me until my boyfriend at the time
could get there and when he showed up to
my apartment I fell into his arms like
an infant and I made him cradle me to
sleep and then I woke up completely fine
the next day but that emotionally will
rock you and so I don't really touch
weed anymore
that's my embarrassing story I guess I
once smoked weed by myself I was like
I'll just sort of same thing I'm like
I'm just gonna smoke a little bit no no
we had sliding doors in the apartment
that we lived in like sliding doors for
like a little balcony area it I smoked
through that I was just sitting there
alright cool cool
and then someone upstairs is what
actually happens someone opened the
sliding door but it created went like
and in my head in my super stoned head
what made absolute sense and what I was
fully certain of was that oh my god
there's a witch what there is a witch
here there's a witch coming here right
now she's working upstairs and she's
coming down here oh my god and I hopped
up honest to god it's as if I had been
through this before it's like I know
what to do I know the drill and I just
went into the bathroom and just sat
there until someone came home doors
locked
here's the thing we should also mention
that we helps a lot of people Odyssey we
are not anti weed in any sense I think
no it's super it's like it's medicine
it's a plan it was a funny thing to say
but there are some times where if you
are not a weed person where you end up
in the bathroom either and
puking or waiting for a witch to come
take you and I was so calm about it I'm
just thinking the bathroom like this is
where I'll stay this is where I'll stay
say she can't get me in here no I was
soaked I was just like yeah I'll chill
in here I took a bath it was nice just
like the witch is out there I have so
many embarrassing stories about
weed I've embarrassing stories about not
 oh would you like to hear one
yes ma'am
okay so I was hooking up well I was
trying to hook up with this guy so I'm
hanging out with this guy and whatever
we had we went into his room to like we
were drinking a lot so we were gonna go
like hook up right he kept trying to
like have sex now I was like do you have
economies like no let's do it anyway I
was like absolutely not I was like I
think we're done here
and yeah okay I mean I hadn't had sex
yet oh yeah cuz I I liked him too it was
just like yeah have sex with this that's
fine whatever
and then he didn't have a condom and I
was like not today baby cuz I know it
would be me the one who didn't have sex
for so long the one time you do have sex
you're gonna get pregnant I was like not
today so baby
so I also I didn't really know what to
do with a dick kind of guided my hand
down to his dick it's not a Rubik's Cube
oh but it feels like what because I get
there and I just with my hands the way
you would go like play a piano that you
never touch I truly went boom maybe we
should've got like a piano yeah I didn't
and then of all the things I know how to
do with my hand I did that I chose that
oh my and then literally after I think
we're done you just like alright but I
was so embarrassed about that because I
was just like I don't know what to do
because also he was like really drunk so
his dick was all weird it was like kind
of heart it felt like it's called
slatted but it was it was like a little
hard but also nah it just felt like
there was something inside a lot of
other stuff that keeps filling it and no
matter what happens it's like you're
always gonna drop it yeah and I just was
like not now I'm just not in the mood to
learn yeah so I said let's just go to
bed so we go to bed and then I wake up
my eyes shoot open in the morning and I
was like oh my god I have made a mistake
I was so embarrassed so I get up very
sneaky like a cartoon tippy-toe Oh baby
I'm backing out of the room
oh I'm getting out of here alive and
then I open the door and it creaks a
little bit and then I back into what I
then found out was the closet he was
just like that's the closet and then he
like woke walked me to the front door
kissed me on the eye I hate that and
then I didn't hear from him for like
three years I hate that well wow that's
the long game a and B I hate that
when like you after you after you've
hooked up with someone especially the
next day when like you haven't brushed
your teeth maybe you had a dick in your
house or something and it's like you
don't know if you're supposed to kiss
cuz you're like well we're not it like
into each other you just wanted to hook
up oh I thought we were gonna get
married after that it was he's gonna
love me even though I was sneaking it oh
sweet sweet cake boy oh boy my
perspective is really influenced by all
of my demons issue two with what it got
as well through my dear
sweatshirt holy reliving these
memories I mean I go through that too
like where when when you're hooking up
with someone do you like kiss when you
say hello even though it's just sex
yeah I don't know I don't know I look
there's no wrong way to do things I
think movies have given us an idea of
what we think relationships are supposed
to look like and where's my movie on
polyamory huh where's my movie on
bisexuality huh where's my movie on open
relationships we should just make those
oh okay

should do well I think we should
introduce our new segment hmm

in November we're gonna do a wrap-up on
how ho member went so yeah Fred yeah
how'd we do buddy
yeah it was a real journey it was
knocking on the door of 30 is you know
it's really dirty you know really close
to 30 no you're not you're likely blocks
away
walk your block today we we also like
didn't go out a time like we and I think
us being well semi sober had a lot to do
that we spent a lot of time indoors did
you do any like bumbling or dating apps
well you know what what I'm really doing
stuff like heavy swiping for like a
couple weeks straight and they're like I
delete them all and like don't do
anything for a month
honestly like I and I actually got
inspired by you tell so just especially
being like trying to like be soap or
sober but like reading more this week oh
really I love to read
I read a lot too much someone
say I had way more fun and honestly also
learn more about myself reading
Gabrielle Union oh what's it called more
wine or something it's like a go after
our own hearts that's tell vember yes
right I was saying earlier that what a
good time we had at the Queens of the
New Age show yeah and I was thinking
like for personally my home ember which
wasn't I really like but I like I hate
going to bars I'm not gonna go to a bar
and and push my tits up and you know
compete with other people I want to be
around like-minded people and I feel
like we had such a fun time I feel like
that's the type of stuff I want to go to
and learning more about where I would
like to meet someone that I would like
to hold with yes bars are not the best
though because we were talking about
like yeah like if you go to like a Harry
Potter memorabilia find someone else
there that also like Harry Potter
memorabilia yeah that's a bigger turn-on
to me than just like some random this is
also like really nice I feel like there
is a big there's something that I would
always avoid which is like vulnerability
in any way I would try to avoid it and I
feel like there were so many people who
were saying things that I was like yes I
grieve and they're saying it like on
stage and they're like pouring their
hearts out on stage and I'm like so
there is a place for people I guess you
do with this podcast yeah I know I know
but it was nice to see it's you know
when you're not alone in finding places
where you could you could listen to
other people and not just bars just argh
like cold the tune and like really
unapproachable surprisingly its Arney
this sort of feels like I'm heart I'm
like competing with a bunch of other
just traditionally hot people and I just
want to go somewhere where it's not just
that you know what I mean if there's
like window shopping where there's just
like well let's meet people I love
I think that is such a good wrap up that
like we had this idea in our head of
what it was gonna be and we did like the
complete opposite but I think all of us
are happier yeah for it and because of
it and like our learning a lot about
ourselves me too like leaning into like
other parts of myself oh you know like
reading more like yes watching a movie
that may not have ever thought to watch
Emily
we were watching obvious child like this
past weekend and that was a cool like it
you feel so watch with like Jenny slay
and like just really like to never have
our time anymore be focused around love
and dating and sex I think we give so
much as women just in general to like
this idea of what our our value comes
from and really finding things that make
us truly happy like art or events or
hanging out with friends we all hung out
so much this money yeah and I met new
people too which was really nice to have
like really in depth right off the bat
conversations with other people who have
similar mindsets but we might not be in
the same circle or because I'm like I
might see them all the time but it's
really nice to check in with other
people just felt very very beautiful and
refreshing and I'm super inspired it's
true fred is adopting the most
unsensible Wow couple goals talk about
the royal family what's her name oh god
that is so awesome
the real looks like Freddie freaking
joking me but the I cannot wait Fred
people need to go follow you on
Instagram so they can start seeing cat
photos what's yes
underscore note Oh guys as well follow I
totally forgot about the KY that's the
perfect trap I have two more questions
just real quick Freddy
when do you get this cat I have a toy
for her and then also should we all eat
lunch together today oh I can eat let's
go there okay
we love you Fred Fred Mona Fred which is
going to happen a lot because we just
like talking to her she was here all the
time
yeah she's busier though she's super how
was your ho member I do have a date this
weekend coming up with a guy that I'm
like really excited to meet and I think
we have a lot in common
and look I'm protected in my heart in my
vagina the best I can
we could ask the biggest takeaway from
home ember was really like the sobriety
aspect of it and I think knowing that I
don't need to drink to have confidence
to be sexual to fun frankly what about
you coat Kate sorry I called Cape coat
sometimes and it's just gonna happen so
get used to it well you know I didn't
know at all I think though that I'm kind
of still I'm like in the same vein as
Freddie where I just feel like I learned
a lot about myself what I thought I was
gonna do I I didn't do it all but then I
did something what feels way better like
it just feels a lot better to be I I
just feel like inspired now and a little
hope a little more hopeful about the
caliber of people that are out there to
talk to and you know maybe form whether
it's like a romantic relationship or
just a relationship at all it was really
really nice and refreshing to see that
there are just so many people out there
going through the same thing
or having totally different experiences
that are just so fun to like hear about
and listen to and connect on yeah and we
want to hear your stories to how home
ever went for you guys yeah there's this
summer coming up what's a pun for Hoenn
in December Oh oh-ho-ho in December
that's that's it can deal with shelf it
workshop it will take ember guys should
we give our shoutouts for the week yeah
let's do it okay my shout out this week
is ad Georgie love ship at dancing girl
1995 and at t-money's thank you so much
for writing to me yes I don't have the
actual handle so I'm not going to shout
it out but I will say I think your
name's Mandy sings char and annamaria
thank you that we got so so many many
people reached out and I I want to say
all of you what it would the whole
podcast would be about that which is a
beautiful problem to have so thanks we
we read all of them I try to respond
also Ike I don't want that like
definitely reach out I love hearing
about you and whatnot if you're feeling
down or you're feeling hopeless there
are places to call there's hotline
there's free hotlines there's free
support groups there's online forums we
are not experts no we're actually pre
the opposite I mess up all the time so
just so you know like we're listening to
you we're with you but there are other
people around you yeah who can help yes
and if we could write to everyone we
would but honestly like the reason why I
haven't reached out back to a lot of
people is because the responses are so
thoughtful and emotional and if I just
send back like a heart emoji I don't
feel like it does it justice so I really
try to take my time like when with
someone writes something really
heartfelt I want to give all that energy
back to you and so if I haven't got back
to you I'm sorry but I love you and
thank you and we're just so we just love
