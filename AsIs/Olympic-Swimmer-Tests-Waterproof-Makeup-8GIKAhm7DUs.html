Olympic medalist for USA Swimming and
we're here at the Cal Berkeley swimming
pool where I am going to test some
waterproof makeup I have never worn
makeup at the Olympics there was this
girl when I was younger who'd wear
mascara and I would run down her picks
after every race and so that's kind of
been a fear of mine let's start with
some more I Pacific
I need my sunscreen when I get in the
pool and also it'll cover up the zit
that I picked this morning bad idea Pat
Von D tattoo liner in trooper because
I'm a trooper I feel like a little kid
using a crayon and I'm like coloring
outside the lines oh hell let's try the
Dior show iconic waterproof mascara this
is important that perfect brush you're
not putting on mascara right unless
you're making a funny face
reveal actually let's hold up really
well really really and like I even
rubbed this highlight quite a bit I'm
impressed
two thumbs up on both the Dior and the
Kat Von D the Dior like my lashes look
kind of chunky right now just cuz
they're wet so it's a little clumpy but
it's not dripping down my face like I
was worried about so take it off and try
the next one this is the Too Faced
better than sex waterproof mascara
looks like I just came out of the water
and this is the Sephora brand
long-lasting eyeliner in fantasy blue
suck at putting these on it's fun I like
it but some all over my eyelashes I
think let's use their error more than
anything so again the brush is important
ooh I think I like this brush better
this is definitely a fun one maybe like
festival season or poolside in Vegas
like I like it
all right let's check this out help it
pretty well
none of the blue seem to move again the
mascara gal clumsy from me being in the
water but the eyeliner didn't seem to
budge at all this is the Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipstick now this
would be good for me because my lips
turn blue because I'm always so cold in
the water based on my fingers it's all
over the place
hopefully it's not all over my face
alright let's check this out it did not
budge I've never worn lipstick while
swimming I think this one's aware all
right this is the Revlon Colorstay
ultimate like wha'd lipstick that's nice
because this is a drugstore brand so you
could get it pretty much anywhere I'm
not good at putting on makeup oh this is
pretty
hopefully I don't ha the butcher let's
pick all over my face so let's
it's favor really well it didn't budge
at all and there's like no feathering
around the edges so I'm a family I
traditionally have not looked for
waterproof makeup just because I don't
tend to wear makeup when I'm in the pool
but if I was gonna lounge by the pool
with my friends or at the beach and I
wanted to add a little something I will
now check out some waterproof stuff
two-faced
might have been my favorite one and this
stayed really well I'll just have to get
the professional to put it on for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
