today we're talking about Fanny fashion
in London for an American horse what is
this called
bum bag bum back at them back now we
keep getting funny looks when we say the
American word which is fanny pack what's
so weird about the phrase fanny pack
don't say that word Fanny means
something else together different topic
is an old English word meaning to fill
something and a fanny refers to a very
intimate area of a female what does it
mean here a latest important like a
crowd of the crowds of vaginas so if I'm
as an adult man say fanny pack why is it
anyone from England told us that you
switched the meaning of the word tranny
because I mean but in America just
letting us enjoy you guys you laugh at
Americans when you hear it
I love Americans when I don't hear it
when you come here and you say Perry
Perry just laugh at you I feel like all
of England knows this joke that we are
not in on uh correct there's a few
things you yet to find out about us
Brits
why don't you call it about that why
don't you thought of anything
oh no I'm with you right now I'm gonna
stop calling it funny back from now on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
