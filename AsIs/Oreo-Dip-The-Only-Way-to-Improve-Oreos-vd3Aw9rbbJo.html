to three boxes of Oreos and you want
Oreos with as much stuff as possible
seriously as much stuff as possible now
grab a butter knife and start cutting
out the stuff this is the step that
trips a lot of people up because they
think it's gonna take forever but we
were able to get through this entire box
of mega stuff Oreos in just over two
minutes next eat a spoonful of raw Oreo
cream just because how often you have
this opportunity then throw the whole
thing in the microwave for 30 seconds to
a minute stir in a microwave until you
have the desired consistency and then
get dipping there are no wrong answers
with Oreo dip you can throw whatever you
want in there but we found a nice ripe
strawberry works best but don't take my
word for it here are some of my
co-workers reactions to trying Oreo
dipped strawberries for the first time
brave this is incredible it's delicious
holy this is amazing tastes like
strawberry shortcake
I would eat a lot of this I'm double
dipping that is very sweet it feels like
childhood to do unrolling itself in my
mouth but it's fleeting it goes away so
fast me try again
I can a lot of this
it's rich on second thought I don't know
how much this high could heat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
