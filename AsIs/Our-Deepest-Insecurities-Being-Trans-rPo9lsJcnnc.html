is not being seen as a quote real man
well my voice get deep well I get facial
hair well I pass while all these things
that seemed important to me at the time
ever occur I was insecure about not
being feminine enough I had insecurities
about having masculine features my
biggest insecurity is as simple and as
deep as walking down the street I
transitioned while taking public
transportation in Chicago every day and
I got very attuned to kind of quietly
watching and listening into all the
other passengers to see who was gawking
who was laughing and who was disgusted
because disgust can often lead to
violence and so you have to like always
be aware of what everyone is thinking
about you
I think I'm constantly paranoid over my
safety I've been the victim of a bashing
before like someone walked up behind me
knocked me to the ground like sucker
country from behind and in my mind I was
thinking what did I do to provoke such
you know insanity or anger in this
person bathroom situations are really
complicated and make me feel really
insecure I don't use public bathrooms
ever and I haven't since I was like 16
sometimes I feel like I'm not trans
enough because I can pass as a masculine
woman I've made a choice to not continue
transitioning and to like exist some
place in the middle I'd say one of my
other biggest insecurities is my impact
on other people I'm so terrified that
I've hurt my family or I've hurt my
friends that I've ruined certain social
networks or certain events that all my
friends used to attend together and my
transition is what changed all of that
so dating brings up a lot of
insecurities for me and I think it's
about getting our partners to feel good
about their identity can we talk about
sex
I noticed that whenever I was dating
somebody I couldn't be as sexually free
with them as I would have liked I felt
like I could only give and I couldn't
receive I missed out on a lot of
beautiful moments that could have helped
me grow unfortunately I do think that my
insecurities around my trans identity
will live with me forever I think the
only way that I have learned to deal
with it is just to understand that I I
am a man and I accept myself as a man
and that other people's opinions of me
don't really matter when I first came
out my biggest coping mechanism for
dealing with insecurity was fake it till
you make it I would just walk out of the
door with such confidence and such
excitement that I put on an air of like
I knew exactly what I was doing queer
secretly inside I was terrified but as
long as I could put that front up it
seemed to help mitigate some of the
unwanted attention coming my way when I
walk down the street I still look over
my shoulder but it did not prevent me
from continuing walking down the street
now I've really grown to love myself I
love Who I am I love the fact that I
have masculine qualities about me that's
what makes me the trans person that I am
for transpeople are insecure about
coming out or about their trans identity
it's okay to be insecure it's okay to be
uncomfortable it's okay to question
yourself in this process befriend your
insecurities get to know your fears come
to live with them they become kind of
like roommates you might not love them
but they're there and you just kind of
have to come to terms with them this
time in between that trans people kind
of don't feel like they're either here
or there enjoy this is the time that
when we look deep into ourselves and we
work solidly to get right with ourselves
we end up coming out of all of this
better human beings and I'm quoting my
girlfriend she said most people can I
get out of bad relationships they cannot
change your jobs and here we are we're
changing everything about ourselves and
saying to the world look this is me
surround yourself with people that
validate you and that supports you the
most important thing to focus on is that
you're happy and healthy and that you're
happy with yourself and that you don't
pay attention to what other people think
about you because ultimately they're not
in your skin they're not in your body
and they're not living your life make
every day a day that is meaningful for
you that feels good to you time is
moving so quickly don't waste it on
negative energy in other people's
opinion find happiness within you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
