I want to get Patrick rings I finally
had surprised them when we took a trip
to San Francisco and that's where it all
started
we were like playing around making
videos he takes his bookbag off and puts
it down and he's like dancing on the
train cuz we were the only ones in there
oh my god this is no clue is I'm just
gonna happy what can go wrong to get on
the BART we're like halfway to the city
and then all of a sudden POW was like oh
my book bag is like I took Vito Kasich
in like no it's not okay like oh my god
we finally find out that it's at the
police station in the airport he thought
they had closed the airport because they
thought I had some kind of bomb and I
even told security because he said
what's in your book bag and I said oh
the only hand of my book bag is Oprah
Magazine and then a watch Mel's like
we'll get you a new Oprah Magazine it's
okay I didn't to tell anyone about the
Rings because I don't want to like this
is like the one thing I've worked so
hard to surprise him he was straight up
lying to them so that I wouldn't know I
had one of our close friends I text her
I said hey can you call Patrick I need
him distracted I talked with their
security so when I get on the phone with
her and she's like oh my god like did
you have any Britney album like I love
track why did you listen to track 3 and
I'm like panicking cuz when like they're
arresting Paulo well then I hang up on
her and then the door closes and I'm
like stuck outside by myself they
apologized to me so that they found the
book bag and that it was okay but it was
one of the scariest days of my life
because I did not want to lose of the
Rings like how could I do that
on March 13 of 2011 when we went to the
restaurant when we walk in they're like
oh we have your table ready we had a
beautiful view we have our dinner we
have like wine it's so beautiful and
lovely I'm not really listening to him I
just kept nodding my head because I kept
thinking about the Rings and if this is
all gonna work out and then they come
out with dessert the waitress comes and
brings the box of rings on each dish one
for me and one for Patrick I knew that
this is a moment that I've been waiting
for we unwrapped the box and then I just
said that I want him when we hand in the
state of California I want him to be my
husband I feel like I kind of maybe
didn't give the reaction he wanted I
thought he'd be like oh my beautiful
just kept saying what are you doing what
are you doing what are you doing it was
just like oh my god what's happening
right now at my parents got divorced
when I was in college so I was kind of
like marriage is stupid whatever after I
declare my love for him and why he means
the world to me our conversation kind of
shifted and I just kind of told him
exactly like how I what I was feeling
like the anxiety about the idea of
marriage once we started talking about
it that kind of like he just came back
to like us and the relationship and what
it means it's not about being perfect
it's just about you know being hopeful
and giving it a shot and you know seeing
what happens
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
