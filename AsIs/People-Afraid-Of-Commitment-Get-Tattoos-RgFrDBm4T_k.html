is a temporary tattoo that's supposed to
look more realistic but without all the
commitment I've been thinking about
getting a tattoo for probably six or
seven years I want to get this geometric
pattern that's actually a gif it's like
a breathing exercise for when you're
having an anxiety attack the tattoo I'm
interested in getting is two cranes or a
paper crane one of my favorite books
growing up and my mother and I used to
read together with Sadako and the
thousand paper cranes that's its acuity
the tiny little crane there's obvious
destruction it's kind of intimidating I
thought this is gonna be like a quick
five-minute thing these pressure and
hold firmly for 15 minutes we want to
like play a game or something while
we're doing this like a long time we'll
be right back and we're back peel the
ink box off in the direction your hair
grows my hair goes everywhere they look
hipper just like a trendsetter I think
that's the opposite thing of what trends
that are saying if you can see it it's a
really really faint shadow we could fly
a little bit that's so lame I don't want
to be that lame guy you know if this
ends up looking really good then I'm
totally doomed to go get the real one I
mean this is really cool if you can't
commit to things like I can I'm really
nervous to see what my dad thinks I'm
he's gonna flip a so it's only been
about two hours and you could I have
it's almost a real tattoo six hours
seven hours since I've acquired the
tattoo actually coming in pretty pretty
good now is that real
what do you think I love it you like it
I love it
okay you'd be like that's cute if it's
real I really like it if it's the early
2000s order a wonderful time and I'm
glad you're trying to recapture that I'm
actually really digging it so can just
point me with Sheridan's reaction and
it's already been like a week and it
doesn't look like it's fading at all
right
it's fading a little bit you can see
that so it's looking like a temporary
tattoo right now or like I just like got
stamped at a club and it's wearing off
I'm not to call my dad so I wanted to
play you guys something I got a pack I
got a tattoo paper crane two weeks but I
think it's been about ten days it's gone
I could see how people would like to
just add it on as a little accessory to
their outfit and stuff I don't think I'm
gonna fully commit to the real tattoo it
hasn't felt like this huge commitment so
far so I mean definitely thinking about
getting real wind after having the ink
box tattoos on our arms for about two
weeks we've decided that we're we're
doing it we're gonna get that - yeah
hello Billy
Kirstin they say yeah Zack nice to meet
you
growing up there was a book that my
mother I read when I was younger called
South Dakota thousand paper cranes and
so on Japanese telling for clora day if
you make a thousand paper cranes you're
granted one wish three years after I
read that book for years my mother was
diagnosed with cancer so I made a
thousand paper cranes to grant her that
way and she's not here but if she ended
up pulling out eight nine years after
that even though they'll give her six
weeks that's the reason why I want a
paper crane makes perfect sense it's a
combination of a couple of different
inspirations one is I wanted to get a
piece of this drawing by Sylvia Plath
because she's my favorite author and
she's like helped me through some pretty
dark times mental health wise I wanted
to get this Jima inside a geometric
triangle like this and we're we gonna
put it right here on my forearm
oh my god so much better than I ever
could have imagined it being oh well
okay ready sure
about it all right
oh my goodness
I believe we have a tattoo now oh my god
oh it looks so beautiful though
Wow it's on there it's a life nice
reminder it's nice just you know
symbolic thing put me my mom so I'm
happy about that
thank you I feel great I love the design
so much I'm glad that I finally
committed to something I feel like this
is a long time coming after thinking
about this for so long finally a happy
to have it and I'm finally happy it's on
my arm sorry mom please forgive me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
