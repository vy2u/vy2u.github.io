dated a do once though I saw Prince of
Egypt yeah I'm excited I love learning
about different cultures
we are going to retell the story of the
leaving of Egypt together so if you look
at the table we have all these different
foods that are going to allow us to eat
through the journey how better to learn
the story than to eat a story so one of
the things you might want to keep in
mind when we think about this Seder and
I invite you to think of that now is is
there anything in your own life you're
trying to move towards freedom with my
favorite part was all the wine drinking
certainly um the UH is it's interesting
it's like a lot of fun it's just a lot
of like tradition so let's take the car
pass the spring vegetable and so we're
going to mix the taste of spring and new
life with the experience of the pain of
slavery it's not too bad though after
having a really sweet wine I know
America palate yeah yeah it's just like
a lot of fun and interactive who's the
youngest here at our Seder table love
you okay
so I'll ask admonished 'innahu Lila has
Emily kokal a lot I was this night
different from all other nights put the
horseradish and the hallo sit and make a
little sandwich with your matzah is if
you want to keep in mind that in life
there's gonna be bitterness and there's
gonna be sweetness right you can't get
one without the other
yeah all over with honey you can have
the whole dog I mean it's like apple pie
and then Lou
horse horse radish pears with nothing no
so this is the cup for Elijah Eliyahu
Hanavi Elijah the prophet if he doesn't
show up you like pour a little bit out
no somehow being around like people that
I knew and just enjoying their company
and kind of experiencing a story and
traditions that I wasn't really familiar
with the reading together was pretty fun
Elementary School and it kind of made
like the whole thing like more special
and I feel like I got closer these
people I think that place of knowing
that our stories in each of our cultures
are so important our stories shape who
we are how we imagine our past and
imagine our future always teaches me
more about my own tradition when I get
to share it with Barb's for whom it's
new I think that last piece that really
is about the Seder is let's try and make
a world that's a beautiful place for
everyone to be where we can all be free
this feels like double dinner
whereas at all time not sharing well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
