problem I just like my own Instagram
photo the classic candid I'm totally
didn't know this photo was being taken
yeah I gave my phone to my friend and
was like take a picture of me walking
away from this okay
and I blurred out the background so it's
you know your focus goes to me and my
banging body
guy I'm not proud of this like I'm
like a hot dog like this is
crazy-looking oh that's more likeable
than just a girl having confidence which
is like really gross this is actually in
front of an eyeglasses store and my
friend had a really nice camera with him
and he was like oh stand there and I'll
just take your picture there are a lot
of posts where I'm looking down and
that's because I like ran analytics on
my posts and the ones that perform the
best are when I'm looking down and then
he like edited it in Photoshop this
wasn't taking on my phone I'm
embarrassed
tell you how many pictures this took
that's probably the 20th picture I was
home alone on a Sunday I'm just like
self-conscious about my smile and it
just wasn't working that day so I'm like
oh how about I cover half my face and
just open up my eyes really big but Real
Talk is just my hair looks cool this
picture for almost of the day I went
back and forth like should I post the
video or should I post a still in the
picture my lift looks pretty solid and
in the video it really wasn't that solid
of a lift I like ran forward the fact
that I had that debate for like half a
day in my head was just like really
really stupid
it's me wearing this harness I actually
almost didn't post it because we took
maybe like five or six and I didn't look
good in all of them and I look kind of
chubby kind of bloated and like all of
them and the last photo ended up being a
candid one where I was like talking
about how I want the camera to step from
here because I wanted to hide like the
chubs
and so that people can see like my
little chub hanging out I wanted to look
skinnier in a photo I think we all want
to look skinny in a photo right when you
put yourself in a position to be in you
know the public I like that you do have
a responsibility to say the truth I
definitely don't think that I'm lying in
any of my photos but that doesn't mean
that I don't heavily take into
consideration what I look like or how
the photos taken what time of day it's
posted it's like weird to think that
someone with 200 followers and someone
with 40 million followers had the same
insecurities social media is like
creating this obsession with how other
people perceive us but I think that if
you're living within your truth and
you're being honest in your media and
you're being like this is who I am and
sometimes we look amazing and
we're slaying and sometimes we look like
potatoes really like if I wanted my
Instagram would just be like photobooth
pictures of me bored but no one wants to
see that it's here it's here
what get it
there I think I got it get it yeah you
get it it's here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
