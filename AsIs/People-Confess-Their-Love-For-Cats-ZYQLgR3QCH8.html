I am one and I was put in the wrong body
I can't date people who hate cats my two
cats are my babies if you can't love
them I can't love you Catherine on
motivation it sounds kind of weird but
it's my cat that cuddles me and reminds
me that she'd be lost if I were gone if
I'm angry cats if I'm sad cats if I'm
happy cats if I'm bored cats and cats
are the solution to every and every
problem for me I love cats cuz they hate
people as much as I do
yeah I get mad when people talk bad
about cats like they're not all the same
I love cats my kitty has saved my soul
so many times over I'm so thankful for
him like I honestly wish I could own
every cat in the world like cats make me
so happy
angry cats fat cats quickie cats those
are my favorite I came home crying today
my cats immediately followed me to my
room and sat on my lap I love cats I'd
rather have them than have kids and go
through pregnancy no pain and lots of
gain Jack are the best beings to dance
in front of I mean I was twerking in
front of my cat today and he was
watching my booty pop I love cats so
much that I'm starting to think I may be
a little bit crazy
