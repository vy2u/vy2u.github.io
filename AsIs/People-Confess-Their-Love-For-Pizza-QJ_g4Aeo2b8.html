sex all I want in life is enough money
to buy pizza whenever I want
Pizza is the only thing that knows how
to make me happy I wish someone looked
at me like how I look at pizza looking
at the love of my life like you're so
beautiful you got perfect curves in the
best cheese I love you too pizza
I stopped texting a guy once because he
told me he didn't like pizza I always
say I love you first just once I'd like
extra cheese pizza to say it back just
once any pizza is a personal pizza if
you believe in yourself and try your
best Pizza is the only love triangle I
want in my life these are always listens
these are never ask stupid questions
these will never cheat on you
Pizza understands Pizza is one of God's
great creations
you're hurting God's feelings when you
act too good for it got turned down by
the girl of my dreams and I feel like my
soul is broken but then I wonder $25
gift card for pizza so I got that going
for me which is nice
I wonder how people deal with such huge
changes in their lives I have panic
attacks when my favorite frozen pizza
changes sauces there's times when I wish
I was in a relationship but then I
remember how happy pizza makes me the
noises I make while eating pizza are as
raw and sensual as the first encounter
of two lovers who have been separated by
war for years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
