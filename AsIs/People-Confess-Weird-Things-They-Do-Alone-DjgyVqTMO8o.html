of paper and pretend to be a stapler I
talk to myself in a British accent when
I'm alone when I'm alone I push out my
belly and pretend I'm pregnant when I'm
by myself I eat Froot Loops for dinner a
lot when I'm alone I like to stare at
objects to see if I can move them with
my mind it never happens though when I'm
home by myself all day I forget other
people exists after hearing the sombre
fiend by Britney Spears I've not only
took my perfume and sprayed it all over
my ex's shirts and clothing but I wipe
myself with his clothing so snooger can
smell and find out I'm still sleeping
with him
planning a drink listen to music clean
and dance all by myself tonight
sometimes I sit in my freezer and
pretend I'm a chicken nugget when I'm
alone I like to lather my body and honey
when I'm by myself in an elevator I
dance I work in an office by myself and
listen to Disney songs all day I'm a
straight guy when I'm alone I like to
watch chick flicks honestly the best
therapy sessions I've ever had were the
fake ones where I talk aloud all my
problems in my bedroom by myself and cry
it all out I am 18 and I still have to
sleep with a teddy bear my brother made
me when I was little if I'm alone my
roommate and I are nudists what would
you do if you were all alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
