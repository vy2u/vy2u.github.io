hi
egg yells hi egg your sigh Agathe this
is a trend in Korea beauty circles
apparently you accentuate the fat
deposits underneath your eyes and it
makes you look younger and cute we want
to let the young and supple I want a
baby head photoshopped onto my body bags
under your eyes make you look tired and
we don't want to achieve that look of
looking tired so when I smile I guess
you can see the fatty deposits here and
I apparently I want to have those
deposits visible all the time so step
one is to smile and to get a good idea
of where your fat deposits are what are
we doing okay all right yeah I see it
use a darker tone color than your skin
and you draw the line on your actual fat
deposit I'm gonna use eyeshadow to
create the line in Branson will use the
dear girls cute I maker tool you just
laugh this is a disaster they're crying
right now looks so ridiculous let me see
yours
you can't even she still cannot see it
yeah we both look more tired than we
already were so we're using the shimmery
side of this pen to fill in our eye fat
really sure this pretty shimmery this is
this is something it doesn't look bad no
I feel like you could you need to blend
it a little bit more you could blend it
I feel like every time I try to use
makeup I end up looking like a clown
oh maybe yeah I feel like if it was less
shimmery when look is weird all right
now let's see what our co-workers think
see what they think I think it looks a
bit like you put like
tape or like some tightening tightening
lotions okay I don't know if it's like
concealer or something do you notice
anything different about my eyes
specifically my iPad your iPad is not
even a word and assuming you did
something to minimize it we've got a lot
of fat I don't really notice a
difference you don't notice my youthful
glow no my iPad Alex tell me good
something different about your face is
your eyebrows this is hard because now
I'm just gonna start calling things out
in your face I don't I don't think I'm
the right person for this yeah it's just
she slowly died Mike Ronnie have you not
been sleeping that much Cranston you
have some bags under your eyes oh
what about my eyes listen yellow
together i shat on underneath your eyes
maybe like you pull and beautiful I
don't know I wouldn't say there's like a
super noticeable difference
you know they like already knew so
apparently no one can tell a difference
with prompting people have been calling
us beautiful you know now with more even
lighting
I can't tell two hours yeah maybe doom I
think we look less tired I think if we
had a little bit more practice we could
perfect this hack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
