cover-up under my boot by Diana the
tattoo that I'm getting covered up today
is underneath my left boob underneath it
in its curvature says this heart beats
for only Oh
it is a lyric from a Paramore song that
I got when I was 18
that's cotton ball needles what we call
it it's gonna be super soft oh I like
the sound of the rainbows and bunnies -
but I regret the tattoo because I'm no
longer interested in Paramore and it
taught me to not get song lyrics or just
like words in general that you don't
really feel particularly Iran - anymore
I was 19 at Disneyland with my good
friends Lauren and I was just so still
get is new and so I'm like I need to
remember this for the rest of my life
I'm gonna go get a tattoo so we found
the only place that was open in
Hollywood at 2:00 in the morning and I
was like what better way to commemorate
my love for Disneyland than by a
Tinkerbell tattoo when I went to look in
the mirror at the finished product it is
a silhouette of Tinkerbell and it looks
like she is sent over taking a craft so
that is what I've lived with for seven
years and I'm so ready to be
with it and move on to the next chapter
of my think about free life we just let
me know if my areola pops out oh I did
this guy's fiancees name and it had a
lakh letters the month later you get the
phone call yo I need you to cover this
tattoo up for me out that's hurting so
badly we're going over the same area
look at what I'm going through again see
our yeah personally like just my
favorite me when I get tattoos I see
your plate it like hurts a on tickles
oh I think I'm gonna pass out
we still have a little bit of the top of
the old tattoo sticking out so I'm going
to do is freehand a little bit of more
design give me like five seconds
I thought I'd be much braver
oh no no no that's about it enough a
little bit of white look over everything
looks good
fine I think it is great I think no more
all right my dear I believe we're done
it looks incredible it's the only
cover-up tattoo that I have but it looks
a lot better than a lot of non cover of
tattoos that I have I thought it would
be so tough to get three in the wings
and like that whole weird shape covered
into something that looks normal had I
like gone to a tattoo artist with like
not a full vision and said like what do
you think they might have like come up
with something just as good as this but
it looks amazing
this is something that I can actually
show people - look at my tattoos yes
your tattoo artists what they think when
you get something and maybe they can
come up with something like better than
you could um yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
