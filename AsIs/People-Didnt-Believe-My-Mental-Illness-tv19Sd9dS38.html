guy has told me that he just didn't
believe it was kind of so dismissive and
I felt super embarrassed for confronting
a doctor about it I have anxiety panic
disorder and a mild hint of OCD it
sounds a lot like a cocktail and I said
like that though I overcame anorexia and
bulimia I have struggled with depression
for most of my life I have premenstrual
dysphoric disorder or PMDD postpartum
onset mental illness depression and
anxiety I started modeling in high
school it was ingrained in us pretty
quickly that food was the enemy if you
want to be the girl who gets dates to
prom if you want to be popular you got
to be skinny I had a great boyfriend
great friends like depression always
loves to choose the most perfect time to
kind of come in and shake up your life
next thing I knew it was a month or two
of me not leaving my bed he's starting
to cut blocking out literally my mind
going blank and not knowing what
happened I get laid off from my job
within two weeks I find out I'm pregnant
by like twenty two weeks pregnant I
couldn't tell if I was puking from like
anxiety or morning sickness anymore with
PMDD
you have symptoms like two weeks before
your period so for two weeks you're a
monster for one week you're bleeding and
then you have one normal week out of the
month where you feel kind of okay I
moved abroad to South America I was
invited to launch a Youth Employment
Program two weeks later after I moved my
dad is rushed to the emergency room I
started losing weight my hair started
falling out and I couldn't sleep at
night I just wasn't myself anymore I
started with like 1,500 calories and
then I remember one day I reached 900
calories and I was like oh God I don't
even need food I got a boyfriend and I
got into college so society reinforced
this behavior that I had I never ate the
soft serve ice cream at my college like
that's the biggest that's why you go to
college right I was just like hanging
out with my friends it was a very casual
night and then my heart started her
I just remember thinking I'm a 20 year
old college student and I'm having a
heart attack I wanted to be a parent I
looked forward to being pregnant I
remember distinctly just like lying on
the bathroom floor thinking like I will
never advance beyond this place than I
am at right now when I first realized
something that might be wrong I was
brushing my hair and I had entire patch
of hair come out and I started to cry I
told my friend and she was like that's
because you have a problem
she said it very judgmental II like I
think the thing that isolates us the
most when you're going through an eating
disorder is the shame that's built into
it they think that you're doing this to
yourself and there's a lot of shame
surrounding it which can be paralyzing
my community therapy is already seen as
something for crazy people I don't want
to like tell somebody in my or like hey
can y'all send me to therapy I couldn't
return phone calls I just kind of sat in
my house with my newborn baby isolated
it really took a toll on a lot of my
relationships specifically with this
boyfriend at the time we'd be on the
phone for like four hours at a time and
I would be laughing and then crying and
then angry and then fine and it was
insane I like wanted to go to the
emergency room I went and saw a doctor
they were like seems like you're just
like stressed but they didn't like put
any sort of like label on what was
happening to me it was kind of so
dismissive they asked if I had been
drinking and I felt super embarrassed
for confronting a doctor about it going
to the staff members of this
organization I'm working for I
established that something was wrong
with me I explained to them everything
like my symptoms they just didn't take
it seriously
it was like a big slap in the face I
didn't really know who to talk to you
about it I didn't want people to tell me
that you know I was fine or that I
seemed fine cuz I I know I seemed fine
but I didn't feel it I felt like a
monster I think with the stigma that's
already surrounds periods in PMS if
there's gonna be one thing that's gonna
be not believed it's probably PMDD I was
sleeping literally 30 minutes a night
because I couldn't fall asleep that's
when I was like I have to get help for
this my parents decided to take me to a
bunch of doctors and not
single one was a therapist my mom
thought oh maybe you know you're eating
something funky and I'm like yeah for a
month and then I went to another doctor
and they told me I was probably
deficient of vitamins they had been
looking up my symptoms and and found and
was like if you have over ten of these
you probably have PMT D's I'm kind of
self diagnosed I went to the doctor and
he was like how did you look at those
symptoms lists yeah he was like probably
have PMDD
I mean I was unable to function so I
couldn't call my best friend
the basic assumption for most of them
was like oh she has a kid she's done
with us my best friend was incredibly
hurt I was really hurt because she
wasn't recognizing what I was going
through my boyfriend sat me down and he
said you don't have to talk to me
but you need to talk to someone and then
he later became my husband so I think I
had such a hard time because I come from
a very old-school households where you
have problems but maybe you don't talk
about them
I still don't talk to my family about
this stuff like if I told them they'd be
like have a glass of wine I was in
college at the time I weighed like 108
pounds I remember sitting in my voice
class with a professor that I loved and
I wasn't hearing anything that's she was
saying because I was just thinking about
food the entire time getting help for
these sorts of things takes years
college I tried to open up to new people
and kind of make friends and be real
about it and I remember this one guy has
told me that he didn't believe in which
antidepressants it's hard to find people
who will listen and understand and just
listen and like not try to diagnose when
I talk to doctors they'd be like oh well
maybe you need to sleep more or maybe
you need to take a break from school and
I always felt like it was cited as
something that I was doing wrong I
wanted a doctor that said to me I think
you have panic disorder I remember
speaking to one of the staff members of
the organization who basically called me
a quitter and in that moment I knew I'm
going home immediately because that's
what I need to do for myself I went to
my colleges
mental health center they basically told
me I was like probably stressing myself
out with academics and extracurriculars
and like fake bubble baths and it's like
if holy it could be so easy
I knew depression could cause physical
ailments but this was like on a whole
nother level it turns out I do have
disease depression is one of the big
symptoms of it I was at my obstetricians
office I said to her you know I think
I'm really hormonal I'm just like
sweating all the time and she was like
you're having a panic attack I'm
watching you you need to be in therapy
tomorrow and here's the person that
you're going to go see when I went to
rehab for the first time I remember
meeting women who talked about how they
were on the other side of their
interaxial and I thought to myself oh
that will never be me this is just who I
am for the rest of my life and I can
definitely say there is another side the
key to healing is taking away the shame
if there's anybody out there who's like
telling you that this is your fault
that you are doing this to yourself
you're not I went to the event for women
who had survived postpartum depression
we made a video it's sort of saying like
look here we all are you know we're all
okay I started crying I was just like oh
she's talking to me like this is for me
and one of these people it was just an
incredible moment a finding community
having a friend that I can say I can't
come tonight because I'm really anxious
I didn't felt like I could be honest
with therapists I could be honest with
doctors and then when doctor said I just
think you need a little bit more sleep I
had the confidence to push back and say
well I can't get sleep because I'm
anxious I need an action plan I
literally googled a therapist finding
someone that I can really be honest and
talk to you about was really important I
got myself back into fairly intensive
care I felt happy for the first time in
January of last year don't be afraid to
reach out for help identify who your
community is those are people that are
always going to believe you even when
others don't these habits are not you
these habits have become a part of your
routine but they're not
when your brain says you are a
loser
that is a lie you are not the
loser if you tell your friends and
family about your mental illness and
they don't understand that's a them
thing it's not a you thing you have to
foster friendships and relationships
with people who understand what's going
on with you I have a tattoo term I me
that there are millions of other women
out there who understand exactly what I
go through if you are going through this
and you ever meet me just ask for a hug
because god I would have loved that some
people might not believe you but I
believe you just reach out to someone
doesn't have to be someone you know
but anyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
