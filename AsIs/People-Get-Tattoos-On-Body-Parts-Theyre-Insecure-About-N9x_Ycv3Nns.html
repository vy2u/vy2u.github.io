it's not fun I can feel it vibrating in
my lungs though I hate my thighs I have
had appetite issues that like stem from
being diagnosed with clinical depression
always felt kind of self-conscious about
my arms I have very strong Italian genes
that have blessed me with incredibly
pale skin and very dark thick hair
everywhere as a queer trans non-binary
person I draw a lot of attention in the
streets I'll have my chest out I'll have
chest hair out and for a lot of people
that makes them uncomfortable when I got
to college I started thin cheating out
of boredom I gained a lot of weight for
some reason after I came back from study
abroad my appetite disappeared my arms
just always looked kind of manly I'm
making a few videos which means my hands
and my arms are at the forefront of
every video that I make a lot of the
comments that I get are making fun of my
arms telling me I should shave the hair
on my arm in my experience as a Chinese
American I kind of feel pressured to
like have been physique in China random
acquaintances will come up to me and be
like your face is so route I wear a lot
of loose clothing low-cut dresses and
tops my thighs which I've always been
super insecure about are actually the
thinnest they've ever been I want to
feel happy about it but it's
disappointment and myself for not
treating my body well enough I wanted to
have something that makes sure that no
one a fucks with me and B that decorates
my outside persona this is my first
tattoo and the fact that I'm getting it
on a body part that I'm insecure about
is super important I'm so excited
hi my name is yang and I'm a tattoo
artist I've been tattooing for five
years I feel like tattoos can be really
transformative make them feel better
about themselves if they have any
insecurities about their bodies you can
always put a piece of art on there and
you know make them feel better so tell
me about this tattoo I looked at me and
pure parents on my favorite movies
Tinkerbell was kind of who I related to
the most because she was magical and all
of it Safiye so I really want to get a
Buffy the Vampire Slayer - delighted
tattoo I really want to get her stake
there's a specific stake that I want
it's called mr. pointy
it's the stake that she uses in like the
earlier seasons it was given to her by
another Slayer so the tattoo I chose is
inspired by a toy Oh Mia takis
photograph it's a pair of pliers in
front of a barbed wire fence at the
Japanese internment camps and where the
sewing on the outer part my wife so I
want to get it on my left arm either
here or right here on the inside we're
putting it on my chest so I wanted to
also incorporate something that
represents my Chinese American heritage
I want my Chinese name as the stars so
the design I drew up I feel like it will
look better on the inside of your arm
that is so cool wait that's so pretty I
love that so much I love that that's
really dope this woman is a superstar so
are you ready to get that yeah that's
did
ready I try was Tinkerbell because she
just doesn't take anyone elses bullshit
that's the sort of attitude I want when
it comes to owning my body I'm a huge
Buffy fan I've always wanted to get this
I think it's a great symbol of strength
and girl power and independence
I do immigrant rights organizing the
tattoo that I'm gonna get is a
chain-link fence with a fist running
through it holding a rose I love that my
Chinese name was bigger and I love the
bow slashes of color I really want the
steak to be surrounded by flowers
feminine aspect so it's not just a twig
the idea for the Rose is we've clearly
noticed that some people are afforded
their humanity and some are not
it's an indication of the beauty and the
resilience of existence as resistance so
pain was actually more manageable they
thought it would be I loved yang she was
so amazingly talented I wasn't expecting
it to hurt that much there were times
when I was gritting my teeth but she was
like cheering me on I know it'll be a
permanent reminder that my thighs are
beautiful
like how the Claire thing also got it's
like not too much but it's like super
simple holy shit Wow the shading and the
fake and the flowers it's on my arm
forever and I'm so happy about that line
work is amazing the super femme
fingernail it's been one week since I
got my first tattoo it still doesn't
feel real I'll just admire it and like
that really happened it's a part of my
body maybe no one will comment about my
hairy arms anymore and instead they'll
just feel like your tattoo is so cool I
fucking love it I feel like I can walk
down the street confidently I try to
avoid looking at my bare body especially
my thighs but because of this tattoo I
have something to admire and makes me
feel proud that my thigh was able to be
the canvas for a piece of art when I
look at my arm I just see this awesome
piece of artwork and I don't really
think about my insecurities or anything
else that I normally would think of
beforehand it was interesting to see it
men look my way and be unsure about
their attraction especially when I'm
expressing my gender in a non-conforming
way I've been kind of showing off my
tattoo now I feel empowered and affirmed
in the way that I'm expressing myself
through my tattoo the tattoo regardless
of which thigh it's honor which body
part definitely serves as a reminder
that regardless of what I put in it or
don't put in it it's still beautiful and
it's healthy and I should appreciate it
more often so as you may have noticed
boldly is now
as it but don't worry you'll still get
all the awesome content you used to but
just even more new great stuff click
