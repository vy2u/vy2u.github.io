my nose grew before the rest of my body
and face did so I kind of had a
prominent nose in my whole life my nose
has bothered me it's just like it's
lumpy it's big I was actually born with
the condition called hemangioma it was
basically an overgrowth of tissue it was
like really big and it was red one of my
nicknames was Rudolph and I'll get like
Internet comments like that girl has the
ugliest nose I've ever seen all I've
ever wanted to know is what it would be
like if I was born with a normal nose
what's that like I'm the creator of the
non-surgical nose job procedure so what
it can't do is get rid of the bump
because it's a procedure that I can only
add filler what it can do is camouflage
the bump you think I'm adding to the
nose you think of making the nose bigger
but in actuality I'm making the nose
look smaller because I'm making it
straight if the nose is straight it
doesn't draw attention and it blends
into the rest of the face with Ben his
concern is is on the profile interesting
that he's got not one but two bumps to
lift a little bit at the between the two
bumps and then we lift a little bit on
the tip we can give him nice straight
nose on the profile the Swazi has
surgery when she was little for
hemangioma because she had that surgery
on her nose the contours of her nose are
different than they would have been
naturally what I think we can do with
fillers is extend the tip of her nose a
little bit this way down so that on the
profile instead of having her nose look
like that having it look kind of more of
a right angle with cristal I think she's
going to be the one with the most
dramatic transformation her nose is not
actually physically too big for her face
it's just that she has a bump it draws
attention it makes her nose look bigger
I can make her nose straight and when I
do that it's going to look small it's
going to blend in to the rest of her
face and it's going to be really a big
change hi hi I'm dr. Afghan crystal nice
to meet you
very bumpy interesting nose oh it's okay
I had a friend in college who literally
made it a point to tell me after I
basically confided in her about my
insecurity with that she told me would
look a lot prettier if you had your
mom's nose an adult I'm a little bit
more comfortable with it but there's
still some angles that I see that I've
kind of like it seems a little crooked
okay so see that clearly without my
glasses
right it's tiny this is gonna be no big
deal I'm gonna inject you're gonna
breathe we're gonna be cool I'm excited
I'm gonna close my eyes I don't want to
see it go that's mine
am I gonna cry absolutely here's a joy
but manly tears of joy won't judge me
right no okay so looks like here hey
how's that that's fine right it's no big
deal
no why I'm so scared little tiny you
won't be scared in a second oh that's
right that's it
wait what good oh this is looking much
better already
molding it a little bit just because the
stuff is stuff is adjustable even as
we're doing it yeah doing all right I'm
doing great
don't worry about the sounds there's a
little hair bubbles
any when it's all done if it's really
good
you can cry I will cry so this is
lifting the tip giving a little bit more
definition and also making it a little
more stable so that when you smiles
doesn't go down still really good it's a
position I very much encouraged you can
do if you're ready for the big moment I
can't believe that's already done that
was so quick I haven't even seen this
good right I know it's gonna be good bye
the tears that they're flowing I think
you're ready to see this big reveal all
right here we go oh look at that
go ahead and take a look take a look
from here this you know doesn't do that
like wavy horrible thing that I hate
it's great I'm I'm very happy with it
though it looks like how I wanted my
nose to look good I feel great it was so
quick it was painless my nose bothers me
but I wasn't saying it like I needed to
be changed to be happy but now that it
is different and better like I'm
relieved and happy and excited I just
can't believe I'm looking at my face and
I'm not seeing a crooked nose anymore
like I'm literally not going to stop
looking at this for the next however
long this lasts months on months and I
know for a fact I will end up back here
but this is this is what I thought I
would look like you know but if I were
to grow up with normal nose this is this
is what I imagined I don't think guys
getting procedures makes them any more
or less masculine masculinity is a
construct I'm excited to have this nose
for the next year and a half two years I
would totally have this nose forever
like it feels like my nose this is going
to help me so much with my confidence I
think everyone should celebrate and
everyone else's happiness instead of
thinking oh why would she go out of her
way to inject her lips or do her nose as
people should be accepted for who they
want to be as well
