it's a really terrible excuse but I've
just never got around to it I don't know
I just really have no reason why I've
never done this at the age of 23 I've
had really low iron in the past and
other health reasons that have led me to
not be eligible to donate blood but I'm
feeling pretty healthy now and should be
good to go
I'm Gemma for Kamiya and I'm a
spokesperson for the Australian Red
Cross Blood Service so the Australian
Red Cross Blood Service needs around
27,000 blood donations each and every
week across Australia that's to help
road accident victims cancer patients
those with autoimmune diseases and lots
of other people undergoing surgery we do
only have 3% of the population donating
blood though so we actually do need to
be constantly out in the public
encouraging other people to donate and
certainly having 3 percent of the
population donating it's not many we
could certainly use more and we do tend
to rely on the same people donating
quite regularly we actually say one in
30 people donate blood and one in three
people are likely to need some sort of
blood or a blood product at some stage
in their life I'm Nancy Lukich I was
born with a genetic blood disorder
called Selassie me a major whereby my
red blood cells don't have the ability
to reproduce patients like myself
require regular blood transfusions every
three to four weeks in order for
survival so the blood donors that donate
blood are actually our lifeline and are
giving us the gift of life
feeling really good I'm actually feeling
really relaxed it's not nearly as bad as
I thought I thought I would be feeling
woozy and nervous but I'm it's like it's
kind of cool like yeah I'm not freaked
out at all that's pretty cool it's a
workday and I'm laying down I'll be this
regular yeah it's fun I felt pretty good
and then I saw like the bags brought out
that they were going to put the blood in
and that I did have a moment of like oh
my god while they're taking that much
but once they started going for it it
was pretty cool I feel really fine I
feel silly for being nervous we need
people in here every day because we
actually can't keep the blood for a long
time but essentially as soon as your
blood is collected it's going to go to
help somebody almost straight away once
you break the ice and give blood for the
first time you would wonder why you
didn't do it sooner it's it's great it's
easy and you just feel good with
yourself after I think I've got a cool
bandage we've got a sticker and they
gave me a cookie which was delicious
I would definitely do it again like I
want to kind of look into how often I
can do it because I feel like I should
do it as often as possible I feel so
good and if anything just a little bit
silly that I wasn't able to do this
earlier it took me five minutes of my
day today to make such a big impact on
three other people's lives so it's a
really incredible feeling some people
can't donate due to health reasons and I
understand that but if you're able to I
think there's absolutely no reason not
to what I did today took 10 minutes and
it might save somebody's life that's a
really amazing feeling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
