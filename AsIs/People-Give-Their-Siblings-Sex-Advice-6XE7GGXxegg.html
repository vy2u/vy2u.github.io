coconut oil is a fantastic lubricant
it's not I have a sister she just told
21 she is in my hometown which is Bhopal
so right turn we've never discussed
anything beyond family that is something
we restrict to ourselves on our cell
phones you know how it is in India you
you talk metaphorically it's your first
time how are you supposed to know what's
good what's not good my first sexual
experience is a disaster
spectacular and I was hours I think I
was perfect
booth was just lying down next to each
other and it just happened I wanted to
appear very confident that I knew where
exactly to put it in it was awkward and
sloppy and weird we started and exactly
5 minutes and 27 seconds later I stepped
off let's just say there was it was no
sexual masterpiece sex is not a big deal
it is overrated the friends are bragging
about it the fact is half of them are
lying about it and the other half are
having just really really bad sex it
will end up happening the question is
just when first time we have sex don't
put too much expectation into it like I
might just you know come off like really
fast and you know it happens your
boyfriend could be extremely shy in
front of people but he could be like a
like a cowboy in bed thinking of sex as
a very very perfect thing it's not that
way but all you know it's gonna be
somebody's couch or like a really
disgusting bed with people's clothes on
top of it he's also probably going to be
hairy and he might stink and he might
make some sounds you're not going to
have a boyfriend with Abby
we size doesn't matter I think it's more
about what you do with your instrument
as opposed to how shiny and flashy and
long people will want to do freaky stuff
in bed don't be like I'm not gonna go
down my doesn't go down because
it's your job to good huh if there's
even that one small tiny inkling or that
that voice in your head that says no
don't do it don't do it experiment have
a lot of sex if that means being
committed I'm staying in a committed
relationship and being with just a one
person that's fine if you think that you
want to proceed to have sex despite your
religious beliefs you can do that but
then if you don't want to do that and
want to have a lot of fun that's fine as
well not that I recommend you you know
participating in orgies just stay true
to yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
