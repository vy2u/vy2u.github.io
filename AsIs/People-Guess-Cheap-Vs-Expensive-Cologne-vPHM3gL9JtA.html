that everyone is ripping us off and then
it really doesn't make a difference
not like bottom bottom shelf but it's
like so duck into last shelf it's like
the smirnoff vodka of clones you know
it's malls and yeah mall scented
it was inoffensive but it wasn't like oh
my god right honey
yeah hug me gonna take off your clothes
now but it smells good I mean it doesn't
smell bad I wouldn't be like no but I
wouldn't be like oh hell yes smells like
it should be the most expensive but I
think it's probably me you'd wear it cuz
your mom gave it to you but like it's
not your favorite oh you were right well
I don't know give it it was the one I
liked it'll change Obama I mean that's
like supposed to be nice right yeah
it smelled like a household cleaner or
something
it smells like man fruit okay actually
that wouldn't smelled more expensive to
me for some reason smelt a little higher
quality are you thinking the opposite I
think that was a cheap cologne yeah that
was very very Oh
did the day that was $220 well I am
shocked and appalled I am so I'm so
disappointed
okay it wasn't bad
no I liked it you know it smells like
something that somebody was good credit
yeah no student loans away the scent
reminds me of floor cleaner older
gentleman cruise ship by lingering like
a good steak dinner at a fancy
restaurant Congrats to Beverly Hills
hope I see you for you they called me I
love it fool so the $7 one smells better
than the most expensive one by far like
that's ridiculous that's what I'm trying
to tell you prices and everything guys
don't count it out just because it's at
CVS don't wear eggs be better than us
this is just a PSA that juicy like they
don't spray ax all over don't wear ax
anymore preteens yeah don't do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
