which one lassos
today we're trying to guess the
difference between cheap lingerie and
expensive lingerie I definitely know
that longer I can get pretty expensive
friends with lingerie I don't own any
I've brought a few yeah I don't really
understand why lingerie is so expensive
thinking about food it's like the tinier
of the plate is the more expensive it is
but it's like really good I think I can
tell the difference between cheap and
expensive lingerie no lace is a hard
thing to kind of tell if it's cheap or
expensive because some people can really
got the cheap lace down pack lace on
this is more like intricate but I hope
that's a delight because that's the
tennis that's what people do to test for
like diamonds and stuff for sure it's
not like a trick where they're both the
same exact pair mm-hmm the stitching is
a little bit off it's a few strings out
of plague I think I think the red one is
more expensive because it looks like a
connection in between the fabric is
stronger and it feels stretchier oh no
way this is like a pillow is a soft
either these are more expensive
shee these are definitely more expensive
these are the fancy ones and these are
the less fancy less expensive ones
that's our gasps damn it I'm very
surprised but hey I like these better
my confidence is shaking very sexy these
brows are very similar let's feel some
underwire this looks like real grandma
knitted lace I like that this one's
flatter the brownness of that one kind
of makes me think cheap you've been
something sort of like streamlined and
minimalist just like fancier what fill
this machine that much they're like this
one this one feels cheaper than that one
yeah yeah these are more expensive this
is the more expensive bra and panties my
final answer is this one but harness is
more expensive I think this is the more
expensive one and I think this is a less
expensive way
you could get a an apartment in Michigan
25 I'm serious
yeah yeah honey I was hoping this was a
little hole in the back so you could go
to the bathroom we could just sit down I
don't worry about a thing or taking a
hall I'm gonna do the light test again
I'm sorry exactly like that's not
healthy last time
this feels rough it's all get-out like
this one's more like fashion-forward I'm
thinking about sheets the higher the
thread count the better the quality so
this looks like a tighter knit so in my
opinion this looks more expensive I'm
genuinely stumped on which one's more
expensive in which one's cheap expensive
cheap this one's more expensive but I'm
gonna go ahead and say this one's more
expensive because I've been wrong every
time this is fancy mesh and and that
makes me think this is the the more
expensive I think this one was more
expensive but it might just be because I
like it more I'm gonna go against what
you're guessing I think this one's more
expensive than that one
what I'm shocked
so you're right you do pay you're paying
for a hole in the back you're paying for
the it's the convenience fee of the poop
hole my world is getting rocked my world
is rocks
I am shook today I learned that I cannot
tell the difference between cheap and
expensive lingerie this is actually even
cheaper than the cheap lingerie I
already behind I think people should
spend what they want to spend on
lingerie if it makes you feel good it
makes you feel good you do not have to
spend an arm and a leg to look fly and
it look good I can do it now cuz I know
that it's not that expensive
clearly I have cheap taste so you don't
got it much to give me a showgirl
especially because mesh is in right now
Sifu is in ya going neck it is in itself
