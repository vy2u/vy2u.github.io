saying jeans they're leggings I am a
giant fan of yoga pants agreed some of
the things that I feel insecure about my
body about I feel more comfortable about
when I'm wearing yoga pants I became a
mom and leg that's the uniform man have
you seen my butt and some yoga pants you
would understand why I love some yoga
pants okay I'm just gonna visualize the
booty I think that will help me material
feels really nice yeah this is weird
that they have a little like patch over
the crotch I don't think it's weird look
at this there's a pocket in the booty
okok yes that's a fake pocket I think
it's maybe for lipgloss no I think it's
perfect look at your ID pocket the thank
you I'm bad ok so you know what I think
they stretch so I think you're right I
feel like it's like $65 I'm gonna say 70
I'm guessing that these are $74.99 but I
was thinking 50 ish $179 99.99 right on
the dot whoa get really close
you're getting a lot of bang for your 65
bucks that's really awesome I think the
material is a little bit cheaper than
the last one we have I don't know about
the fabric it's supposed to be a
visionary yes yeah I'm not spending
money for people to see my underwear I
already win me over on design this is
like sewn inside out - this isn't does
that mean that it's where you've made
but I feel like the design would jack up
the price a little bit more that is what
I likes called camel toe stitching you
know what 70 again I think 50 I'm gonna
go with maybe a good 25
I'm gonna go $21.99 450 I'm gonna say
$45
oh my god oh I would not pay $110
business you are paying for fashion you
are not paying for function doesn't feel
comfortable at all I do like the mesh
I'm telling you right now these are
gonna dig into my stomach I think this
would make the booty look okay the first
time but then the third time you were in
I mean kind of like it has the vag pad
okay camel toe pads but I'm gonna go
with like 25 like $30 $35 yeah I think
13 29.95 I'm here $19.99 oh I'm pretty
good at this that's the closest we've
gotten yeah see you're good at this I
don't own anything like this spent a lot
of time with you ladies we look like
superhero pants you feel really nice
it's a cotton it's a breathable cotton a
plus bootie on that I think the booty
would look nice like these just have so
much flair to them I feel like these are
expensive I'm gonna say 45 middle of the
line like dainty a hundred and twenty
dollars I could see between 60 and 80
I'm gonna go with $119 I think they're
50 4.99 oh these would run my car for a
month we're holding a piece of rent and
feel like this would hug my curves and
make me feel for me leggings are life I
think more men should wear them too
actually
yeah could men start wearing them so we
can all just be creepy if a legging
costs a lot of money but will make me
look like five to ten pounds slimmer I
will spend that money don't be afraid to
size up okay nobody knows what size yoga
pants you're wearing but you're gonna
look hot they really are the future of
pants and people just kind of need to
hop on board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
