been taught a specific set of
terminology that is not understandable
I'm going to bring some of these terms
to my friends here and see if they know
if they can guess what we're talking
about what do you do if you're giving a
love offering sex of sex sounds like an
orgy handy what I initially think yeah
open your arms to someone the answer
we've come up with is the sign of peace
either a hug or a handshake I'm wrong
dammit the answer is actually when
someone comes to your church as like an
evangelist or a preacher and you can't
pay them so you pass around the bucket
and you give them a love offering of
money so money equals love what is the
10/40 window oh that's when everybody
shows up ten one is going to pee 10 2 is
going to poop what I went to Catholic
school growing up Pete and I used to
have like are you called it the coke
pudding on some like it's a it's
the last song Church I don't want to put
on their coats 10:40 is the window
before church begins we're in you can
either socialize get a few minutes in
with the Reverend priest preacher that
is incorrect
is actually the latitude and longitude
of the most unreached people groups in
the world so if somebody says they're a
missionary I'm in the 10/40 window whoa
that's deep
it's like some soldier right there
that's pretty crazy what is happening
when someone is being washed in the
blood that's horrible the water
represents blood in a Baptist
yeah are you sure when you're drunk on
wine yeah maybe like a absolved of I
don't know watching the blood that's
totally contradictory and you can't wash
something blood after though ah kind of
we gotta wash clean washed in the blood
cuz his sacrifice he made for us it
makes us clean if you look at someone
and you're not seeing the fruit what has
happened
they've closed on the warrant no for now
children why wouldn't you see a food
maybe they don't have enough fruit yeah
and they're a bad egg yeah they have no
Gotham fruit of the Spirit in Galatians
is love joy peace patience kindness
goodness faithfulness gentleness and
self-control so if you claim to be a
Christian and you're murdering someone
ain't got no fruit right even if you're
not religious maybe you grew up in here
you're your mom or someone saying those
words so you think like everybody knows
what that means if you use it like I
don't know what to talk about groups
have their own lingo and language in
terms for things because they're
inclusive you know anyone from the
outside is obviously going to you know
question those things like if you're if
you said you're a dancer right if I hung
out with your crew you'd be using terms
that I wouldn't know about great yeah
like what ah swag no just uh okay that's
our joke</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
