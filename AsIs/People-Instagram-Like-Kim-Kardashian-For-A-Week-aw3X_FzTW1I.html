Vinci of Instagram meanwhile us plebs
can't even get a selfie right I love the
Kardashians I don't like all of them all
the time as a family I think they're
nuts but it's really entertaining to
watch I admired that they can stick
together even when so much is
happening love them or hate them
everyone is talking about them I can't
say that I'm a fan of the Kardashians
but it's impressive to Rand yourself as
America's royal family and I wouldn't
disagree
kim was robbed at gunpoint in Paris
during Paris Fashion Week she took a
really long hiatus from social media at
the look during Paris and before Paris
was tan and light all of a sudden it
stopped for like three months and you're
like whoa when is Kim gonna post again
and then all of a sudden is like damn
Bam Bam Bam Bam like a new chapter of
her life and she's in control of her
story this is what I'm putting out there
poetic with these series of pictures you
don't see her face trying to keep it
mysterious loli letting people in blue
and green it feels like an atmosphere
timeless brainy kind of film a nostalgic
you want to know what's happening that
day they feel like you know them and you
want to like go give them a hug but
she's very stripped down she has on like
a white t-shirt I want to see the blood
sweat and tears that goes into Kim
Kardashian's instagrams this week we're
going to apply Kim Kardashian's new
Instagram aesthetics to our own lives
and see how we feel first photo I took
was the one that we did as a group
matching a photo that Kim posted on her
Instagram I think I look cool in it
maybe I don't know I found that it was
hard to mimic her without looking silly
I captioned it tired and happy it shows
a more intimate and like sweet side
someone wrote this is too precious a
comment that I've never gone before I'm
still unsure of how we're supposed to
emulate Kim Kardashian's Instagram I was
supposed to meet up with a friend today
at a cafe and I asked if we could find a
place that was Q for Instagram when I
was editing the photo to I was like oh I
could be more green but I didn't wanted
to be green and I was like feeling like
oh yeah I did my job at the same posted
a photo that was like way more Kim Kate
looks like I was taken with a Polaroid I
feel threatened now
kanna's posted it looks like she's just
in the middle of something and someone
grabbed a camera and took a photo I'm at
home carrying my dog about to take him
out to poop I tried to do the filters
but it is really hard to like get it in
the state I said it did of pose
Kardashians would do I kind of wanted to
try something I've never done before you
can kind of see my butt a little bit
funny like the reactions that I got from
people were just kind of like whoa it's
am like okay why am I getting secure
about posting photo like that not that
big of a deal actually I'm about to take
my dog out for a walk it is telling more
historian what is he doing notice kins
captions simple things like family so I
have one this is home and hugs the other
one that I posted I'm sitting on the
floor the back of the room is like dark
flashes on did you take these pictures
with the Polaroid or something or is it
just filters filter name please whoo-hoo
I want to write what filter it is but
it's like literally a bunch of steps
shooting the pictures is a lot of fun
but posting them is kind of exhausting
have to put on 20 different like filter
features onto the picture it's like
you're trying to paint this masterpiece
and it's like no I'm putting a picture
on Instagram I think being good at
Instagram should be an Olympic event
everyone seems to be having trouble
getting their photos in on time just in
case I'm bringing in another co-worker
quail Eleni I'm someone who's definitely
in the camp of the Kardashians they're
really great at making money it's not
necessarily a brand that I would have
endorsed but I am kind of into this
style of photography I decided to take a
photo using the self-portrait technique
it's not necessarily in my opinion hard
reminds me of any other art technique
they're trying to replicate it's
tantamount to trying to replicate like
someone else's watercolor technique well
I did have difficulty throughout this
thing and then I posted a photo where
I'm just kind of looking off to the side
they were like yeah yeah you did it
right so I was like so okay I think I
got it a lot of Kim's photos they're
kind of like in motion looking away or
looking down it makes it easier to pose
honestly and I've gotten like a lot of
comments around that some people did you
drop something trying to channel Kim and
my own what
this boss ass women are my pictures
looking as good as hers no all the
filters are like based on a numeric
system numbers make me dizzy I'm always
really intrigued when people have like
really prevalent instagrams who's taking
these photos is Kanye they're taking
those photos Instagram intern that would
actually probably a pretty sweet gig no
one was home
you know the GPS holder in your car
where you put your phone set my camera
on timer and I caption it routines with
like an alien emoji this editing
technique is kind of reminding me of
everything I love about analog color
photography I remind zoo boy was like
going into the darkroom when dialing in
like three points magenta two points
green one dab blue I wanted to
experiment with the photo where she's
standing outside like a porch it's just
very content I'm outside with my dog
Marty I hope to mind my friends jasmine
because it seems like the photos focus
on relationships friendships familial
bonds also it seems like there's this
introspective vibe and I put that in
quotes because I think in order to be
introspective you have to be naked Kim's
photos you know how to family gathering
your party so I wanted to post with one
of my friends I posted with my friend
Freddie all the other photos have been
just me it got kind of boring like I ran
out of poses I'm gonna just try to like
to do the most Kim thing possible and
like having fun without but I'm wearing
I thought about what are three routines
I do I saw my makeup I drink tea and I
read celebrity gossip while eating junk
food also I just don't think people
really want to see what I do day to day
they're gonna be like why are you
posting that you probably like shaking
and how is posting to Instagram is often
like running a marathon this exhausting
but every day I consider it like when I
was going to take a picture of bodies
I'm gonna take my picture I felt like I
was creating a masterpiece I'm realizing
that I'm actually really that I'm doing
this because in my appearance to the
Kardashians I think I'm actually missing
out on a major piece of cultural history
people already think pieces on Kim's new
style of
so clearly this is some day nuts being
left in the cultural membrane and as
someone who is a lover of history and
sociology and anthropology I think that
you have to understand who the idols are
whether or not it's your Idol I've been
treated and also kind of excited to
maybe a road a little bit of my
pretentiousness
hurt me and I just found the darkest
zones possible literally can't see
anything in here because this is order
took our photo all her photos it's like
really low light and then flash she's
still one of the most famous people in
the world she's also like a mother egg
the family and has a job and we have the
same desires who wants that all of us
how was my last picture it really has
that like warm glow for my six photo for
my anniversary with my girlfriend a
organic moment that was captured felt a
little bit more empowered to be open
with my personal life I'm gonna post
about my dinner why not like celebrate
something that's really reminds me of
middle school on like a Sunday afternoon
chill and I home with my family that
kind of nostalgia can't help us mile
it's just so peaceful looking people
have this tendency at like making it
scream like a museum of your life where
you just like post most interesting
things but for this made me peel back
the curtain by peeling up a curtain or
like actually interested in my real life
not just really crazy life that I would
normally want to portray and social
media I guess I think I'm gonna change
just be more true to myself even though
I post a fair amount
I actually don't put a lot of thought
into it I think social media is a fun
like expression of yourself the
Kardashians use it as a big part of
their business for me I think I'm just
gonna stick to posting random things
looking back on this week I realized
that the photo that did best was the one
where I'm being hot cheetos while
browsing my laptop and i can see why--
can post these like kind of photos
because people respond well when they
feel like they're getting to know a more
relatable side to you I feel like I know
what colors look good but it's
interesting to let that go and imitate I
would never have added glow I would
never have added
to my photos ready to apply elements
that I've learned into my own style I
always would you proceed the Kardashians
to be sort of shallow there is something
I really I'm starting to respect and
love about taking something that deals
with feeling unsafe familial bonds
intimacy thing with grain and color
shaping that to like reshape the way
that you tell your story after an event
I have so much respect for that art
shapes and defines the world that we
live in and it also reshaped sus so it's
really rad that she is using art as a
conduit to our story which i think is
what all artists do but I just never
really thought of her as an artist until
this point post a photo or two or three
or nine on instagram and hashtag
BuzzFeed Kim K filter good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
