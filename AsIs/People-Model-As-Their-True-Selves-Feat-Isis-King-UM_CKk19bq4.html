people is about to become feed famous
last week our competitors had to show us
their best hashtag not sponsored video
and photo Anthony won for the second
week in a row unfortunately we had to
say goodbye to divinity and now we're
down to our top three competitors let's
see what they brought this week hey
again we're so close to the finale
hey it's Anthony no matter what happens
go I'm gonna just stay true to myself hi
everyone Vicky you guys the fourth
challenge the semifinals oh my god I'm
so excited
this week's celebrity guest judge
competed on America's Next Top Model and
guest-starred on shows such as shameless
and the bold and the beautiful
let's welcome Isis King Hey thank you so
much for being here thank you for having
me number one we have the same birthday
itself we right here we have yeah yeah
I'm excited to see everything you can
give us and help me because girl I need
help well I'm ready to help you break it
down our challenge this week is love
yourself hashtag as is let's see what
the competitors had to do all right
competitors hello again
we know on social media you can
basically be anybody you want to be you
can fool the whole world honestly but to
me being food famous means being
authentic and yourself if you want your
followers to love you then you gotta
love yourself you gotta love yourself
this week's challenge is called love
yourself hashtag as is that means I want
you to be your true authentic self I
want this picture to be you so here's
what I need from you one the picture
must be a wide shot two we must see you
from head to toe three you must have a
prop in your picture and four you better
make us say wow this is your last chance
to show us why you deserve to be flown
out to LA and compete in the finale show
I need you to really give this all you
have I want to look at this picture and
say oh this is you this is who they are
now go out there and make me proud
remember you can only use your phone
though good luck that's exciting
yeah I'm excited to see who's gonna be
naked oh that's something you would ever
make and you already know I'm excited to
see what pops people that can literally
be anything the important part to me was
when picking this challenge is that
competitor show their most true and
authentic selves which I'm so glad
you're here because you've started your
career being your true authentic self so
I'm hoping that our competitors can just
make it just so true and so honest
each week we judge our competitors on
three categories this week is
composition wow factor and feed
worthiness with composition we're
looking at framing more technical things
like lighting with wow factor I'm really
looking for like wow what is it's gonna
make me stop and be like cool
it's all about the wow factor so if you
don't feel it right away okay then it's
not the wow factor and then with feed
worthiness is this something you would
like this picture would you save this
picture would you send this picture to
friends would you leave a comment it's
gonna take all three of those factors to
decide our top two competitors this week
we're gonna start off with our first
competitor Anthony I'm very interested
to see where Antony's gonna take us this
week hey it's Anthony and I watched the
challenge video two hours ago
and I was downstairs well my mom and my
dad to have a portrait of themselves
think that was like my number one
inspiration pic because I did want to
give an O much to my mom my mom has a
mole right here so honestly she's like
literally my best friend and I honestly
don't want to let her down she pictured
a different life for me when I told her
I was gay she didn't talk to me for like
a good week she's okay with me being gay
but I know that she wouldn't be okay
with me wearing makeup because that's
too feminine reason why I'm scared to
tell my mom that I do makeup
is because a my dad I know that he knew
that I was gay because there was one
time I was like for my mom and my dad
they were like playing Cambodian karaoke
and I went up to the bathroom and I
wrapped the towel around my waist and I
was dancing like the girls that I seen
and my dad he just walked in and I just
like stood there like I like graaah
thought he was gonna beat me he thinks
that I'm gonna end up a woman and I told
him all the time that that's not what I
want and like we don't even talk for a
long time I've been trying to hide
myself it ate me up inside and now I
honestly don't give it this is me and if
my dad can't accept me the way I am well
there's like a whole bunch of other
people that are gonna love you for just
who you are no matter what happens go
I'm gonna just stay true to myself
because being yourself is honestly the
greatest thing that you can do
yeah from what I'm seeing Anthony looks
like he posed three different ways and
then dressed up is two different people
what I really love is how he really
opened up and he really got vulnerable
and let us see and hear his true story
the outfits are so on point I love the
fact that he said like Etha when it
comes to being accepted by family I
learned that you can't live your life
for other people so I'm proud of him
that he's learning that at an early age
you have to just be you and clearly he's
grown into history composition wise like
I mentioned before he's doing different
poses so the bottom two look like
they're mirrored image and then the
middle is a different pose and then the
top to the left and the right are both
different poses as well and it's so
clean it's not definite yeah it looks
great
his makeup I like that it's also
personal to him and his culture wow
factor like come on I have to hold on to
my hair yeah good like wow factor I'm
feed worthiness that's definitely worth
a like a comment a safe operation yeah
that's the wow factor I agree I feel
sorry for the other competitors I know
this is love yourself as is to me last
week all the competitors had to sell me
toilet paper and Victoria made a dress
out of the toilet paper went over and
beyond so I'm hoping Victoria also goes
over and beyond for this challenge this
week I hope she recycled that just last
week I know hi everyone Vickie here
welcome to the fourth challenge love
yourself
hashtag it or be sure is supposed to
embody everything we are always supposed
to show you a way of a picture if
someone asks me to ascribe myself what
would I say which first thing that came
to my mind is fed up I have a very
bubbly personality
and then I was like lovely bubbles yeah
bubbles that's what I have to have in my
picture I think I went gonna cry see you
guys as you can see here I found one
he's both tedious in case I don't know I
have so many balls you guys I love the
idea of loving yourself as we are I feel
very happy I feel very proud of myself
so I feel like I'm on top of the world
right now and I want my picture to rings
like that so I want for you to see a
background of the whole city I think
this is a strongest concept that I've
had so far
as soon as you see your pictures you are
gonna be like well that's weak it's the
last challenge before the finale but I
feel like God things I'm feeling quite
often so thank you guys I wish me luck
besitos much
oh I like how colorful the bubbles are
they look like little prisms in there I
feel like I would see this picture and I
wouldn't know that she's like a fun
person I would see it and think that
she's fun in a sense of the bubbles but
her outfit is really dark it is I
understand she wanted to use a prop so
she used the bubbles I'm not getting I
have a bubbly personality by just seeing
all these bubbles composition wise I
think her poses all around are okay
it's a beautiful backdrop for feed
worthiness I mean I would definitely
like this photo and I'd probably comment
on it I would definitely stop in like
all three yeah I would say it would
definitely inspire me to want to use
bubbles in this way I just wanted a
little bit more vulnerable it's a lot
going on right there when it could be a
lot lighter last but not least we have
oh so last week in our competition
ohso served us a little throwback 90s
looking vibe but so I'm interested to
see what Oso is going to bring to us
this week hey we're so close to the
finale just call me a shark instead of
also because I'm smelling blood in the
water I normally say I'm excited but for
this sort of calendar all the creative
aspects of this challenge are on us and
we challenge my head and just going to
pull and then I'm design operate also we
don't have the budget to do what you
really want to I'm really happy for this
photo show I feel it'll be very
different from other photo shoots that
I've done it's going to be one outside
I'm gonna be using a disco ball which I
feel will give a pretty cool effect with
the light I'm going to be wearing kind
of a turquoise kimono keep it very
casual but still very much my style it's
me the tones are me the colors are me
the kimono it's me like I wear that it's
just like I feel like I'm a superhero
but overall I'm really happy I'm excited
really looking forward to going to LA
manifesting it I love you oh okay I like
this picture a lot aesthetically it's
falling a little short for me what I'm
talking about the hashtag love yourself
as is I think it's art it definitely has
a WOW factor but I get what you saying
like how is the disco botton and
together that make me feel like love
yourself composition wise I mean the
shot is beautiful the lighting and the
background is great in the foreground I
love it dark the spotlight on the disco
ball his pose has leaned that's a
beautiful picture only thing I can get
from it though is that he's mysterious
yeah wow factor I would see the picture
and think wow but as far as this
challenge goes I'm not thinking wow for
feed worthiness I think this would
inspire me to recreate this picture I
would definitely like it I would
probably leave a comment but it's like a
missed mark to me I think it's falling a
little short now it's time for us to
delivery and decide who wins this week's
challenge and who is being kicked off
the feed Victoria it's just missing the
mark for me between what she was saying
and what this photo actually came across
as I love the bubbles and I get the
reference to a bubbly personality but
the outfit the hair the faces nothing
with Anthony he went into so much detail
about what this story meant to him he
gave us his inspiration he gave us his
story and put it into a picture even if
he didn't Photoshop the rest of the
images and had that middle image it
still would have been the best of the
week I agree on top of it having the wow
factor
the most amazing composition very great
and being feed famous everyone was saved
this bitch for oh so the picture is
great I love this photo but as far as
they'll love yourself as is challenge
he's hiding I don't know what it is
there's nothing showing me who you are I
don't see him at all he's a shadow in
the background and I get the picture
looks like art yeah if this is about who
are you and I can't see you then he's
the worst of the week from me so Anthony
obviously is like my top one I'm a
little lost between Victoria and oh so
no one to me is better than the other
they're both mediocre parents Anthony
Anthony Forrest made that connection and
showed us this is literally who he is I
don't think this is Victoria and I
really don't think this is Oh so if I
had to pick I would give it to Victoria
overall so just quite a simple fact that
I don't even see him at all yeah what
I'm struggling with is Victoria from the
beginning of this competition the photos
have been great but her first photo was
her best photo so she's gone down a
little bit but the thing is with Oso is
also his Benin or top two every week
he's just been consistently serving us
good photos but as far as deciding
between Victoria and Oso I don't know I
have to pick the toy it
I don't agree out of this we're gonna be
flying people out here and they're gonna
be competing in the top two so this is
high this was a tough deliberation
obviously we went back and forth but I'm
glad you were here I think we have our
winner and we're gonna let him know as
far as Oso and Victoria goes I still
need them to convince me why they
deserve to take that other spot in our
top two so I think we should give them a
call
ie look at you honey you know I have to
don't wanna like you know whatever touch
it
I'm here with Isis from America's Next
Top Model the best I know we're all
going
hello sweetie how are you I'm great how
are you I'm doing wonderful now all
right so we were calling to tell you
that you won this week's challenge Oh
honestly Anthony your video and how
vulnerable you open yourself up to be it
was so amazing and the outfits the
backstory you involving your culture
into it like you did over and beyond oh
thank you and you provide so obviously
you're one of our top - that's gonna be
flown out here to LA you're already the
best yes I'm so excited to meet you
finally in person I'm just so excited
right now be ready on your toes alrighty
we'll see you okay bye oh my gosh I love
him now we're going to call Victoria and
see why she deserves to be one of our
top two because I'm not fully convinced
hi I'm here with Isis from America's
Next Top Model so beautiful but we are
calling to talk to you because with your
love yourself as is challenge it was a
beautiful picture but it wasn't as deep
and vulnerable as I wanted you to get
right now I'm just calling you what to
have you sell to me why you deserve to
be one of the top two in the finale show
okay well thank you for the feedback
first of all throughout the competition
I have challenged myself every single
time I feel I have push myself through
places where I'm not really comfortable
in I feel this competition is very
important the beauty part is perception
that the media has is very narrow it
doesn't reflect what real
I want to show people that they don't
have to change anything to feel
beautiful or to be represented in the
media so that's my my goal I feel like
that's what you guys are doing with this
thank you so much for picking up right
now and telling us all that it means a
lot thank you so much for calling me you
guys bad you look beautiful I love her I
know I mean not just because she
complimented me I already liked hers a
little bit more yeah so seeing her talk
about it I got interested to see what
I'm already I was already likely anymore
towards her I truly can say that I'm in
between now we're gonna give Oso a call
Hey hello I'm here with Isis from
America's Next Top Model
Hey hi I am good at you okay we're
calling you about your love yourself as
is challenge aesthetically I loved the
photo but when it came to the challenge
I was kind of confused at how that
picture represented you why this photo
you sent in in comparison to this
challenge to the photo in regards to
loving myself is because I feel like the
picture does represent me masculinity
can be something that's very taboo and
me wearing capes or me wearing things
that are very drapey can be very
controversial sometimes so I decided to
represent that by wearing a kimono
because you know I do be getting up in
the girls section but still the truth
and that's why I chose the disco ball
just choosing to be light that was my
main thing I really have come out of my
comfort zone through these challenges
with the first challenge and being bare
chested and wearing the turban and
putting glitter on my hair and wearing
makeup that isn't my norm but it's still
a new Liberty that I want to embrace of
myself I'm actually very vulnerable
because I'm doing all of that for a show
you know it's not something that's
personal and I'm doing for friends or
family that's something that I'm doing
and it's gonna be seen all righty
thank you so much oh so we're gonna be
giving you a call back shortly to let
you know what we decide of course see ya
bye bye
he's so adorable I know okay
they both presented very good cases for
them Victoria went into detail on whyphy
famous was important to her and then
also also turned around and gave us why
he turned in the photo that he did I
think for Victoria I really liked also
how she want to see the image of beauty
change and I think that it's beyond her
as bigger than her and I think also for
him they kind of said the same thing in
a way because he want to break the
stigma of being gay and masculinity they
both see this big picture which is what
I'm ultimately so proud of so how can I
sit here and say I'm gonna cut one of
them we had some tough decisions to make
but I think it's time to make the call
after me and Isis deliberated we're
letting you know you're gonna be in our
finale episode yes congratulations it
was a hard decision you know it's
getting really tough so next week you
have to like bring your a-game okay I
promise you I will keep it bye oh I'm
excited for you congratulations girl
thank you so much you guys you means so
much to me thank you so much girl we'll
see you bye bye now it's time to make
the final cold - oh so hey also hey so
we were calling first of all - thank you
so much for everything that you've done
so far you've been so amazing as far as
the season finale goes you're gonna be
at it
oh don't don't I need to do this right
now
so as far as moving forward we open this
up to three because they're supposed to
be on top to blood and decide it was
between you and someone else and we
really couldn't decide these other two
people are strong as people and I'm
gonna need you to come out here and be
you and be vulnerable and just be
everything that you can be because you
have some stiff competition
I was nervous yeah I've been anxious all
day all righty thank you so much and I'm
excited to meet you make sure you bring
it by I was not expecting that to be
emotional you can tell he's really gonna
be thankful yeah I feel really really
good about going into this season finale

decided to see what happens
