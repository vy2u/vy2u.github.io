make your presence known in the room
oh my nope
today we're in a literal haunted house
where someone has actually died in and
literally feel like I'm walking into my
desk guys this is where I die this is
how I hide when I first walked in the
house and my whole body said no I should
turn around and leave immediately
you know what you watch like American
Horror Story you're like those houses
don't exist it's just a sad props this
is literally looking at you like weird
like all the pictures looking at me
watch you step foot in this house and
you feel the lives that have been in
here and I can't believe people actually
died in this house I can't leave the
group by yourself at this point yeah
yeah I know we got each other we can't
we can't leave each other why am I here
so welcome to dr. Robert team wars home
he had this place built in 1929 it was
intended to house himself his wife his
second wife I might say this guy Artie
came here paddle wiper - had a side
piece or two he was known as like a ho
this guy was known to be a ho it
literally says on Wikipedia and his
collection of 55,000 birds I am deathly
afraid of birds so when I found out that
there were ones 55,000 birds both alive
and dead that wasn't really the most
exciting thing for me to hear that was
his most precious and valuable asset we
know that this is a room that dr. Moore
spent a lot of time in we have had
several people report having a deep
sense of presence here I have always
wanted to have a ghost encounter this
place is the first time that I've ever
felt like
something could happen so I have his
handwriting which feels special to me as
a matter of fact I almost feel like I'm
in love with him I call him Artie
there's a bookcase that actually moves
it's behind this one on the other side
it goes down and out completely off the
property I'm questioning the secret
passages in this house I never trust
those I was thinking he was hiding all
these women around everywhere you know
like letting people come in and out and
get to his room without walking through
other rooms he was an OG ho and I
respect it this was his room there was
just this like weird feeling of having
heart palpitations this place feels has
like a cold energy to it I don't like it
he died is relying October 30th 1958 his
wife died nine days later I have never
been able to find a record where he's
buried
I believe that he's buried here I
guarantee you there's a dead body
somewhere in this room right now I've
been looking for him since of 2012
because I feel an attachment and Pete
here
it's his skeleton somewhere in this
place I'm just sketched out have you
ever had any experiences in here it has
been reported to me that the woman and
the paint
what about her has moved it has moved
her head I won't say anything more about
that so you stay here mm-hmm
and you've never experienced anything
nothing I'm willing to share with any
walls I just say don't discount anything
cuz never know you might anger the wrong
spirit if you don't believe in it you
will find whatever it is that you're
looking for here
oh no or nothing yeah we're about to go
model with some potentially evil ghost
hello keep freaking out but I gotta keep
my head in the game I'm ready to do this
so my idea for this shoot was 60s with a
modern twist the owner of the house died
around that era so hopefully he'll feel
comfortable and want to reach out the
thing that will be the hardest for them
is modeling while being scared number
one and there will be a lot of things
going on we have a ghost hunter I'm
Joshua Hammond the founder of a Modelo
paranormal I've had a few odd readings
walking through the house I would love
to get interactions start to say like
yes this is me me and Christy are
probably the most similar in the fact
that we try to make jokes to cover up
our fear what is ice beneath is it a
cool already been yelled at for opening
doors I'm not supposed to
I love trolling people and scaring them
and so far everyone is really angry
sissy is a hundred percent internalizing
all her fear I can see it on her face
sheridan has been the most jumpy of
anyone pablo was holding a rosary for
his dear life so pretty much everyone's
in a bad place I'm here for them that's
so big or not I'm not here for them
so I'm modeling in the bedroom where he
died you know when you walk into a room
and you feel like nothing but I walked
into this room and I felt something so
I'm in the bedroom and I'm gonna keep it
on this back painting because apparently
the paint you don't shut that door
apparently this painting moves it's
weird because like I don't feel
completely welcome
I have EMF readers which er is
electromagnetic field detector I have a
thermal-imaging camera if something were
to randomly hit and I would be able to
say okay that could be paranormal I know
this was the owners room so if Artie is
here is there any chance you could light
up the meter kind of come interact with
it
like tell us how you feel about us being
in your room I'm legit like staring this
thing down so so when we were trying to
communicate Josh was asking a whole
bunch of questions and I was like nah
man just leave them alone maybe make
your presence known in the room you know
knock on a wall or make some kind of
noise
now that we've shut some of the lights
off do you feel a little more
comfortable interacting hey mr. ghost do
they like being called goes I mean it
depends like I feel for this man in some
sort of way because I'm in his bedroom
and he was a ho so I'm like hose
represents alright so if there were
multiple people women in here give us
this
I like this I don't feel normal
if that makes sense I know nothing said
that it was going on
but I don't feel like this is just a
normal room that I'm like okay to be in
right now I'm gonna try to be here so
I'm gonna try to stay focused I'm not
too comfortable in there and with
modeling you have to be comfortable I
realize that may see the photographer
kind of set me up to mimic the woman in
the picture behind me like I don't know
it felt a little too real the pub looks
like a place that's someone I say this
so often I hear footsteps right now
don't like it the prof eels like a place
where someone got murdered I'm gonna say
it I think someone got killed via for
some reason I keep getting drawn to that
room and I don't know what it is there
energy in there is like welcoming but I
like in a scary way and it's like come
in and then I'm gonna trap you in here I
never let you leave I'm not trying to
speak to it ghosts today my mother
taught me better she gave me this dollar
store rosary and it's gonna protect me
from anything that happens today so
we're in the bar right now we're about
to see if there's any phenomena if
there's anyone here with us right now
they would like to interact maybe want
to step up the bar have a drink I got
our bartender right here we asked the
ghost to knock and well I didn't ask it
cuz I don't want it to know my name who
I am or follow me like on Twitter
anything so
what it was nice doing all of you tell
my mom I love her I don't like this
eventually like knocked every time
something was inside the walls and if
you watched horror movies like I do a
lot it's always in the walls the
wall
I knew going in that Pablo is really
freaked out by this whole experience so
until knocky knocky on the wall oops
sorry pops I've never modeled with the
ghost before but I can't imagine it's
great they mainly shoot not only in the
pub that had the most activity but
there's a freaking gate out there that
just leads to nowhere and they're like
Pablo get next to the gate and
just stand there we're about to shoot
outside a place I didn't want to go
today it feels like a horror movie and I
hate everyone something enticing about
like getting a photo shoot on won't
being scared I think the ghost brought
my best self out I won't do whatever
again but I can say that I did it once
and I did it well Chrissy and I had been
did a photo shoot together in the
hallway what I don't like is this
why I was like okay what is the vibe
here I don't think it's good if
something thermal appeared in this damn
here I would have run I'm creeped out my
game plan tonight is like not have a
diamond go inside my body and like look
hot
good ask questions and see if we can get
them to interact okay like this what
should we ask it are you HOT like
physically Chrissy was a little bit more
into speaking to whatever spirits were
around us that I was out there please
give us a sign and light this bad way up
we're here for you just want to chill
with your cool spirit
sir madam I don't care what gender you
are I love you I'm a curious person by
nature which in horror movies means that
you die I'm also maybe an asshole I'm
not asking for a job I would
love a knock
we have this big creaking air behind us
so yourself a lot of spirits within this
house cool hot tip there's pizza here
and if you come to this for yay you
might get a little slice - slice II of
some pepperoni pizza maybe ghost can't
eat sue me that's mean now we're bribing
that goes why is it so red right there
he pointed the heat sensor to the wall
and he's like oh it's fine just because
we turned the lights off and it just
keeps the heat in and I'm like I'm not
convinced truly am NOT I think that why
I'm shaking for some reason maybe we
should like open the closet Oh like that
at all that real do I hate this there
any ghosts in the closet would you like
to come out of the closet the reading
was interesting because the thermal
meter thing something is here yeah it's
like no warm-up sigh I know it's very
cold no a nighttime why would there be
warm this here I kept on saying
something like out this window oh
modeling with Jasmine it's always really
fun she meets me like forget that I'm in
a haunted house so that's good I
really love how the photo turned out
because it's totally inspired by The
Shining witch hello is a creepy
house in the middle of nowhere the rich
should happen this for my solo shot I
went into this purple and blue bathroom
which happened to be the bathroom of
where the owner's wife died I don't know
if she died in the bathroom but she
definitely did somewhere in the vicinity
of the bathroom he didn't even look like
myself in the photo I just really felt
like I was in a different time I'm not
gonna lie my heart has been racing along
I'm apparently modeling in the place
where a lot of the birds were kept
walking into the room I felt pretty okay
until we decided it would be a good idea
to get a sense of the ghosts presence I
feel like these things can sense fear so
I wanted to be like oh I'm very strong
and badass don't come near me cuz I'll
 you up if Robert Timor is here
anywhere could he may become interact
say hi all you should have to be able to
do is just kind of touch that I have
never been so nervous
as I was when he was asking questions
there's anyone besides Robert here could
you maybe trying to interact with the
device I don't want to feel a breeze I
don't want to feel anything rub up
against me is there anything you wanted
to ask I'm not sure why he didn't talk
to me maybe just cause like good sense
that I was like uh-uh not tonight
I'm just hoping nothing pops out I don't
feel anything I'm sterile kind of scary
and if you're gonna die in the Haunted
Mansion tripping and tumbling down the
stairs seems like a pretty normal way to
go no you can't let go since you're here
you gotta like everything's okay I am
very thankful walked into the room I was
like I'm gonna bring a really good
energy
she didn't say anyone died in the room
but she also didn't say anyone didn't
die so I sit down and the vibe is like
really quiet very chill everyone's
really tired so we're just gonna try and
like ask questions and try and get
interaction okay cool there anyone here
that would like to interact with us you
can touch the meter on the table here
and just being light it up
it goes from green to red like
immediately
and I'm just like Oh Robert well done
did anyone else like it lit up like this
for most other like him though could you
light it up again to confirm it with you
Oh God I have very like a good respect
for all things paranormal like you go do
your room I'll do mine
I promise you I didn't do anything wrong
I thought for a second that it may have
been my grandma which I was hoping for
because her spirit follows me everywhere
god bless her shoulder she's amazing
just make sure that I didn't bring a
beer back from Arizona if you're not my
grandma and light it up sissy thinks
she's speaking to her grandmother out
there but I think we both know that girl
that angel grandma so are you the one
that died in upstairs
just one more direct yes asking
questions and questions and questions
and continuously the light is going from
green straight to read from green
straight to yellow is your body here
inside of the house
yeah talking to a spirit the more my
heart just beat it faster and faster
because I was having a conversation with
something not of this world I don't want
to piss Robert off like that's never my
intention I hope you know that okay
Robert we're gonna do a shoot and I'm
gonna leave it's gonna be fine I just
had to sit on a very throne-like chair
and this looked kind of took over and I
did my fiercest looks but I could
possibly do at the back of my nose like
a wonder and Robert and watching me am I
making some proud because his house and
I don't want to just respect it I feel
like
I think that this opened up a world for
me that I want to know more about this
was definitely an experience like I'm
not walking away from this being like
just another day at work like no this
was something and I felt things more
than meets the eye when it comes to this
haunted house and there's more than
meets the eye than just the people that
are in this room I hope it stays here
don't bring it back with me walking
around I hope I'm good can we be done
now I'm good let's cut this is big nope
and I'm gone I'm gone
so creepy out here oh I just
thought a rock was a demon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
