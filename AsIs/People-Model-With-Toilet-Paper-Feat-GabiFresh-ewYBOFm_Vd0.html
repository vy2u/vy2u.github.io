these people is about to become feed
famous last week the competitors had to
show us their best unboxing photos
Anthony crushed it by dressing up like a
little mermaid and did amazing he won
the challenge for the week
unfortunately rosey didn't quite make
the cut and we had to say goodbye to her
now we're down to our top four
competitors and here they are hi
everyone Vicky's hips Meghan hey it's
Anthony I'm also whole other week that
you got to see my face I cannot believe
it's our third week already these past
couple of weeks have been amazing I've
had so much fun oh my god I can't tell
you guys how much fun I had doing our
unboxing challenge
I'm loving not knowing what's coming
next and I'm just having a good time the
unboxing challenge it was hard because I
couldn't get my idea down and it was
hard trying to incorporate all the
things into one photo so I'm just gonna
go into this week how I've been going in
like literally going in
so with challenge number two I thought
it was a lot better than I did with my
first week challenge I'm ready to just
give it my all this week looking forward
to know what this challenge is all right
Mike Missy does pass now let's meet our
syllabus judge for the week not only
does she have over 600,000 Instagram
followers she has her own swimwear line
and co-founded a plus-size brand called
Prem which we are both wearing today
let's welcome to get me fry thank you so
much for being here thanks for having me
tonight it yes thanks first I would say
let's go good at it yeah bring your ring
is happening
this week's challenge was our hashtag
not sponsored challenge this is what we
sent the competitors hello
competitors and welcome to this week's
challenge video you've probably seen a
whole bunch of people selling a bunch of
random all over your feeds weight-loss
team make up teeth whitening
literally anything brand partnerships
are essential to being a social media
star because let's be real we got to
make our money this week your challenge
is hashtag not sponsored you're going to
have to make a fake hashtag ad about
toilet paper now you need to sell me
this main toilet paper why do I want it
why do I need it why do I have to have
this in my life not only will you be
sending me a pic modeling the toilet
paper but I also need a video of your
hashtag ad you are all being sent the
same script and you have to say it in
one take we know that money makes the
feed go round so let's try to be as
natural as we can in these ads and
remember you can only use your phones
toilet paper interesting choice yeah I
wanted you here in the first place
because not only are you you but you
have brands behind you you have creme
you have your swimsuit line so you're
used to having to at least sell things
for sure but also be yourself I think
that's the main part of doing
sponsorships is making sure you still
have your entirety and are yourself and
our casual and people can still connect
with you and it doesn't feel like a
commercial I'm hoping our contestants
can bring that so this week we're
judging our competitors on three
categories composition authenticity and
feed worthiness composition is gonna be
like technical like framing even less
one take did they use good while often
ticinese at are they staying themselves
totally and then feed worthiness would
we buy into this would be scroll past
got it I think all three of those things
kind of play into each other it's you
like if you have great composition and
authenticity you're gonna get that
double tax right
I think authenticity though is the thing
I'm looking for the mode our first
competitor this week that were
watches oh so oh so last week almost one
missed it by a hair but has sent some
pretty authentic very himself pictures
so I'm hoping that's what we're gonna
get this week I'm so happy this week is
the not sponsored chat age memorizing
lines I'm good
one tape y'all playin with me really
don't know what I've been doing with
this load paper we couldn't sell salt I
could have been so baby boy
mother jazz is now playing no she's not
but you know what joke's on y'all cause
I'm ready ready hands down I'm gonna try
to kill it
toilet paper is a basic necessity but
when your feed famous nothing in your
life can be basic that's why I use
toilet paper here it's versatile fun and
glam no social media star should have to
use anything that is involved and
luxurious that's why I can't live
without my toilet I kind of loved it I
kind of did to backlit the whole time
when I didn't love but also that made a
little more realistic and a little more
authentic cuz it looked real like he was
just hanging out in his bathroom so in
some ways I think that actually connects
better to the audience yes
composition wines like you said I think
it could have been lit a little bit
better definitely but I do like his one
angle go to the second I love that
little turn yeah great he's feeling a
little frog it was a movement it felt
realistic yeah instead of just being
like still go ahead and separate
authenticity I mean this is my first
time saying oh so but he seems super
authentic and that to me is what really
intrigued me and made me want to buy
what he was selling yes I loved it I
loved it a lot and then feed worthiness
I think I would honestly buy it because
I loved his authenticity so much yeah I
love the sunglasses that he's wearing
sunglasses another toilet paper is
wearing sunglasses hilarious yes but I
do think it's a little to overproduce
when you over produce and you have
something sponsored it just reads it's
too corporate
you're right yeah that's when you do
this now we have Victoria Victoria won
our challenge number one and then the
second challenge she did decently
Victoria always brings it though so I'm
hoping she like one over and beyond
awesome let's see
hello everyone Vickie here this week our
challenge is I stuck not sponsored I was
feeling very confident very excited then
I was a video and I was like oh my god
um like selling toilet paper you guys
why why I don't all things how how am I
gonna sell toilet paper oh my god
weather paper I think this is the
hardest challenge yet I am NOT excited I
think that the best thing I can do is
create a dress or a skill with the
toilet paper yay
I'm selling toilet paper but I'm also
selling fashion I have to find a
location to shoot it in that screams
glamour my focus now it's to try to make
it as Vickie as possible
Wow I'm already sure I love it
toilet paper is a basic necessity but
when you're famous
it's fun
no social medias
that's why I can leave without my Tony
Wow no kind of mind-blowing that was so
creative to make it into a dress that
was a really great way to make it cool
and if you notice in the video she had
two that were like bedazzled definitely
put some work into that video for sure
alright composition wise different that
she's in public doing this stuff I can
take pictures you need to have a bravery
to do that because it's part of the job
the only little criticism I would give
is I wish it was more of a quieter place
so I could agree yeah the sound wasn't
great authenticity it's weird because
like she was playing someone else that
was the hard part for me yeah I do think
as long as it means it's like kind of
ironic and funny exactly then it works
and I really like the fact that she's
selling something as basic as that paper
and she like totally took it their feed
worthiness I would definitely save this
or I would definitely like it and I
would have an extend it to a few friends
yeah I've been with this girl girl baby
oh yeah she made a dress insane
I would've toilet gray and it looked
good so good Wow next is affinity last
week divinity had a beautiful picture
like mirror water fountain and
divinities also like very herself very
like vulnerable but strong if it's love
so I'm excited to see what she's great
hello everybody this is the hashtag I'm
sponsored challenge cuz we're getting
paid to do this in real life you are and
I only do we have to shoot a video but
we have to do a video and just one take
I'm very nervous I'm the queen of a
thousand tanks like right now and I'm
already on take two hundred and twenty
five attacks right now I fumble over my
words all the time I'm on this shouldnÃ­t
see this one's talking about I read
somewhere if you write something down
you're more likely to remember it
slightly papers it's the basic necessity
I am very like it is a chance wait are
you on camera or show how I really can't
do on camera it's like Russian runway
right now I'm officially nervous for
this one
toilet paper is a basic necessity but
when your feed famous nothing in your
life can be basic that's why I use
toilet paper it's versatile it's fun
it's glam no social media stars should
ever have to use anything that's not
bold and luxurious that's why I can't
live without my toilet paper first of
all I'm not over how gorgeous he is I
mean you know what I'm talking about
yeah it's like her intro video was so
funny you know I walk that ticking so
good and I was so excited to see her
actual concert video and then it fell
flat for me I agree I was a little
underwhelmed composition wise the
lighting was great it was just a basic
like 1yj looked well done and it looked
very familiar like it looked like most
youtube videos but I think it's actually
a good thing again yeah it just it
wasn't anything special yeah I agree
when it comes to authenticity it was
hard because I think she's more fun than
that it just felt very sponsored which
is like what we're trying to get away
from right this way for feed worthiness
I think it was just okay I honestly feel
like divinity herself would delete this
later right eye is really really really
connected with her and then I was so
disappointed in her video so yeah I
think I would just grow past our last
competitor of the day is Anthony he won
last week's challenge
turned himself into a beautiful like
mermaid goddess yes I am really having a
lot of high hopes my high expectations
now so hopefully he brings it let's hope
chase and thingy and then Phenom sponsor
challenge and live from my bathroom
stall I'm gonna go into this challenge
really stoked really happy and trying to
step outside the box like try to push
myself even further trying to sell
something but I'm really not confident
in trying to say it in all in one take I
know it's gonna take a while
kind of like muscle memory but with the
head so memorizing it basically I'm
gonna add some spice and try to make it
my own but I'm confident slashing stone
toilet I don't know you were the one
that said that you wanted to get spicy
food girl let me call you back
I said let me call you back hi hello
it's me again you're not just sitting
here cleaning on my inside I love it
about what you are doing wrong and no
it's not your eyebrows this time it's
about toilet paper you know sure the
paper is a basic necessity but when your
feet famous nothing in your life can be
basic that's why I use toilet puppy em
excuse me while I'm professional guide
you back to Italy white brick it's
versatile fun angle and the like neat
little bit debit you need no social
media star sure have seen anything that
is emotive luxurious that's why I can
live without much order to puppy air
I love for you to stay and chat but I've
got some cleaning up to do so choose
toilet puppy air and cleans your so you
can be
wait I'm all died gosh I feel like
that's so on Branford it's amazing I
feel like it was 100% him even though it
wasn't him
I just loved that he was the first
influence her to really embrace the
challenge and make toilet paper what it
is I thought was hilarious
also he elevated it to make it funny and
cool I totally agree composition wise
it's funny because he was so made-up but
I feel like everything around him being
just like natural lighting like it works
yeah when it comes to authenticity no I
mean I don't even know him but I could
tell that was yeah I mean he was
performing but in a self-aware way yeah
I didn't love that he was really using
tissue and not paper it was weird but I
was still like okay yeah you know the
one thing that kind of detracted I agree
feed worthiness yeah like it everybody
would buy em you know and to my friends
would double top yo area it was
beautiful that's good everyone really
brought it this week it made me so happy
but unfortunately we need to pick out
who's the winner and who's being kicked
off so our first person is Anthony
Anthony killed it this week I just
really loved how he took the talent
seriously but also made it light-hearted
and fun he was the only one to actually
be in a bathroom and using the actual
product which is whipping works and
added his own gas quote exactly he
embellished the script and made it more
funny and like it just worked it was
great it was great
divinity is she looks beautiful she
looked beautiful in the whole thing but
it just fell a little bit short yeah the
actual challenge is about sponsorship
and selling something it didn't work for
me yeah okay so Victoria so good she put
herself out there she was in Gaelic in
toilet paper it takes a lot to do that
someone who disposes in normal clothes I
can't imagine what it was like posing
that toilet paper guy Seuss was in
between to me of paying like authentic
but being a little bit too commercially
for me yeah it was a little
tongue-in-cheek which is like did it
translated but then it kind of crossed
over sometimes into two failed men yeah
yeah yeah not the strong yes I think
he's in like the lower half
our top four so our top two and zan and
Victoria I really love what Victoria did
but I know what you have strong feelings
for Anthony I mean I just really loved
how authentic he came off and I think he
embraced the challenge so much Victoria
was great too though
I'm on the fence looking at everything
as a whole I think we know who the
winner is
