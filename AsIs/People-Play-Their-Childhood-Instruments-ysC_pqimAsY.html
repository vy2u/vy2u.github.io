even seen or touched an oboe I haven't
played the clarinet
since the eighth grade so that's like I
think I played in like seventh grade two
light years ago I have not played the
trombone since about halfway through my
senior year of high school I hope my
piano teacher doesn't see this video
because she's not gonna be happy with me
mr. violin it looks smaller than I
remember it all smells like the 7:00
news I just made a mess but I forgot
that I liked this taste it's just like
candy
so I guess I'm supposed to play this so
I'm already looking at this and I've
forgotten every single note again I
haven't played this in 13 years I'm so
nervous
I want to say this starts on an a is it
a even a note
oh my god my mind is blown nostalgia
bomb
I don't know I'm trying to find this I
actually feel a tad bit emotional I was
as bad as I am now as I was then oh I
feel like I'm back to my ten year old
self again it brought back a lot of
middle school and high school anxiety
about not being good at it and not
practicing hard enough I think it's cool
that the millions of potentially useless
things you learn as a child you can
still pick up later I would like to play
an instrument again take up on the
ukulele cuz that's what tiny chicks are
doing these days right and singing about
pineapples would I go back probably not
but if you gave me an oboe I wouldn't be
opposed to whipping it out of parties to
you know scare people so yeah I think
that I learned a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
