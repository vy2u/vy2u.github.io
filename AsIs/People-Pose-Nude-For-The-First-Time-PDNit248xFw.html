somebody tells you picture everybody in
their underwear it was the opposite of
that and I was naked and not in my
underwear there's a nice breeze if you
know what I mean is it too late back out
I'm gonna dive in swim swim in the pool
with all with all the big kids naked all
right
my name is Luiz I'm Annie and I'm about
to pose nude for the first time it's
definitely out of my comfort zone I've
been losing tons of sleep over this I
definitely have a love not quite hate
relationship with my body since I was a
kid I've been like the big kid living in
today's world you are constantly
reminded that there are other people out
there with perfect bodies I think I'll
feel really empowered after doing this I
may have a boner
I may not let's find out I'll see you
when I'm naked she went in first the
nerves are kicking in I was just telling
myself this is your body just work it
have fun with it I got into the groove
of it there was no judgment in that room
all right they're calling me in I gotta
go but we'll see how this goes
all right this actually feels very
liberating
that's it that was pretty crazy just
having 12 or so people doing a half
circle all around you staring at you
naked this was totally like a wiener
versus brain battle that day I felt like
I almost had like a reverse boner Oh
oh my gosh this turned out beautiful I
like this one a lot after doing this I
think my relationship with my body is
definitely a lot better I look at these
pictures and I look at the parts of me
that sometimes I have issues with they
obviously don't see it the way I do and
that's just really nice to know yeah I
think I'm really beautiful and I have no
reason not to love myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
