I love fashion
I think it is something that you can
definitely like describe yourself
through it is something that can make
you unique I watch a lot of runway shows
but you're not going to see my body type
which is sort of like short like little
squares when you see yourself a lot in
the media that's a message to you that
your body is acceptable that your body
is ideal and so to not see yourself it
makes you feel like other or alien high
fashion and the fashion industry it's
creating this image of you know
something to aspire to and when you see
someone there that like you that
connects with you in a deeper level and
makes you feel like you can be someone
definitely little nervous these BuzzFeed
videos man you see a lot of girls with
not a lot of clothes on and I know how -
it feels right now
I am scared I'm living her I'm
definitely nervous but I could really
get behind the idea of like switching
like gender roles I feel like like I'm
constantly preaching that you know
people should use their privilege to
help you know people that don't have
that privilege so I mean it's kind of a
small step but any way that I can use my
privilege I'm always like excited too we
need to shift the narrative of what
society or the images that are pushed
out into the current media about who we
are as people of color who we are as
women who we are as just human beings I
love the product image that we will be
recreating it's funny because I look at
the image and I immediately thought
these should be ethnic women I'm excited
for it
they're very stone-faced I typically
smile a lot like when I like get serious
it's kind of scary so I don't really
like to be that but I think it'll show
off like a more fierce side of me you
kind of perpetuate this idea that
there's one way to look in order to be
considered beautiful and that's just not
the case at all I think that you know
you have women of color you have trans
women you have trans women of color you
have like all of these diverse people
who are all beautiful in their own way
as a trans woman growing up no I did not
see very many positive representation of
trans women if anything I only have seen
negative representations if I see one
that looks like me that has the same
hair same like image I feel like already
you have me I'm like okay like those
pants look cute on her they look cute on
me today I'll be recreating a Chanel ad
I think that fashion is art that we wear
so I think the purpose of clothing is to
represent the self so you wear the shirt
because you think it says something
about X Y or Z about you I also think
that fashion upholds our like gender and
body ideals ads are so ubiquitous in our
everyday it's impossible not to take
something away from them and not to have
it like imprint itself on your mind I've
definitely seen the mark wahlberg calvin
klein image dude is ripped like crazy
ripped I mean
me be probably like took like a couple
of months to get that body together the
gesture of grabbing your nuts I mean I
kind of do that by default it's
definitely bravado very masculine very
not giving a I'm kind of excited to
be posing in my underwear I was always
you know the naked roommate I absolutely
think that there should be more pregnant
women in ads for things other than sort
of like baby or maternity related things
because it's something that is very
natural and happens all the time and
like as a pregnant woman
I don't like stop wanting to feel sexy
the second that like there's a baby
growing in my room remember telling my
mom growing up like you know the
prettiest Asian person wouldn't compare
to the ugliest white person like because
that's all I saw in the media is I only
saw like Asians as nerds or like just
really minor characters that weren't
important to the story there needs to be
more diversity not just with black
models but models of all cultures and
also more trans models there are so many
out there I'm like an in-between II
which is like half plus-size not really
straight size and I never really saw
anybody like that especially latina I
haven't ever looked at like an underwear
ad and thought that I saw myself but I
think that's because like I already
could just see me rocking them anyway so
I was just like okay like I'm not there
but I'm gonna be there someday people
are finding their voices and people are
realizing that they're deserving of
representation and of beauty if there's
one thing I could tell big fashion
companies it would be please hire more
girls who look like me or look like the
other girls who are out on the street
instead of just one type in ethnicity
and body type because I feel like we
need to be represented to
I think that the world is already a very
beautiful place but I often wonder how
would make people feel mentally if they
saw themselves more if they're
represented more I know that when I saw
myself I was practically moved to tears
it's not just one face that's looking at
these magazine covers it's plenty of
different diverse faces who come from
different backgrounds and that's
important that it's represented more and
more the more visible that I am when it
comes to my identity I think the more
that it reaches an audience that are
like me and are inspired by seeing me
automatically like when I look at the
Mark Wahlberg picture I was just like
admiring like the hard work that went
into the body rather than like wanting
that body if that makes sense it's a
rarity that you like I don't know see
half a naked dude in a fully clothed
woman it's usually the opposite of that
so it made me like just think about how
like a woman would feel you know doing
what I just did which happens all the
time this is that black girl magic and
full effect and it does and I don't have
to be in a dress with a pressing curl
you know I'm saying I can rock these
locks I don't have to have on a whole
bunch of eyelashes and stuff and 35
weeks pregnant and I'm working today you
know so I think normalizing pregnancy is
just like another part of everyday life
is really important to a young trans
girl or anyone in general who wants to
follow their dreams and feel like they
don't see themselves I would tell you
that sometime you have to break that
mold sometime you have to be the first
person and don't look for someone to
tell you that it's okay or your valid go
out there and break down those walls and
do it yourself the world is all shapes
all sizes all everything it's not just
one thing so yes inclusivity completely
matters in life because that's what you
see in real life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
