I hate to admit it but I'm like very
much growing into my mom's shoes we're
both very empathetic we read that you're
like having a bad day you're gonna try
to solve something for you my mom and I
are really close we've never really
fought but we are very different when
she goes shopping for me she looks for
the ugliest thing she can find and she
buys it for me because she knows I'll
like it my mom kind of takes care of the
like survival aspects howdy eatin have
you slept enough my mom and I aren't
that similar so our conversations tend
to be short I'm not super close in this
photo my mom is rocking some really cool
earrings and she's holding my brother
the best part is her hair she has long
hair down to her butt and she's got this
cute little flick oh situation the photo
is my mom when she was 25 which is how
old I am right now and I think she was
at work and she was just talking on the
phone and whoever took the photo I was
just like hey and she turned and they've
captured this candid photo she used to
play volleyball
they had a photo shoot so she's like
posing with the ball she's about to
serve it and it just looks really badass
I want to recreate this picture of my
mom holding my brother because it's just
a beautiful portrait if I were to
replicate her style I could really see
how similar we look and I know she would
love it through showing her this photo I
hope to learn more about who she was as
a person then she had such a brilliant
life before she became my mom
this photo is only a small snippet of it
my mom's name is Lola this also goes by
Lully her favorite job is taking care of
my nephews my mom loves music when you
wake up on a Saturday morning and you
hear chyann like in full blast you know
it's gonna be cleaning day when I moved
to New York away from California we grew
much closer it was also at the time that
I came out and was like fully supported
and embraced I'm always here for her and
she's always there for me my mom is
amazing her name is Debbie she lives in
Pittsburgh which is where I grew up
she's an accountant she's really
compassionate and always tries to see
every perspective of things my mom has
always been very stylish definitely
dresses a little bit more casual now
than she used to but she definitely had
she made me a scarf a couple months ago
that was bright pink and I was like why
did you make this for me mom she'll
probably be really embarrassed that this
photo is gonna be put on the internet
she's probably just gonna laugh she has
a great sense of humor and we're just
gonna make fun of each other my mom's
name is going Zoo and she was born in
Beijing China currently she works out of
high school as a cafeteria worker she
used to be a doctor I don't know a whole
lot about her life in China people need
her style almost that makes me so wish
that I could see that see her starting
down the street you would like
confidence since I don't know that much
about my mom when she was growing up I'm
hoping this photo can help me learn a
little bit about the person that she was
oh my god I feel like my mom has a very
like stoic look Wow my hair is so
beautiful I really look like my mom oh
my god I do really feel like I'm in the
sci-fi movie I'm cute regardless because
I have my mom's jeans I'm gonna send my
mom the photo and then call her so we
can hear her reaction
hello Amazon you can turn it off you
know it's just like what you're wearing
I'm so grateful to have like such a
supportive and loving mom that's pretty
much exactly how I thought she would
react she would laugh and tell me that I
look stupid so after we took this photo
I actually had a conversation with my
mom just about like how she grew up and
like I felt so good coming out of it for
me it was a beautiful experience because
I knew that the activity or the process
of my mom going through all of these
beautiful memories from her past was
like a very positive experience my mom
definitely looks way better than I do in
this look it's definitely her look I
gave it a try but she invented it even
with our broken vocabulary it's still
very much possible to exchange stories
and like learn from
another as long as our patient and then
compassionate well I want to go home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
