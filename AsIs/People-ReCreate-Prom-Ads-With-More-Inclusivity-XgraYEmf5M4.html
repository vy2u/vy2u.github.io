went to prom in 2010 I reused my sweet
16 dress because it was red and puffy
and my princessy thing that I really
wanted to go for and I was like I'm
gonna save money so as a kid I competed
a lot of piano competitions so I'd
always need formal wear for that so I
just reward my piano gowns I went to
prom three years in a row I was a very
hot commodity even though I didn't make
out with anybody my first two years I
wore dresses and in my final year I went
in a tux I didn't think that I saw
myself in the prom ads at all I'm curvy
like I'm a thick girl so like you
probably did not see any of that
everyone else in my class would go to
this one store where all the dresses
were super super long like four very
tall skinny people going to prom was
almost like following cooking recipe
you're doing all the right moves and
parts and pieces today we're gonna be
working with a celebrity stylist who's
going to be picking a 20-18
dress that matches our personal
aesthetic and we're going to be spicing
up these basic as prom looks because
lord knows they need some help so let's
go get glammed the up y'all I think
the reason why I want to recreate this
prom mat today is because I feel that so
many people feel that their clothing is
a shackle and not necessarily an
extension of their freedom of expression
and most of these prom ads you see white
tall skinny beautiful girls and I am
Chinese very petite stock photos are
more diverse than these products I don't
know where they're going with it if you
can find a good meme with different
ethnicities and like body shaves then
you can pull a prom at I
typically don't wear dresses in this ad
you'll see me wearing a dress but I want
to wear it just to let people know that
I can and that I'm still gonna be okay
and I can walk out the door and feel
free the clothing doesn't own me and
neither does society for the same reason
why a lot of Asian folks want to see
Asian characters and TV
shows and movies we want to see
ourselves represented not just in the
professions that people assume that we
have but in anything that we participate
in and prom is very much a
quintessential American experience I
want to see myself represented in prom
ads and I imagine like other young Asian
girls do as well there are so many black
girls and so many thick girls that are
underrepresented they just need that
type of focus then that type of
spotlight so if we can do that that
would be great when people see the
finished photo today I really hope that
they see the possibilities for
themselves and I really want people to
see that they can be validated and loved
no matter what they wear
I definitely think 18 year old me would
want to see someone who has the pixie
haircut or shaved head that's the other
thing with prom ads is that all the
girls have super long hair they look
like princesses I hope that they see
themselves but also fabulous in this and
glamor and the magic of prom because you
only have one if you're going to prom
and you've spent four years hiding who
you are or you feel like you've been
pushing yourself down or holding back
this is the time to let go my hope for
this video and recreating this ad is
that somebody else sees this and it's
like I can have colored hair and cut it
how I want and wear whatever I want to
prom that makes me feel the most me and
the most confident that I can possibly
be because problem is supposed to be
about you this is marking a time in your
life it's almost like a big party to
celebrate the fact that you're about to
be a legal adult free to go out into the
world and be who you want to be I
absolutely love my outfit I feel like so
confident it's like so amazing I want to
actually revive like Mariah Carey Vegas
look or some indifferent I'm
wearing boxers under it so I feel great
like I have a secret I like the fact
that it's shiny big fan of shiny the
slit it's a lot of leg for someone who
just is you know discovering puberty I
feel like a space Queen
love it somebody said space hooker so
either one of those
Queen by day hooker and I know who does
this in real life who does this who
walks around and suddenly is like oh
geez I forgot something oh good thing
I'm wearing this dress because I look
good the three of us we all have
different styles and starting small is
starting at all hard to change the whole
entire thing at one time but just being
here with these amazing people and
seeing them so confident I really do
feel like we made something that we
should be seeing more of you should have
a good time like that should
just be your one aim wear whatever you
want it doesn't have to be any of these
things yeah it could be tee shirt and
like shorts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
