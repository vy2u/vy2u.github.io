my favorite holidays for a really long
time my grandmother made this Dalmatian
costume for me I remember look being
like crazy into the Ninja Turtles I was
a nerd my headless do you too holding
his head when I was about 4 or 5 I was
really obsessed with dogs I would call
my dog my brother sometimes when you're
in high school you kind of get pressured
to dress a little bit more provocative
Halloween is a time to like have fun my
sister has a bone disease and this was
like the last Halloween for like a
couple of years because she was in like
a body cast sort of bittersweet to look
back at this picture and see this
fragment of my past I'm not a what you
would call a crafty gay all right here's
one the crutch clothes hanger combo I
have to compress my my afro wouldn't be
surprised if my mom had like never seen
the Ninja Turtles and just like looked
it up on I don't even know what you
would look things up on back then I'm
just now imagining what it was like for
my grandma to sit here and cut out all
of these the costume all comes down to
the quality of the trench coat it's
looking okay proper sloppiness it's like
a dad sweater for sure oh okay so the
ones that stand out with it this is
really tricky oh it's in it look like a
shell oh there's still so much space to
cover that feels right okay these are
like indestructible the next Halloween
they just took this outfit and turned it
into a cow outfit that even like
remotely and everybody
thank that's right can you face pain a
beard this does not look like a nose I
don't know why I have a dot on my nose I
look like a mouse one Galland is like
just like oozing out of this week but
the pose I feel like in my my mom's
dress pants and my dad's work shirt I'm
even wearing like white shoes like I was
then my hands hanging down here kind of
screw up the whole effect I would rock
this again it's cool cuz it just makes
me want to call my friend like I'm
remembering like living in that house
and going trick-or-treating with my
cousin but they all have like their own
kids now I'm super thankful for all of
the little things that my grandma did
for me Halloween is a fun time to
remember your childhood
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah hmm you don't know the
half of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
