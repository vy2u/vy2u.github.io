what reminds me of being young and full
of confidence
it feels relaxing and comfortable known
like home I have had this bear all my
life from the moment I was born it was
put in the bassinet with me it kind of
brings home to you ready yeah oh this is
so embarrassing
I'm very embarrassed showing showing
this right now like I can barely like
look look at anybody they both look
really old
yes Oh cute friends but there are like
small holes and all the edges because I
was just like rub it like I just rubbed
the silky so I used to cry into his paws
actually some like the thread came off
oh no I know look at peaches like
she's missing an eyeball or baby our dog
got ahold of this and
ripped it up the back and the stuffing
came out and she had to fix it so
there's a big seam I remember asking my
mom why some of her fur is gone and she
told me it's because as a child I used
to like bite and rip it off I'm just
really happy and proud that I could pass
this along to my daughter it's kind of
why I held onto it for as long as I did
a sentimental Ness and also just like
this office of the fur and the look of
it like you can't find anything like
this I'm an adult I like live my life I
live in my own apartment pay my own
bills so when I have it I'm like oh
there was the time when I didn't and I
was you know this with my little baby so
parents don't throw away your kids go
ahead do it
they won't thank you for it later
my mother washed puppy Lupita's fur my
to my chair and I never forgave her I
never would me too
oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
