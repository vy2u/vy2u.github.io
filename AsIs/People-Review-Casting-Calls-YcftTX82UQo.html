were saying like oh this role is for a
white woman only but it was kind of like
this role is for a ravishingly beautiful
girl and that in a coded way meant that
it wasn't for me do your friends
describe you as a hot latina mom
obviously even go so far to call you the
real-life Sofia Vergara new TV show is
now searching for hot-blooded passionate
attractive latina moms the emphasis here
is more on the fact that she's hot and
less on the fact that she's a mom
reality shows are weird because they're
definitely playing into stereotypes I
hear one more time Latinas referred to
as spicy I must freak out and then
people will tell me I'm being
hot-blooded and spicy I actually found
this kind of funny as a Latin person
what do they think about lions ugh what
we're all like Alec with maracas as are
some things accurate car commercial the
role name is African American car dealer
role details nice-looking friendly not
too dark I just got so awkward I'm so
uncomfortable clearly they're not a fan
of people that are more tan it's like
when I think about the spectrum of
blackness like I could go to someone
else and be like alright well like I'm
lighter than them but I'm darker than
them so like am I am I too dark am I not
too dark like where where do I fit on
that spectrum it's colorism it's just
one of those things where there people
are like if you're darker skinned then
they don't want you six words and that's
like the most racist ever and always
yeah we're just getting started look I
feel like it's just gonna get way hoarse
from here whoa oh my god I can't okay
male 20s to 40s asian petite average or
chubby frontal and back manatee must
have extremely Oh must have an extremely
small penis this makes me that makes me
so mad
it should I also think what's like
troublesome is that whenever race is
called out it's to play out a stereotype
if you're an Asian dude you
to be like weird-looking we need you a
tiny pain and that's perfect
there's no redeeming factor in this
other than the fact that Chang gets a
name this gets to giant Asian damn Oh
I'm I don't even want to read this out
loud
I feel like tactless even repeating
what's on this page eight girls these
are the hottest of the hottest models
must have real hair me girls these are
fine girls long natural hair really nice
body small waist nice hips you should be
light-skinned Beyonce is a prototype
here know where the this casting
director came from no no let's look
let's stop let's like think so see girls
are african-american girls medium to
light skin with a weave see you girls
these are African American girls poor
not in good shape medium to dark skin
tone what
so like the hotter the girl is the more
open her ethnicity can be but the more
undesirable the girl gets the more
pigeon-holed her race becomes you know
why Beyonce's a big girl because she's
black Oh again with like skin darkness
determining your words this is like
literally my childhood insecurities I'm
like a piece of paper this just makes me
sad and it makes me really sad for young
actors and actresses who are trying to
come up and seeing how like if you're a
person of color if you're a woman this
is what is out there for you there
aren't necessarily a ton of dynamic
roles for you that well we've come a
long way from like pure you know
blackface or yellow face or things like
that
racism is just sort of molded itself
it's manifested itself in a new sneakier
way it's not gone it just doesn't look
the way it used to look this is why I
need to write 16 more movies like we
need to be yeah producing content and
making our own films and sitting on the
casting couch
