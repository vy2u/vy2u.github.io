really mean is already trouble cuz men
know women better than anyone right even
better than ourselves why they make our
laws shyguys guide to dating persistent
guy keeps a picture of her in his wallet
for inspiration what that's so creepy
never do that no I don't even have a
photo of my girlfriend the last thing I
would do is keep a picture of a girl I'm
interested in my wallet can you imagine
if she found it the title of this
section is hunting the easy prey let me
set a similar scene you walk into a
party all the girls are thin sexy
beautiful and they all have guys
crawling all over them then you see one
girl in the corner she's cute but she's
a little heavier than the others she
doesn't exactly stand out in the crowd
she is basically being ignored this is
the one that you want to go for she is
easy prey whoa what wait so like a girl
that just doesn't look like a sexy thin
model is easy like I honestly feel like
that would be the opposite goodbye I am
moving to space
sometimes a girl starts off saying you
can't do certain things but then she
starts getting turned on she changes her
mind and she lets you go to town so keep
trying you never know when a know can
turn into a yes ultimately though it's
her choice this is garbage
this is terrible put this man in jail
this man is perpetuated a sexual assault
and read someone says no to something it
means no it's like his publisher as
editor was like maybe you should just
add him that thing about being her
choice he's like does this kind of
derail my entire point and she's like we
can legally have to do that this is
literally a guide to becoming a rapist
forever alone guy to ladies man the true
ladies man Bill of Rights
thou shalt not throw away any
opportunity to practice your pimping
skills
he called in pimping skills it's been
scholastic breast problems neck I don't
care if you have to practice on 13-year
old grandmas or hookers as long as
they're female wow this book just
totally to hit on 13-year olds like
that's like illegal like pretty illegal
pretty illegal I kind of feel a little
nauseous
Alfa's won't pay for her except on
occasion if she did something to deserve
it
like sleep with him and they won't sit
there and listen to her problems for
hours and Alpha's time is much too
valuable for that just get a blow-up sex
doll because you don't want a real
person like at all
it's just training men to be assholes
like our further told that consent
doesn't matter which is a huge problem
people say like oh like why do we need
feminism just dick this book these bugs
I would say don't treat dating like
hunting just be yourself because there
are so many damn people in the world
that you are bound to find other people
who are like you treat dating like
you're looking for a new friend because
ultimately your significant other is
going to be your best friend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
