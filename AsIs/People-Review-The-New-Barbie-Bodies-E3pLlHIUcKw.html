large black Barbies back is a black oh
how beautiful
oh my god I'm diggin the soul fro going
on right here it's really soft her legs
are super freakin long oh one leg is
shorter than the other though very long
legs always wearing high heels
that's a men making that design right
there yes Barbie came out with new skin
tones but I think this is the first time
that were seeing such variation in those
skin tones which Barbie is this Oh
petite this one's really cute I like
this one she's fun
you didn't cut this out right it looks
like it
I just sorry I don't mean to undress her
but I'm like okay yes curvy Barbie
yeah curvy Barbie see this is me I got
no boobs and a fat ass if I could just
get them to like make a hybrid I think I
found like myself well look they're
wearing flat shoes can you guys stand up
because your feet are flat I'm gonna ask
my makers to make sure that I can wear
flat shoes and I'll wear some dope kicks
to the club and should be like okay and
they're friends how do you think this
will affect kids for me kids should
understand that like you shouldn't look
at a plastic toy and be like that's what
I need to look like that's what I need
to be calm I hear people argue all the
time like my child can tell the
difference between a doll and a real
person and while that may be true the
original intention of Barbie was to
project your adult ideals I get it but
it's just I think it's important that
parents teach their kids that they
should not see themselves in plastic
things and you know even for myself like
I've gained weight over the last few
years and being able to look at a curvy
Barbie that looked just as beautiful as
all the other Barbies sitting there it
was meaningful to me I'm happy that they
have the wide array
of sizes but then they also need to
think about what are they going to sell
along with these body types you need to
make sure that along with having all of
these ranges and sizes like you're also
letting young girls know that there's
happiness along with being different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
