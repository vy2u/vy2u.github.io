I know nothing the worst advice I've
ever gotten starts with me in school
there was this girl that was terribly
attractive she was going out with this
guy who was like very hard as in like
you know would beat everyone up he had a
signature move in which he would put
people in a headlock and feed them bread
they broke up and she came up to me and
started talking to me and then the word
got around to this guy and he was like
anybody tries to get with this girl I'm
gonna feed him the bread and
nobody wants that
so I went home that evening and I saw a
neighbor who you could occasionally find
talking to himself I psych yeah I've
just going to the story about the girl
and he said you should fight for her I
thought about it and the next day came I
walked it straight up to him and in this
Ray moment of adrenaline I went to
headbutt him he stood back and like I
had by at his chest then proceeded to
jump on top of me and beat the at
me in this situation of death I was
thinking this is great she's gonna see
me getting hit for her she saw me go up
to him we're then gonna run off happily
ever after if it turns out that she'd
moved schools so moral of the story
don't take advice from people that talk
to themselves the worst piece of advice
I ever received was when I was 5 years
old my brother and I were playing near
the Christmas tree looking at all the
ornaments and looking at our reflection
in it my brother said if you push on
that ball you can warp the image around
and sort of play with your reflection so
I pushed on the ornament and instantly
it breaks right in my hands and a piece
of glass goes shooting into my eye so I
start screaming and my brother's like
mom and dad are gonna be mad stop
screaming and I was like well there's
glass in my eye
and then my parents came running in and
I had to be rushed off to the emergency
room and that's Christmas the worst
advice that I ever got was in the 8th
grade and they tell us that we're going
to do career projects I think well this
is going to be very easy because I know
what I want to be when I grow up the
teacher comes around to check all of our
outlines and approve them there she is
towering over me and she looks down at
me and she says you can't do that for
your project you have to change your
career because that is a hobby and that
is
then walked away and moved on to the
next student after the project was over
I decided to keep on with my thing some
of the worst advice I ever got in my
life was the first summer I went to
summer camp I was a very shy a sweaty
kid back then and he kind of had like a
cool cabin it was like the cool guys
they had like switchblade cones they
could talk to girls and I had a couple
of accidents I guess you could call him
so I didn't want to put my laundry in
with everybody else's so I was given
advice by another camper to hide my
underwear under the Kathak you know when
cabins are on hills and there's rain
sometimes underwear what kind of like
wash up like it's on a shore and it'll
just be there in front of your cabin as
they come back from lunch and then your
parents put your name in them it's kind
of a a lonely last night at camp
campfire for this guy so thanks a lot
also don't get white underwear yellow in
the front Brown in the back that's what
it should be that's what underwear
should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
