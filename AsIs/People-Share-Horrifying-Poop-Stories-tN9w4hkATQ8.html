forever I'll never forgive myself I was
in first grade
it was recess we had like a lunch aide
who just controlled recess with an iron
fist and I had to poop so bad I had to
poop the most and she wouldn't let me go
poop finally I can't hold it anymore
I pooped my pants I'm wearing these
tighty whiteys just packed to the brim
in poop so I was like oh I know I just
won't tell anyone there's only four
hours left in the day so I just dealt
with it I'm like yeah I'm gonna do this
and I sat on my poop and I'll never
forget the feeling of like the poo
contouring to my little baby butt cheeks
and then my mom picked me up and I asked
her kindly to put down newspaper on the
backseat and roll down the windows and I
didn't say a word
the whole ride back one time over the
summer a couple of years ago I decided
to go jogging when it was just like it
immediately hit me and it was like
you're not gonna make it you're not
gonna make it you need it right now so
I'm like alright okay I'm just gonna
poop in the woods no one will know it'll
be like a total big secret lots of
people do it so I take off my parents I
take off my underwear I squat I start
doing my business and I hear like this
weird rustling and I look up and in the
distance there's just this giant fear
and we just make eye contact and I can't
stop so I'm literally just like
squatting pooping and staring into the
eyes of this huge acid ear I was with my
dad and my mom and we were into cars we
were visiting a friend their friend they
were taking forever so finally I was
like I can't I can't I'll just go to
like I'll just go to the carwash like
right here down the street just take me
walk with me save me the carwash so I'm
taking my pants on as I'm I start to
throw up some shooting from both ends
throw everything in the toilet flush it
it starts to overflow my mom continues
to not make sure that there is a little
girl out here that needs to use the
bathroom hurry up I'm like mom tell her
the bathrooms broken and I decided to
face this little girl so sure enough I
open the door big ol fat
fourteen-year-old boy coming out of the
ladies restroom I look at the girl and
I'm like it's out of order
so I had a huge huge
Stane i had set on towels in the car and
I hung out of my and then with my
grandma's where I hung out with no pants
for the rest of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
