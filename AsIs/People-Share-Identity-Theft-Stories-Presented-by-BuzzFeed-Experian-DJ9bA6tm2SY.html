I'm Courtney and I'm a victim of
identity theft I was buying the just
typical things about the road trip cuz I
was gonna travel I use I first used my
debit card and then I use my credit card
of both were being denied so I called my
bank there was about fifteen hundred
dollars at a restaurant named Tecate in
Chihuahua Mexico and around five hundred
dollars was spent at a toy store about
three to four hundred dollars was taken
for collect calls you basically go
through a process where you find
yourself proving to yourself and to your
bank that you are who you say you are
and that this was not you I was like
working crazy hours for the holidays and
I worked like 70 plus hours when we to
try to maintain just a certain balance
to get some gifts I woke up Thursday and
I had like 60 bucks in my account and as
I'm calling my job somebody in El Paso
Texas pumps Terje dollars in gas so it
goes from 60 to 30 bucks uh oh I want a
phone with the bank teller it was like
one of the worst holiday seasons I ever
encountered thus far I got a call from
my bank have you been buying a bunch of
exotic pets no of course not apparently

under my name when I was three
butterfly fishes a cockatoo a Gila
monster they spent over $8,000 I had a
bank come after me when I was like seven

my identity had been stolen they got in
a car in my name eighty thousand dollars
