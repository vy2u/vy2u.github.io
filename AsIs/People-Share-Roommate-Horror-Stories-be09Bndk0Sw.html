shut-in he had a girlfriend she wasn't
long distance but for some reason they
were just constantly on skype with each
other he was just playing a video game
with her on the corner of his computer
screen his computer was perfectly facing
my bed every single time I went to sleep
his girlfriend's face would just be
staring blankly toward me as I was like
changing and getting ready for bed and
she lived like a building over there's
no reason they had to do that I'm trying
to eat my frosted flakes and he's
talking about all the deranged sex acts
he wants to do all of the ladies all of
all different kinds of ladies he would
not stop talking about how his biggest
fantasy was going to a strip club and
having a stripper step on his balls I
want to do a movie this like 300 man
with like chicks that are just like
stepping on guy's balls there was one
time where I walked into the apartment
and ended up seeing him with a lady and
was whipping her and he had the 300
soundtrack playing everybody's cool to
like what they like I'm trying to go to
bed I don't need to know about this when
she was home she kind of always had guys
around sometimes she wouldn't have
enough money for the bills but she would
be like instagramming her going out to
like steak dinners always wore heels how
did you get those shoes by the way those
are like $5,000 shoes I opened up like
her arm walk from top to bottom shelf
she had expensive beautiful matching
lingerie I pretty much knew a hundred
percent that my roommate was a
high-class escort I come back from
holiday break one time and all of her
stuff has gotten out of the apartment I
was 24 and I had a roommate move in and
to celebrate we sat in the living room
and had a few drinks she proceeded to
drink all of the drinks and then took
her shirt off played with her nipples
put her head up in the air
projectile volcano vomited all over
herself and the couch and then passed
out that was within about 45 minutes
meeting her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
