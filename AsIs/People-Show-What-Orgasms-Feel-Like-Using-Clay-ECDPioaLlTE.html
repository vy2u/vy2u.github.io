orgasm I need to like work it a little
bit you know get everything a little
like warmed up for plays underrated
people don't always have like the most
sensitive approach gotta listen to the
clay and be be kind to the clay like
what do you want I don't know what feels
good for you clay like I'm not thinking
about myself it's like a mountain that's
like you know you're sweating but you're
really enjoying the view it depends on
the day if it's a mini mountain or like
a big mountain as I get more excited the
intensity higher for us it's like a
second wave that's sort of like builds
on so you can leave wound up a little
bit while contracting and releasing that
doesn't look great but it feels good I
start feeling tense I'm balling this up
because like the closer I get to coming
but kind of tenser my body feels about
to get there it's like oh my god at any
minute any second it goes through is
this emotions all of this this is what
the explosion looks like you get to the
top of the mountain and you're like oh
my god I made the firework show it's
amazing just like a bursting feeling or
a spring sort of like almost leaving
your body and then it's just like wow
all of that just happened this is going
through your whole body like firework
shows they don't last as long as you'd
like them to unless you know you're late
you can have multiple that would fall
over very dramatically because you're
exhausted you're done and everything was
great then you should have come back to
the state again you know take your time
building this this beautiful masterpiece
this is me after sex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
