about everything I'm Monica ten Kate
most people know me as Monica the medium
I'm a spirit medium which means that I
can communicate with those who crossed
over a que I talked to dead people I
will connect with whoever it is that
they've lost that want to come through
and communicate messages to them you're
open and you're yes excited yeah
lopsided it's not to me who chooses to
come through how they acknowledge
themselves so we'll just close your eyes
and then we will start to connect all
right gosh la la I like to write as a
channel just easier for me when I have a
lot of stuff going on up here to have to
raise my energy very high they have to
lower theirs we meet somewhere in the
middle in order to connect do you have
an uncle or father that's passed father
your dad okay so your dad is stepping
forward was he around 50 52 perfect
there is a very strong female energy
that's trying to come through mom or
your mom's mom passed for you my mom's
mom my grandma your dad is stepping
forward he find it's like he's so funny
he's kind of like in all that this is
happening do you know if there's a
Richard or a Rick that's my father's
name was Ricky there's like an s female
name connection um we called her Sonny
I heard dad's here then I heard that
there's a mother energy so both of your
parents are on the other side I heard
sister but then I kept feeling boy
energy so I just had a baby last year
it's a boy yeah do you ever catch him
just being like yes no yeah I stopped
out like morose but you're sayin what is
delay what are you looking at and maybe
you guys have even wondered is that
maybe dance that's around my mom is
convinced my mom may recommend the
station but if it's a question it's
absolutely your daddy baby that's me
one of them made me feel like something
in the head is like Alzheimer's dementia
memory loss broke that's something where
I'm losing my memory or not go there and
what she communicates is just that
yeah I I was my mind wasn't fully there
but my soul knew just how much my family
was with me around me calling me taking
care of me all of those things that my
daughter's most beautiful woman in the
world and he said I'm so lucky to be
able to call her my daughter to be able
to say that I'm her father because he's
not here in the physical world that
doesn't matter he's there in spirit he's
still your dad he wants you to know that
he's not going to miss out and he's not
missing out on any of the things going
on in your life it comes up in a lot of
readings with girls who lost the father
but I can't hold back because he still
wants you to know that message I'll be
their wedding-day I'll be there for all
those moments he's not missing out you
have been able to be so strong not
having your parents to be there
physically to support you and cheer you
on she's like amazed by that she said
look at my daughter look at what she's
doing I'm so proud of her I mean I thank
you so much
it's really hard to say that this
ethereal medium stuff is real but it's
real I've seen stuff like that on TV but
I've never really experienced it for
myself I think you definitely have to be
open-minded who wouldn't want to hear
from their mom and dad who died nine
years ago I think after speaking to her
I definitely feel a little bit more
closure if that's a good word to
describe it I just feel more at peace to
know that my parents are like super
proud of me it makes me feel great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
