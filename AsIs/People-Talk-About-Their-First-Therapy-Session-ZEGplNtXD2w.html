independent and type-a so it was very
difficult to stomach the idea that I was
going to pay or use my health insurance
for someone to help me with my problems
I actually grew up in a household that
was very anti therapy I always thought
it was best if I could take care of
myself I didn't think it would be worth
my time I thought it was going to be a
big waste of money if I can't tell
people that I know and love my problems
why would I tell a stranger my problems
first time I saw a therapist was
actually when I was 15 I had my first
really big anxiety episode in sixth
grade and my parents made me go to
therapy I was literally telling my
school advisor all of the that was
going on in my life my school counselor
walked me to my first therapy session
technically I had no idea what to expect
I was really really nervous I almost
canceled I went to a therapist in high
school that was very much like the ones
that are portrayed in the media I was
sitting on a couch she was sitting in a
chair I complained about things and she
said how does that make you feel before
I went in I just thought this is
 this isn't going to work who is
this lady who's telling me what to do
I was really scared and really super
embarrassed and I hated it I was telling
my psychiatrist about all of the shitty
things have that have been going on in
school I was also very consciously
picking my words carefully to kind of
prove to her that I'm not like a mental
case after he asked me a few questions
and got me to open up a little bit
like so much emotion came out of me and
it was such a great feeling oh my god
I'm sorry just I always remember that
feeling of like the burden lifting after
we finished we scheduled our next
session and it was one of those moments
where I realized that I had a lot more
to share and talk about than I thought I
went to about two or three therapists
and did those little introductory
sessions and then I found someone where
I was like I understand this person this
person can understand me therapy is kind
of like school and you go and you learn
and when you graduate it's the best
feeling because you now like have tools
to be a better person and you'll always
cry for some reason they'll find a way
to make you cry
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
