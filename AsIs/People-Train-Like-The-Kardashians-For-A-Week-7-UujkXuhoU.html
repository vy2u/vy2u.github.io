them over there and I'm working out over
here I'm so over them
this week we're training like the
Kardashians and probably end up with
really big butts I don't really like the
Kardashian is that much I don't
understand why people are so into them I
really like the Kardashians I appreciate
their family dynamic
they're also amazing business people
from what I've seen on Keeping Up with
the Kardashians it doesn't seem like the
Kardashians have much of a tolerance for
pain so I don't think that this workout
is gonna be that hard although I don't
really like them I know that a lot of
work goes into keeping their bodies and
their image intact I feel like this
could be harder than it seems
my name is Gunnar Peterson and you are
in Beverly Hills gym that I live in
pretty much we're gonna go through some
cool full-body multi-joint movements
that should elevate their heart rates
and really fire them up and get them on
their path to working out if they're not
already on it do you think we'll be able
to keep up with Kardashians
you mean the workout oh for sure you'll
be killing this wait no I know you will
you'd be fine you excited you're right I
was really excited to meet Gunnar he's
trained so many celebrities and athletes
that I look up to the first thing he did
was he put us on some form of cardio and
I was afraid he was gonna leave us on
those treadmills all day the workouts
themselves were actually really cool
they were kind of a combination of a
little bit of circuit training weight
training and always involve some cardio
a lot of the workouts were so fun that
you didn't feel like you were working
out he had so many really interesting
workout moves that you never see and I
think a lot of it is connected with this
really cool equipment he has that he has
engineered the worst part of working out
with Gunnar was this little machine that
he had us on it was so tiring
so we're cuz her legs look like they
were stuff they were okay I stopped me
making sure I saw that it was complete
on us making sure that we were lifting
enough weight going fast enough but at
the same time he was encouraging us to
drink water all the time and rest when
we needed to a lot of his equipment were
super high-tech and game-like he's gonna
light up yeah it's kind of like you kind
of get competitive when you're hitting
the locks and everything like that and
when you're just trying to run ah I
don't know if I do the jump Midway but
whatever works oh yeah come on there's a
second filling it big we get there how
do we do today I thought you guys killed
thank you so much glad you guys made it
guys good luck this week keep up on
three get in here one two three keep
with the Kardashian
working out at Gunners gym was awesome
we got to use all this equipment that
I'd never seen before but kind of
transferring that to real life where we
were at our normal gyms working out with
normal equipment on our own time that
was a lot harder
we had Gunners workout yesterday and
today of course my muscles are hurting
Marty over it already don't wanna go I
was considering staying home and I'm
already late
it required a lot of personal motivation
to get up and to do his long workouts
without him there making sure that we
were doing everything correctly his
workout was basically warmup big chunk
of workout and then 30 minutes of cardio
I normally just do the cartoon we'd all
go to the gym together cuz it was like
okay well I can't not go to the gym
because there's two other people waiting
for me I totally would have sucked this
morning if I hadn't already made plans
I was about to not go today but some
worm said she was going so I will say
it's a little bit harder than I thought
it was gonna be was cool though cuz I
feel like we're the kardashian sisters
yeah kind of matching I immediately
figured out who is who
Michelle is for sure Chloe cuz she's
like the workout guru
I'm Courtney cuz I'm like second it's
really hard to find motivation when you
have a full day of work ahead and you
only have 30 minutes left to sleep
sometimes you just to sleep salams
Kendall she's already fit without even
trying we're on our last rep now how's
it feel almost done I want pasta I am
NOT going today I was at an amusement
park till 2:00 a.m. last night and the
last thing I want to do right now
there's dumbbell lateral raises I just
don't think this is something that's
necessarily doable for a normal person
scheduled this morning I got to the gym
and the Salar man came had to cancel to
do something else so I had to do the
workout by myself and it just made me
realize like how much easier and more
fun it is to work out when you have a
team or a trainer with you to push you
and I feel like maybe if I was a
Kardashian my body my appearance would
be such a huge part of my career that I
have to make time in my schedule to go
to the gym what I learned from this
experience is that the people we see on
the covers of magazines not only have
Photoshop on their side but also they're
paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars
for nutritionists trainers a whole team
of people to help them look the way they
do no normal person has that kind of
support we're just regular people trying
to get fit it's much harder than we
thought it's really difficult to like
fit it into your regular life overall
I'm happy with my body I don't think I
need a Kardashian body to feel
comfortable and happy with who I am as
long as I'm fit and healthy that's all
that really matters to me so doing a
Superman to a Superman like its Superman
yes just like this no no no
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
