stickers that you put on to your
pitbulls I found this one he has it
means desk and I know she's making a
video about it and I want to use one
after cleansing apply a dot tacky side
down on your blemish for best results
wear for six hours or simply leave it on
overnight after 10 years of pubescent
pain it's time to start something new it
kind of feels plastic heat we've got one
over here and I'm just gonna put just a
whole trail over here just in case as
you can see I have one little pimple
right here this is a pimple right here
it's raised and it hurts some in your
video now yes okay added a couple gonna
add the last one just there sure I mean
whatever there's a billion six hours or
however long I sleep for and then take
them off and see if it worked I'm hoping
that by tomorrow morning it at least
doesn't hurt and when I get the kind of
pimples that hurt they hurt for days and
if I could just stick one of these on my
face and know that in the morning it
wouldn't be painful
that'd be worth the money I'm very
shocked and impressed that the dot has
stayed on my face however it hurts so
much more than it did yesterday we are
going to see how the peace out acne
stickers did all right
the moment of truth oh so it's very
smooth and on this it's like a little
scab of what my pimple used to be I feel
like the swelling went down this one
remember it was like kind of ready to
pop this one definitely went down
looks literally no different I'm so
disappointed
overall they worked pretty good this was
a big pimple and now it's got they could
hurt when you take them off a little bit
obviously they're sticky and I would
recommend this and also use them again
we're not bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
