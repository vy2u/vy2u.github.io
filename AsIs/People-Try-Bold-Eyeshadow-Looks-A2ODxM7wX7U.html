filling myself y'all like for real we're
gonna try Juvia x' eyeshadow palettes
it's loading apparently the colors show
up very pop in on our skin tone I wear
it I shadow
probably like three times a year max if
I have a makeup palette which I do I use
maybe three out of like the 50 colors I
don't use eyeshadow but whenever I've
had it on I feel like it looks really
good I think I'm slowly sort of getting
into the rhythm of like maybe wanting to
step out on like bolder colors and
bolder tones but I'm excited today
because I know that like these were made
for us yeah I'm already in love with it
just like the packaging alone I love
packaging I feel like this is about to
make me look like royalty
absolutely coming to America oh my god
can I take a cordial I really can I say
go yeah even though I knew that these
were gonna be really pigmented I still
wasn't ready I think straight off the
bat it's going to be blues and pinks yep
this is what I envision definitely
bright festive oh my god that is so
smooth so perfect
what like you legit don't need a primer
that's great for girls like me because
when I have to start priming and using
products to make your product work
better I'm like no oh
see these are bigger circles the names
Nefertiti of course
Isabelle Cleopatra it's not Roby like
this gold
every color is so good yeah I don't even
like how are we even gonna choose what
look we want to do I don't know okay
let's let's have some fun yes this is
what I gravitated towards the masquerade
and I think I'm gonna go with the nubian
palette I'm gonna use the masquerade
palette and I want to use the two Nubian
looks awareness goes on though light
isn't to die to die it looks so good I'm
saying what am i doing is definitely as
pigmented as it was when I squat which
is awesome but then you also kind of
have to tread lightly so it's kind of a
balance so I got the zobo kind of
reddish on top and closer to the center
we have the Chi I'm starting to look
like a peacock yet I don't really know
the colors that I'm choosing are like
supposed to go together but like yeah I
feel like the ones I have a
complimentary but they don't look like
it if I had these pallets I mean
actually wear eye shadow a little bit
more
is this what blending is when you just
leave what's blending and see I was
gonna go home after work today I got to
go out I might just step out and let
this little way to take a few sips I had
a masquerade oh so fun I'm in love I
loved it loved a person and it doesn't
disappoint in the fact that it is like
for women of color and the packaging is
just this beautiful celebration of black
woman I think is like amazing and I've
literally never seen anything like it if
I owned this palette I could see myself
wanting to be bolder and see myself
wanting to experiment more with color
it's so nice to have makeup like me like
for even though I'm not like a consumer
as much as maybe you are but I agree
there needs to be like more of a risk
you don't worry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
