cheerleading is for exciting bubbly
people a lot of butt touching I'm
definitely not flexible enough to do
cheerleading it seems real hard and I
don't think I can do it I'm terrified
I'm gonna get thrown in the air I don't
know what to expect everyone's got a
beer so that's making me a little
nervous
hi my name is Jesse Moorhead and I am
the head coach at Santa Monica College
I love cheerleading because of the
physical challenge every single day I
get to walk in and manipulate people to
see what we can accomplish so we're
gonna start warming up the body we're
gonna do some face expression so what
I'm gonna do some co-ed partner stunting
and I'm going to have my ladies going up
doing basic tosses
must be cheer team get ready colleges
around America
we just did a basket tuck X out and
we're actually going to instruct basic
load and straight tosses competition a
section of the routine is actually a
cheer Porsha
everyone needs a moment to shake their
up I think they did amazing they came in
with an open mind and took every single
challenge there wasn't a single moment
where they said no and or I couldn't do
it they walked in and they trusted us
through the entire process which is the
only thing you can ask for I came in so
amped to try this and I immediately
my pants I don't know if you saw my face
during some of the lips but they were
insane I'm still shaking actually from
the adrenaline they keep you moving fast
so that you don't have the time to panic
I couldn't believe that they just
casually tossed people I'm like pretty
good at cheerleading my 15 year old self
would be like Eli this is your moment to
touch but but you're not thinking about
grabbing butts because there's a human
being that you're holding above your
head I did fall I'm lying I'm not gonna
cheer for life what was I doing in band
all this time still don't think it's a
sport noise I think it's a sorry but it
is weird that it's a sport about people
cheering for other people playing for
who's cheering for the cheerleaders I'll
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
