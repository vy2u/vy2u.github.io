gotten the wonderful opportunity to see
and hold a Cuban cigar
I know Mexican food really well so but I
don't think this is gonna be like
Mexican food so to be honest I'm not
really sure what to expect here I'm just
expecting it to be good croquettas de
jamon it looks like a potato ball yeah
like a mozzarella stick like a
cylindrical crab cake mmm it's crunchy
and delicious holy she wanted
cheese yeah and then there's kind of a
little like bit of sweetness
yeah the touch is bad I want sriracha
with it Kobe Nia pineapple soda I just
saw like a glass of what looks like
whiskey and about half of a Mad Men
moment smells really sweet down over
here this tastes like a very rare
japanese sprite yes i have pineapple
holy now that you say that of course is
pineapple Wow I'd I not notice that
you've got going moment the presentation
is beautiful I feel like someone put
their time and effort into this oh wait
it smells good like potatoes that were
like soaked in something I don't know
what potatoes you're looking at that
definite is not does this look like a
potato to any of you out there because
seriously doubt it as if it does you've
been looking at potatoes it's really
garlic you know I love garlic I'm a big
fan of it we have this in Barbados which
is where my family's from mm-hmm this is
so good you know Paula Deen says you can
never have enough butter I say you can
never have my dad herb ah yeah but
Mother's soda we might think like a
motor this smells like Windex I'm not
really sure much better Bob I like this
one I like the other one better I feel
like this is like Jagermeister or
something like that where it's like a
used to be medicine but now we just
drink it for fun I didn't know that Cuba
was like the Willy Wonka of so it is
sandwich Cubano is what I'm talking
about that's what I expected
the Cuban this looks promising I'm
actually really oh there's a little
sword in here too that's freaking cool
look at this yeah solid oh yeah look at
okay see that I mean I love the fact
that I think there's like two to three
types of meat in here only got a pickle
in here we got some mustard yeah it's
really good
she likes it I could tell by her rocking
back and forth I don't want the sandwich
to end
ropa vieja oh my god smell amazing it
smells like yourself it's like a Haitian
dish that I know boo young yeah I guess
is something like a ground wall would
make because you know how much time she
put into it and it's so amazing oh it's
okay it's the best thing in the entire
world I don't know what it is but it
just it tastes like my childhood for
some reason this is an entree this is an
entree cafe Cubano I've never heard of
Cuban coffee me neither
don't drink coffee no I've never had a
cup of coffee in my life you're gonna
get so jack then are you capping a
sensitive for this dark it looks like
oil I'm gonna give you more okay cheers
Cheers
how come you know your saucer because
you don't need to do that I think like
you do ooh that's serious this is how my
granddaddy used to make coffee from me
when I was a little girl this is great
Huli Shh oh it's way sweeter than I
thought it would be like Mark Cuban this
is good really good I was expecting to
die this stuff could smack your mama
like that's a serious it is go motive
way overall is really good everything
was super focused and what it wouldn't
be in that sandwich that's it yeah it
was all just like really well done
overall I'd said that food was strong it
was rich and the coffee was a perfect
yeah it's a nice touch I know it kind of
reminds me of home in my culture I feel
really good eating this Cuban food makes
me feel happy go Cuba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
