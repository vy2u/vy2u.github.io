we are using stencils to put on our eye
makeup but I want it to work because I
love anything that makes my life easier
like it's not gonna be very accurate and
it's gonna be just a lot of blobs on my
face okay so it looks like first you're
supposed to find which I shape you have
you close your eyes you press it to your
eye and then you fill it in this is so
easy
not really wait how do I do this this is
extremely hard because it doesn't adhere
to your face so if you've done your
foundation first just say goodbye oh oh
yeah yours actually stayed on the line
did I want it to stay that's the
question okay I mean that's probably the
best it's been so far
I mean it's eye shadow you can't really
go that wrong with eye shadow reveal I
look a mess
so in what world it's enough for me
this is not good actually not gonna lie
I just did it okay once you blend it
it's not as terrible I'm gonna go over
it and make it better so I just have
done it all myself in the first place I
don't know that this seems like stage
makeup for like beating up guy number
one oh no no oh wow this is like mud but
it's not really showing out this is
impossible to do with this kit like No
oh oh I got I guess what is technically
a cat eye it's not necessarily a good
what's hope the eyebrows are better I
don't think so I know it's not something
you put in your for join us oh it's kind
of looking like it's working okay a
little bit I've done my heart bells
worse than this I actually made this
change isn't always good it's really
hard to hold it down because this is now
material just keeps popping off but how
I like super sentai well see oh wow
forget about twins they're not even
sisters they're Ivan first second or
third cousins these are like distant pen
pals look at that eyebrow that is not a
bad-looking eyebrow
three that is not too bad if I was in so
much of a rush that I need to use a
makeup stencil I probably just wouldn't
want to make up these stencils don't
worry I called it
they don't worry it's it's gonna be no
for me though - no for me guys
sorry stencils</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
