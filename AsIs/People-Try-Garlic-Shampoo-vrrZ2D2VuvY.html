Greek I grew up with a Greek mother so I
had no choice but to love garlic I'm a
fan of garlic I love garlic in my bread
I'm one of those people who I don't care
if you choose eating garlic I'll make
out with you I love garlic so much it
just makes everything so much better it
just makes me happy I love all things
beauty and I love garlic but I don't
know about together
it's a ship ship ship ship ship ship
garlic shampoo for excessive hair loss
I do have thinning hair so maybe if I
were to use this a lot it would help out
with that contains the OL garlic oil and
other natural ingredients don't like it
one things they like and other because
then it's like what is the oven oh oh
oh my god it's not like garlic bread
oh yeah that's garlic just like step
into an Italian restaurant it tastes it
tastes I'm really curious as to how the
consistency will be also curious to see
if I vomit ah good you do enough excited
about this I go to get sound wet hands
thoroughly through lukewarm water air is
wet let's try this okay this pick was
purple brown she heard it in the West
before me was complaining of that it was
so strong better no she just doesn't
have what it takes is almost too much of
a good thing
you know there's like a part and you
taste it I taste it
it smells like did it on my head it's
like flattery not nicely though I'm not
mad about it like this is totally
workable I'm used to the shower smells
like
phagon good and look happy we're just
gonna enjoy the smell of my junk leaders
right now I feel like I was just baby in
a plate of delicious again not a good
idea thank you girl
the experience was terrible it was
interesting that smell you can't be like
Oh feels so relaxed now it's the exact
opposite
a gag Domitian okay so now that my hair
is all blow-dried it feels good it feels
nice it was fun and different and used
to just standard sense of shampoo and
this was very different the fact that it
is pink it's horrifying colic is not
pink so it's not natural they're putting
other stuff in it which defeats the
whole point of the shampoo you're saying
the shampoo felt super normal but I can
still smell it and I'll probably still
smell it in my nightmares my hair feels
clean usually when I'm blow-drying my
hair at least twenty five strands fall
out and are all around the sink but
today was fine my ear actually feels
pretty soft and I haven't even put
conditioner in it I'd be curious to do
this repeatedly so I could see if
there's actually hair regrowth that
happens kind of like when you get your
eyebrows waxed and like you always love
the end result but the process you're
not looking forward to I feel like this
has only fueled my garlic obsession I'm
actually getting really hungry right now
like I want some garlic steak mashed
potatoes for dinner I think I would
definitely use this product again the
smell whatever you're gonna go through
the rest of the day smelling terribly
and when people say like god it smells
over here I'll just feel like yeah who
did that I think I am garlic now I am
one with the garlic now you are what you
shampoo feeling every these Falls and
string
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
