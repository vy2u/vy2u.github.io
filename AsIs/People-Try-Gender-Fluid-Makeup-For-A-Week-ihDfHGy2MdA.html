and it's for people of all gender
identities gender expressions and skin
tones
so I'm assist women which means that you
know I D with the gender that I was
assigned to at Birth but with that comes
certain expectations right you're
supposed to wear a makeup so my gender
identity and gender expression pretty
much aligns with that of a sis man when
I was a little kid I got into my mom's
makeup drawer and there's this amazing
photo of me like sitting on her lap
crying because I'm in trouble like
covered in her makeup I identify as
female I also identify as lesbian I feel
like I've really embraced and drogyny a
lot lately as a trans and non-binary
person I love the way makeup accentuates
different elements of my gender
expression sometimes people are confused
and think that trans means transitioning
trans is like just not identifying what
the gender that you were assigned at
birth I'm really excited to try this out
for this week and see what it's like
wearing makeup so I'm starting off my
day I think I'm gonna try this cute
little red situation so I painted my
nails last night a bright orange and
everything worked out fine until trying
to open my nightguard container and
sacrifices had to be made you know it's
a little festive it gets everywhere
because it's glitter but I'm
kind of liking it oh wow I should
probably be doing this in front of a
mirror a little smudged all right do you
think it looks really cool it matches
your aesthetic I'm gonna try this yellow
hopefully it's pretty thick cuz I only
really have time to apply one layer I'm
really digging this red it's super cute
but I already on my nails heading
to the subway
see I guess how people feel about Disney
morning glitter falling on them on the
subway today I'm gonna go with the
golden color I'm going to use this
silver glitter to create like a little
bit of eye shadow effect successfully
you made it to work today with my nails
done I think it was easier this time
around because you didn't need as many
layers as with the yellow so last night
my roommate Xena and I ended up going to
the Brooklyn Museum Swizz Beatz was
DJing out of nowhere
Zen and I took over the dance floor I
was wearing cute little red lip little
black dress and I felt like all eyes
were on me in a really good way today
I'm headed in to work early to meet a
friend who's gonna do my makeup putting
on some purple lipstick it's a good
color for me I dig it I feel like I've
disco balls on my eyes I want my little
work and the purple is still looking
nice and vibrant I'm so happy about it
today I had my friend Jen do my makeup
people are just so supportive and I'm so
so lucky to be in a city like New York
you can show up looking however you want
and no one is gonna I don't know call
you names furred or anything like that
is blue liquid lipstick is lemme cue
I'm loving the vibrancy I'm loving how
it's like you know matching with my hair
so far so did the nail polish was also a
game-changer for me this is like a
shimmery like gray I really like it I
was meeting a friend at a restaurant and
as I was walking in somebody was like
whoa you have glitter on your face the
lipstick the pigmented color a plus dope
amazing and they stayed on for like
quite a while I only had like a couple
like side eyes on the train even the guy
at my bodega was like you're rocking it
girl and I was like giving my coffee I
was really anxious at first surprisingly
to go out in public what the reality is
for a lot of like trans and gender
non-conforming folks it can be a very
dangerous place trying to shift what
this like cultural or like social
understanding of gender is I think it's
cool that fluid is very gender-neutral
in their advertising whether you're you
know trans non-binary sis whatever
makeup is genderless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
