CBD I love THC I love it I know that now
they're just kind of putting weed into
like every possible item they can maybe
lipsticks that gonna be fun cause what
imagine making out with someone and just
getting each other high back and forth
like cheap products
she knows products I'll try it all
exotic green tea and Asian pear it's
like an exfoliating oh we're bringing
out a mask
it says help restore and balance it
doesn't say balanced what so these don't
get you high some benefits may include
health care dental visions I'm into
anything that's like gonna make me feel
more like a princess Wow I can see it oh
wow you just pose again
holy wait it my face it does feel very
relaxed right now mmm a common feeling
that I have when I use CBD oil the scam
feels good it feels youthful your skin
is just shine glowing thank you I'm not
pregnant
perfume it doesn't smell bad what do you
think about the promise oh I can taste
that ahh mmm my hand smells beautiful
press your neck against my neck it takes
a love of mine ever oh it does smell
like surprisingly grandma II it kind of
would make me feel like I'm at home
just look like bait I wonder if I put
this in my mustache I can like see the
products on my lashes it does make them
look bigger
does it am I pretty it's the clumpy 'us
mascara I've every yes doesn't exactly
feel good feel like I would wear this on
a daily basis or at least most full
times a week going oh it smells so nice
it's so shiny
this is feels very strange and sticky
and weird now that it's on my mouth one
thing I would say about this is I'm
getting it everywhere right this
is what someone who's the biggest fan of
wicked wood where would you use it on a
night on the town
no I don't look good I like crazy makeup
that looks like an alien would wear it
okay I feel more relaxed maybe moral of
the story
we need more wheat in our life more
wheat and more things truly exactly one
feed sneakers all right weed tofu let's
start the revolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
