looking pretty good but my wife doesn't
really know about them tattoos to me are
really scary and if they're not
important I wouldn't just get one I
can't even stay in a relationship for
longer than a year
so tattoos like a lifetime commitment
and I'm not ready for that I would say
people perceive me as a pretty straight
edge kind of guy
I've never have done hard drugs I've
never done marijuana the edge part of me
is when I smoke cigars occasionally and
I drink whisky the first thing that
actually came to mind when I was getting
a tattoo the bigger one was is it gonna
show up when I'm in a wedding dress
this face tattoo is gonna be serious I
mean I live in a liberal place so I mean
I'm sure I'm not gonna get any to
parkour looks but it'll definitely
change the perception I'm like really
excited to look like I actually am cool
so this gets Haddie
really nervous that people are gonna
stare at me how's it look
getting rid look some people look at my
face so put the Sony's on what kind of
hide it as I'm leaving my apartment I
realized that I look like a character
from West Side Story I got the white
shirt blue jeans I don't know I just
think I have to have a snap battle with
somebody campus and I realized that
we've actually started dressed more
badass to show off our tattoos kind of
fashion notice I was illuminated talked
in my water I was standing up the bar
and this girl came up to me and I think
she thought that I was gay she started
buying me shots or talking to me about
my tattoos so I guess my tattoos are
attracting everybody and the hardest
thing about having a tattoo in your face
is to get it out is there like being
concerned about people looking at you
so we're at Nicole Miller West Hollywood
and I'm about to try on some wedding
dresses I'm excited yeah I'm excited to
see you manjar especially with like oh
that's just gonna be weird yeah my mom
would be judging me so oh yeah now Wow
well well yeah I don't even see it I
don't even see yeah yeah when it's
something so special so right it's
mm-hmm you're not gonna see it you
should I think there's this thing that
women have to look so pristine and so
like flawless basically on their wedding
and it's like this can be part of you
it's changed my perspective definitely
you don't see the tattoo when when the
bride just like look so beautiful in the
dress you can tell that she feels
beautiful it's like this is whatever I
will say that the tattoo has really
started to kind of grow on me
same thing with my wife we both have
come to enjoy it more over the week it's
so bizarre how emotionally attached I've
gotten to this tattoo like it's so dumb
but like I love it and now I feel I feel
like I've had so many memories those
weird 3 4 second looks I just like
enough to like grab my attention and
again I always forgot it was on my face
and then I was like oh yeah I have a
tattoo of my face this is uh
this may look kind of strange people
identify you for your tattoos first and
foremost it's not your personality it's
not your glorious smile or your eyes
it's your tattoo it was almost like
people had more respect for me with
showing off these tattoos and like they
saw me in a totally different light and
then I started feeling more confident
maybe a half sleeve is in my future I
don't know what to look at my bank
account
