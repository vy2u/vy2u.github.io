hats
I found myself intrigued by things I see
on like Instagram because I follow a lot
of makeup in Beauty accounts I fear is
that I won't understand any of these
hacks and I will be unsuccessful at all
of them I look like a dumb happy yeah we
are going to use hairspray and a wet
cloth to get out lipstick stains yuck
that's pretty in there that's like some
making out action I'm high as a kite
alright it's hairspray it's ready to go
time to check the shirt it's not as
visible as it was it's like rubbing out
a little I just feel like this would
take a long time and you could just wash
your shirt it's like really getting
there if I were to sit like watching
some trash TV and just do this for an
hour I think it would all be out I think
I would rather just change my shirt
because then my shirt would be wet and
sticky I'm giving this a 9 it's like a
six out of ten yeah
number two use a toothbrush and
hairspray to keep eyebrows in place what
where are they going
load it up and then you just kind of Pat
it down I can feel that they're like a
little more stuck to it extra security
yeah like glued almost this it don't
work if you go to the extreme it doesn't
work if you don't go to the extreme it
works use a sock instead of a beauty
blender to blend foundation you don't
want to be putting a dirty sock out here
me it does say make sure the sock is
clean you sickos oh they're nice socks
oh thank you roll it into a ball like a
Beautyblender and you go like this Oh
I'm not a fan of this it doesn't feel
that good to blend though like I want
something like a beauty blender that has
like a little precision get lint on your
face did you get lint or sock on your
face I got sock on my face now I have to
go back in and pick all the fuzz off my
face I would give it like a three out of
ten cover gray hairs with your mascara
instantly I mean like I think there's
like one oh look at this great man
this doesn't work I can still see it and
now I got my scare in my hair if you run
out of nail polish remover mixed
together equal parts lemon juice and
vinegar pretty excited mm-hmm
doesn't seem to be doing and literally
nothing so that is a zero zero zero
negative use your Vaseline and the
disposable mascara wand as a lip scrub I
am actually really excited to try this
because like Kujo really like dry gross
lips oh yeah this feels good I could see
myself sitting at home doing this
there's a rub-a-dub-dub I also wear
matte lipsticks like almost every day
and that really dries out my lift before
I didn't ever have to scrub my lips but
now this is something that I like need
to do mmm I feel like totally like they
had a lip massage like they went to the
spa feel fresh and moist and ready to
smooch this is my favorite accent yeah
definitely I like this is when I always
do a nine out of ten even out your
hairline with eyeshadow and hairspray I
think it's like filling in your hair for
me it would make it seem like I have a
little more hair right here it's like
match up with the point maybe okay it's
definitely working I feel like I just
have dandruff
like a scalp problem I think the key to
this is definitely ensuring that
whatever eyeshadow you're using is an
exact match for your hair oh it works
very well if I needed to have like a
very even hairline for like something
camera related or for like a really
fancy party and I have my hair up in a
tight bun it looks good it just looks
like I'm dirty yeah this is a zero again
I would take everything you read on the
internet with a grain of salt
lívia best lice if you want to spend
your time trying out these hacks because
you think it'll make life easier do it I
don't my hair lines kind of up a
little bit I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
