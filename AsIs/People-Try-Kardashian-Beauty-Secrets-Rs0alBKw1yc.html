and light it up with my face,
that's what I feel like.
(electronic music)
I'm pro Kardashian, let's just say that.
I'm not a hater.
- If you're into pop culture,
you kinda gotta know who they are.
- I respect them as business women.
- I would call myself a
self taught makeup lover.
- I appreciate makeup.
I like makeup.
I just don't have the patience for it.
- This lipstick has been really difficult
for me to wear all day.
(silly orchestral music)
I'm about to watch Kylie
Jenner's eyeliner hack,
so basically I'm gonna
steal all of her secrets
and become her.
- Ooh that dog.
- Darker color on the edges.
- That's my fear that it's gonna hurt.
That's why I've never
tried this to be honest.
- Okay, I think I'm ready.
- Where am I supposed to put it?
Like where's the line supposed to go?
- Uh oh, I just taped
down my bottom lashes.
I don't think that's gonna end well.
- Yeah it doesn't feel good.
- Uh.
- I always attempt to do winged eyeliner
right as I'm getting
ready to go somewhere.
And then I'm like an hour late.
(giggles)
- I don't know which
beauty blogger specifically
came up with this hack,
but it was not Kylie.
- These steps were not
explained well enough
in that video.
- Ah!
MmMmm.
Uhh no.
- Uh.
Okay, didn't work out.
- I was expecting this sharp ass,
sickening wing eyeliner.
- Well there is a straight line.
I wouldn't say it looked good.
(sighs)
- Kylie let me down.
(electro music)
- I have never contoured
in my entire life.
- I can definitely do this.
- Great, here I go.
Here I go.
- I feel like she gets
it all around the face.
You're like outlining your face, yes?
- Oh my gosh, I'm scared
now for the light part.
- You go like this and then
you're like, it explodes.
- Oh I know you're supposed
to do like a three.
- I look like I'm ready to go to war.
- Also here?
Jesus Christ!
You put it everywhere!
- I feel like this look is complete.
- Let's try blending the outside
since it's the most disturbing to me.
- Maybe my net worth will increase.
- Call me Chelsea with a K.
- But now I'm definitely
less scared to try it,
'cause I thought I would look crazy.
- Did I do it?
I don't know if I did it.
I think I just look really shiny.
Like ridiculously shiny.
- It's not as bad as I thought.
I also don't think I look contoured, but.
- I am seeing Chloe Kardashian with her
extreme highlight.
- I already have a glow, so.
- The highlighter's under the eyebrow
then on the apple of the cheek.
I think that's what it's called.
- I still don't have a super clear
understanding of where
ones cheekbones are.
Like if it's the actual area on top
or if it's the part underneath.
- Woo, it's so sparkly.
- It's like here and it's under here.
- This stuff does get everywhere but.
- Oh wow, this is super glittery.
- Fudge.
Fudge, fudge, okay.
Uh wow.
- I have to go to a meeting after this.
I'm not gonna take it off.
- Oh my God I think I'm getting it.
I think I'm doing it.
- I probably didn't do it right.
I probably put too much on but I felt like
I didn't pump that much into my hand.
- I think it needs to
be a little more exact,
but I think I did this one.
- Definitely the best hack out of
all these Kardashian hacks
would be the contouring.
- I didn't do any of them right.
I don't know if that's
the Kardashian's fault.
- The tape hack is
probably the most useful
for everyday life 'cause
I do like a cat eye.
- They have makeup artists
come to their house
every morning to do their makeup.
- If you disrespect the Kardashians
and their abilities when it
comes to makeup and hair,
you're just a big idiot.
- I mean their faces are always beat.
Like love them or hate them,
they're always beat to the gauze.
- Makeup's not easy.
It's hard to do.
- I'm inspired now and I'm gonna get
more into some of these techniques.
