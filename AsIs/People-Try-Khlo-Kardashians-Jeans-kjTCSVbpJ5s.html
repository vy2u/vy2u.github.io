Emma and we are trying on our good
American jeans on some of the staff at
BuzzFeed and I'm super excited to see
how they look on these beautiful women
okay so first things first how do you
feel in good America I feel like my butt
looks great which is always good check
it out check it out yeah mm-hmm and I
love how slimming these are legit want
to get a pair so you feel good in them I
do I feel very confident they go all the
way up to my belly button like they fit
high waist even though my hips are
pretty high so girl how do you like the
denim and how do they fit you first try
they fit so that's very rare you she's
like 20 in the dressing room you cry
take a few shots right ha ha ha here's
my thing is that I'm like a shorter
person so like finding jeans and I don't
have to like drag out to some man and
like get them hemmed every single time
and like these I slip them on and could
have like worn them out of the store but
I have like bigger hips and like bigger
like in this area so it usually it's
hard because the jeans are just always
too big on my leg and I feel like these
make my legs look really nice and they
are a bit cropped fit on me but I love
that they have the kind of the frayed
bottom because it looks purposeful
because I have longer legs I do like
yeah the frayed bottom on those as well
what do you normally look for in denim
like a high waist uh does that matter to
you loose any leg I'm late to the game I
just started doing my highways thing
well what is your normal like what's
your biggest complaint about denim
normally well I'm like more of a
leggings kind of person because I like
comfortable and I don't want to like eat
a sandwich and then like feel like I'm
gonna burst out these are so like
stretchy and nice then it's so good and
as I'm the queen in this house tada
yeah
carry on I think there I look like yeah
it's our place yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
