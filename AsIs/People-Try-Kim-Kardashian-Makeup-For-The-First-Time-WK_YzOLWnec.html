highlights in order to emphasize
different bone structures in your face
I'm pretty nervous I generally don't
wear makeup I'm very intrigued by
contouring and I've never tried it
before I'm doing this today because I'm
being forced to I'm actually really
excited about it aren't asked to I've
never known how to do it really then
someone said Kim Kardashian and I was
like isn't that what she looks like all
the time apparently she doesn't do it do
everything well see how it goes okay so
this is gonna hurt right no okay there's
no pain basically accentuating those
highlights and lowlights
am I the only guy getting over okay now
this is what your face looks like with
just the highlights and lowlights with
no blending oh my god okay oh my god
what the heck Wow well I was actually
expecting a lot less makeup on this
isn't real people don't do this take it
away
it's gonna look different than this
right I actually think this is gonna
look awful now
oh okay I need a second holy Shh oh my I
don't even look like myself no I can see
like parts of my face that don't you
stuffy how do you make sure your face so
well and like how do you even know to do
that only the more I keep looking at the
more I'm like oh no I do like it I still
look like myself but it's just a
different version of myself I would
thinner that's one thing I know that
looks thinner instead of like working
out like losing weight my face I can
just see it on contour every morning
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
