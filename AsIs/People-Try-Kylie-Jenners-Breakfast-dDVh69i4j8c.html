breakfast food holy
Oh Kylie she's a very influential teen
she appears to be more down to earth
than people might think I have a
love-hate relationship with the junior
Kardashian clan there's just something
to distract us from what's going on and
it's not good or bad
knowing Kylie Jenner I would think that
she just eats whatever she wants simple
easy to make breakfast but probably like
high quality ingredients Kylie seems
like a comfort food aficionado even it's
not what she eats every day I feel like
that's what she broadcast to people so
it looks like some turkey bacon yeah cuz
bacon bacon the fat would be a lot more
juice wait a minute
keeps a little bacon this bacon looks
really good tastes really good job I
mean that's bacon bacon bacon is great
they smell good like really like roasted
the potatoes look like potatoes that's
pretty good I like that she adds garlic
to it
really nice and seasoned I normally like
really hate breakfast potatoes you know
these potatoes have done it for me I
like it it's not a lot of protein going
on as breakfast this is very filling I
feel I don't like vegetables and there's
vegetables in this but I will eat it
because Kylie Jenner eats it if I had to
describe the taste of the sausage I
would say it's like gray the sausage is
very sweet this peppers dish is so cute
not a fan of the sausage it needs like
some mustard and ketchup this is a damn
good idea
I like to smell my food before I eat it
I smells like mine shows I taste a piece
of cinnamon that's it this is actually
like really good I like it what's good
it's very sweet and so I think this
might be like the dessert okay you know
what
I do like this now that I've shooted all
the way it perplexes me
Bravo Kylie Bravo rice with eggs I've
never been presented this idea before I
feel like we've all had scrambled eggs
mixed into rice but just like the way
that it's cooked in here I don't know I
don't like it that's good it is Xing
rice don't kind of weird this is Miss
ghosting I would rather have like an egg
sandwich maybe it's super sad honestly
you look at the plate and you think I
don't like this actually since
reassemble she's like so relatable but
then like you when you think about the
processes that you have to go through to
make specific aspects of it you start to
think yeah I probably would have time to
do this by myself
I think this is like a top-notch
breakfast it's very well-rounded I love
you Kylie but I don't love your
breakfast I think I just like really
basic combinations and she's just too
basic for me the breakfast potatoes I
will give an A to the French toast Oh
give an A to those can stay on my plate
everything else can go No
hell no it's just the breakfast of a
girl who's trying to be healthy but like
wants to live her life
they shine the size of all countries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
