favorite things makeup and dicks
this is probably the closest I've been
to a penis in like ten years my name it
just rolls out the tongue yeah flipped
ecliptic elliptic I'm hoping that it's
equal like there's uncircumcised and
circumcised by God I'm not ready for
that I came prepared so many penises so
a little time I won't lie it looks super
inviting that's a perfect whoa mushroom
tip mmm major cool points for the veins
the head is beautiful I'm sad that they
don't have real names they just have the
numbers on the back could you imagine
what you can name this thing exactly
like red tip all right playful pink I
might do I want Matt do I want Sheen I
mean this is like real white I like this
new D Brown I'm I'm a star it also looks
the most like a real dick I think here
we go baby sorry mom it's kind of nice
actually I don't mind the texture looks
good as hell it's definitely supposed to
be for a bachelorette party like you buy
these and you're like girls were going
out compared to a real day it doesn't
leave quite the mark well it doesn't
leave the emotional mark of a real dick
I thought the shape of the penis would
make it more difficult to put on but it
doesn't we both will only like one yeah
wipe on and it looks this bright which
is really cool honestly if you didn't
know this was shaped like a penis that I
just put all over my mouth you wouldn't
you want to know the color is great you
can't tell that there was a penis on our
faces I think it's like cool to give
people little double take you know like
is that no it
I licked it and I'm not mad at these
dicks probably cuz they're not attached
to a brain I feel like you'd look like a
boss ass bitch yep in public like this
is the day and age we live in right we
live in the era of lyft examen ISM I
really do find it empowering though
because you know like women are ashamed
for a like makeup they're shamed if we
showing interest in sex and it's like
BAM like I like both honestly I think
all lipsticks should be in the shape of
dicks from here on out you know it's a
normal lipstick it's kind of comfortable
very easy to put on and actually
decently pigmented I think I look pretty
 good I recommend dicks just this
once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
