house in California
so today we're gonna have three
different groups of people two couples
and a single gentleman come in and spend
a couple hours in my house and see what
it's like to live in a small space a
tiny house is a smaller home than a
traditional home then you may normally
think of it's on wheels or it's on a
traditional foundation and there's lots
of sizes and spaces it's whatever works
for you as tiny so this house is 112
square feet the trailer is 8 by 16 feet
in the interior living space is 6 by 13
plus the loft which is a queen-size bed
at 8 by 6 up there so you should at
least be able to lay down in the launch
do you have to get company while you're
here what would be a good password to
get in here alaa magic cups and glasses
are in here if you want to make tea or
anything it's not about making it
disappear it's about making the air not
touching okay that's what keeps it from
selling any questions you can materials
are about 25,000 and then I did the
labor myself if I'd had to pay labor it
would have been another 15 or 20,000 so
this is probably you know 40 or 50
thousand dollar house make yourself at
home thank you very much Hagrid's hut
feel like if Hagrid like how to wife and
she payments first things up I'm gonna
Instagram this moment hey wave hello it
was a real fiasco getting up there it
was it wasn't it was a fiasco and but I
mean this is part of the sacrifice so
facetiming people you guys want to see
the tiny house should i hashtag this
divorce in two hours so unsexy by like
getting out like this I will - you would
think come on okay so yeah I'm in case
it is we happen yeah I'll have one look
they're dogs oh this is the best thing
that's happened since I've moved into
this tiny house boiling tiny bubbles %
I don't wanna have to go the bathroom
again while I'm in this house that's the
thing is it basically two rooms
there's inside and outside they should
advertise these things like marriage
counseling
this is the only place for us to sit I
guess I feel like I'm learning so many
things about you that I never noticed
how do you know just from each other I
know you dip and look look how deep the
well is but don't put your fingers in
there I didn't hold it by the handle
this is a great time to be single I
can't imagine what the two couples were
like you barely know trust him the light
falls in the house hey let alone know
how to hang a photo stream there's no
place to go we need that flavor profile
with me this is on tight I did a lot of
the work okay little gloat moment cheers
to t42 in a tiny house no claustrophobic
so I'm keeping my eyes closed and doing
deep breathing exercises
I think the roof this close to me it's a
little freaky I'm sorry I mean we're not
wider than the doorframe we are how is
that possible in college I study
sustainable design and construction but
I never used EDS you're not like running
out to buy a tiny house right now I
don't think the tiny house thing is for
me
vodka
here I'm putting my legs straight out oh
wow I love it
have fun baby and might divorce you and
go Canada tiny house for one and just
tour the country not for us as a couple
but really cool experience I would like
to spend more time in kind of go from
place to place and see what it's like I
don't know who he's gonna do that with
and I understand that two people who
actually make tiny odds and go through
with it it's not a gimmick it's
something that they actually are doing
as a lifestyle and I think that's very
brave of them I think it's very
admirable I should have one improvement
we think that there should be a table in
the wall that you pulled down so you can
eat at it because we had to eat standing
up a fold-down table off the wall would
be a great addition I mean it's not for
me I'm too used to creature comforts I'm
enormous I'm six foot seven this is just
too small for me I think you really
learn to appreciate what you do have I
like to appreciate you yeah I think
would be fun to design somebody else's
tiny house
I guess not one that I had to be inside
of but I'm really appreciated I'm really
appreciative to that man for letting me
experience this tiny house firsthand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
