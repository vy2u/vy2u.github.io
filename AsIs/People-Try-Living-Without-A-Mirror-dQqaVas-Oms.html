that mirror over there to see what I
look like so looks like it's gonna be a
hard week
I'm one of those people who like doesn't
like to go out in public unless I know
how other people are seeing me I wish I
could say that I didn't care about my
appearance but that would be a lie how
many times were looking at mere five six
times a day I mean I use it like pretty
much all the time it's just like a
casual like walk by like oh hey cool
that's me this is what I look like in
who I am for writing how much I realize
how vain I am because I really do check
myself out a lot so this is my mirror
I'm getting ready to cover it for the
next week I taped up my mirror with a
garbage bag I took down all the mirrors
in my apartment look break anything I'm
a hotel is weekend there are mirrors
everywhere how do we have Muir's I'm
like five sounds like why is that
necessary if we go back to caveman times
there were no mirrors people probably
had better self-esteem when we were like
rolling rocks around I'd have to be like
Oh can't look over there there's a
window with the reflection Oh can't look
over there there's a mirror and I have
silver-plated faucets and all of a
sudden I see myself this world is filled
with reflective surfaces I swear that
first day was so fun because I just like
I imagined I looked awesome without
makeup
the first day people were kind of like
looking at me weird probably because I
looked like a hot mess or at least I
felt like I did I got to work realizing
I was gonna like weird people out
because they've never seen me without
liquid eyeliner
they were my sunglasses a lot more I
would like refuse to make eye contact
with them or like constantly look at the
ground I went to go meet some friends
for frozen yogurt I'm like looking for
social cues someone was like Michelle I
think you have something on your face
and I like rub my nose there was like a
huge piece of snot like just coming out
of my nose just like enough of like that
eyebrow lift that was like my mirror to
be like what oh I wanted to like brush
my teeth and look at myself hey why do
you look at yourself when you brush your
teeth the most restaurant was not being
able to check if I ate food in my teeth
I felt like I was a basic human right I
had my girlfriend help me shave are you
pretending solutions Madol none of this
- there you go a little higher over a
little bit yes super great look at this
very really I mean as good as it's gonna
get
yesterday I cheated I had a date and I
definitely looked in the mirror because
I wanted to make sure that I looked good
I wanted to feel good about myself
yesterday I was just like oh my gosh
this is really difficult I wanted to
stop doing this it was hard at first but
then it actually became pretty enjoyable
it actually freed me up even more to be
low maintenance today is day four I've
stopped gotta giving it back but I'll
think which is very free it felt like I
was on vacation takes me five minutes to
get ready I always feel like at the gym
like oh I'm looking in the mirror to
check my form but really I'm like
looking to criticize myself I noticed a
big difference the workout went way
faster because I wasn't sitting there
criticizing myself I didn't know I'd
have to look at myself in a mirror on
camera I'm dreading it a little bit oh I
don't look so bad it looks familiar it's
nice I look like this my fave is so
stupid
I'm over it man I don't want to like
myself anymore you should totally do
this challenge just to see like how
special it is to be able to look at
yourself if you don't have anything nice
to say about yourself don't look in a
mirror and I'm so much happier when I
don't have the opportunity to say those
things my goal was to look in the mirror
and kind of like instead of this past
week was probably the most body-positive
I felt about myself I was just so
surprised by what I think about myself
is what puts me down the most I'm the
one who's mean to myself like it's not
anybody else it's really just me
everybody should try this free ourselves
from the chain of the mirror I had to
lose it to appreciate it
I thought maybe by chance I turned into
that bitch but it didn't happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
