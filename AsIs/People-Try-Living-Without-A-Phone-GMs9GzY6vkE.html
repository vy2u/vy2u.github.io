yeah it's gonna stop it's gonna suck I
have a doctor's appointment later this
week and I think I'm gonna have to print
out a map I'm excited to like have like
moments of like being creative instead
of just like being on my phone I'm
having like a physical response to this
right now
so I've only walked this distance from
BuzzFeed to my car and I've already
reached in my pocket to make a call to
check my email and to check my facebook
each on separate occasions the struggle
is pretty real I'm still alive this is
getting impossible past weekend going to
San Francisco was really really really
hard I missed my friend's birthday party
so I went to a party this past weekend
the left side of me people were having a
conversation on the right side of me
people are having a conversation I
didn't have a phone to look at to keep
me occupied or anything this I do not
know where I am
so printing out map directions wasn't
that bad but once I made a wrong turn I
had to use like this tiny map they print
out to figure out how to correct it but
on the other hand people have used maps
for centuries
so they synced a mile and I was gonna
over and I realized that you can't use
an uber without having a phone I had to
use a landline at Home Depot I don't
really like asking people for favors and
this one felt like a weird a weird favor
but I feel like my thought processes are
more sophisticated because they're not
constantly interrupted by wanting to
check something I am however in fact
noticing when other people are seeming
distracted because they might be on
their phones on the road I realize how
many people are on their phones all the
time not having a cell phone makes you
like more culpable to your word of like
when you say something you sort of have
to show up no really that kind of made
me realize
how much easier things are when you just
have a someone to connect to someone
immediately doing this challenge has
made me really appreciate the privilege
that comes with having a cell phone that
I can connect with anyone whenever I
want at my leisure or in an emergency
and not everyone has that privilege
my focus improved allies for even just
watching movies or watching TV shows I
would totally recommend every single
person to do this I was a lot more
efficient with my time it means you look
at the world again I feel like this is
taboo I feel like that I'm not allowed
to have this it's a weirdly emotional
reunion but I can live without it I
don't think I think I'll have a greater
appreciation for my phone this is an
awesome piece of technology yeah I am
connected I'm plugged back into the
matrix right now downloading 144 290 401
emails oh this is crazy
all right now I can do banking that's
cool I don't want those messages
sometimes likes to be left alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
