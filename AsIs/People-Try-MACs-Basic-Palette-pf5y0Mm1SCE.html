admit that I am a basic bitch I like
pumpkin spice lattes I love fall I love
Halloween and I love the holidays so if
all that love for all those great things
makes me basic then here we are today I
am a stock photo of a white person I am
so generically Caucasian
that's even more basic do you put spice
on your chicken mmm
Brants it'll probably look a lot like
The Naked palette to be honest I feel
like that's like the most basic bitch
palette out there right now this
packaging pretty basic there's no real
pop of color in here but this is
completely all neutral tones maybe a
little bit of shimmer I guess that's the
pop you get
Flygirl mmm me me me yeah I can relate
to that text me later okay
miss personality because really that's
what matters is your personality I love
love this bitch very pigmented the
pigmentation is pretty decent I wouldn't
like to like a nice like bright pop from
love this bitch to be honest we are
going to go with Helen heels I'm a fan
of this I'm gonna start with sly girl I
don't know how much super I'm gonna get
so much on you know I'm trying to create
a basic dramatic smoky look or something
because I like dramatic looks drama it's
basic my god big white lie and I'm going
in right here in the corner oh and
that's a choice for sure I don't
understand how you relax one eye while
it's closed and open the other oh that's
real glitter I'm not a big glitter fan
oh okay
if Mac were a car what car brand would
max oh well once you look at these
colors you're gonna realize that every
girl on some level is basic because
every girl I know has a palette with
some of these colors at least it's just
taking everything that everyone likes
and it's putting it here I would be so
here for that I'm gonna get this
eyeshadow costs $75 oh
Oh almost certainly not this is a
completely uneducated opinion like all
makeup is too expensive right I liked it
is it actually very pigmented
and then like the sparkly colors if
you're really going for that Unicorn
basic special Oh nailed it
yeah probably for like a festival
concert maybe to a concert I would say
that this met all my expectations of
what a basic bitch pallet would be
you've got your mats
you've got your shimmers they're all
pretty neutral and I'm feeling feeling
pretty basic thanks Mac eyeshadow seems
like that's like the gateway makeup it's
like the entry level like I don't really
put on the makeup try this like oh
that's easy now I have a nun for
interface to wear more makeup if I had
cause to wear eyeshadow I would
absolutely wear this again it was a good
palette pigments are fantastic it was
easy to blend and you didn't need to
like really dig your brush into it in
order to transfer color to your eyelid
it really pops and if you say you don't
like pumpkin spice latte you're a lying
ass bitch that's what you are I want
them to a little bit of shimmer in it I
have needs now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
