at a Halloween party I don't get your
outfit but then the other person is like
no like like oh come on like you know
you know what this is whenever I go home
my mom always points out my acne first
before saying hi to me I eat like shit I
don't put anything on it although I feel
like now that I'm getting older I should
like start every Sunday I do like a
facial so I'll like steam my face with
essential oils I know that sounds insane
and kind of obsessive I don't get kind
of it together you try and rub your
masks this is scary
this is like what a serial killer wears
it kind of looks like a big skated baby
oh this is extreme I mean I feel like I
really like a mask that I cannot fuck up
my lips to see where oily no it's just
like a condom man I mean it is a rougher
I hope this works though I wonder
because it does seem like there's a lot
of beard coming in like your answer yeah
it doesn't feel like as precise as like
when you like slather on something that
hardens on your face ah
it is doing yeah it was fine I didn't
know fuck it doesn't stay on super great
I wonder if I can get my glasses on oh
yeah you could do this face mask on the
go I feel like my lipstick still looks
good I can have glasses like I could
work if I pull this off and my skin
isn't like a waterfall is great you
don't strike all blackheads all upcoming
pimples yes better be gone this is nice
I'm the more I wear this longer I'm
loving it I'm starting to get like very
spa vibes I just like slip out of the
chair I'm like
this has not been the most secure face
mask I've worn little clapping see
Exhibit A I think I might peel mine off
I feel good about it it feels like I
feel refresh it looks like it took off
some skin yeah it looks like I still got
some stuff yeah some oils
um you can tell it took off a bit of my
concealer under my eyelashes I'm like
maneuver my face my tiny face in such a
way to like make it stay on perfectly
that was kind of frustrating but I feel
like if I was just like I'm tired I'll
lay down I would just like lop it on if
someone else pay for it I will
definitely say that my skin feels more
elastic so I do feel a different
something definitely happened
between now and when I walked into this
room but I don't know what I would try
this again I would probably wait for it
to go on sale that would just buy like a
bunch
