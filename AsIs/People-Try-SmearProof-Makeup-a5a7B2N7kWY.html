just cry as much as I want to and eat
more today we're trying smear proof
makeup by lip ink it says it's cruelty
free it's vegan it's organic and it's
the approved waterproof semi-permanent
why have we never heard of it makes me
suspicious I've seen so many ads for so
many products through the years and none
of them ever worked for me my eyeliner
fades a lot the shine coming through
your lip liner starts to like fall down
into your chin I'm so used to looking
like a raccoon through the day that I
carry q-tips in my pockets it's really
hard to find something smear proof that
also feels good on so I'm excited to try
it let's do it 11 steps to put on
lipstick what the this is like an
Ikea packet of instructions so step one
is to purify it girls like water face
massage a small amount of tinted
moisturizer to lift until thoroughly
observe machine is really pretty though
it feels like I'm putting Burt's Bees on
my lips it burns like like a UTI
on my mouth oh wait I have to repeat
step seven and eight twice
it does come out clumpy and when I try
to go over it it gets clumpy Christy is
live what the heck it's like a seafoam
green that is blue this isn't a great
mascara doesn't seem to stick on very
well kind of burn I think they look good
oh I like this one more this is just an
interesting texture I'm really into the
shadow my full face is on think I'm
ready these lips are atrocious it's a
lot of steps but I'll do a lot of steps
if it'll last all day but I got to be
honest we're off to a rough start
do you like my makeup what's different
what's different oh you didn't do one
eye you know my brow it did not transfer
when I was drinking and eating clean is
also usually it does get on my spoon or
it'll get on a straw and I didn't notice
that at all I'm eating the curry and
it's completely staying put what the
heck
although it is crusty still it did last
for kissing I totally transferred right
there I started crying it just watched a
video
three ninety when they were praised by
different families and I'm fine but how
does my makeup look much prettier
stayed on I will say the plus to this is
that it is really sheer and I mean it's
definitely got some hold to it but the
negatives are is that it's kind of all
over the place I just went for a run and
a lot of it came off and what's gross is
that clumps of the lipstick came off and
it felt like play-doh so I guess it's
not waterproof it's in three hours and
my lipstick is a little worse for wear
I'll tell you one thing though my
eyebrows are not moving the
verdict is how do I be polite is this
smear proof no is it long wear yes just
don't touch it it wasn't waterproof it's
not smear proof I don't know if it's
organic I can't tell the eye makeup
stayed on it ellipse sets and other
stories like with my eyebrows are green
these are the one things that stayed on
all the effort it took to put on the
makeup is just as much effort to just
kind of clean yourself up or maintain
your makeup I guess I'm happy with my
makeup that's what you heard
want to watch us have a threesome then
click here and watch am I doing this
right free on watch we're not having
three shut up and make up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
