Guy right now we're trying this viral
Facebook
I've had really bad cystic acne for
about eight years my acne is not just a
vanity thing and also it's very painful
I've been getting a lot of fast food
specifically Popeyes so I've been
breaking out pretty bad my skin type is
combination you know I'll be fine for a
couple of days and then out of the blue
a pimple will pop up my skin is very
oily and it's very acne prone a little
nervous you see on the side here it says
feel your face pulsate
it smells like well you would think clay
would smell like
it feels pretty much like powder sugar
directions say mix clay with equal parts
of raw apple cider vinegar and or water
I read in the reviews that it was better
to use apple cider vinegar than water
this shit is tight on my face sorry
you're gonna have the front row seat but
I really want to show you guys how flaky
this is I'm kind of feeling the
pulsating sensation right now so I just
rinsed it all off my skin is a little
bit red but they said that that's normal
and it should decrease within 30 minutes
so I just woke up I gotta say I think my
complexions actually a little bit better
my skin was a lot softer than it usually
is today patches
um the redness over here or fade it away
but it's still there but it just
decreased in size
you really only need half a tablespoon
of the powder itself
yeah fYI have these little brushes you
can get pretty much anywhere like any
beauty supply store they're like two
dollars and they make all the difference
so I left the mask on for a little bit
longer today and my skin is still so
tight like I almost feel like I still
have the mask on I'm feeling it just a
little bit dry because I have
combination skin so I'm gonna put some
of my moisturizer on just so that it
doesn't dry my skin out
my skin is really clear my pores feel
really clean and even if this is doing
nothing at the very least I feel like
I'm taking an extra step to take care of
myself so that's great the last night of
our face mask experience because we
think that after this for a while
consecutively for so many days already
it would be parked my life no I'm still
a Z and it's like huge commitment I just
want to see my dermatologist and she
actually told me my skin was looking
really good the mass is doing something
I'm gonna keep using it been a good day
honestly my skin feel amazing my pores
have minimized on my cheeks I wouldn't
do this every day because it is very
laborious
however I would incorporate this into my
skincare regimen
on my left side I noticed that my
smaller pimple stuff totally disappeared
if there was any redness it definitely
reduce in size it was okay I would do it
again I probably will do it again
because it's fun and its really
refreshing like it smells good and it
feels tingly but I don't think I'm like
in it for life with this unfortunately
my skin is really smooth right now and a
lot of the acne I had at the beginning
of this is pretty much gone I kind of
just decided for no real reason to not
put on face makeup for most of the week
and it wasn't as scary as I thought it
would be whether truly was working or
not maybe it was like a placebo effect
but it was really nice to to go out for
once with no makeup and be like you know
whatever this is what my skin looks like
and I'm just gonna do it
