Zack and I'm saying this a lot of
dating apps out there but only one that
has a reputation of being the world's
most exclusive so what is the leak and
do my friends and I have what it takes
to get in so I've heard a little bit
about this app called the lead if we're
gonna be real here I have a pretty
negative impression of it just going in
I feel like it's for like boozy people
cuz it's called the lead
what is the lead so I think of the
league as a community built for high
achieving singles like me look maybe
well-well take a look at what you got
the app is gained notoriety for being
quote a tinder for elites but Amanda
sees it as serving a function in a
currently crowded marketplace do you
really not want to play at all there's
not really been a community for kind of
ambitious high achieving people that can
find each other and I like to say we're
trying to create power couples hell yeah
I want to be a power couple and in order
to create the power couples of tomorrow
the league is employed a highly
selective vetting process so our wait
list is over a hundred thousand yeah
what it's kind of like we're trying to
weigh everything like almost like a
college admissions where they're
personal essay section no yeah so my
friends and I are going to apply and
find out just what it takes to join the
league BAM bitch we gotta live you got
it no boy yours no games no noise
looking for potential soul mates
maybe I'll love it maybe I'll get
married just that would suck um two
young my starting profile picture is me
on a bouncy castle with big bird on my
lap I might need a better photo one of
the things that we could do to kind of
improve each step of our application cuz
I'm not above cheating to get in small
small crop and I'm a big hunk of corn so
huh oh no him when we ended the
County Fair this metaphor is dumb look
I'm gonna get into the league probably
guessing that high quality photos
have almost like a 20% increase in light
yeah currently like this is one of my
pics like that's not cute but then also
are kind of presenting different aspects
of you saw professionals pose I have
like a green mush stain on my shirt
you need to have HD pics to get in the
league oh man I take all my photos on an
iPhone 4 I'm
we want to see different sides of you
throw me Oprah Winfrey I love bread I
look like a real estate agent we're in
the league look at what is in look at
that face look at that
 cream their pants my CIS that's
gross gross disgusting photos of your
dog do you have a dog I could get a dog
you got my dogs
good god they're dogs that deserve dog
up here this hard we didn't find a dog
we did find a cake are you okay don't
bite me oh the things I do you get
into the dating are actually I forgot to
tell you
photos with costumes are like 18%
increase in popularity yeah it is good
for a dating profile
that's cute if I put on my profile I can
say that I made this because we have
your Facebook and your LinkedIn we can
look at LinkedIn yeah we get your
LinkedIn I don't have a LinkedIn here
you go no this is the problem with LA
it's asking me what causes I care about
I'm just gonna click all of them I was
in tourists for dog breeding
I've been around dogs that
 but there is sort of an influence
score that we have in the algorithm
where if you have like you know a ton of
Facebook friends that is gonna help you
kind of move up the wait list faster
except except I'm just expecting
everybody I don't give a you said
volunteering yeah some people that have
started nonprofit started a non-profit
hi my name is Jenna jor-el oh and I'm
calling about possibly citing your
charity as my own creation on LinkedIn
okay um thank you so much for taking
time if I don't hear from you I would
assume it's okay okay I mean we just met
yeah
what do you think my chances are I think
you might be able to do something with
your humor so yeah I can say with you
used to that no I'm excited to see if
you get in Joe I can't do
so today's today we find out if we got
on to the league I feel good about my
profile this is definitely the most I've
ever done for dating at I'm over it I
just want to know all right I'm gonna
open up the app now okay I thought I was
gonna have a message I don't know I
guess that's enough there's one too many
animal pic damn the ethics I don't have
friends and it said the cry laughing
emojis like it's laughing at me that's
rude I didn't get in you guys I didn't
get into the league your photos could
use some work especially those last two
I can't see you and also missing it
about me which tells me you don't care
that much I didn't fill out the about Me
section well obviously I would have
gotten in if I doesn't unfortunately you
have been wait-listed on the account of
being a bit too basic
apparently we have too many five eight
Jewish white men right now ah really I
really thought that I was gonna be the
one get in so oh my gosh you have
officially been drafted into the league
I got it oh my god check out the talent
I am I'm just overwhelmed I feel like I
just won an Oscar yeah I don't really
not really like her just based on the
numbers that they have and clearly not
enough black balls
hey maybe that's their decision and
mistake right now I'm single as and
I love it I'm good I did everything they
told me to I had a one-on-one with the
 creator of the app and I still
got rejected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
