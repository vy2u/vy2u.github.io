makeup bags to these lovely ladies guess
which bag is this just based off of
their headshots I don't want to cheat
like by looking at foundations to skin
color today okay good that's this one
way to keep me guessing hey let's just
go ahead and dive into it right all
right so we're gonna start with this big
red Mae majima
this is a suitcase this one's super
organized a lot of eyelashes they're a
drag queen amongst these crew this is
amazing
this woman is extra she's prepared for
anything this is the evacuation plan I
think I saw like a couple canteens in
here I saw like the nuclear codes she's
ready and she's gonna take on the world
with this bag I'm hoping this goes to be
because this is truly amazing she seems
smart she seems like a badass bitch see
I'm gonna go a C on that one okay we
have Urban Decay's Naked palette but hi
you're missing an entire square what
happened lots of brushes in here they
hold up what is this I know this is some
kind of brush but why is it shaped like
this what is this brushing for the
hard-to-reach places or something but I
don't know what this brush is so I'm
just gonna put it back you can tell that
they've used this bag for a long time
because it's totally dirty inside she
seems klutzy but she also seems fun
because of the color of this bag e she
seems like a fun girl d I'm gonna go eat
here she looks a little bit ahead of the
curve
right off the bat I see a two-faced
palette I see a Beautyblender and I see
some MAC lipstick this girl knows what
she's doing
but this person either way if they had a
Beauty Blender it looks like it would be
clean this is really fun
this lady is ready to party they have
some really good quality brushes in here
ready for a night on the town so I'm
gonna say this person seems like a more
of a minimalist she knows how to pack
light and I respect that
girl letter A D my girl B is is that one
all the way okay this feels like a
pencil case quite low maintenance which
is not a bad thing I love I love a girl
who can just put on mascara and some lip
and then walk out the door it's totally
cool so this person has sparkly purple
eyeshadow in their bag purple is just a
bold color so this person kind of given
me bold yes I'm gonna automatically off
the bat say that this goes to T she has
a really warm smile to her and seems
really like low-key chill kind of girl
very classy so definitely blue goes to D
blue belongs to a she would like makeup
and when she does like makeup she would
do it to stand out
hence the purple eyeshadow you following
guys he's fallen
there's my I'm like the Sherlock Holmes
of makeup bags today this one the most
compact of the bunch I would say also
feels like a brick Oh
pulled it out right away that's Chanel I
don't even know Chanel made makeup wow
she even has the covers still on her
eyes shadows who does that eight gives
me uh she gives me a little bit of a
fashionista she gives me a little West
Coast vibes West Coast vibes a lot of
labels you know I mean it's got to be
see it has to be see she has that face
of like I'm classy Hey
the timeless chic classic let's uh let's
go with Sea
did a pretty decent job
III give myself a little pat on the back
here definitely not one to judge a lady
by her makeup back but uh if I did judge
her by makeup bag I might not be too far
off just sayin
in the end guys makeup is truly for
everyone you can wear whatever you want
wear how many products you want it
doesn't matter as long as you feel
beautiful all it matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
