highlighters for paper no I am a little
disappointed I thought we were actually
going to be highlighting our vaginas I
um just recently started wearing
highlighter and it's my part of my like
I put on my foundation I put on
highlight sometimes it's like the only
thing I wear I think it's that important
I don't really use highlighters maybe
vaginas are the answer they are yeah
vaginas are beautiful and they're all
different so I'm expecting to see like
an array of colors array of shapes and
sizes smells who knows
oh is excited to try a new highlighter
always excited to see new vagina shaped
things are beautiful these are just
water which is really look like they
definitely do look like vaginas the hood
there's the clip what else tell him
that's it that's all I got Oh oh my gosh
this is not gonna be a one-night n I
didn't take it home this might be a
one-night stand this rainbow on there
very sparse so cute look like great um I
shadows - honestly yeah this is
multi-purpose vaginas not for one use
you're so dreamy look at that I feel
like time she's getting a makeover who
ty I'm clueless I never felt foolish

really heavy but I feel like I would use
this massage

oh that's pretty
oh you're a beautiful starfish oh oh oh
clearly this isn't like something that
you would go to like the market would
move your truth this isn't my truth oh I
feel like with other products when you
think of them being like vagina
something or like penis something
everyone's like oh that would be just
for bachelorette parties like no you
sort of like what exactly vaginas are
which are just like beautiful perfect
for everyday use I'd like to see some
some variety in the shape and size and
colors of the vaginas but other than
that it makes like okay highlighter and
vaginas are doe makeups fun vaginas are
fun you should be proud of your body
and wear on your face weird on your face
why not if you're not ready to handle
the shape the smell and the taste of
Aegina you ain't ready to be around the
jam Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
