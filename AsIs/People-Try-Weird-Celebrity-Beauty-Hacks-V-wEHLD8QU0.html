face right now today we're having a
really strange meal I think none of this
belongs on your body I play things very
safe I don't want to rub no eggs on my
face I don't want to put no mail in my
hair I put ketchup on my hair before I
put egg on my hair was because the
internet told me to yeah Scarlett
Johansson uses apple cider vinegar on
her face according to my interview she
did a Scarlett Johansson uses it then
I'm okay with it alright celebrities
where the did you get this one from
let me guess the Internet so apparently
this will reduce inflammation balance
oil production and exfoliate with citric
acid shake it shake it oh it smells bad
oh so strong why didn't I put it under
my nose let me see what you look like do
I look like Scarlett no in the post can
you just like put her face on my face I
don't know how it's supposed to feel but
it feels kind of good this hurts my eyes
unless it looks amazing this hack is not
worth it Scarlett Johansson you do this
alone I'm gonna pass we're trying oils
with coconut oil it's supposed to give
you fresh breath fight gingivitis and
fight plaque oh it's 3,000 years old I
don't care I just want whiter teeth what
if Paltrow endorses this Gwyneth Paltrow
is also friends with Beyonce so through
the transitive property we are one step
closer to being friends Beyonce it looks
like little bombs the texture of it is
just so unappealing you don't need that
much you're not that's a lot oh it did
Oh God no oily just the noise is like
setting please tell me how you're
feeling
hmm it doesn't taste like coconut it
tastes like hardened olive oil no he
thinks he's friends with Beyonce
something like mm-hmm
we're gonna go you look way less brother
changer by the way thank you
we're gonna be using digestive relief
medicine for the face mask this hack
went by roll and Victoria Secret model
Devin Windsor Wars selfie and snapchat
back in January 2017
it's absorbs oils massive skin
exfoliates dead skin cells how can I do
all that but also settle my stomach I
don't trust that should only be used by
people with oily skin hello
me too here goes nothing Cheers go put
on a pimple you smell delicious I you
know I feel delicious thank you oh oh
it's dripping I'm having fun now it just
feels like arts and crafts time I feel
like we're bonding I don't want to do
this anymore
my skin feels really soft yeah it was
very easy to apply easy to take off so
that was good very impressed never doing
it again plus one so apparently this is
helpful for thick and frizzy hair which
like hello that is my life Blake
Lively's into this and she's obviously
better than the rest of us um Ben
doesn't have thick curly or frizzy hair
so he's gonna help me apply all right
it's happening it's happening 23 go.if
late can do it I can do it oh my god I
need a mirror I don't want to do this
blind I know you have to it's okay just
trust me I know what I'm doing I'm a
professional there's a 0% chance I'm
doing this right it's squeaking this is
it this is me now we're gonna let this
mayonnaise mask sink in and see if it
does anything feels dreamy
knocks off first
impression is that this smell terrible
and they feel smooth it works I feel
like the oil pulling for me I would do
it again you just have to get past that
like chunk once you let it dissolve it
feels great
I love the oil pulling I think that's
gonna actual legit hack that I could do
because I already use coconut oil for
like other things also a perk of it is
that it like ends up on your lips and my
lips are chapped anymore a lip gloss
topic mm-hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
