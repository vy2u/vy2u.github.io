Kardashians stay swearing that they
started some God and start breaking off
a KitKat girl what's up guys my name is
Hal I make videos here at BuzzFeed in
New York this morning I'm supposed to be
making a video and all I've been doing
is watching these really strange videos
if the Kardashians on YouTube I have all
of these weird food hacks after watching
these videos I thought to myself I
definitely want to make my co-workers
try these out first I'm watching a video
by Chloe called cookie jars god she's so
beautiful
Khloe looks amazing like people are
watching Chloe organize her cookies this
isn't even a real it isn't even a recipe
it's oh but the keys in a jar looks like
it would take six to seven hours oh no
I'm sweating this is making me so angry
I don't want to say dumb but this is
dumb I'm going to now try Khloe's cookie
jar hat I'm already regretting it just a
wig a Kardashian way more 30 what you
know what we live once who wants to eat
cookies that you've all touched I
honestly forgot what she said
Chloe how'd you do that with those
cookies in the jar well let me make a
four-minute video showing you how how
many of y'all have time to go home
from your 905 and organize some cookies
I don't you know what I don't wanna do
this anymore I'm done with this this is
it this is all I'm doing let me show
y'all the essent tag throw them joints
in there like so this is the farthest
thing from a hack
mmm tastes exactly the same out of the
jar out of the package seemed time I
have time guys it does not take six
steps to eat a KitKat you open the paper
and you put the KitKat in your mouth
step one of this is break the KitKat the
way everyone fix the kid pad this
doesn't work with your Kit Kat is
remotely melted there's no way no
no no no no this is not a thing
okay Courtney the cookie in the jar is
like level one this is like level ten
she says in the video if you do it this
way you'll never want you to KitKat
another way and don't know if that's
true but we'll find out right now you
eat a piece of one in make a big mess
doing this I feel like a squirrel a
legit don't remember the fifth step look
at that and she sticks in the landing
hello Courtney might be honest I'm
figure that's where it is wafer it
tastes better than it normally does how
do I anyone else who's doing this money
is never it's not different it's the
same exact thing it's kind of fun to
just try does he dig me do it this is
just like psychotic behavior this is
insanity this wig is doesn t the same
cooking with Kylie cinnamon roll waffles
I can absolutely get down with that
Sheena bass uppity cinnamon rolls in
this waffle maker I'm not no mm-hmm
I love pills various and minerals I'm
already irritated the idea is definitely
good that definitely sounds good to me
I can probably pop it against this right
oh whoa all right so I'm gonna put that
here I'm gonna press down I don't know
what it's done
No all these are actually really cute
are you kidding me look how good these
look how I don't want to see any
comments about what this looks like
not a one obviously that's good I had no
doubt Kylie I'm with you that's amazing
that's the best thing I've ever tasted
this is the most happiest of the hags
back on the Kardashian train back on
overall I do think the Kardashians are
geniuses I've always thought this even
before the food hacks one is a hack the
two others are just like here's what I
do
the best would be Kylie I feel like it
was the most hacky you do think that
Kylie's waffle iron hack was genius
two or three million people watched to
talk for three minutes about organizing
some damn Double Stuf Oreos so you and
girl you still win I guess uh Kim
Kourtney Khloe Kylie kendall easy
ladylike is moving to our own new
