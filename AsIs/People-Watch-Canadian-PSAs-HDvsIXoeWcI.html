effective because if it's effective then
by all means continue to do this weird
 I've heard stories of Canadian PSAs
guys on moose nice how would you say
more than one moose I've never heard of
Canadians doing anything wrong so I
don't know what they could be PSA about
if no I'm well so far this is a
commercial for futuristic cars or Bionic
body limbs he doesn't look like a robot
so much as like a weird ass alien she's
got her ass on check though doing squats
for days so the robot arm fell off and
it says I can put my arm back on but you
can't play safe in the playground I
wouldn't have guessed that it was for
war amputees this is more abstract art
than PSA so we're watching don't put it
in your mouth oh it's the Muppets on
crack this is a two-minute PSA this
makes me want to put things in my mouth
that I shouldn't put in my mouth
guys like this is very weirdly sexual
sexually exclusive don't put her here
now no in about 2h days as someone you
love to put so I gotta ask my mom if
it's okay to put it in your mouth then
I'm an elephant I am look like favio I
don't think this line is eaten in a
while
Maine is really clear yeah so like when
they say don't put anything your mouth
apparently he took it apparently it just
means don't eat ever oh no this is like
worse than labyrinth was needles
innocence
I guess that you have drugs but do you
have to have them stabbed into your hand
did you see this one pill that's like
hanging on his pinky
they don't have whites in their eyes
what happened to her lip look at her lip
what is that
who the are these concerned
children's advertisers and what are they
doing this is called head just simply
titled he's gonna have IBS oh that's
hopped off is his body what he's hungry
and like they want him to use his head
so like choose the right she's the right
food love him let me brush cavitate lace
let's eat some organics okay that's
really scary and now like he's just
grabbing a Tupperware container I don't
know what's in there it's a flight so
like I'm trying to think of what healthy
food could be white yogurt Canadian
bacon it makes so much sadder you even
know that use your head when it comes to
eating habits and I'm like but you don't
even see what you're what he's eating
there's nothing in its translucent
eating nothing I get that they try to be
creative and like appeal to the masses
but I mean it did make me want to do it
and I like I said long live kids you're
not gonna live you don't eat anything
kids it's not a baby hippo shut up are
those real house hippos he'll know they
have miniature hippos in Canada how
freaking cute that's a lie there's no
such thing as the house set though or is
there you're so cute I want one of my
house I hated it
way to ruin my dreams in a matter of
seconds I feel like I was falsely
advertised - this is about like
questioning what's on media is that is
that what what they said yeah I think
it's saying believe everything you see
on TV that was a really roundabout way
of getting to that next time I want to
relay a message to someone I'm gonna use
puppets and hippos you're cool Canada
like y'all were cool when I came up
there so maybe your PSAs have gotten
better
let's hope so maybe no one in Canada
watches TV
