this is the person who sits next to me
guys foot up on the desk flip-flops
flip-flops you went on my swag you went
you went on my swag you went on my swag
on my swag swag radar hey I'm Alaska oh
hi I'm Sarah my style I like comfortable
clothes I think I a lot of times like I
intend to dress nice and then I just end
up looking like pepper and things I
gotta have my wardrobe anything
camouflage gotta have that yeah I would
say that I dress like a cartoon
character like kind of like an adult
sort of East Coast cartoon character
yeah I don't know I sort of just like to
dress kind of fun rule number one no
jeans that makes sense
jeans are not part of a suit rule number
two no repeating outfits I can mix and
match cool rule number three I must wear
the suit for at least 12 hours a day
okay that seems doable yeah I guess I'm
awake for 12 hours so we're out here to
buy me a suit to wear for a week we got
a budget of 225 I'm gonna try to get
fresh today get a suit gonna wear for a
week you know let's do this
I found a really nice blaze around say
oh that's actually like really
high-quality the only thing was I didn't
paint for very strangely sighs and we're
all too small for me even though I'm
very small he's like my butt was just
like popping out of him it was not a
good situation so right when I put on
the suit I instantly felt way more
grown-up I walked out to the fitting
room and the guy was like damn in like
you look good everyone in the office is
just gonna be like shocked us on me when
I'm walking I see them chit chat shoot
so I am definitely feeling way more
confident today it is day 2 I mean my
boss has said like five times today like
I still can't believe that you look like
that like you look great this is my
casual look cuz as planned I'm
definitely getting a little more used to
it but I'm very sweaty just wearing a
suit is like I'm on the limitless drug
everyone respects me everyone looks at
me everyone gives me compliments it's
amazing you know it was an interesting
experience for sure layers sure place
dragon equals sweaty at work the first
day was brutal the first day I just
could not handle it because like my
pants were too tight and like my bell oh
and a lot of people are saying I look
like Vince McMahon also eating was hard
because like I didn't want to get
anything on the suit I'm wearing my suit
but I'm eating ramen so I have many many
nephews I would come home and look at
myself in the mirror and just be like
proud of my image and that I took the
time to put myself together that I
normally wouldn't do hi we're very
I'm sure you're very glamorous cool and
warm all the pockets the best thing is
the pockets how you can store anything
in there the most powerful validation I
got was actually from myself
just make you look good yeah I feel like
suits are almost like it's like a
superpower just one item of clothing
like no matter what you feel confident
in whether it's like a sweatshirt or
suit or whatever you know if you feel
confident powerful in it that's pretty
dope you wink oh my swag you ain't you
ain't on my swag you ain't on my swag on
my swag swag no you ain't on my swag you
ain't you ain't on my swing oh my god
