call me acrylic this feels like a step
up so today we're trying on crazy long
nails I'm excited to do this because I'm
pretty open to body modification
apparently painted my nails like in
middle school or any ones are twice in
high school no nail salon experience a
lot of women do it so we know why can't
men do it too I had a cousin who like
wore her nails very very long long curly
kind I always wondered how she wiped her
ass I'm worried that they'll be too long
I work in IT so I can't type it really I
can't do my job at all wiping my ass is
a worry how you living your life right
now how's that going for you you look
kind of like this kind of extra my
grandmother's nails
really always she's probably where I get
it from so let's see what her reaction
is
stifle the nails that I got made using
my hands pretty much impossible I had to
move some boxes for work and I broke two
nails doing that so now I'm stuck with
these emo kid nails it was harder than I
thought it was good I'm just spinning
yeah this is my life now Hammond so I
asked people to do things for me a lot
of the time can you go in that part of
my sense which one is zipper and there's
a perfect you use your hands all the
time and you don't think about it until
you can't couldn't even take a leak open
a door I went home and I like tore them
off so I could finish my work day so now
that I've trimmed it down yeah I can
breathe again and now I'm back to this
really cool scene kid so come in the
house and the first thing my mom wants
to know is you got your ghetto girl
nails on but I didn't think about where
the implications of being black is mom
like are like nails it comes with like a
stigma it was a challenge I will say I
think I would do it again if there was
acrylic involved I would wear nails
again I just wouldn't give them as goofy
the first thing I think I'm gonna do is
take a cuz it's over dude the
bright side was that I like gesturing a
lot it made me feel very like you know
grandiose are you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
