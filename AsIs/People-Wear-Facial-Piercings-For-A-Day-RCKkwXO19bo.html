and I can't scratch it there's a lot of
reasons why I haven't gotten facial
piercings before the number one is that
my mother would probably disown me if I
did feel like maybe back in the day in
the 90s especially it was like kind of
rebellious thing but now it's just kind
of like glare when I see facial
piercings on other people I immediately
think damn that's a badass I'm gonna be
wearing a septum and then also on the
side of my nose yeah I am gonna do the
septum and the outer nose it's gonna try
to keep it to one area we don't need to
get too crazy I'm gonna be wearing a
septum which I'm stoked out of a lip
ring which I'm hesitant about I'm just
worried about it being like whoa that's
a lot of jewelry okay
the nose rings are in I'm not the
biggest fan of this one I feel like it's
eating my face this is gonna take some
getting used to
what are we doing what are we doing what
are we doing I'm just like all over the
place like this is too much I like it
with the beard and the mustache I'm not
mad about it it's just you don't look
like yourself mm-hmm like I feel like I
couldn't approach you as easily as I
could approach you I think you pull it
off looks good looks great on you this F
damn right yeah
my friend has to go too much what do you
mean it's nice yeah yeah it's very gold
know what you trying to do here I'm
eating all this pizza so can I keep like
all my skinny nose ring like little
burger Oh like I'm gradually clean this
I wore a septum and a nose ring piercing
for one entire day and it was hell
so waking up fine and then I had to put
this shit in my nose and it was like
tickling all my nose hairs all day long
just like tickle tickle tickle tickle
it's like making me want to sneeze when
I got to work I went to my desk good at
all the people lady like we're freaking
out yeah the septum was really cute I
think you could go for either both
together is a little much but either I
think yes I had a lot of people that
weren't sure if I had always had the
septum or not they just like couldn't
tell could remember or not because it
looks so good I should get one yeah so
we had to post a picture on Instagram
with our piercings and people were
really nice people loved it I was really
surprised I literally got zero negative
responses like at least three friends
text me oh my god is that real people
were vicious like they came for me I was
like okay first of all bitches it's fake
also it's my body my choice right I can
do whatever the fuck I want with my body
it was really cool because it almost
came with a level of confidence like
walking down and you're like yeah I have
piercings on my face I'm that person and
like not giving any fucks about anyone
else I'm pretty much as basic as they
come when it comes to like fashion stuff
so trying something new like this
definitely like was eye-opening and I
think I kind of want to like do more of
these like things I'm getting ideas
bitch I think it's so cool and you can
experiment with stuff like this without
having to commit to the full piercing
and just play around and see what works
and then surprisingly like you can make
anything work like as long as you wear
it with confidence it totally works
cool basic hmm basic cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
