y'all already know I'm playing and basic
regular fur makes me really sad because
it's like you're pretending to be that
yeah I think I kind of worry that
because it's becoming a big trend that
also means like real fur and wearing
real fur is a big trend I do feel a
little bit guilty because part of me is
a little bit excited since this is like
kind of a trendy thing but I also do
feel a little guilty because I am
perpetuating an industry that slaughters
animals so we'll see how I feel at the
end of the day
okay wearing the first what are your
thoughts on like me wearing fur like in
general it's definitely a statement is
so glamorous I just want to pet it I
love this coat why do you look really
good you kind of look like something
that I would see in a magazine be like I
never see I would never be able to pull
that off but you're pulling it off what
do you think of a fact that it's faux
fur I think hell yeah so fur you get to
look plus it's not as expensive very
dangerous exactly
oh it's real fun no it's not right oh
hey honey
bleh I have very mixed feelings I have a
faux fur jacket I wear it all the time I
love it it makes me feel very glamorous
but I don't I would never go real fur I
mean in an ideal world I love what's
real sir feels like but I would never
get one animals what do you think of my
faux fur jacket aesthetically I love it
environmentally I believe that those
guys are pretty bad for the environment
I wore fake fur for the day and it
wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna
be I was surprised that I liked it I
don't think anyone assumed that it was
real mostly because I'm not rich people
were like why is he wearing fur honey
they were gagging I did have a co-worker
tell me that especially like brightly
dyed faux fur is really bad for the
environment because of plastics I feel
like it kind of makes me want to look
more into the clothes that I wear wear
what you want to wear live your life the
way you want to live it twirl in the
streets if you want to do that I do
think that I'll think twice about the
types of products that I buy in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
