promise we're gonna do it with new and
improved looks that we were wear to prom
today my prom look was amateur it was
very baggy and mismatched the cherry on
top was a beautiful felt read fedora
with a leopard print band on it I didn't
go to prom I went to after prom after
prom outfit you would have thought it
was something I just found in my closet
but it was actually something that I
went looking for in multiple stores for
about two months with my mom it was a
journey to get to that very simple
simple 10 outfit so my prom look was
like blue it was long there were a lot
of ruffles in there I think I had some
jewels up in there I literally decided
to go to prom the morning up and so I
had to make do with what I could find if
I could redo it it would be a lot more
free and flowy and just be warm me I've
been roasted pretty hard for my prom
outfit in the past so I'm hoping to
redeem myself in the eyes of my friends
and show the world that I can be spiffy
we're gonna need some help today so
we're gonna get Megan O'Connor celebrity
stylist to come in and slay our looks my
name is Megan O'Connor and I'm a fashion
stylist with resources like breadth a
runway and the black tux it's really
easy to not have an awkward prom photo
nowadays we'll really showed his
personality the first time around and I
didn't want to lose that I knew I wanted
to keep with style pattern and something
fun an eclectic that showed his
personality I really wanted to show her
ethereal beautiful simplistic style but
with a bold statement like a pop of
color something with a good vibe little
sparkle and shine that could show her
personality
it's a tux like I like I guess I didn't
get a regular suit this is my look and I
think I look pretty spiffy relax ladies
relax you guys think you might have seen
this look before you have I'm now the
dancing emoji girl the stylist pretty
much hit it with some I guess unexpected
surprises
one being the vest I love the
mix-and-match of colors and this I never
would have thought to mix blue green and
black together but it works like magic
honestly sometimes I find that things
that fit me up top don't fit me in the
bottom and it can make things like
shopping and trying to find certain
dresses really really difficult
the stylist really brought the best of
my personality out in these clothes I
like shiny stuff so we got it with the
shoes got my little shiny shiny shoes
there I'm loving that you're gonna have
to give your girl height you know I look
like a snack or in the words of
prophetic cardi B I am a meal and an
entree okay the pants have a nice taper
to them so they look like they actually
fit I've got a fun bowtie suspenders
that actually stand out from the shirt
and a pocket square I definitely feel
like I can get down at prom with this Oh
Nene okay okay okay a little
Oh feel like I am the prom queen where's
my crown bitches let's go ask my toe
work is what they think of 2018 prom
will ya nope you better say something
nice because if not okay just get it but
like 400 is it have a nice yeah would
you go with me I would go to you in a
heartbeat damn look at you
they're even going to prom oh my god the
problem I am
this is hashtag prom 2018 would you go
with me
feeling good looking good we've got
shoes with us any that boat we got both
sides
I think my date would find this look
much more agreeable than my last one oh
yeah this definitely looks way better
than that you know make sure you guys
step out into something that you feel
really good and really confident and
something that fits your body the way
you want to whatever colors you want a
rock if you're gonna wear a dress wear a
dress don't wear pants wear pants damn
it sometimes you don't need second
chances maybe I don't need to go back to
prom but I know moving forward like this
is my nuance to prom look and I'll
treasure this look forever because y'all
know I look cute at the end of the day
this experience has given me a lot more
confidence in myself because I see just
what a good set of clothes can do wear
what makes you happy because you're
gonna feel confident the whole night
through and honestly that's what's gonna
make you look like a batty being
confident out on that dance floor if you
can't handle me at my 2011 prom then you
don't deserve me at my 28th teen prom
don't want to take it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
