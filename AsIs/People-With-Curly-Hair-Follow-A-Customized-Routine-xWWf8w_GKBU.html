anything not even my damn hair most of
the time I have braids because it's just
so easy to wear them walk out of the
house and go I need a hair routine that
is not something that I have to like
bother with too much and they can fit
with my fast-paced lifestyle my hair
journey for like the longest was on very
like unflagging like low bus cuts just
like no style just like a number one all
the way across so this is like me
growing my hair out from 2014 so now
it's been really hard to find like the
right products if you go to the you go
to a store and like the ethnic section
is like so tiny so my hair journey has
been really crazy for the past 23 years
my mom is Asian and my dad is black so
my friends didn't really know what to do
with my hair so as a result I've just
straightened it ever since I had natural
hair until I was 13 then I begged my mom
to get a perm or whatever hated it then
I realized while doing that I really
just wanted to have my natural hair
again I've been using the stuff that I
learned from when I was trying to take
care of my hair and it's relax day and
the things that I've learned from trying
to take care of my hair and it's a
natural state let's see how it goes my
name is Cassidy blackwell and I am the
director of brand engagement at Walker &amp;amp;
Company I started relaxing my hair when
I was five years old until one morning I
woke up a nice just was like why my mom
relaxed her hair at the time and she and
I would get into these arguments and I
realized that hair care rather than
bringing us together was starting to
divide us form was really inspired by
being able to speak to people's
individual hair care choices whether you
wear your hair natural or braided or
straightened or all of those things and
somewhere in between form has something
for you you said you like to wear your
hair and twist up so this is called
twist it is your protective styling
cream so this is what you're gonna use
to set your twist but you told me that
you want to try a wash and go for the
first time yeah I'm nervous okay I'm
also going to add in
fine oh no you went online and you took
your form consultation so this is your
complete form regiments so we start here
with clarify this is a detoxifying
shampoo if you wear braids on a regular
basis it can be hard to get product in
there right so we have this needle nose
applicator so you can actually apply it
right at the root of the braid and help
to break up a lot of that buildup when
you heat style your hair we're gonna
have you using it remember your very
first experience with a Gera we picked
for you is called revive revive is great
for processed hair which means anybody
who color treats their hair that needs
that extra dose of protein so we
formulated it to have a ton of slip so
it's gonna make detangling super explode
we all do it I'm excited
we'll see you great so I wash my hair
and I use this shampoo for protective
styles and the conditioner I gotta say
my hair feels so good so I can already
say the cleansing shampoo the smell is
amazing smells like really like minty I
really like that it's also like a very
soft shampoo it doesn't so heavy doesn't
so thick already so I feel like it'll
wash out very useful this is gonna be
incriminating for my boys already no
ready I'm looking in the side mirror and
it looks like a little like more
luxurious are just bad
my hair is holding up pretty well
this isn't like half as frizzy at that
were normally good this feels so good so
I do don't watch him go today what do
you think it looks good it looks good it
looks a lot shorter then what it
normally looks like but I don't think
that's bad this conditioning water I
think you killed it my hair was really
moisturized throughout the day which is
very reassuring for me I'm a little
nervous but mostly excited to have such
big hair it's looking really good this
is the warm polished pomade and it
smells super good all of them pretty
much have like the same smell the
consistency like really like smooth
creamy edge and I'm like really excited
to do my hair and let's see like how it
works out on it so I took out my twist
and this is what it looks like I'm
pretty satisfied with this I can walk
out of the door with this I'm good
the week is up and my hair looks bomb I
literally went through all of the
products and I have to say my favorites
were the twisting cream and I really
liked the spray when I use that with my
braids it was like the photo shoot was
special it just it's weird you know
because it's just like a lot of my
beauty styles were always kind of deeply
rooted in the fact that I was hiding my
natural hair and so having this week to
really wear it out felt really great
because I never really got to see myself
like that I never really got to see
myself as I really am
the foreign products they're pretty dope
on day four I had a new go watch and go
and I was really nervous I don't know
but it worked out the photoshoot was
weird I'm not used to taking pictures of
myself like that so it was completely
out of my element and I usually don't
see that with men and just you know big
smiles while playing was my hair was
really cool I am so excited I learned so
much about my hair growing up with mixed
hair it was such a hard and emotional
thing to deal with it really just kind
of took me back to my childhood and I
was like if those pictures existed in
ads when I was growing up I would have
been more inclined to wear my hair
natural so I'm really excited about
these pictures
I really liked it some things works for
me but like I will be honest something
sitting when I use the pomade it
actually works it very well for my hair
is actually my favorite product out of
the whole line but that initial like in
kind of uh you know it's kind of loose
might not work for me
it definitely proves me wrong growing up
like I always was told that me being
african-american I couldn't dye my hair
any color I wanted to because it
wouldn't look right if he's seeing those
pictures in that light it just made me
like I don't know why anybody would ever
think that a black girl couldn't have
blond hair being able to see everyone's
different hair textures everyone's
different coils and to be able to see
how form has different products in
different regimens that could help all
of us look so amazing was just great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
