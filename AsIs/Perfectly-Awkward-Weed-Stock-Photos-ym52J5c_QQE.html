and she's loading some sticky icky icky
while waiting on the front porch for the
school bus to drop off the kids this guy
is just dropping some dank tincture and
his tea before naptime
these ladies are tapping the ganja while
they carefully slice bell peppers for
Samantha's exquisite roasted red pepper
puree and these friends are casually
inflating the vape bag while waiting for
the newest episode of Kitchen Nightmares
she's just enjoying a relaxing morning
of reefer and yoga stretch it out Martha

some mary-jane while his wife journals
