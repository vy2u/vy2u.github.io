- Yeah.
- Should we all do shots?
- Yes.
- Ned, is it okay?
Do you need to check with your wife?
- I already did!
- He checked with his wife!
- I checked with my wife!
To Ned's wife!
- To Ned's wife!
- Woo!
- Woo!
- And here, it's like I'm trying to have
a great time with both of them,
but how do you split your
attention between two women?
- That's awesome, man.
- It sounds like it.
What do I touch, where do I grab?
How do I make you feel loved,
and how do I make you feel loved?
And it all has to happen in one night?
Are you kidding me?
Okay, enough, enough, enough.
Enough.
This is grotesque.
- [Woman] Okay.
- She's gonna be fine, okay?
Have fun on your trip.
- Yeah, we will. Thank you.
- Bye.
- You guys are coming back, right?
- [Woman] Maybe.
- This isn't my dog now, right?
- No semen on my couch.
- So the orange shoots--
- I'm used to Xbox controls.
- Oh!
- My wife would never
let me buy one of these.
- Hi-yah!
- We probably shouldn't be
fighting with real swords...
- Oh shit, that is real metal.
Do you guys know the
Matterhorn, like, at Disneyland?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- So I rent skis, and I ski the Matterhorn
with these two random Canadian
travelers on my birthday.
- What?
- Oh my God!
- It's my birthday!
- So are you sad he beat you,
or are you looking to
get married soon, too?
- No, I'm not gonna say
I'm looking to get married,
but I'm looking to meet someone
as sweet as his sweet wife.
- Aw.
- We're just looking to have a date night.
Usually go to the same places.
Wondering if you knew...
- If you guys wanna start
with dinner, there's like
great places downtown
near the arts district.
Go to Bestia for like, Italian.
They got really fresh Italian.
And then if you guys wanna
get drinks afterwards,
there's this place
downtown called Varnish.
You gotta find the door.
- Oh.
- It's, like, the
mystery is just the door,
and then once you're in,
it's just like the coolest
place on earth.
Your wife's gonna love it.
She's gonna be like, &quot;Oh my God.
&quot;You know everything.&quot;
If you want something like a
little bit maybe more sexy,
but kinda in that same vein,
you can go to this
place called No Vacancy.
They have like these burlesque
dancers, that just, like,
pop out of nowhere.
- Burlesque dancers?
- And it really gets,
like, the juices flowing.
Especially if you're out with
your wife and maybe wanna
like, charge it up,
a little bit of sexual energy.
Like, that's a great place
after like a nice meal
and maybe drinks at Varnish.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
