when you go on a road trip
you'll take many pictures of clouds like
clouds you'll also take many pictures of
bridges once home you'll think what's
with all the clouds and bridges there
will be at least one photo that was
funny to you at the time but now you
can't remember why
there will be selfies and pictures of
sellings there will be many photos of
food some of it was good some of it was
less good but it all tasted better
because of the people you were with you
will take photos that make you feel
small ones that make you feel big ones
of the strangers you meet out on the
road these are your road friends if you
are American you will take one of
foreign currency because it's colorful
it will sit in your top dresser drawer
for the next 15 years
you will take a shadow photo thinking
this is gonna turn out so artsy there
will be posed photos candid photos
sneaky photos which will put away for a
special time like blackmail you'll take
skyline photos that look like postcards
will make big plans to print them out
thinking of all the money you'll save on
postcards you won't because this printer
won't work you will get bored and take
photos of the road and then photos of
the side of the road and then road signs
you will take a photo of your friends
looking for your car key your friends
will get annoyed because you lost the
car keys in the first place
why are you taking a picture of us right
now you'll take pictures of souvenirs
you will take one that you swear will
look like an album cover it won't
probably because you haven't seen an
actual album cover in 20 years there
will be an epic performance followed by
an epic nap you will take photos of art
you found when you took a wrong turn
into a town you'd never heard of others
will see a picture of a totem pole a
flag the dinosaur but to you they'll be
a reminder that there are no wrong turns
in the end these photos won't just show
who you are or where you put there the
inspiration to get back out on the road
to take those wrong turns and pave the
way of where you're going and who you're
going to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
