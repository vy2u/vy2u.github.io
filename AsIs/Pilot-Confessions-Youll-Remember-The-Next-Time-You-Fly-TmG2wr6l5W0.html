interfere with the plane system and
correspondence is both I work as a pilot
the passengers don't know that we pilots
only get 10 hours of sleep per week I'm
really afraid of heights
I thought joining the Air Force would
help but it's even worse now that I'm a
pilot oh the irony
I'm a pilot and after thousands of hours
of flying experience
I still say we during takeoff the buzz
is still there I'm a pilot and I can't
stop drinking I love flying but I can't
stop and get help at the risk of losing
my job and dream when I was a kid I
remember my teacher scolding no one is
gonna pay you to stare out the window
I'm a pilot as a pilot of two years now
every time I fly I flirt with the idea
of pushing as hard and fast as I can
pass the aircraft limits but never had
the balls to as a pilot I talk about
women while I'm flying and flying while
I'm with women if we're in a plane and
I'm talking about flying something is
wrong and you should be nervous I feel
like the worst dad ever I'm a pilot gone
a week at a time
my son doesn't like talking to me
anymore when I'm gone he's four I'm a
pilot whenever I fly above a large city
I look down and wonder what's the
nastiest thing anyone is doing down
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
