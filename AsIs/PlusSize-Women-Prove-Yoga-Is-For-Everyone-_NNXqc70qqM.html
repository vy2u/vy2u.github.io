little like nervous to get into it yoga
and I have the same relationship as I do
with Jake Gyllenhaal pretty much not
existed even though I would like to have
one
call me when I get the word yoga I think
super flexible steam rooms pants I think
of like really hot like 40 year old moms
I don't think I feel very comfortable
walking into most yoga spaces because I
think I would feel judged every yoga
space feels like a not inviting yoga
space people assume that because I'm
curvy and a size you know 14 16 I like I
don't work out and I just eat potato
chips all day long I think me and like a
lot of plus-sized women end up
exercising alone I'm show today they're
like you know have this awesome yoga
experience with other curvaceous woman
and feel safe and empowered my name is
Valerie Sagan and I'm a yoga instructor
there is a stigma when it comes to
plus-sized women in bigger bodies
practicing yoga I think the only way to
fight the stigma of figure body is doing
anything is pretty much just
representation and visibility my body
doesn't have to look like your body but
it's still acceptable Atocha it's about
being present in your own in your own
body right now being content with how
your body's feeling right now and not
trying to push it past this limit
we're going to start out with some
couple breathing exercises usually the
breath that you have at a yoga class is
called the PJ bruh
and that breath is Tennyson look at our
computer sound first we're going to
place the hand right in front of our
mouths and we're going to tell if we're
like fogging up a window
then dropping the Hin lifting up the
left leg pointing the toes back and then
dropping the knee down still gazing at
the mat keeping with you Jai bruh
bring the hands to your heart center
then inhale chant them with me
thank you guys all for having me I think
I really enjoyed having a class where
there were other women who looks like me
was so refreshing for me to see because
usually in yoga classes you're kind of
surrounded by the same bodies over and
over I think more people would take
fitness classes if they were sure that
like hey it's okay if you fall or if you
need to curl up to the child's pose for
a while or as I like to call it too many
student loans pose
I think instructors just understanding
that like the Plus body just like plus
size clothes are different and have to
have different you know ways that they
fall on bodies like some times you have
to just be a little mindful that a move
might not work or I might not nail it
quite the way that you know someone
who's like very svelte would do it I
think everyone has different levels of
what their body can do in that moment so
as long as we remember that the intent
is there so to have patience and be
welcoming and let them know that they
are accepted just encouraging people in
your classes you know making sure that
they feel safe because it is scary going
to a group workout class as a plus-size
woman everyone tells us like we're
supposed to workout and everything so I
want that to be an enjoyable experience
and I want other plus-sized women to
have that experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
