like borderline ridiculous and I know
that it's something I'm doing just it's
like well okay it'll be fine like this
isn't like it's a real Playboy cover
today we're recreating iconic Playboy
covers with all beautiful curvy
plus-sized woman I can't say I ever read
playboy growing up but it's been an
iconic brand I don't think that playboy
is known for its diversity in any way
shape or form I think that they have
sort of one lady I kind of just want to
bring in this not the standard Playboy
blonde hair blue ties girl I think this
is really exciting just to show that
sexy is not a size sexy is not a skin
color and sexy is not like a hair type I
am recreating Kate Moss's cover she's
kind of like everything to me
I just thought it was so gorgeous and
you know tasteful how I was shot and I'm
really excited
it was a chance to wear some bunny ears
and like the tail and everything and I
was like holy if I'm gonna do
playboy I want to like go all the way
and really feel like a Playboy bunny so
today I'm recreating the Pam cover and
she is the epitome of Playboy Pam
Anderson has been a sex symbol for many
years even today like she is like sexy
so I hope today I can at least bring a
little bit posing topless I really love
my body and I love being curvy and so
I'm excited to you know do this shoot in
which it's just me I hope today shows
people that every body is beautiful and
everybody can be sexy I think the idea
of what we think is sexy you know is
always changing and so I hope to change
a couple people's perceptions the
Playboy magazine cover I'm recreating
has Farrah Fawcett on the cover when you
see this photo of her she's like oh
don't mind me I'm just drinking my
morning champagne it's very cool girl
chic is what I'm trying to do and those
are like two adjectives I would not
usually use to describe myself
it's like imagine like in your mind what
it looks like when you're lounging on a
Sunday morning now make that very
difficult to achieve and that's what
this was posing for magazines is really
really tough it's designed to look
beautiful and natural but it's really
hard
I also succeeded in that we took a
picture so I can't complain too much the
cover I'm creating is Elle McPherson her
knees are over each other and her feet
are down on the ground too and I
literally don't know how I'm going to do
that my main goal for today is to just
like let everybody know that you can go
out there and do you and yeah be sexy at
any time
being that elder person is such a iconic
person like being known as the body that
is not me I have a body but probably not
the body I don't think it's gonna be
like oh my gosh that's amazing that
looks so alike because like nothing
about us looks alike Tamra creating
Carmen Electra I do feel a little bit
pressure recreating Carmen Electra
because you know she is like a sex
symbol I got a little sweaty and my back
hurts a little bit but other than that
I'm feeling like I'm ready
you know I've never done anything like
this or anything close to this so I
really wanted to push myself I think it
looked really good women should know
that they can be sexy at any size no
matter what anyone tells you I don't
think people should be ashamed of sex
heated up a little bit I think a lot of
times media and Society has told us only
a certain size can be sexy but really
that's just a bunch of poor Pam
Anderson is a huge sex symbol but I felt
very empowered you know as a curvy woman
trying to recreate this photo and I hope
other women know that it's time that we
all recognize that sexy is a very
different concept for all of us and it's
always changing and that's great
I think that like everyone is sexy
to someone and I think if you think you
aren't sexy to anyone it's because you
haven't met enough people honestly I
think it looked really good I think
maybe just as good as Carmen Electra
just with a different person I wish I
could do it again I do it a million
times it was so great I think anybody
who doesn't feel the sexiest should try
like pushing themselves and pushing
their boundaries no matter what your
body type or size everybody is sexy in
their own way and I think that's what
makes everybody so cool and so beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
