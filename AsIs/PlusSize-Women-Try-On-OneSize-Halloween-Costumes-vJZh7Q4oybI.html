how we put on this mic sorry
Halloween the only time of the year
where it's okay to dress
besides Coachella I guess so every year
I always make my costume and I always do
it like a month in advance I love
Halloween I've never really had a good
Halloween experience I usually like
watch a scary ish movie like Harry
Potter and just go to bed Halloween is
like everything that's stressful about
life compacted into one day whole thing
that we all do we all stress about we
all turning it perfect and the next day
it's like nothing happened
fighting Halloween costumes is so hard
especially if you're plus-size because
chances are they don't make your size
they never fit they're not very
comfortable the fabric just tends to be
terrible and itchy it's unrealistic
I am trying on the SWAT costume it looks
very interesting there's a tutu there
I'm not sure why or how that would aid
me in saving people how's it going back
there I don't know what are like
people's versions of hell because I'm
pretty sure I'm in mine right now
I might need someone to help me into
this tonight okay I'm gonna go gonna go
holy crud okay okay I think you know
what you're gonna be fine
everything's gonna be fine it's kind of
when bleed through your pants on your
period and your friends like
everything's gonna be fine no one's
going to notice people are gonna
notice okay okay you guys ready
I don't feel the bats in this shockingly
this is not what I want to wear on
Halloween I definitely want you to check
out the back which is for some reason a
lace corset everything about this is
terrible so I want to wear this if I was
like the drunkest of drunks on Halloween
I picked the stormtrooper costume I
actually like this costume because it's
not explicitly sexy it's actually just
storm trooper I really like the idea of
getting dressed up but I just I feel
like I've been disappointed and
heartbroken so much that I'm trying not
to get my hopes up oh this is all just
one piece I didn't realize it was gonna
be a jumpsuit
oh no oh this is awful oh if I was any
taller this wouldn't fit hurry I'm
almost ready gonna put this mask on so
no one knows who I am
I was not expecting this to be all one
piece I was kind of hoping that this
would be separate pieces you know like
how it looked in the picture if you had
to pee on his kill went to ten how
difficult would it be oh easily a fifty
I don't want to see it from other angles
but from the front angle not that bad
it's not bad for the back either
thank you today I'm gonna be trying on
the Sailor costume and I feel like I'm
gonna feel very blue like super cute but
I'll have to see how the plus-sized one
goes cuz you know it's very blue puffy
poofy outfit
oh no oh god oh god oh no I love
Halloween but this is like sucking all
the Halloween joy out of me right now
you guys know when you were like in high
school and you had to wear like Kim
clothes these are like those shorts and
they're not in a cute blue guys I don't
even want to come out
ha I feel like a marshmallow that like
vomited blue
you look like a build-a-bear yeah oh you
do oh the wiring is so uncomfortable
girls always want to be like the sexy
sailor like I feel so far from sexy
right now it's like a it's sad my
costume is the sexy Catwoman gosh if I
could honestly just be transformed into
like a real looking cat I'd be much
better than this like spandex latex type
of hot mess that I'm about to be like a
these feel like it's a cat sexy cat what
buy it or don't guys I can't even I'm
too tall
literally oh my god oh yeah we got you
oh okay it's not gonna zip no we're good
I just want to bust out of this man
this is a joke what is this I
can't even lift my arms up if I wear
this the proper way my like it won't
come up to here we are all four
different sizes different heights
holding our weight in different places
you can't just give one size call it
plus size and think Oh problem solved
one plus size was never gonna fit all
about no way I don't like Halloween
anymore
like this like seriously takes all like
the joy and the fun out of dressing up
like this is just sad I think this is
the worst thing I have ever done and I
went to fat camp so having a perspective
nothing so hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
