in some freaking dungeon I fail in a
couple of hours I am gonna lose feeling
in my hand but that's fine because
that's not the worst it's gonna happen
today I feel well you've already lost
your dignity I challenge anyone to find
something that's more robot aluminous
I'm straight I'm gay I'm white a person
of color I'm a meat-eater I don't eat
meat left-handed right-handed cat hater
cat lover Anna Kendrick Lizzy Caplan I
am looking most forward to in 24 hours
beam uncut Sam that's the one thing we
have in common
yeah call me old-fashioned but I'm not a
big fan of being Hank after someone
while I take a dunk as a gay woman it's
gonna be interesting having Nick of all
men in the shower as I shower in my bed
as I sleep I must be a little bit
sadistic so I've come up with this idea
okay it's ten o'clock where did you get
these cuffs from the sex stuff you ready
no three two one
I put it all way too tight I'm
sorry I'm not really the one to know how
handcuffs work I can't tell vanilla
spice just to prove that we won't be
cheating at any point I'm going to turn
this key to our fellow colleague power
we are going to still do the things that
we do every day
masturbate no we are not doing
that normally nick has just told me some
terrible news well time for the gym and
I can't change my day-to-day routine so
I'm going with Tanya our first adventure
out people might think you like a really
kinky comfort Nick keeps trying to hide
on handcuffs why you ashamed about our
handcuffs I've never been going back to
my liking this moment I did what four
hours in we went to the gym we had a
great time at the gym it was home yeah
it was actually really not good this is
the worst thing I have ever done
you wanna die what
yeah price on your shirt my wrist hurts
20 hours ago
BAM Nick just told me some amazing news
I have to pee
everyone Nick swing welcome to the home
of privilege the male bathroom do we
know yay proud of you what happened
first way of the day it just felt like
my brother was laying in front of me so
tenure needs to go to the toilet in this
last video here is little secret
yeah and I can sing again hi Nick what
I'm not walking I can't say anything
it's like a horror movie in hand
the bathroom I'm here in some
free dungeon Oh the fragility of hue I
just want to be alone now how long to go
18 hours the hardest thing hasn't even
begun bed showering someone's gonna have
to eventually so I haven't had a
coffee today because coffee leads to you
know just accept the fact that you're
gonna have to poop no not gonna be I
have Ivan typically that we're gonna go
out now 10 where we going let's be
environment erm I'm a bit worried that
we're not going to be allowed into bars
with these handcuffs so we might have to
hold hands and pretend that we're
friends
I don't have words for this you know in
this toilet right now the bathroom we
were just in was about 50 Fu's what the
stench I'm really over this now
so last night wore out having some
drinks with some friends and we had to
go to a bathroom it was the fifth time
he had to urinate in that 30 minutes
that we were there I was drinking the
seal was broken and we go outside and
there's a whole bunch of security
waiting for us
and they say we can't have you going in
there we don't know what you're doing
and I think he saw the defeat in my eyes
I just said look mate we're handcuffed I
really had no other choice and he looked
at me with so much empathy and he just
said it's fine don't worry about it and
walked away obviously this was a very
painful experience I don't want to be
here home it's no offense but um it's
clean it's a little dude I had to watch
you like kiss about ten times today so
the least that you think it means my own
bed are you going to pay for the cap
shields yes
I will pay triple alright sweat we're a
10 years house and we're like halfway
there and the rest is like sleeping so
it should be on the home stretch I'm
pretty sure I could actually fall asleep
with you next to me which is something
unless it's almost women it's fine
mmm my past cat your favorite that's my
bag so I didn't pack PJ's that's my
mistake and I'm going to be in the same
place 24 hours and I'm gonna have to
bleach my sheets I'm not gonna
dirty them come on
Oh someone's getting a little bit
tuition I just want to go to bed I don't
want to get this whole behind me
I feel so dead inside right now and now
the time we've all been waiting for bed
I need to leave right trust
exercise yeah it's good of them yeah my
cat like in the bowl
sustainer it's like I found my brother
son and enemy all at once thank you

wing with the bathroom door wide open a
married couple head magnet that's the
alarm it's 10 o'clock oh my god it's
time holy c'mon out of yours this
is like us exchanging our wedding vows

three two one ready yeah that's why I'm
going to the toilet
 you know what I think that there
are very few people in the world that I
could be handcuffed to for 24 hours and
the fact that we have somehow made it
happen is testament to how good a person
you are
we're never doing this again though
absolutely not get off me yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
