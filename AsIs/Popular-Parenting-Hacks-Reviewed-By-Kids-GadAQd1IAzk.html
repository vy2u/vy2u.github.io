in the room then take the door off its
hinges so you can always be inside what
do you think of that idea
no it'll be sort of a hassle taking off
the hinges and that's just a waste of
their time if my parents said that
they'll take off the door of my bedroom
I would have ducked my parents bedroom
you just take over their bedroom okay oh
yeah that's happening before you break
your parents were taking the door off
yeah it's been a lot harder to hide my
phone when I'm playing on it when you
put a kid on timeout don't call a
timeout call it a feel better break um
no it's still a timeout like I don't I
don't want to feel better I want to go
play yeah cuz I don't like it being
called timeout I'm not a kid oh I'm
sorry little um I would do it I would
actually have a feel better brick I'm
gonna give me an excuse now I didn't run
homework if siblings don't behave make
them where I get a long t-shirt it's
like a really big shirt with that to
kids wear I don't think this would help
to get a song cuz well yeah might make
me just more angry then you'd probably
start punching people hey it's me that
they take a picture that's just like
they're upset
and it's easy a teacher I would probably
like hack it and like delete their
account
I probably rip the shirt districts and I
need
put sprinkles on vegetables to make your
kids eat their veggies I would do it I
don't know that's a good idea or not I
have never tried vegetables with
sprinkles on them sprinkles are supposed
to be for a sweet stuff not vegetable um
if you put like chocolate sprinkles on
my broccoli
like I would non-stop eat broccoli like
24/7 so I think it would work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
