their ability to balance each other out
you know the yin to the yang the plus to
the minus being able to listen to each
other and try and see from each other's
point of views the ability to to stay
stay around that person without being
annoyed the willingness to adapt to each
other I think trying something new is
the way to go because it kind of puts
you out of your comfort zone and it's
kind of hard to be bored when you're not
comfortable I say I'll try everything
once you know everything one time most
of my stuff happens to be on camera to
be a girl buy some sexy lingerie and
surprise him one day when you come to
work if you're a guy you know surprise
her with a handwritten note hanwen notes
are sexy if you're scared but really
interested in trying kinky sex with your
partner I think you should go try it I
don't have to say if you're scared to do
something sometimes it ends up being the
best thing ever
paying attention to your partner
maintenance and communication do talk to
each other like communicate you're not
gonna know if somebody is gonna like
getting their hair polled if you can't
say do you like getting your hair polled
just be open and honest about everything
even if what you think you're gonna say
is going to hurt your partner it's part
of the process if you fight a lot it's
sometimes just I mean at least you still
gave a right sometimes if it hurts
it's a good thing it's a matter of what
you do with that pain and how you turn
that around that'll benefit your
relationship you can care about somebody
you sometimes have to break them I feel
like you have to have it and lose it to
understand why you need it or want it
you need to be happy with yourself and
who you are before you can go be happy
to someone else you definitely need to
be confident in yourself before you drag
other people along with you so you never
want to drag anybody down it's all about
bringing people
watch porn together um why would my
hundred dollar washer their wives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
