a celebrity hair stylist hair try
colleges and I transform people's lives
the first thing I think of hair is
something that I have to always keep in
one place keep it tidy it happens when
I'm at work because I'm a nurse so it
has to be up at home I have a baby since
up it used to be something that I can
feel pretty about now it's just
something that gets in the way I'm just
plain Jane no bangs
long hair I've always been on this
journey trying to find what kind of
style matches my personality the first
thing I think of when I think of hair is
work lots and lots of work ever since I
was a kid my hair has always been in
some kind of style I never just had my
hair just out because that wasn't okay
I went through a period of rapid weight
loss when you lose weight really really
quickly your hair falls out most guys
pay no attention to what's really
happening with their hair or it starts
not to be there anymore and then you
panic I think it's hard for girls with
curly hair to find the right style like
a typical latina mom she was giving me
the tightest most slicked-back ponytail
I look at girls and I think I wish I
could do that to my hair if only I had
straight hair my hair is pretty thin you
watch all the commercials with the
amazing hair and you do all those things
and it still looks flat my hair style is
dictated by the fact that I don't like
spending time with it well when I think
of hair I do think of my sister she
passed away two years ago from leukemia
but her hair was always on point when
she'd have her chemo days she would have
me put on her makeup
she's like even though I have no hair
honey she's like you got to do my face
since her passing I would do the best
that I could but now with being a mom
it's a little bit more challenging
today's gonna be a great hair day and
she's gonna be right there watching it
she's through like yes
there's a story behind every haircut
it's a hair journey I'm feeling that I'm
gonna give your sister the honor of
something spectacular and miraculous I'm
visioning something really simple yet
still eleganza and that's important yeah
you shouldn't lose yourself just because
you have a family or a job you've kind
of put your hair back over here yeah the
style that you're you like to go for
yeah it's my way of feeling a little
edging I've never been able to get good
bangs oh you've been angry there's like
gonna be two things I'm gonna be talking
to you about covering your hair and then
more of a styling of your hair with your
permission I feel like we should go
natural today you know your struggles
like I have to be more black than the
black people after you more white know
why people same thing here like you're
living two different life it's
exhausting no for sure yeah this is
untouched you're a virgin here yeah and
I think that that's so empowering as
like a hair stylist yeah because you've
given me the opportunity to just go with
it let's do this yeah I'm gonna ask you
before I start cuz this is a really huge
step okay
is it cool if I shave you oh okay oh
shoot you're already there curlier is
its own class all these people who are
red carpet they have waves in their hair
that's essentially curls it's girl power
you want embrace those curls because
those are what's working for you a lot
of moms go like I don't want to try
anything new the maintenance but I have
no time but remember if the stylist is
giving you the correct consultation the
maintenance can actually be as easy as
pie mom you rock and we're here to show
you that first word that comes to your
mind okay
shorter the stigma of putting short hair
on girls
I am super nervous because I don't know
how short you're going pickling oh don't
cut your hair your hair is beautiful I'm
talking about having that open
conversation of like why you want to cut
your hair there's a liberating back
your hair can grow better it's less
likely to get split ends live a little
bit don't worry hair goes back we have a
virgin client that's a stylist stream
blank canvas coloring hair is not as
scary as you but because coloring your
hair is almost like coloring your life
still be you but have a little bit of
hold on someone else for men they have
something called DHT it's aegyo
testosterone and it blocks follicles
from growing they can either be like
losing here lose me back here losing a
little here patchiness for every hundred
thousand men that are losing hair fifty
thousand women are it's diffused to me
it's everywhere
so we're speaking to women to figure out
where your areas of concern are and how
we can get you from point zero to time
I'm going to send you to one of my
really really great friends but I feel
like a lot of the culture where we
sabotage each other is like oh you have
to have straight hair who said that
that's the best way to do things there's
another way to feel your hair breathe
again and to accept that as something
that's so beautiful I'm so ready you
like this cut is just fun yeah like you
can even scrunch it and just let it go
that lived in kind of here and you're
not Bhangra oh my god
what do you think it's so clean and you
have a cute style this is a natural wave
people want this I have never had a
haircut word I love how curly my hair
looks lighter
I feel livelier yeah I feel younger this
is the most authentic haircut I think
I've given my mom struggled I think the
last thing she thought about was her
looks I feel like you are empowering as
a person thank you I really like it I'm
surprised by how you really can't see
the receding hairline what this looks
like is effortless yeah Lily woke up
judged my hair a little bit and then BAM
there we go gorgeous it feels like
there's a vibrancy to it that I didn't
have before and it feels full I didn't
tease your hair at all this is no tease
this is straight up a blow-dry you're
gonna get some looks girl honey my
sister approves oh I'm so I just feel
very open I feel very free right now I
can touch my scalp for when I feel like
this is another great option for you
you're embodying everything that I think
that a woman stands for and one that
stands for her hair it looks so much
that's just color this is a sweet color
through the time in today it's the
easiest thing to mean to you this is
awesome yeah you're definitely a fox my
advice for girls who never do anything
with their hair
is to get somebody trusted and just let
them go wild with it
people forget that this is forever
and whether you're losing it or whether
you have a lot of it it's there that's
what I me there's a video for people out
there who don't have a voice for hair my
husband's gonna say let your hair be
free
keep trying new things and I think that
really helps you grow as a person as my
sister would say she'd be like mm-hmm
that's how you do your hair girl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
