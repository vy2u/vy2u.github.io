that means people talk to me I'm not
just talking about friends or family you
got a minute
can I talk to you for a minute yeah what
feels like every single person for some
reason you do that is me to unload on I
think I should probably get a pregnant
it starts the same every time just a
regular interaction hey goober hey I've
gone to you later
and now pivot oh fuck and then
everything turns look Nick uh can I talk
to you for a minute
I think about dog fighting see I feel
like we all have this shit going on
inside of us all the times it's
constantly stirring and we rarely get
the chance to tell anybody how we
actually feel those girls are not my
friends they're just people I hang out
my dad ran a pretty big ring of dog
fight I hate this place
heat job he could look into a dog's eyes
and just kind of know like this one
wants to fight sometimes we hide it from
our closest friends but then there's
that opportunity that chance where you
actually realize that somebody's Lissie
like why am i friends with my friends or
this one doesn't want to fight or this
one hungrier this one just need the walk
I didn't think when I got out of high
school that I would end up here this my
fifth year here and everything changed
this much more of a dog whisperer than a
son whisperer
I feel like you're like really listening
to me people start being honest so my
dad got arrested he had a pretty long a
pretty long rap sheet I thought that I'm
afraid of commitment or anything it's
just that girls find me disgusting I'm
so lonely
so why is this a problem
well sometimes I don't want to with them
yeah sometimes I just want to be a piece
of scenery in your life I don't want to
be a full-fledged carrot like what a
quit or sometimes I just want to say
shut up so I can enjoy my own head but I
don't and then my mom made she made
screen savers because I am naturally an
empathetic person yeah you know there's
some reason that causes me to be a
magnet for these deeper stranger
conversations when I'm with them I feel
even more alone
yeah I've applied to Shark Tank many
times
mm-hmm bathroom jazz bands people tell
me things that they don't tell people in
their regular lives if I get her
pregnant then her dad kind of has to
accept our relationship and sometimes
that piece of scenery that extra in your
life I have I get oh my god thank you
you don't you don't I'm taking this shit
with me can be a catalyst for change
I'm so glad you came here to fish if
people are like toxic to you let them go
these strangers tell me things they're
too afraid to tell people my actual life
you can
people at a bar oh yeah my friends know
I care because I'm always listening to
everybody
oh thanks for listening thanks for
listening thank you for listening
thanks for listen thanks for listening
anyway thanks
you know what I'm gonna write that
letter
you're getting 5 stars
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
