fashion and we had enough talking on for
almost a hour

emoji over Jonathan yeah say anything I

for you call Jonathan and it was amazing
oh and also we should mention that now
you can watch this on youtube.com slash

something that'll make us feel laughing
yeah oh good our merch craziness last
week's hashtag was stupid history with a
1 don't forget you got a hashtag contest
in order to be considered we're gonna
read off some of our favorites this one
was going to be the winner if this is a
runner-up this is our second place for
the week at G Knapton AK said stupid
history pineapples were such a status
symbol in 18th century England that you
could rent one and take it to a party
for the night hashtag Sabri
carry around a pineapple all might go
like that guy it's like when you
rent the runway you know what I mean you
are a nice dress or Renta wait why are
Tesla such a big deal what that was such
a left turn I just thought like maybe
you could rent a Tesla to go to a party
you probably could attest why are Tesla
there's sleek luxury cars for cheap and
they're battery-powered or like
solar-powered I don't know who want to
go the Elon Musk involved yes he
invented the Tesla I'm gonna need you
guys I'm gonna restate this I'm gonna
need you guys at Elon Musk wait let's
get him let's get him to help us okay
okay okay here's one fun one um from
Rene k33 Oh
oh my god three three oh one four seven
ninety for Rene babe don't have to do
this uh according to what amy wolff told
The Telegraph in 2009 her marriage to an
amusement park ride called 1001 knots he
came from a 20-year infatuation
basically a woman married a fairground
ride and that is we all have our things
we don't shave here we don't judge
we don't yeah Mary
at zawa and as ow the president of ends
in 1899 died from getting the life
sucked out of him if you know what I
mean he died from a bj that's funny
dangerous the life sucked out of him if
you knew what I mean uh how about Benji
Dibble said next time you're having a
bad day think of this Napoleon lost his
final battle at Waterloo because he
suffered from severe diarrhea haven't we
all been there where we all be there oh
no this one's bad at Nakoa said charles
ii on the wedding night of his nephew
and future king william of orange
watched the entire consummation while
shouting encouragement from the
sidelines oh that's kind of taking the
height man a little too far oh here we
go from Heather Lobeck Mary did indeed
have a little lamb whose fleece was
white as snow and yes it did follow her
to school one day Mary was Mary Sawyer
an 11 year old Bostonian whose lamb
followed her to school one day but just
once and we wrote a iconic song
about her what the did she ever do
that was so great I mean lambs they
don't like to follow too far so I think
you would know I don't know I thought
this one was really interesting quite a
few of you guys tweeted this at us that
Anne Frank wrote more than what is
taught in schools her dad actually like
edited her diary she often wrote about
masturbation and administration and even
fart jokes I also thought that she
talked about liking girls maybe I heard
about that I don't know don't quote me
oh sorry I just realized I got my hair
cut my hair was like all up and
then I was like oh no I got a cut I'm so
sorry I just have that realization man I
don't care ah this week's winner ladies
and
in between for this week comes from at
tall underscore foot King George the
third planted beast to try and grow beef
tree
god damn you sweet kitty George you fool
Oh his heart was in the right place I
don't think this regard I don't know if
he was one of those crazy kids yeah
maybe maybe we should not say that he
okay well uh that's okay enough for this
week so we've done we've got two weeks
down huh yeah two weeks so we've got our
third week this week you guys we're
changing up the hashtag Kate tell him
all right the new hashtag is hashtag
talk about a tox filled up with the one
so it's he a1k about ugh talk about uh
you know it might have this might have
been an inspiration just from the way
Kate and I were feeling I'm smart so
here's an example when you need to get a
birth certificate but your license is
gonna expire but you need to renew your
license in order to get a birth
certificate so now you're just stuck in
California for ever talk about my
example I said this on the podcast
before is talked about uh how about UTI
meds give you a yeast infection but the
yeast infection meds give you a UTI and
the UTI meds give you a yeast infection
it's just a never-ending cycle talking
about oh that's dead content oh you're
in line and someone they open another
line Oh a little bit away and someone
behind you gets first in that line talk
about oh gosh I talk about oh you just
start remembering your boyfriend
did before you guys were exclusive and
it puts you in a downward spiral and you
can't stop circling in to pressure and
wondering if you're ever gonna be good
enough even though it was something that
happened months ago talk about Oh accent
contests whenever you're trying to vent
to a friend and they try to one-up you
with something else there's like oh this
hurt and there's like oh you want to see
her closer to what happened to me
instead it's great talk about oh that's
tracked this podcast it feels good it
feels good thank you for sticking with
us none of my problems are solved but it
feels good you can't solve it right now
I know I can't solve it right now but
you're right I could try to focus
something else however I'm going to
present you this entire podcast okay
cool well you know I just I feel like
I'm one of those people that were
conditioned mean you are conditioned to
hammer things that bother us into our
heads and we can't do anything or we
can't be complete people until we've
finished and get rid of that one bad
thoughts we think about that one but
this one is actually a really big deal I
know but think about it like there we
can't carry on until we get rid
of those nasty ass feelings like that's
who we are as people
right that's so how do we expel this you
go find your goddamn birth certificate
right we've work I'm leaving after this
podcast well guys hot-hot tape you're
gonna have to keep updated to see if
kate fives or instagram you should go
follow her on as I find my Instagram are
you fine girl sorry I forgot to grab the
 is wrong with you I'm spiraling
till I make a both came in this morning
and went I'm in a sassy mood i what I'm
learning assessment I don't want to talk
about it okay fine oh I was I was
journaling last night and I had a
journal in a while in my in my physical
journal I literally like to write but
then I got this app called day one it's
really good and you should go download
it not sponsored not sponsored and you
take a pic whatever point yes I was like
I want to write my old journal I haven't
written in a while so I wrote in it and
the page before that I had written in
was the night that my boyfriend who
wasn't my boyfriend at the time did that
really shitty thing yeah and I just
started reading all of my feelings about
it and I was like why how am I having a
relationship with this person oh I
didn't mean that but I kind of I don't
know how I was able to can you forget
someone you did yeah I don't know that I
did though if I'm getting this
worked up about it
I'm like did I get like roped into
something that I shouldn't have
so when inevitably he does me
over then am I gonna be like what yeah
sure no look at how it started
this is insecurities huh I'm sorry DJ
you know I love you I'm sorry I I'm sure
we'll work this out like it's that thing
where you're like okay we're gonna go
we're going we're doing the journey
we're going and then as you're
going oh my god let's just sit down real
quick let's go let's go tomorrow let's
go man and it's just just like their
cult spoke didn't this beautiful thing
that we have and it's me doing it it's
not him he's not making me feeling
secure at all it's me thinking of things
that we he did before we were exclusive
do you forgive him I don't I don't trust
him all the way yet mm-hmm and I guess
that means it's because I don't forgive
him I haven't forgiven them yet not that
I need to bring we weren't exclusive so
it doesn't matter but it was the manner
in which he handled it that made me go
ill I mean I definitely think that it's
it makes sense like if someone gets bit
by a dog you can't just be like yeah I'm
gonna go right back up to that dog you
know you have to kind of like you're
gonna be timid and be like I need I need
a little bit of time to feel fully
comfortable but what happens if that dog
is inside of you six nights a week that
legal thing I don't want to talk about
why would that be what you went to what
if that dog is inside because I party
back with the dog I'm ro I'm not going
to yo dog this is a whole metal I know I
know it I didn't mean you were calling
him a dog I just meant that the dog that
fit me I'm already back with the dog
okay but you could still be scared of
the dog that just means you're like
never like oven mitts around it I think
you just talked to him about it
I guess sorry for airing my dirty
laundry before talking to him hey I
definitely twisted your heart I don't
want to talk about it okay don't talk
about it all he's thinking about it all
day
which I probably will now do anyways the
same way hear anything about your
goddamn bar sort of ever guy I'm finding
that I'm fighting it today okay
what about the universe I believe you
guys I'm finding it still tugging on my
I think it's in one of my notebooks
because I remember going to the the DMV
to get just an ID why didn't I just get
my license then Oh anyway I went to the
D I know you're really frustrated by you
thoroughly enjoy watching you just break
apart everything it's everything
all at once everyone has the
opinion about something stupid I can't
for my birth certificate Hussein
do we have to keep one anyway why can't
I just be like Here I am
here's my social security card what the
 does the US government have a
Twitter we could tweet at hey government
could you just help me out here
could someone just send me my
birth certificate please wait at what
age is it appropriate to take your birth
certificate from your parents cuz I
don't think it's college coz you're too
messy in and loosey-goosey and not
organized and college belief I wasn't I
don't think I got my person to take a
typic until I was like 24 I have it when
I moved I had it when I moved here and
what wait why didn't you put it in a
special folder lately important stuff
and put it in a place you'd never forget
because when I first moved here I
literally didn't have anything so I it
was there was one of two places it could
be this suitcase or that suit and then I
know and then I then eventually I lived
in my car and I didn't move out real
fast you lived in your car like a day
and then I lived on a couch but all but
all of my stuff was in my car like all
my clothes were in my car all my things
and so everything just kind of got messy
and then I moved so many times
then now that I'm in a place and I have
stuff there's more more places for it to
be but I think it's got to be my car
somewhere oh that's not a great place
for it to be because you throw things
out in your car all the time
I'm sorry didn't mean to spark more
anxiety could you just do the podcast
alone for the rest of this hey guys uh
no because this would not be a good
podcast oh you know what we can do we
can't introduce who our guest is going
to be in a second we're gonna have a
little tiny segment before we play the
interview with tan don't worry that's

today's just got beautiful no it's very
obvious you don't have to share if you

each thing is it different is it for
each bomb yeah like do you think of
someone when you read it that poem is
about and for my dad who is my best
friend see I wasn't sure if it was a
literal father no it is so it's so funny
cuz this poem when I was in Boston it
was chosen like the mayor what
yeah the arts and cultural was like a
large arts and cultural hit in Boston
but it was chosen to UM be displayed at
City Hall in Boston but also be
stenciled in the ground so when it rains

like tires like grief in the wings of an
eagle come closer and so daddy I made
myself my mother and I made myself yours

so dad is like a Portuguese word for
longing because I was imagining a
different word each time you said it

stopped everywhere can you even go to
the airport
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
day two day three when we realized oh
 she got real like it we were
expecting the slope and thinking yeah
the next few ones people start to
recognize you that I get to watch the
show
let's eat day to wait Bon Jovi stalks
you on day two MCS I I think I love you
okay Jonathan
Bon Jovi Jonathan bonneted chosen and
you watch the whole season in one day me
my wife were obsessed with you can we
take a photo
yes of course you can and so let me
recognize everywhere you go is very
still creepy because they use my name
yeah that's the strange yeah with other
people who are like they truly know they
get right into the personal stuff like
immediately they're just sort of like
yeah I know I heard you and and I just
want to share my really personal
experience yeah I'm trying to buy a
coffee that's what happens with the
podcast it's like we we're sitting in a
room with each other like just yeah how
we would normally talk but we forget
that this gets broadcast to millions of
people so when we're walking down the
street people will just stop us and be
like let me talk about my vagina for two
and a half minutes and we're like okay
forget a lot of the time we do forget
that they're on us if I ever such idiots
together like we became so close so
quickly
I love these idiots father like I'm so
lonely
laughter and I mean I speak to literally
every day we facetimed call the bath or
will we will have think that's what's up
I'm sure you probably get asked this
question a lot but like are you guys
really friends there's not like crazy
behind-the-scenes drama let me tell you
I will clean obsessed if you want to
show you we don't oh yeah I can't
connect so well with us is that we you
can tell we truly do love each other and
yeah looks so touchy-feely like we are
just we're brothers at this point yeah
there's no separating us I mean I'm sure
that drives production not sleep all day
and we actually I know it does the
amount of times people we have a
telegram Glenn who tries to make sure
that we don't leave a room the place all
that we're focusing all the way to be
doing the stress will show these shows
he's ever done because trying to control
five gay men to get them to calm down
and everything it's not like I follow
all of you guys on Instagram so your
story somehow it's always line up with
each other and it's the same goddamn
thing you guys are just reposting each
other's instagrams and like each other
being like oh look at my boys new buds
go to this support it's such a purely a
friendship and I feel like that really
it was such a everyone I talked to who
watched the show is like it was such a
pure beautiful thing that I needed in my
life and they just feel so good and that
I don't think could be faked at all no I
feel like stories can be altered and
whatever but it was just so it was so
genuinely good yeah it was good it's not
weird that we haven't had a show like
these people that's just good is this
sad that you watch the show to get oh
this is what it feels like to be a
decent human yeah and we were gonna ask
about because I read some article I
can't remember if it was good
that's all they have to pre-record why
all my interviews because I say
hi welcome to the pot we're never
getting any of that literally I baked
all this unbranded term but we are we
were eating in one article about how
they were saying we like we love queer I
but here's why it's like queer emotional
labor and you can tell that they have to
do this because it's for middle America
and I'm going you guys happy to be
sharing their stories talking about your
life can you talk about that a little
bit because I feel like it's also the
queer community kind of like standing up
for ourselves being like we shouldn't
have to do this but also it it's done
and it's beautiful sell our story to the
middle America but I want people to know
who we are I don't want to ever be
called a disgusting name on the street
again and the way we do that is by
having conversations with people and
saying this is - yeah this is what we
represent we're just like you yes I know
that my hair's higher yes I know that I
really care about my skin but I'm still
at a regular person as are you and so
that's why I think it was really
important we went somewhere like Georgia
I didn't say it said that where did this
show in New York I don't think I
would've been interested no joke I
wouldn't have appeal to me hmm I don't
want to have a chat with a load of
liberals who already love the gays and
desperate to be that techie Sonny's
friend you guys are changing the world
it's not just the gay thing is I'm an
immigrant and middle eastern half of the
certain religion there are so many
reasons why so many people would never
want to talk to me and so the fact that
I've got a platform to be able to say we
are having a conversation whether you
like it or not
and I'm a complete well as we say in
England gobshite which means I cannot
show piaf I'm a complete Gaucho and I'm
gonna say exactly what the I want
what do you like or no
I'm gonna get a shirt that says that we
don't have to edit ourselves so when you
see us on the show whatever I say
it's truly how I'm feeling yeah and
unabashedly how I'm feeling I mean they
added it how they want both they edit it
to the point where it's still very much
me what you see on the show is very much
what you get realized I think that's the
beauty of a show like this is it's the
first truly fully real show where we can
we can connect with a group that people
don't expect us connect so when people
say oh there's something out that
they're trying to appeal to middle
America we should all be trying to
appeal to exactly that's what's so weird
that's what bothers me hon we talk about
I preached about this all the goddamn
time because I feel like when you know
people have maybe wrong ideas or like
old-fashioned ideas or views on things
that's not going to get solved by
speaking into a void of other people who
already think like you and it's not
gonna get resolved by meeting it with
anger it always gets real I really like
also Sarah Silverman has that show I
love you America on Hulu and it's it's a
long legs I swear we're on a different
channel on a different channel but yeah
I think that it's just meeting opposing
views and lifestyles with compassion is
the only way to actually have the
uncomfortable conversation so that you
can find a common ground when they cast
US v I think they did a very good job
casting by people who are ready
empathetic and who can represent our
community well where we could have these
conversations and it doesn't turn into
an argument
yeah it doesn't turn into something
hellacious we are able to have a
conversation and truly find common
ground it's not just for a TV show
and again I've never seen this before me
either it's so nice like we follow me on
in this room when I did my rant about
like Kelly oh I want to hear the
team so
[Laughter]
Kelly and a lot of people didn't want us
to do that show and I got an eye post
about it I posted a picture of me and
her when the show is actually going live
we record there because I'm a I
got so many dances from people saying
nasty nasty thing you said not to not
about me without her this is disgusting
she needs to learn a place when we
shouldn't we should have been a position
of power this is why should be should
have their own talk shows and it's
destroying to say if you think that's
who I am you really have got the wrong
person like I'm not going to include
that kind of behavior it makes sense
that we do a show like this yes I know
that her views may not align with mine
but that's exactly why we want to do a
show like this is a lot of do shows that
do target a demographic though we're not
accustomed to and this is the purpose of
our show we're meant to bridging these
gaps it makes no sense to go on all
these liberal shows I want to go on the
shows where we're actually talking to
people who would never click onto a show
called queer I know this is not a game
show yes there's five days on it but
this is my game show and so so yeah I
went on a very long run and then to
answer the the way that you're changing
the world with hate that just blows my
mind that people by supporting you means
tearing down another group of people or
whatever it's very strange because no
one thinks they're wrong nobody thinks
no one wakes up every day and goes yeah
no this is wrong leather debut wrong
that's I mean I do what I think of what
I texted the night before is sure but
yeah it when it comes to like my morals
and stuff for the most part I try to do
my best I think everyone does that so
that's why it's always so like weird to
meet different views with like a you
know
reaching or something like that because
then it's like how they think they're
right easily and everyone thinks they're
right and we're just tryin I'm truely I
always think I'm right yeah however
somebody has evidence to show me that
I'm wrong I'd like to believe having
decent numbers and say you know what I
accept your argument I haven't even
thought of that perspective you know
just a lot with me
he's convinced me many times because
this is always an informed opinion and
it's not annex usually something I've
never even considered he's really right
yeah yeah was he from
or was it called Quincy Illinois oh I'm
so he great he's been out in LA for a
while ago I remember watching him on
like Game of Thrones not Funny or Die
and I was like this guy needs his own
show and then lo and behold Netflix pop
I'm not like ok so let's talk about
fashion let's talk about how no I I
wanna I'm like let's talk are you sure
ok that was like please do talk about
that oh great he responded to my
Instagram store the other day and I
should she hit my pants don't your
pants Kate it's not attractive I didn't
I was alone in a sudden it's like didn't
know what time I go to the gym we
FaceTime maybe 2 p.m. today but I tell
him he knows full well what time I go to
the gym
Thank You sis as soon as he wakes up
there's an outlet right as soon as he
wakes up he he basically sent me the
amount of times I've had to say I'm at
the gym at the gym too he's
always go good
I don't owe you guys all on a group chat
and if so what is the group chat name
actually we Bobby created it the day
last five got really close the Thursday
and he creates it well we will save ya
even if we don't get the job we know
we're good present there's something
which goes fight sometimes they're soul
mates of friends you know what I mean oh
you're like no bitch I have a partner um
who's your favorite out of the five and
you have to answer come on
give the people what they want it's
Jonathan's hair he it's its own
personality do you guys get to be
together a lot because I feel like now
that you're are you done with press tour
or no I see them all the time I see me
every week oh okay good are you just
travelling like crazy wait oh yeah
that's a quick play you just get
frustrated when I don't wear a hat
because he's like just gonna get coffee
and people keep stopping you when they
see us should we have to put on some
like Kylie Jenner wigs eventually like
he could talk his ridiculous khoka
straight oh my god he wants to wear one
to one sinner that zipper back of your
lace but yes so when does that even
happen because obviously in universe
when would you find out so we should
find out the start of April hmm yeah
yeah the announcement me let me tell you
the network is like no no other network
we they don't they don't watch but a
regular ratings mean it's based on some
algorithm that I will never understand
and so many many factors
and so we don't know until they make the
announcement what the response has been
so in the are huge like pockets there's
no way there's no way yeah in the world
yeah they've only cancelled one of my
favorite shows which was sensate and
everyone on the internet like freaked
out so badly that they're bringing it
back for the Christmas special or the
holiday special aw yeah they're bringing
back one more episode the internet went
to war for this show so hard and
I feel like if anything we're happy for
it to happen to queer I the internet
would just it would bring that lovin up
people the internet went nuts when Tom
when they found out that Tom and Abbie
where to go what do you think about all
of that your mom's there back though
yeah what do you think of that it I've
seen them in real life together and
there's no way yeah I let's check
Twitter every day you might got in a
fight with our friend at work got in a
real fight I was I look I love Tom so
much that I was mad at Abby and I know
that that's not fair cuz I didn't get
her side of the story but I was like
come on Abby I was mad and they were
like you can't be mad at her I was like
you can't tell me how to feel whose yeah
AJ no engage his boyfriend you obviously
are going yeah I had a really hard time
getting dressed this morning because I
was like what the am I supposed to
wear okay
it's an incredible artist her name's kid
belle but she would send you she will
send you this out of some herbage
and it's really cute like she has all
the power to the sure it's my
merch just came out whether it's an
anxiety queen and yeah it's a
like yes the answer is yes I'm confident
she'll say yes wait so so tell me about
like do when you meet someone for the
first time do you kind of like up/down
them and kind of give a story in your
open just whether they need a so awesome
is that it's so much more than just
let's make them pretty so that's why
don't we all do it when we see something
something shocking yeah yeah look I feel
like a lot of the people on the show too
and I think a lot of our listeners like
I've talked a lot about like body image
issues and whatnot and I think a lot of
like are our listeners that have voice
that they have the same concerns and
I've always been someone to like hide in
clothes so because I'm not like a
certain like the you know what standards
smaller size I just sort of trying to
hide myself in clothes she's got great
boobs that's calling but so but so I
feel like that's how like a lot of other
like a lot of the guys on the earth like
the heroes on that show sort of did that
to sort of hints of what what advice do
you give to people who are just like
closed down using clothes to hide
instead of using close to Lake like I
dread getting dressed in the morning
yeah yeah well besides that you truly
are me because you're gonna make
yourself feel worse if he overing sizes
there breaks up when people let me do
this a lot they'll buy a size of clothes
that they wanna fix him too
I think that's doing something so after
theory of intelligence I'll help people
when super news things actually
articulate please I'll pick it up they
are aggressive body do you have not for
the body minute you hope to have in my
case I don't wear like a bra and I just
wear like ironic t-shirts because we've
also work in a place where it's very
casual like yeah you don't have to wear
a suit so we have a weird like I should
be so lucky
no I'm not but also whoo in what world
if someone was actually having an affair
when they'd be like Oh finally someone
asks me about it that's why it's been
keeping it a secret because you're
basically saying the two gay men can't
be friends I'm asking you something so
you involve me I just wanted to be mean
to them yeah
she didn't scream story once where she
was like so I'm on the tabloids today
someone said that you know I'm dating
this guy that I lost a bunch of weight
and there's all these rumors coming out
and you know what that means I
made we never saw a jack
well why is it a chair would you have
his life exactly you say the whole thing
like two gay men can't be friends
because we were like just talking about
that because we both identify as bi so
like dating is always really weird
because when you meet a girl it's like
okay it should issue my best friend
because she's touching me because she
likes my outfit or she trying to me
like it's very confusing the same way I
feel like women have that struggle to
yeah who is your inspiration your style
inspiration take a lot of inspiration
problem so because I like to come up
with like oh look I like to make
something that's appropriate for me
I don't want to be anybody else but
people who I'm obsessed with our
co-worker Eugene just got picked to be
on David Beckham's new hair what's his
new line it's like his new style on her
Sumeria but anyways he did the job so
that he could meet Victoria back 14
years ago 30 years ago and I asked the
question she probably gets asked by
every gay man which is so inappropriate
but she was so funny and so nice so I
thought yeah I asked her what do I need
to do I mean like that's it comes with
the territory I feel like when you got a
fine-ass husband you know what I bet you
I bet you some people it's not like it's
not like men are asking him wait can I
borrow your wife haha yeah you know
No all the Spice Girls I thought it was
yes yes for listeners right now if
you're listening get us all tickets to
see this is what we do every episode
because our audience is so
awesome ly aggressive on Twitter we ask
them to do things for us where we'll be
like Texas let me talk to you okay if
you can get for that be great
importantly we need one for dance okay I
have a feeling with that Netflix money
you could go ahead and get yourself a
ticket girl oh just being greedy no no
no that is yielding your power and
greater good that I wield that I never
knew up for example I can tweet that I
really want to meet James Corden and he
responds saying I will meet you anytime
like okay let me tell you what free
stuff never gets old I'm never not gonna
love free are you kidding me wait
speaking of food Anthony don't do it
we don't even have to he's a great cook
I follow on in almost every night drink
on the show so we spent every night
every evening together in our own and
each other's apartments he cooked for me
almost every night he is the best cook
your people say yeah that's like an
ongoing thing is that people are like is
even a good cook all he doesn't slice an
avocado in it look he makes accessible
food for the people who are there he's
not gonna go Tom like could ask you
about his Instagram story because the
other night he had dumplings on there
that I wanted to stick my I wanted to
put inside of me in a sexual way what's
wrong with interviewers I guess they
gotta get their sound bites right that's
why and he loves that he had such good
close-ups of okay yeah they would he
came in there like very cinematic food
stories and he got the job is because
that first day of interviews he started
to talk about food and me and the other
ones we were on camera we were
salivating oh my he was talking about he
describes food oh my goodness a
fantastic shot and the way it's
something about his mouth it's so it's
 sexy like the way he talks in
the way it's like all pouty and I'm
just like oh my god
the funny thing is and I feel this way
otherwise I don't think we'd be as close
as we are
I never even at casting everyone's
talking about how sexy this guy was oh
yeah not my type at all I love that
because it leaves we can have the
closest yeah it doesn't mean you want to
 each other just cuz you gay yeah
believe it or not
so what's your favorite type of food
then yes very well yeah for me looks
because western food like something from
a jar and then add meat okay do it from
scratch I get the spices ready I grind
my spices and then the actual naan bread
I bake the dough is the best so
he loves it so I make it round although
every night do you ever get to eat
Pakistani food out here when you come to
LA you guys don't know I was just gonna
ask if you had any recommendation here
[Laughter]
yeah she went so so we recommend a
recommendation and I really hope she so
watch this cuz she could be offended but
I mean she made a recommendation like
setting food it's only my husband when
this was after the oh my god I saw you
and I was so jealous she said it was a
hard wall but I didn't realize it was a
rat infested no good like usually those
are the best places right and they're
like mom and pop kinda honestly jars of
time I love a hole in the wall man do
not like foxy well the funny thing is
now that this is all happened people
think oh we arranged a meeting with him
let's take him to somewhere super bougie
do you know what it's gonna make me
really upset yeah I love you what's your
favorite nice buns Nan's bond between
