remember the first time I noticed a lady
in that way knew I liked her in a
different way that I did not like my
other friends like why am I seeing her
in a different way why is she so
beautiful to me but like you know in a
teeny kind of way women just have this
like softness like their softer to touch
to kiss I love a woman has has some
curves too I really loved Beck's woman's
curves on their backs their hips the
softness yet like so strong forearms
forearms are the hottest part if you
have lesbian sex you are having sex with
someone's forearms a big personality
usually gets me it's sort of like their
energy you don't really see it but if
something you feel I'm always like
really attracted to really confident
women confidence on a woman is probably
the sexiest things you know confidence
is like quieter but it's like almost
more powerful I see a woman that's like
she looks strong she comes in like
unapologetic do I want to be more like
them or do I want to be with them like I
want to get to know that person I really
like fat Femmes and I think that's a fat
person I really feel seen and understood
by other fat people so I guess my type
is a little bit more masculine that
androgyny is so sexy to me type of swag
and style to you I mean their swagger
which is this kind of unidentifiable way
in which someone of masculine
presentation expresses confidence women
who break those gender binaries are sexy
because they're breaking it because
they're saying well screw you big ol
middle finger to that idea I'm gonna do
it this way I think that there's truly a
radiance that comes out of someone when
they're really being who they are so for
me the most beautiful people are the
people who are being their most
authentic selves what makes a woman
beautiful is your soul doesn't matter if
you're short if you're tall it doesn't
matter if you're thicker if you're
dinner it's so much more than what they
look like on the outside I think women
are gorgeous inside and outside when
are incredibly more worthy than they are
taught women are amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
