because his name is not on a cup that
you could hold for ten minutes while you
drink a pumpkin spice latte
why does Christian music always sound
like a mixture of like Nickelback and
Third Eye Blind did your devotions
actually happen if you didn't post about
it on Instagram how come we all love Tim
Tebow I mean I do love him I just don't
know why why can't you just pray why
does it have to be a prayer and then
like someone in the background being I
yeah how come everyone's still
supporting Donald Trump why are we so
afraid to talk about sex sex is good
have you read Song of Solomon how come
we all love chick-fil-a why do you think
Facebook is an appropriate place to
discuss theology why when Paul said that
we all have our own individual gifts
that we feel the need to fit into this
absolutely perfect mold that's
impossible why are we as Christians more
known by the things we hate than by our
acts of love why do you think
Christianity and science are
incompatible if anything science makes
God look a lot cooler why are you so
adamant about exercising your religious
freedoms but then gets so offended when
people of other faiths exercise their
religious freedoms why do you feel like
I have to constantly be preaching in
order to be a good Christian is showing
my friends love and grace not allowed to
just speak for itself sometimes how come
there's a church on every block but for
some reason we can't figure out a way to
work together why is just so much racism
sexism and homophobia in the church
Galatians 3:28 says there's neither Jew
nor Greek neither slave nor free normal
nor female for all one in Christ Jesus
so doesn't that pretty much tell you
that none of that stuff matters why when
the main message of the Bible is to love
one another that we choose to do the
opposite how come when we talk about men
having several wives in the Old
Testament we say cultural context and
when we talk about marriage today it's
strictly one man in one woman
why does having a diverse group of
friends make me less Christian why does
the church consider LGBT Christians as
less than I don't remember there being a
demographic of people that Jesus saw as
less than you know well that grace and
forgiveness in love we've all received
how come we can't find a way that extend
that to other people why do you feel
like love the sinner and hate the sin
isn't
okay thing to say you realize that's
condescending and still separating them
as an other right why do you think you
can judge my relationship with God off
of a handful of statements you get mad
at me for not being able to back up what
I have to say but you end up taking
scripture out of context so many times
what makes you decide what makes me a
good Christian
last I checked everyone's relationship
with God is personal in the end the
grand message here is that you're
supposed to love one another and I'm
sorry if I sound like a hallmark after
Street stuff but it's the truth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
