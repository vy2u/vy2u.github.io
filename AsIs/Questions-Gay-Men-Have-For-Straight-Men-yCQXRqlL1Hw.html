fleece hoodie and it like it's very soft
and it's like envelops you very nicely
well it's not like a fleece hoodie as a
straight guy how often do you think
about your penis like all the time some
days I have a great amount of confidence
okay like wow look at you other days
it's like oh it's called
have you always known that you're
straight or have you ever questioned it
I think every straight guy is lying if
they say they haven't like double
checked there's certainly times I was
like I don't know I think I'm straight I
think that's what I assume also when
you're like a kid like a vagina is super
weird and you're like I don't know if I
want to look at that either I don't know
what I want to look at any of this stuff
all this stuff is gross looking can you
explain to me what the deal is with
boobs you don't get them I don't get it
at all like what's the appeal I don't
know for me they're alive they're just
perky and they're fun they're soft
they're round usually symmetrical for
the most part I like the mystery behind
them I've never had vaginal sex and I
don't know what it's like how would you
describe it that's pretty amazing
it's like warm no nice way to describe
like warm wet and silky which I don't
think is a great descriptor and when you
hear it but it's like that sensation of
like oh this feels exactly right what's
it like having the pressure of like I
really hope to god that the condom
doesn't break otherwise I'm gonna have a
baby it's pretty terrifying it's
probably more so for the girl because
right needs a lot more for the girl not
only like is this gonna is this
relationship gonna fall apart now I'm on
the hook for 18 years like man would I
be really ready to father a child at
this age would I be able to afford it
know what it would ruin my life so it's
like it's super scary do you ever get
tired of society's gender norms placed
upon you like do you ever feel like oh
 I don't want to pay on the first
date I think I like less the standards
of like physicality and beauty that
you're led up to believe is a kid like
that is it little boy you should go up
to be a muscular man
and that it's it's like that's how and
you're like measured more by this than
you are by anything else
and like I never was someone who was
like super muscular so I always felt
embarrassed when someone would come up
and be like hey how are you and grab my
arm to sort of gauge my muscle like that
what they're doing when they grab you
that's what girls have admitted that
when a girl talk grabs a guy here it's
too like haha here's so funny it's a
check this just blew my mind right you
don't realize that when like a girl's
aroused that it does physically change
sort of like how you get a boner it does
right right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
