it's in a threeway I've got a real one
right here in front of me or am i what
is bisexuality even a real thing
bisexuality is real and valid are gay
men mean to you today gay men Wow do I
scare you
sometimes curly likes to say we don't
exist
they're not real I feel like bisexual
women are perceived as just like
exploring their sexuality you ever think
that you're being just being selfish
no bisexual women specifically get a lot
of hate from the lesbian community
because we get like labeled greedy do
you think that bisexual people have more
threesomes than the average person does
I don't know what's a stereotype of
bisexuality that you do not fit I think
a lot of people think bisexual people
just want to like have lots of sex and
be with multiple partners at once but I
am for sure like a serial monogamist
like I'm usually always in a
relationship and with one person when
you date someone are they generally more
insecure of this same sex or the
opposite sex so is like was it cheating
if it's a girl
yes it's a cheating I had a girl a
little while back say that she liked me
but wouldn't be interested in doing
anything with me because I'd been with a
guy before
oh her yeah or don't do you notice
yourself changing depending on which
gender you're dating there's not the
same pressure I think when you're dating
a guy to be the man so to speak when it
comes to like having sex with females
I'm more aware of my femininity what's
the most annoying question you regularly
get asked about being bisexual who do
you like more boys or girls are you like
75% lesbian and like 25 gay or is it
like 50/50 and that answer would be very
different for everyone
I don't see sexuality as static I am in
love with like minds and like Intel
yeah and I think that usually is far
more important than any other thing to
me it's okay to be predominantly
attracted to one gender over the other
and still identify as bisexual this is
gonna be like this for forever unless
you get married so if you get married to
a man are you still bisexual no matter
who I marry though that's not gonna
immediately make me like hate dick or
hate vagina bisexuals can love whoever
they want to love and have fun with
whoever they want to have fun with like
I love that so much as long as you know
who you are
everyone a boo no why no one
likes bisexuals because they're wasteful
you know who's wasteful is gay man you
got all those little spermies and waste
another minute it's not wasting if you
swallow honey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
