are there stereotypes that you identify
with more than others there's the super
masculine like passing for straight guy
and then there's like the super femme Z
staffing and like surrounds himself with
like pretty girls yeah I don't find
myself at either of those like extremes
and so like it can sometimes be hard for
people to take me seriously as a gay
person how are to you gay relationships
different from straight relationships I
think a big part of being straight is
like men trying to figure out women and
women trying to figure out men and that
barrier just isn't there in a gay
relationship how much porn did you watch
that was straight porn before you switch
to gay porn I watched a little bit of it
and was always would focus on the guy in
the shot I'd say you know denial is a
really powerful force because I spent
years watching gay porn convincing
myself I was still straight in
retrospect it makes absolutely no sense
no but when you're a confused teenager
you can sort of rationalize anything do
gay guys worry about size as much as I
think straight guys do I would almost
argue that gay people worry about size
even more than straight people when
straight people are having sex they
don't have anyone to compare to unless
it's a threesome but home maintenance
isn't how doesn't like how is it how is
it for you other than a constant fear of
like causing an anal fissure down the
butthole falls down like the butthole
just like falls out is this a Saw movie
what the would you rather hey just
a little bit smaller than an average
dick or like a way too big to do
anything with dick man I would prefer a
way too big dick yeah yeah big ol dick
yeah just a big old day what are you
doing if you meet someone that you
really like
part of the conversation comes up you're
both bottoms or you're both tops just
not compatible is that a deal breaker
there are toys that you can use to
surmount that obstacle you open yourself
to a lot more people if you tell people
that your verse as opposed to just like
always saying that no I'm a hard bottom
or hard top what's the term of verse
verse okay like reverse I do both know
like versatile versatile okay I I can't
imagine it's easy to come out but was I
mean there's a lot of variety of
experiences how did yours go it went
incredibly well and that's mostly just
like thanks to my parents being super
chill and wonderful and supportive yeah
I was just like in the park on a walk
with my mom and I time did speak to that
if it went terribly we wouldn't have
that much left of the walk to do and if
it but if it went well which it did we
would still have some time to process it
it sounds like a proposal I was just as
nervous telling someone something we've
known your whole life and worrying that
it's gonna change their entire
perception of you was terrifying do you
go like whoa yes and is that a good
thing for gay men to hear I think it
boosts like oh whoa look at wow what a
dick you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
