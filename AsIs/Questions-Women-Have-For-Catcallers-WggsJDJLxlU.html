Mother story like this well I yelled hey
you have a nice ass and then the rest
was history has this ever worked for you
do we look like we're enjoying it I may
laugh it off and seem like it's funny
but in reality I'm really scared and it
makes me feel disgusting do you actually
think saying hey baby you want to suck
my dick right now is a great
conversation starter that's the best you
have to offer in terms of reaching out
to the opposite sex why do you think you
have the right to say nasty things to me
just because I'm wearing something that
makes me feel good you do it to impress
other guys around you because degrading
me make you feel like more of a man is
this the rich family tradition that you
hope to pass on to your children what
would you do if you heard someone
talking like that to your mother sister
why would you ever think this is a
compliment if it makes me uncomfortable
it's no longer a compliment it's a
threat who realize that you are the
reason why I took a self-defense class
why do you go out of your way to make
you feel uncomfortable
literally what is going through your
brain when you're shouting at me do you
like me shouting at you you do realize
that actually stopping and thinking
before you commit inaction is what sets
humans apart from animals right are you
gonna go pee on stuff to claim it too
what gives you the authority to tell a
woman that you don't know to smile why
can't you just do something nice to make
me smile if so many women hate it why do
you keep doing you probably hate women
right how would you feel if someone
larger and physically threatening to you
yelled out demeaning things about your
body you notice after you yelled at me
that I started walking away faster why
are you making noises at me am i a dog
like what book did you read that from
cuz it needs to be burned along with
whoever wrote it this stress relief is
this a bad habit are you compensating
for something how do you really want me
to react do you really think I owe you a
response why do you think that you're
entitled to my time like my precious
time that I spend doing meaningful
things just because you want to tell me
that I have a hot ass I wish I didn't
have to just change something about me
because you can't control yourself if
we're ever really gonna reach gender
equality we have to stop viewing each
other as meat here we all disagree that
catcalling sucks and that we should stop
it I don't know how to say that like you
know I'm not gonna you right I'm not
gonna do it tomorrow I'm not gonna do
with the day after that I'm not gonna do
it next week I'm sure so I'm not about
to you next year that is not on my new
year's resolution list to a guy who cat
called me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
