you're definitely talking to them no I
don't want to well I'm gonna go to the
bathroom to a powder my nose
don't do that stop it hi hey why does he
have no posters or pictures does he have
a family
does anybody love him I like your place
right so nervous I'm gonna make a bad
joke can everybody get to careful with
the one-night stand yeah should I put on
my clothes before getting in his bed or
really be grossed out is that unsanitary
I'm very clean Thanks how do we brush my
teeth I use my finger what if I never
find out his last name how will I stalk
him on Facebook do I have to talk to his
roommate what am I gonna say hello I'm
having a one-night stand
hi hi my mic's friend do i text my
roommates and tell him I'm not coming
home they're never gonna boo you I'm at
a guy's place oh man we're gonna have a
good brunch maybe they called the cops
why do all boys have Navy sheets and
decorate with empty bottles of liquor
are we supposed to snuggle well that's
nice
oh is it rude if I move his arm away why
is it so heavy
well just gonna ruin the moment by
moving his arm because I can't breathe
what if he doesn't stop snoring and I
can't fall asleep what if I snore super
loudly and he lays awake in the dark
resenting me what do I do now should I
sneak off like in the movies hey are you
hungry I'm okay I have to leave before
noon for this to be a one-night stand
is there a rule thing what if he
actually asks me out this would be such
an adorable beginning to a relationship
what if I want to see him again I know
where he lives
how do I get home from here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
