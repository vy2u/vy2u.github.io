reproductive endocrinologist which means
I'm an ob/gyn that specializes in
fertility in general it's not a great
idea to insert soap all the way up into
the vagina the vagina is a very balanced
and sensitive ecosystem full of a lot of
different types of bacteria that are in
balance with each other if you insert so
especially antibacterial soap all the
way into the vagina that can actually
cause one bacteria to over grow and the
other ones to diminish and it's going to
upset that balance and that can cause
lots of issues like infections and it
can also cause irritation obviously
cleaning the outside of the vagina is
very important
some of the reason that women react so
differently to hormonal birth control is
that they're with estrogen for example
there's different levels of estrogen you
can have higher levels of estrogen or
lower levels of estrogen within the
birth control or with the progestins you
can have different levels of per Justins
and you can also have different types of
progestin so imagine all the different
combinations of the different levels of
estrogen the different levels and types
of progestins throw that all together
there's lots of different types of
combinations of hormonal contraception
and on top of that you can actually have
some contraception where the levels of
hormones are consistent and stay the
same the whole time you're on them and
other types of hormonal contraception
where actually the levels go up so with
all those different combinations it
makes people feel really different
so you can take patches there's shots
you can actually have implants which are
little rods that get implanted in your
skin in your arm in addition there's
something called the IUD which is an
intrauterine device that actually is a
plastic device that's inserted into the
uterus it's really easily inserted and
that can have hormones or not have
hormones so there's lots of different
options for a contraception besides the
birth control pill
Eagle exercises are actually very
effective at strengthening the pelvic
floor muscles so they can be used as a
treatment for certain types of urinary
incontinence and also uterine prolapse
when there's a drop in the uterus
nothing have instant vagina if you don't
have sex for a while the vagina is just
fine
the vagina is actually designed to
stretch that's what actually happens
when a woman has a baby vaginally
because the baby's head and the baby's
body has to come through the vagina to
get out
some women are predisposed to tear
during childbirth a lot of that may have
to do with the size of the baby and also
actually how long labor goes on labor
goes on for a long time that allows the
vagina to slowly stretch out so it can
accommodate the size of the baby if the
labor is really short sometimes the
vagina just hasn't had time to stretch
out and so the vagina is more likely to
tear in having intercourse the vagina is
probably more likely to tear obviously
if it's rough intercourse or also if
there's not enough vaginal lubrication
the your uterus can't fall out of you
however there is something called
uterine prolapse where the uterus can
drop down because the tissue that holds
it up it's not as strong anymore and
that can happen when women are much
older and after a childbirth so the
outside of the vagina which is the labia
can look very different women can have
larger labia or smaller labia it can be
darker in color lighter in color and all
of those variations are normal
so most women have a typical range of
what their periods feel like to them not
all the months are going to be exactly
the same some might be worse some will
be easier but they're going to be in a
range that's typical for that if they
have a period that is really different
than a normal period that might be a
good time to actually go and speak with
our gynecologist
if you have painful periods especially
ones that disrupt your life you really
need to talk to your gynecologist about
it a healthy amount of sex is the amount
of sex that you feel comfortable with
and you want to have
a woman's fertility starts slowly
changing in the end of her 20s and we
really think after the age of 30 we
start seeing more significant changes
with accelerations at the ages of 35 and
then there's another big change that
happens between 37 and 39 so if you're
thinking about starting a family or
you're thinking about freezing your eggs
because you want to save your chance for
having a baby in the future you should
really start thinking about that in your
early 30s and start addressing it before
the age of 35
