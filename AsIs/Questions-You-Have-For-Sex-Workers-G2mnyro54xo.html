name is Susie Q I'm an author columnist
for the San Francisco weekly podcaster
and I'm a sex worker I'm making mod and
I'm an adult performer what kind of
performer I work primarily in medias
important what do you do in the sex work
industry escort I'm a pro Dom I model
for adult film my name is Venus lux my
stage name an occupation is zo performer
model anything in an adult industry
basically so first off let me just ask
what are some questions you feel people
should just not ever ask sex workers I
really hate it when people ask me how
much I charge
it's like inappropriate like it would be
weird if you like if someone asked me
how much I mean yeah it's weird you
don't do that oh you're a sex worker can
you tell me how often threesome with my
wife I'm like no why do you think sex
work is such a taboo subject I'm Chinese
and so in my culture we don't not talk
about sex at all being in porn actually
helps me open up that dialogue of like
how can you actually have sex with a
transsexual what does that look like
think about it the country was basically
started by the people who weren't cool
enough to live in Europe we have a whole
lot of shame about sex like we don't
provide comprehensive sexual education
to anybody currently in the United
States sex work prostitution
specifically is criminalized already
there is a stigma around sexuality
specifically women leveraging their
sexuality for profit it's easy to talk
about violence in this country than it
is to talk about sex which is so weird
to me yeah sex is so much more fun than
violence exactly why have we figured
that out what do you think some of the
most common misconceptions of sex
workers on I think people see us as
worth less than someone who doesn't do
sex work people have a misconception
about sex work that it's this like kind
of like sleazy shady thing but it's
actually like the probably the most
honest interaction that you can have so
how did your close friends and family
react when they found out that you want
to pursue this professions my mom was so
not happy about it but then over time
she kind of faded out with that
understanding that I
looking at this as a professional doing
this as a career a big stigma that I've
been told as you know sex workers don't
have relationships or live in others I
think it's important to remember that
sex work is my job if I perform they
have to be able to be patient
understanding and respectful that it's
for work purposes I come home to you
because we live in a society where
prostitution and a lot of sex work is
criminalized it does and a lot of people
at risk
have you ever feared for your own life
in this industry I have definitely been
scared about
if someone Rob's me my own body I
definitely fear if someone would assault
me like what would I do
would I call the police I don't know
it's daunting to know that you are not
protected by the law how do you feel
that the treatment of men and women
differs in this industry I think the
outside perception is that men in this
industry are lucky and don't have any
problems and it's a dream job when we're
talking about women doing sex work
everybody wants to talk about victims
and exploitation I mean it's it's funny
that that is the perception but I think
the women of the industry definitely run
the show they're the stars of the show a
lot of times exactly generally porn is
made for a male audience that is federal
sexual sis white male audience no I know
I know boring I'm speaking of both
behalf of transgender men and women we
are like 10 20 years behind we only have
like five companies that shoot
transsexual pornography
what do you think are some things that
society can do in order to be more
understanding to sex workers I think the
most important thing that people can do
is listen to sex workers in the United
States of America there's a House bill
1614 to decriminalize prostitution if
you really want to end trafficking you
need to decriminalize sex work I never
even thought of it as a business but
here you are you made it by yourself
and people don't know that that exists
