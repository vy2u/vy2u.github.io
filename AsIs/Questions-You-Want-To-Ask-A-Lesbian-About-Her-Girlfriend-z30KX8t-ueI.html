even knew you were a lesbian with who
who are you talking about
what do you know about my life if the
woman is always right in an argument who
wins in a lesbian argument
whoever's made the best and most logical
point you know or we compromise we're
women we've been conditioned to
compromise we have is it true that
lesbians send out a stronger connection
as they both understand their situations
as females in this society better
totally and we can share flannel shirts
do you and your partner have the toilet
seat permanently bolted down in your
house of course and this is how we use
it how do you feel when someone asks
who's the man oh well that could be the
man over there that seems like I miss my
family the camera guys a man oh do you
just need help identifying men idiot
what's with the stereotypes that
lesbians get serious really fast and
love home improvement well I think we
tend to get serious really quickly
because it's amazing to spend time with
someone who's a lot like you and wants
to hang out the same way you do also
make out hang out make out that's what
it's like to be a lesbian it's awesome
you can put on Love Actually or whatever
your other favorite movie is as for home
improvement
Tim L is pretty great haha a decent show
Wilson and Jonathan Taylor Thomas his
haircut was pretty influential on me as
a young child how do you stay so calm
with all the judgmental people staring
and whispering at your relationship
generally there isn't that much staring
a whispering I live in a part of the
country where I can openly be Who I am
and there are plenty of reasons why gay
people can't relocate but if you're a
gay person and you live in a part of the
country where you are stared at or
whispered about and you can relocate I
just want you to know that there are
other places where you can feel more
safe
why by strap-ons you made your choice no
first of all I have an innie and also
human beings have been augmenting their
bodies in ways that are helpful for a
very long time some people wear glasses
a lot of people wear shoes just because
you wear shoe doesn't you want to be a
horse other than sex are there any real
differences in your relationship to
others I have no idea last time I dated
a man us 20 we mostly ate cereal
together geez take turns making the
sandwiches or do you have epic
competitions each time if there is a
straight woman out there who's dating
the man who wrote this question breakup
with that man Cheerios Lucky Charms
raisin bran
we are partner ever consider being the
biological mummy to any future bubs
this person is drunk or British</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
