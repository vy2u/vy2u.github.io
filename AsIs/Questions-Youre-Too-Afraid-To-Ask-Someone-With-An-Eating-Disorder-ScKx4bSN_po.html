it's just something that happened
it had nothing to do with me and my
appearance it was kind of my escape I
didn't feel attractive in my own body
but that's a symptom of something else
intellectually you know your worth isn't
dependent on your appearance I wanted at
the time to be a supermodel in short it
was because I wasn't truly pleased with
what I saw but that was based on what I
wanted to be and what is accepted in the
industry in which I found myself I felt
like I had no control over myself or my
surroundings so I turned to my body as a
thing that I could control in order to
give me a sense of stability people
assume that everyone with an eating
disorder is anorexic which is simply not
true there's binge eating disorder
there's bulimia there's a lot of eating
disorders that still allow you to eat
when I would talk to people about in my
family they were like well it's really
easy you can just eat a roti and key and
you'll be good to go like that's not how
it works it's a way to manage your
feelings it's way to not feel your
feelings it is a mental illness that's
what you have to confront the worst
thing that you could do to someone with
an eating disorder is to say that you
don't look thin enough to have an eating
disorder
you can definitely be overweight or
underweight or any type of weight and
have an eating disorder eating disorders
aren't just like physically harming
they're so psychologically harming and I
think focusing on sensational aspects
you're ignoring the fact that sufferers
are in a lot of pain
mental illness doesn't give a about
gender they affect all races weights
genders sexual orientations people think
it's a gendered illness it just created
a lot of stigma for me to deal with if
you're male and you have an eating
disorder don't feel like your struggle
isn't real so so boys and anybody can
get anything disorder and they do
Nana nanana it's not just like oh I'm
eating I'm okay a lot of eating
disorders don't mean that you stop
eating it was a mental process and it
took several years for me to become
happy with myself again you can't tell
by examining someone's eating habits
unless you're like spying on them for
like three months straight and just be
creepy recovery for me was a long time
it was really a battle it wasn't just
like okay I'm ready to get better today
it was a series of small steps and then
a series of backwards slides I thought
like I would never recover I thought
like what am I going to do on my wedding
day like I can't eat the wedding cake
it's still like everyday when I should
eat when I shouldn't eat and can't I get
over the fact that like food is so
social and in my life everyday recovery
spent a lot of managing discomfort it's
a practice it's not a destination that
eating disorder voice I had like it's
still there I just know to ignore it
more now it's kind of like a roommate in
my head then I just share a space with
and he's always there I've just learned
to ask him to be a little less messy I
got to this place of appreciating myself
more than judging myself after you get
to that point you just like go out and
do you
it doesn't affect my personality it
doesn't affect my capabilities it does
not mean that I'm broken it does not
mean I ever was broken it doesn't mean
I'm weak it doesn't mean I'm stupid it
doesn't mean I'm vain and we're all just
trying to live the best life that we can
and be the best people that we can be
and we're trying to feel the best way
that we can if you've never experienced
an eating disorder you just kind of have
to accept that that's an experience you
don't understand and I just need you to
empathize with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
