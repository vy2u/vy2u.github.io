 up so you don't have to I'm Kate
I'm Kelsey well we decided to say our
names in the beginning there
it feels official because some people
were like what's this podcast that's
doing so well on I dude they're like who
are these girls so we thought we should
say our names yeah here we are here we
are and we're also eating breakfast so
sorry for the disgusting audio and thank
you so much for everyone for being
patient last week yes
during that clusterfuck of an output
that I you have to live your life you
have to go to Barcelona yeah speaking of
Barcelona can we just talk about our
shirts if you're listening to this and
not watching we have incredible shirts
from our last guest erekle us my shirt
says my whole rules and my shirt says
sorry Emily Starr I was masturbated
she has the best merch I wore
another one of her shirts to the airport
all the way home from Barcelona that
said powered by orgasms with a lightning
bolt
truly got the most interesting stares
from TSA and not in the way of like
she's suspicious it's more like aha are
you so ho now I feel weird wearing this
well you're gonna take it off as soon as
we sever Curitiba Donald you should
because it's like it's it's subtle yeah
so if you have to get close and then at
that point to be like where you're
looking at my boobs your pervy but my
tits are down here maybe you didn't read
it I'm sorry please got that I will not
sir yeah let's get right into it I'm sad
yeah I feel like I should just get that
out of the way we might have to like
pause recording if I got a phone call
just because this is a podcast where I'm
honest I don't like to hide things from
you guys I learned that very I learned
that early on
and going through some stuff right now
some family stuff some really scary
health stuff my sister
long story short when I was in Barcelona
man so much happened after the last time
yeah literally the most the most
happened when I was in Barcelona I got a
phone call that they found a tumor and
my sister spine which is a weird place
to have a two marks at that yes Rishi
place and she got it tested she got all
these tests done and we're supposed to
literally get the results back while
we're recording and it just makes I'm
thinking I'm like extra happy because
I'm trying to be extra positive yeah and
so if I get a little sad that's why and
we'll cross the bridge when we get to it
and that's uh my sad sob story but you
know what make me feel a lot better talk
about you coming I feel so bad that I
don't have better news Wow
i watch some of Erica's porn videos yeah
indie film videos and the ex confessions
right yeah ex confession and it was
freaking great they were so oh my god it
just was beautiful right oh it was
beautiful I watched the one in the rain
mmm did you see that was like she's like
imagining it I'm pretty sure mm-hmm and
but this guy like comes up to me and
she's just like in there and was like
feelin herself she's mastering what
she's thinking of this guy and then the
guy they actually show this scene with
the guy and it's just really great
aren't going and I was like this is
maybe this am I using one of the toys
from the company that sent us all these
free sex toys yeah really ribbit it's
called the pearly rabbit and it's a
vibrator vibrating dildo right it's got
like pearls in the top I didn't they
spin around and that's why it feels good
yeah maybe how did it have it have it
how did it
okay it was good and then all of a
sudden out of nowhere I was just like
that
I'm over it mmm you just completely just
stopped
oh god okay I have so much more to do oh
but I do think if we've talked about
this before I think that it's like
directly related to me like enjoying
myself what not so feel like I've been
making there's like this saying if
nothing changes nothing changes so
nothing's gonna change there if I don't
if I just keep trying unless you're
taking a whole and the change happens
because you dig a hole too so it doesn't
matter you take it all right now okay
okay for anyone who couldn't see that
sorry okay what was I say if
they're talking about not coming but oh
yeah they say the the thing you said and
also I see a comment on the last
YouTube video or they keep saying I keep
cutting people off that's what I do I'm
not here to interview people I'm
here to talk to people like how friends
talk to people I don't give a if
someone saying something and you know I
be polite but also we have to record and
I need to get answers and they need
sound bites and so for me nobody
all you think I'm too rude what I am
rude but also sometimes I'm stuttering
and she cuts me off and that's good and
when she cuts me off if I'm talking I
tell her yeah and then she says it again
anyways I'd never repeat myself I
literally never repeat myself and so
instead you just go oh yeah I was making
a bad joke
it was that thank you oh what's that
sorry we apologize because I had to take
the phone call from a family which it
turns out the doctors had inconclusive
test results and that really pissed
everyone off cuz they did inconclusive
testing
we are gonna go get a second opinion but
hey back to the show me buddy bebop
buddy
okay we're back had to take a phone call
it was not the phone call cuz my sisters
doctors apparently aren't gonna be your
doctors anymore cuz they don't know what
the is going on and it's actually
let's just let it vent about this for a
quick second because I'm okay
dude you have to find the right
doctor it's insane especially when
you're dealing with like they told
her like the day before she went and got
her test you could have nothing or you
could have AIDS or MS and like that is a
wildly big spectrum of things that it
could be dude when my grandfather was
sick he got he got like real sick and he
went into the hospital and he was there
for weeks he was there for weeks and
they're like we don't know what's wrong
my god especially done elderly like dude
and speak out for themselves we were all
at the hospital and he was like he was
about to get life flighted to pen and he
was like he couldn't speak and the
doctor comes in and was just like you're
about to go in a helicopter have you
ever been in a helicopter and fathers
went huh
cuz he talked about it then the next day
cuz the second he got to pen I swear to
God
yeah he was up and he was talking Wow
and he was like a whole different person
and he had lymphoma well they did no one
was able to tell and it's just it's you
gotta go to only work where it's where
it's and second opinions are so
important I have seen go down where
people have just gone with the first
thing the first doctor the first test
that and then their lives have been
ruined and we've done so many videos
about this where like doctors don't
believe women of color women
specifically and it's actually and it's
it's a huge problem like how how that is
not talked about and it's a shitty thing
to talk about because of course you
never want to like talk about
doctors because they're saving lives but
there is issues there they're
big big issues I feel like there is just
a lot of like I went to a dermatologist
once hey I don't want to tell this jury
never mind what are you gonna say
I have scabies it's terrible what's the
difference wheat scabies and bed bugs
bed bugs don't burrow into your skin and
leave is that what scabies is it's body
lice yeah can you just get it from just
like feet like a coat you have to have
like like like contact and I don't know
if into anyone that's nothing to be
embarrassed about
right I just don't know how I got it
like I don't know it but better but even
still this is why it's so gross is that
it's bad enough cuz like you'll see like
little signs like or whatever and you go
to the doctor like it's gabey's and they
give you medicine and then you're done
and you like wash your sheets and
everything and you know you're done
doctor I went to I wasn't I was like I
had scabies highest IVs doc and he was
like I don't think so I think you're
allergic you you might be allergic to
something so then he just had me either
he was like just a couple weeks like
stop drinking coffee for a couple weeks
if that doesn't work stop being nuts for
a couple weeks and I was like okay so
for six months I had scabies oh
oh my body it was odd I had scars like I
couldn't swim in this that summer he was
from November to March holy I guess
that's five months but then I couldn't
swim in this summer without wearing a
sharks I had just like scars all over my
god and that's how that's
what happens people sit in Disney's are
like in sickness and then something else
terrible happens and then I just didn't
I was covered I was like I was wearing
long sleeves luckily I'm Tara but I was
wearing long sleeves like confluences
yeah like we've talked about this when
we did the chronic pain episode but like
it also can apply to a lot of
authoritative figures but when you go to
the place where you're supposed to get
help and you don't get the help like you
know with police right like that you
know the reason why I like half the
 country doesn't trust the police
because when you go to the one place
where you're suppose to get help and you
end up getting hurt that's just if you
live you whereas if you are that's just
the thing there's some people that when
you're this job you're supposed to just
be this job right now yeah you're a
person but you're this job yeah do we
get it doctors are people too
and we support our troops and our
doctors but my point is I mean I'm still
this because of the other day tried to
say it now
yeah the other day I thought he got like
drugged
I got drugged at a bar didn't know that
that's what you're we're have to go into
like all the details oh but I think it's
important that we do a thought-out
fleshed out good episode about what
happened to you yes it's so new I'm okay
okay but the doctor was also a
 and she just she was like you know
sometimes when you drink too much you
black out and I was like like you were
roofied and she tried to victim-blaming
yeah and then they didn't test my pee
for like days so of course and your plug
they didn't tell it to us and
she's just the sole situation was so
terrible and to go through something
like that alone and then now you're kind
of on the other side being like what the
 was that it's like going through a
washing machine yeah you just have to
find the right knocking dirt still on
yeah what sorry I tried to make a
metaphor do you always make good ones
coming out of a washing machine with
dirt it alanya be good but we should
like we should do an episode about it I
think we might be cool if we talked to a
doctor oh hell yeah
and then we're just sort of like so
what's it like so what the man so
why don't people who believe doctors
yeah or like why don't doctors believe
patient I think it would be really cool
if we could get a doctor that would come
on here and talk about that because
that's a really taboo subject like
that's also not saying that a doctor
would have to speak for all doctors yeah
I think it would be also like rightful
women's especially business yeah cool
let's do it anyway sorry we had
to pause he was finishing talking about
how she's gonna try and do different
things in her life to me it doesn't even
 hold a candle now I'm sorry no
it's okay it's okay that's what this my
guess is though it's all over the
hallways they became you know what you
signed up for it guys
in terms of coming just well I think
this is being true to yourself right and
like liking what you like and just
saying it out loud and whatnot and you
were saying that you're gonna try and
bring more good things into your life
yeah like decorate my apartment yeah I
love your apartment yeah I want to look
put stuff up that I actually like but
hey sometimes I just don't even know oh
we should go to a yeah I'm gonna
 flea market my white girl in Los
Angeles but wait should we take half a
day one day and go for research yeah
definitely we need to take off work to
go to a flea market hopefully our bosses
don't listen to their surfaces listen to
this hey bus if you listenin send us a
sign come out of here dill hella jealous
speaking of coming in to you something
kind of ballsy last week things that we
want to talk about right now oh oh
I tried to skip over it I'm over it
Gelles even said when we were right and
getting our list of things that we were
going to talk about today Kelsey was
like make sure you write it down in case
I gloss over anything and the one
hey we're gonna talk about what it came
to kills oh man okay well I feel like I
just did a really heavy topic and now
like guys so much happen since my little
breath yeah do it people put my neck
when I do ah my boobs look it's insane
ah people with anxiety fun little fun
tip it's really important to breathe out
twice as long as you are breathing in
when people are having anxiety they
think they need to take these big deep
breaths but you actually need to breathe
out let's try to ask twice as long ready
ready okay it felt really good about
really good but I thought about how
people are gonna be listening to this in
their car going
like so many times especially if you're
like having trigger warning panic
attacks like you go like I need to get
breath I need to get breath and yeah air
but when in reality you need to be
producing anyways what I tried to gloss
over what's something that happened in
BA Kelowna Oh baby
ah so obviously if you guys are
following me on instagram you saw I was
there with fuck-buddy neighbor which
look when you're in a romantic city and
you hanging out with someone for a week
straight all day every day I'll just say
some feelings were exchanged over the
trip it was raining we had have a lot of
wine I think I'm dating my buddy I
don't know and there it is I would like
to direct everyone's attention a couple
episodes ago to what I said it might be
something more you just step up buddy
and lo and behold your pal Caitlin's
right Bye Birdie boo buddy dude I was
ready dude
it caught us both by surprise not me
bitch I saw that coming
listen you don't go to Salt Lake City
and then Barcelona with someone that you
don't have feelings for you know you
don't someone that you don't have
some level of feeling whether it be
sexual or like emotion utility okay
there's no we're not putting a label on
it because I I don't like labels are for
other people I was actually go back
listen to notch it but like we're just
we're telling each other how we honestly
feel my biggest reservation is that I a
I don't ever want to be hurt again the
way I was hurt last time that I got
involved with someone and B I don't love
his lifestyle and he's also has
up more than he's done right and he
you know I never want to change the one
I never want someone to not do something
because of me if you want to go
someone go them one you
know damn ones but some I like that
one life is - sure you can wake up one
day no idea but I like life is too short
to be in a relationship that you are not
a hundred percent happy in and like
there are gonna be ups and downs and I
just my whole thing is I don't want
anyone to change for me but like if you
like me enough that you don't want to
 other people then like great
 prove it actions are louder than
words you can talk talk talk talk talk
but you can't you gotta walk walk and
we're condom and not other
people that's a very good point so I
don't really know where we're at right
now we've had like a couple drunken
conversations about it I can't wait to
talk about your thing Oh spilled my milk
oh my god okay so here's the thing I
think this is universal nobody wants to
get her everybody wants a sure thing
right knee a little bit milk on you and
your buddy uh everyone wants a sure
thing so being like oh I don't want to
get hurt again
there's no okay this is from someone
who's literally never been in love
really believe it or not anyway who's
sex appeal baby I know that brought yo
these titties are hot today they are if
you guys could seem up there like -
baked potatoes so where was I I just
think that like risking anything is
really very scary it's so scary I just
think that everyone wants a shirt yeah a
sure thing but then that's not really
fun we keep saying like this is really
scary this is so unlike us like his
lifestyle is nothing like mine yeah I
like other but he likes my the
other people do it we are both having to
do something that we don't normally do
which is not other people it's also
it's weird too because it's it feels
like you guys aren't really ready to not
 other people no but you're also not
ready to lose each other but a boom
bottom mother Bank bitch why
yeah like it would really suck like yeah
it's become more than sex and that's
what's scary and I don't claim to be the
best at being vulnerable and like people
in and I mean you know I've played this
single life don't need no man
 and like the idea of not needing
someone but one thing someone is not
great yeah because you don't have full
control over how you're gonna feel I
baby and what control freak so yeah I
mean it's really difficult and I think
that it's probably one of the scariest
things because then you don't want to
feel stupid that's so weird
I feel like we should don't make me look
stupid okay I could fall who thinks I
but I feel like there's a weird my my
other big fears like let me say this
okay well I thought you forgot so I'll
show you the itis that wasn't me
interrupting kid but okay here it
is I think that we always think that to
to try and DeFeo means looking stupid
mmm but that's so small-minded and I do
it you know but you gotta try and you
guys shut up I know it ties into what am
i doing
like someone like a little less
admittedly but to try and I mean yeah it
sucks to fail but it's also like you get
to this moment where you're like oh okay
I'm still here I didn't die and that
goes to for like I think I also have
talked about all the mistakes he's made
and especially to like my friends and
they are now like wow you are a
full-blown idiot then they also know
that I'm like a very liberal like open
person that is not really into monogamy
and that this is something new and also
you have to also not give a what
people think some at one point it's
they're not the one laying down and
waking up in your body oh god but boy
does he wake up in my butt oh my god
your bed sleep sex obviously you out of
your goddamn gourd yeah sleep sex is the
best when you're sleeping at all of a
sudden you're having sex
consensually somebody is trying to skirt
around the issue ow wow that's what I do
dodging the voters I don't know you're
interrupting me oh I hate talking about
this this is my least favorite subject I
know but we have to talk about it we
have to be are they so their lips yeah
so okay no it doesn't matter what other
people think also nobody's
perfect all of like my not all of them
but a lot of my close friends who are in
these relationships these like long
lasting or like you know they're
probably gonna get married relationships
have gone through yeah it's you go
through because people are so weird
we're so weird and we're so up in
so many different ways and it's
literally just about you God finding
someone else oh my god I have so many
birds inside of me Oh verbs but it's
finding the one person who's like I
could deal with your and they could
do that you could deal with it and not
worry about outside judgment because
that yeah you just can't it and it does
out to be just one person like I we
still haven't talked about
the idea of it being like exclusive not
it like we're not putting a label on it
but we're also being like if we're gonna
 someone we're gonna do it together
how cool and I think the emotional
connection it means a lot more to him
than the sexual connection whereas for
me my thing was the sexual connection my
thing was like if you're gonna
other people wear a condom because not
wearing a condom with someone is the
most intimate thing you could do
with someone so like we had to kind of
match levels and I had to shut out
emotions with him completely ever since
he up the first time so like we
just had to find middle ground with what
mattered to both of us so now we know
what matters to both of us so like I'm
gonna respect that and not develop an
emotional connection with a guy and he's
gonna respect me by not having sex with
other girls does that mean yeah there's
just a lot we don't have to unpack any
more of it we should just move on your
 issue how do we segue into your
problem but it's not really a problem I
know I was really proud of you you
handled it really well why are you
putting on like 16 different lip glosses
I put on lip oil to moisturize and then
I put on my Fenty lip gloss it's really
pretty
me yeah I also like your highlight thank
you like the one UV yay chocolate
smelling one tired to face it start oh
it is tart yeah two faces the one that
smells like chocolate
no mrs. 100 chart smells like chocolate
mmm anyways um so what did you uh what
happened okay so I have this thing where
I get pretty serious crushes on people
who I don't necessarily know we've
talked about this we know it's a
universal truth you know it's for the
best of us so I thought this got like I
thought this guy was cool and then I met
him once and then I was like I freaked
you out when I freaked out like if I
have all and emotion because I would
stop my face he just bit of banana and
in my face we are having breakfast okay
you know this is gonna take a while you
know
here you sloshing oh god it's disgusting
tell your story you avoider
don't turn the tables on me I really
can't open until later oh Jesus all
right I was hungry
anywho so you fell in love with this guy
I bought it shut up okay so oh
my god that bananas disgust I'm dying
all right all right all right here we go
um I just thought it was like really
cool and I wanted to hang out with them
so I am very new to feelings like it
actually embracing my feelings and not
eating my feelings so or like drinking
them away or whatever so I enlisted
anyone who would listen literally the
entire office today you tell everyone
but I I basically just asked this person
out bitch what you just asked a
 person out okay Peterman
go home I mean just ask it you do it out
willy-nilly drop it into them DM really
step out the air in front of my face I
need I'm just so proud of you bitch like
13 weeks ago when we started this GD
podcast but I've never done so much crap
Oh true
so I asked him and to be fair we don't
know each other at all although he was
really nice he's like I'm not really
into dating right now but I'd begun to
hang out his friends or whatever so I
was like yeah sure to the UH you did not
just immediately go yeah sure
no first I cried yeah really down on
yours here's the thing because I asked
him and then when he said no I was just
like immediately I was like well if I
look like any of my hot friends he would
have said yes and that is so the Edie
talking right and so I just got really
ups and like all of my friends like
Garrett was like Kate this is literally
such low stake yeah like it you're okay
and I'm just like in my head like no I'm
 dad do you not understand that
I'm a heinous fat swamp could you spiral
about LOX
oh yeah so but luckily I had all my
friends there if I didn't talk to
everybody I well got into a full bitch
like I would have gotten all the snacks
what my way sharing your feelings
helping yourself yeah you know avoiding
dark paths voiding dark pants and then
how long did it last
he literally called me like the next
morning well we formulated a plan when
we went to go get drinks that night that
you were gonna write back something
because you do want to be friends with
him he is a cool dude yeah so you wrote
back that you wanted to you just said
what yeah let's do it I was like oh cool
good for you
yeah let's like I'd love to hang out his
friends yeah so I don't really know how
to hang out his friends and you don't
actually like know their person but
we're gonna awkwardly try it I guess you
called me the next morning and you're
like huh right I feel like that's what
better we were trying to say earlier is
that when so okay Allah I know a lot of
messages that we get are people like oh
this person is my friend I don't want to
like ruin anything with this friend or
whatever and I don't think that asking
someone out or being like I have
feelings for you is going to ruin
anything if anything it's just like oh
you like me that's really nice eight
water it sucks if they don't like you
back it truly does suck but they're like
I try to think about it there's like a
lot of times when you know I haven't
liked someone for no particular reason
it just isn't really there so yeah I
mean I just say like ask cuz then I will
like if I didn't ask I would have been
like daydreaming about it but that's
what I do that my track record I
daydreamed about a guy for literally
seven years right and like there are I
wish especially because our listeners
are a little younger go there like
formative years and and college and
stuff like there are gonna be so many of
these people that come in and out of
your life and the ones that the universe
once this they are gonna stay so you
might as well just ask the
person you might as well just do
what you want to do life is short
yep you just got in like really truly
like the next day really truly thank you
you called me and you're like you know
when someone doesn't like yeah if
someone passes on an opportunity to love
you and then you that's an opportunity
for you to sort of step up and love
yourself and like I'm gonna be the only
one to have my back so I might as well
be better at it true but I was born
like a pyramid I like typed out the
message and I was like shaking I was so
nervous cuz I just I've never asked
anyone out before so just sitting there
like oh god yeah oh my god and then I
thought to myself okay if I got really
sick like truly sick tomorrow and I
could not like if I didn't have the
ability to waste time you know then what
would I be mad about not doing oh so I
was just like it I don't know
what's gonna happen so I just I sent it
and it didn't go the way I wanted but it
just went away and now it's fine and the
more you do it I'm not gonna say like
the easier it gets cuz like being
rejected to a degree does suck but like
the act of asking someone out or or the
method in which you do it or the verbage
you use does become more fluent and it
gets kind of I feel a little bit better
being like oh this doesn't really have
to do with me and that's not that much
hair are you down to a point where you
can't build yourself back up again it
kind of nice I think it's like a nice
exercise in finding it then learning
that other people's opinions or their
you know decisions or whatever don't
define your word yeah or whatever you
want to present yeah which is nice it's
a little small stepping stone in the
mouth stepping stone life of coat I'd
see that movie it was like my book code
would be animated oh you know it um I'm
really proud of you though because I
just kept saying that that night and
obviously you didn't want to hear it
that night but the next day I think you
knew like wow you kind of got to see it
from where we were all seeing it yeah
and now telling everyone today when you
came to work updating everyone literally
I agree but it'd be way easier right
like just telling people like oh you
said no yeah moving on right and it's
not like a thing that's so catastrophic
that I had to tell everyone all the
detailed looks but yeah it didn't work
out yeah because there's gonna be
another one or you guys are gonna
on Thursday and fall in love and we're
good friends
okay I mean unless we hate each other
and then we won't be friends yeah and
making friends as adults is
weird man it's so weird I don't know how
to do it I have no idea what we're gonna
do I
you just go do something you both enjoy
doing okay well I've been really trying
to go rollerskating for a lot oh I'll go
rollerskating with you really yeah
I've roller skates would you want to go
on Thursday no why
it's the holiday party on Thursday I
thought oh here's what'll happen
oh I'll ask this personnel Wow Thursday
and if it were and if it goes if he says
yes then hurry got a date if he says no
then I'll go to the holiday party and
I'll still have fun but then it kind of
went into a gray area and so now you
have an even more backed up plan I'm
just not hanging out though cuz you're
going to the holiday party I'm
gonna hang out with him you're gonna
holiday party no you're not
if you guys listen to a few podcasts ago
you know that our holiday party got
postponed because the wildfires in
California we haven't talked about our
panties in a while I have an update
someone keeps commenting saying are you
still selling your panties and the
answer is no a guy offered 14 grand I
don't think it's real though cuz I I'm
like alright here's my venmo let me know
when you're ready and he hasn't
responded
I know whatever anyways our holiday
party got moved and it's coming up on
Thursday so we'll talk about that next
podcast but there's it's the biggest
event of the year and this is no way
you're gonna miss it kid it's not the
biggest event of the goddamn year I
don't want to go shuttle this Wow
what do you guys have against shuttles
you took good for shells you want a
 horse and carriage you want to
be carried up I don't know where's
encourage those versus don't live the
life they want to live they should be
able to roam free buy you would
really skip the holiday party to go on a
friendship hang out with a guy that you
truly only want to be friends with I
don't know I just can we not talk about
this no bitch you make me
talking about my thing you
topic I think your dude you can't miss
the holiday party you can't I might
we're gonna read this question why do
you read it I always read it okay that's
Mel Davidson 17 I recently read a story
entitled cat person in The New Yorker
and bad memories came flooding back of a
bad date this might be a trigger warning
of a bad date with a guy where a similar
thing happened to me I was wondering
what your take on guys who don't pick up
on cues or are very forceful in the
situation or on girls who put themselves
in a situation where sex isn't off the
table but then change their minds that
are either too embarrassed or too afraid
to say no or to stop it and they go
ahead with it it's something hard to
define but would you still classify it
as some sort of sexual violation or fit
in with the me to movement a lot of talk
is going on about some about the subject
because of an incident with Aziz Ansari
where a woman publicly shared her story
and experience thanks I love you and
Kate so this was a message sent to
Kelsey okay so obviously you know if
you've been on any sort of social media
you know that the media movement which
was started by tirana Berg back last
year well she heard it like hey yeah and
she finally was given like the proper
credit Asian and recognition for it late
last year after all the Harvey Weinstein
 happened and it's been sparking a
lot of conversation about consent and
rape culture essentially and I feel like
our age group are going to be the change
makers and how society views sex and
consent in a good way yeah I think we're
still fighting a lot of old traditional
yeah situation like you know what I mean
like I went to college opted out a lot
of them but I went to college I did the
whole you know back in high school
people got roofied and you know they it
was it was a common occurrence or you
know it was always blamed on the women
and we're not saying it doesn't happen
to men we're not saying that it's
obviously happening to a specific group
of people in this case women I totally
understand the gray area
I've been in situations even as a loud
sucking opinionated woman have been in
situations where I have done things that
I didn't want to do that I verbally
Express that I didn't want to happen and
it still happened I've also been in
situations Amy Schumer has a joke that I
always refer to when I think of things
like this where it's like every woman's
been asked out raped like they wake up
the next day like yeah I think that was
rape because they're just the the line
is so blurred yeah and especially right
now having a definitive line and knowing
what your boundaries are or learning
what your boundaries are hopefully not
the hard way is really important and I
hope you touch on it a little bit about
like the drag culture of like having to
be able to separate rape from sexual
harassment from sexual assault I mean
there's definitely a a harvey and then
there's a guy that is a creepy guy in
the water cooler line and that doesn't
make any of it okay
right yeah definitely doesn't Samantha
be had a great yeah about it where she
was like it doesn't need to be rape to
ruin your life exactly and I think that
I think that it doesn't need to yeah a
hundred percent it doesn't need to be
rape additionally it's not like this the
woman who like talked about the easiest
thing it's not like that was the first
time she's ever experienced something
like that it's and I think we're so
engrained myself included because like
full disclosure when I first read it I
was like oh she shouldn't have gone back
to his room that's what I thought
because I was like I would because
that's what I was taught like never
don't go back to their room if you don't
want to have sex you're putting yourself
in a really vulnerable position kind of
like if you were to walk out into the
and you see that someone has a stop sign
and you're like well they should stop
and then they you see that they're not
going to stop it you could walk and be
right by going walking into the
intersection be like I had the right
away as a as a pedestrian and they still
hit you yeah so it's like you know
having foresight like that but I am
unlearning so many things yeah that I
that's just how I was raised to you know
sort of believe and I don't think that
that's fair I don't think that that's
that's it's an it's an abuse of power
and the man in a situation has the power
they're stronger they're there's even
even like the shame involved I think
that that's what it sort of comes down
to is that women sort of ignore there
are like like older women like even
myself included like and I sort of blame
myself for for feeling for shameful
things like if I say no to something I
feel bad and like I don't want to hurt
your feelings and I think men need to to
understand and be taught that like teach
boys not to rape don't teach girls to
dress conservatively or to shame
themselves or but also know that like
see this is my main okay this is my like
huge problem with it is that I think it
starts from when you're a kid oh
absolutely because I I don't I think
that it's like what kind of monster
would you turn into if they were like
you're not allowed to cry yeah you're
not a lot cuz I think that there are
these emotions that if like boys aren't
we weren't the boys weren't raised yeah
to cry and they weren't raised to like
feel their emotions and how are you ever
gonna have empathy for another person
nothing that men aren't capable of
empathy but I definitely think society
says like don't like don't you're a
 they don't know what I
mean and I I just think that that the
more we we tell men they can be soft and
the more we encourage we tell women they
could be strong hey we just need to even
the playing field like that and I think
that it's really important to have these
conversations and I feel like if you're
uncomfortable in a situation that's
another thing it doesn't matter
look it doesn't matter what other people
think if you're uncomfortable it's not
up to everyone else who's not in that
situation to decide whether or not your
situation is right is a violation yeah
you know what I mean like if you're
uncomfortable you're uncomfortable and
if you're in a situation with someone
that you're if you're gonna wear the
meet to or like the times up that's what
I mean if you're gonna
time's up button or pan or whatever then
you should probably be a little bit more
in tune with how your how this other
person is feeling and and you know if
they say I don't want to do this or
whatever then you kind of have to deal
with it and don't just be like okay you
don't want to do it now let me show you
I'm a good guy and then I'll sit on the
couch again yeah so you could say that
you're an ally but until you really
listen to other and that really comes
down to that so leaving the oven I heard
I heard someone say as a joke before
like a the first no is a obligatory like
you know first no is obligatory yeah and
it's like if it's not a heart anything
but a yes is it now and not even not
like okay no that's it uh yeah and and I
think two part of the question was
something she was looking back on
something similar that had happened to
her and that is happening so much right
now I want you to know that you're not
alone in wondering about past situations
I think a lot of people are thinking
well I I haven't had it happen to me now
because you know society's changed a
little bit but also thinking about
things that happen like in high school
or in college to you and wondering is
does that was that what it was was that
a violation and what what do I do with
that you know I had a close friend who
called me after you know all this stuff
was happening and she said I realized
that I was sexually abused and it took
this conversation - the conversation
happening in America to realize that and
she didn't know what to do with the
information because she still knows her
abuser mm-hmm and she goes well should I
confront him should I you know does he
know do I want him to know and I think
that is also a really scary thing is if
you felt like you had something has
happened in your past is it you know
worth it to go dredge it up and confront
this person and cause a scene absolutely
have solutely it comes down to listening
and if it's not your job to make it a
teaching moment but I think if it can
become a moment where someone can become
more aware of their behavior yeah and
how wrong it was or how wrong
you were that's just also I think women
becoming too they don't want to hurt
other people's feelings right but I also
think that it's a I hate that people say
cuz I used to get told this all of the
time like Kate don't cause a scene just
let it go just let it go and I'm sorry
but that's just as bad as doing it it
really is because you can't just let it
go because also like this happened kind
of when I was home someone said
something racist and I confronted them
on it and we got in an argument we got
in like a pretty full-blown argument and
it was supposed to have been like a nice
meal together and I was like I'm not
gonna let this go and it I know that it
could have definitely looked like I
caused this scene but I didn't they said
the thing and you have to you have to
get to the root of the problem and
teaching men and boys specifically that
it starts with you like whatever male
listening we have like yeah your job is
to talk to your friends and stop
them from telling that one joke or
having that locker room talk yeah we're
talking about a woman and even if it's
joking yeah that's how it starts
yeah also don't want to be that girl
that's like talking the third
wave feminism and bringing people down
and and that was that is what we're
talking about it is so annoying
and it's an emotional labor if that's
not our job
it doesn't matter we're just in a time
and if we're going to reap the benefits
of a change then we have to be willing
to sacrifice things for that change so
that means saying stuff when you're
uncomfortable and that means being that
girl is but that girl that girl is
awesome but that girl is also yes
 my future too like we are on the
right side of history like it is what's
crazy if a guy says stuff or he's doing
something that's like super
disrespectful and you're the one to be
like hey man that's like not cool why
are the problem there yeah like I would
I would have so much more respect for a
dude who also stood up to one of their
friends to say something like like
because then if not you're just one of
those guys yeah it's just like
oh I don't want to close anything not
well and that's that's Joey I mean
thing and that's kind of like what I
think a lot of the conversation with the
Aziz article that came out to was is
that
yeah Aziz is an asshole for doing what
he did for sure he's not a rapist that
we know of but it the root of the
problem also stems from what men think
is acceptable as date behavior oh what's
expected from date behavior right and
with with women to theirs I feel like
any movement is only as strong as your
weakest part and I think that we have to
even challenge like our own selves and
being like because I I definitely had a
little some controversial like opinions
about yeah the thing at first but then I
started like listening to ya more
educated friends yeah and I was like oh
okay yeah this makes sense I had to
unlearn these things yeah and listen I
know that it's like a survival tactic to
be like if you're like a lamb and
there's a bunch of wolves and you're a
lamb you could pretend to be a wolf like
you could be the land that's like I'm
one of the wolves yeah so I'm gonna
treat linty so you know if I start
treating other Lambs like a wolf would
then I maybe they'll think it's like a
safety thing and we don't have to do
that we need to be like a little bit
more a little bit kinder with each other
and just because because that's
definitely I've been in situations where
I've felt comfortable enough and I think
it's also because of like not to bring
like to make it weird but like I've I'm
not petit I'm like I've always been like
athletic and strong so I've been not
saying that you have to be a certain
like body size to feel strong but I've
just always like in certain situations
I've been able to be like no yeah but
I've also really avoided any sort of
situation which we as I avoid a lot of
like potentially fun situation yeah and
just because if I were to be like I
would have said no I'm going home or I
wouldn't have gone to his room that
doesn't mean that that's it that doesn't
mean that just cuz you would it doesn't
mean as girl could or whatever so I
think that it's a lot of like I don't
know like still just believing the
person and having empathy for their
constitute like you know why would why
was she too scared to leave like what
was going through her head because fear
is crippled
and if you're that scared you might not
be able to lead that I've heard that so
many times that girls down to like
domestic abuse why people stay with in
toxic relationships yeah it's a small
form of it's a power dynamic and they
they really do like in movies and
television they sort of make assault and
and rape look very direct and apparent
so it's just like I'm raping you now or
I'm a salty violence yeah it's violent
and it's so if that's how we define
right like the the standard the line if
that's where we draw the line then it
then it's going to be confusing that's
not what it looks like all the time
that's very apparent but it's not what
it looks like just it's like these
little things that that like sort of
chip away at you and chip away at your
confidence and your security and then
before you know you're in this position
where you're like well just I don't want
to make a bet I don't want to ruin
things and that's like women don't owe
you we got to stop worrying about
kissing men off I mean I bought things
in stores because I was too late I just
felt too bad too ya know and then I
really had to go and return it or what
you know what I mean like sometimes you
just feel bulky free and that's not
everybody yeah and into like we know
that not everyone has the privilege to
be able to speak up and say something
but I would err on the side of if your
privilege allows you to why wouldn't you
right confront it and and feel better
and and maybe like I said it's not your
job to teach the one but like you could
also change lives you know like you
could also change it from happening to
someone else right but also protect
yourself yeah like there are situations
that could turn violent and could be
very scary and whatnot and you know I
don't know maybe like every woman should
have one of those life alert things like
is it down to that because it's sort of
like cuz I get it like even as a very
privileged white person I know that
there have been situations where I've
been far too scared to say something
because I'm like I'm in a room of all
men yeah how did I get here I'm
you know so and then I'm like oh I'm an
idiot
so I deserve anything
that I get out you know especially when
you add like drinking or drugs into the
mix it completely throws everything off
because nine times out of ten it's never
gonna go through in court if there's
alcohol involved and and in a sexual
assault it yeah it they will always it's
really easy though Sarah yeah and and I
think that comes down to like kind of
like the root of what we're saying too
is like you have to believe women yeah
you know yeah just it's a crazy idea
especially talking to men and our male
listeners we do it do like our first
thoughts sometimes even go on the side
of like well it's her faults or like she
did that to her so I in my head I was
like why did you go back to yeah well if
you're gonna you guys with it that's
what I have immediately for that and
it's to and it's terrible but like in
those moments and those snap judgments
we have to go back to the fundamental
truth of just believing women yeah and I
think that again just like with anything
else that we talk about here it's really
important to know that you might not
know everything and you might be wrong
about a lot of things and to listen to
cuz I was when I first heard that I was
wrong and I listened to other people and
I was like oh there is so I think that
for anyone who's listening who's still
like on the fence yeah there are so many
pink pieces and there are so many like
articles and whatnot in videos where
I'll be
yeah just dialogues where they're like
okay here's why and it's like oh right I
didn't even think of it like yeah when
you see something from an angle that
you've never had to experience before
yeah wonderful that's what like this is
about growing and learning and this day
you stop learning as the day you die and
I think this is a vital moment that
everyone can be changed by every single
person as a way of shift making this
shift happen and and I also know that
it's that I know that a lot of a
question that I'm hearing guys sort of
saying is like well then what do we do
how do we even talk to girls and it's
like one I completely empathize with
being like we I just talked for 20
minutes about how I ask someone else for
the very first time and I was beside
myself
I don't know what it's like to have to
ask
someone out and deaf did ya put myself
into the face of constantly being
rejected or be the one to like walk
other people home or like to just be
like you're not supposed to be scared or
you're in a traditional man so I don't
know what that's Leia I do think that
there that we could all benefit from
practicing better communication in
general and it looks it might feel
really weird and sound kind of in your
head kind of crazy to be like hey I feel
this way about you and I you know what I
mean and like I think that we just need
to start like acknowledging our feelings
and ears right out loud because man
wouldn't you rather do that and be
accused of something well you will you
thought was consensual and don't get me
wrong I know how much it's easy for a
you know a liberal in Los Angeles wait
for several in Los Angeles to be like
just talk about your feelings me listen
I'm from an area where that is saying we
don't write Jenna I wouldn't be like now
I'm feeling like this I just know it
would fall for certain people on deaf
ears right but mm-hmm
I mean if the conversation can't be
happen is that someone that you really
want to pursue and and gosh it's it's
off it comes down to just like don't you
want the world to be better right like
it is partly the hands job to
acknowledge the choice and like you're
saying bring up the conversation with
any growth with any it's like training
you don't you can't really train on your
own right like I mean I'm sure you could
get a song work even rocky had a coach
so like so if you're training it
sometimes you need the coach to yell and
like hey do it like your watcher watch
your knees or whatever I don't know I
thought you were through like quick one
just okay so it's so like yeah sometimes
we could we could all sort of be each
other's trainers in a way and just be
like like spot each other and just be
like oh you're slipping yeah that's not
what you say that's a privileged thing
that's a done that's a friend that's not
yeah I'm trying to call you out I feel
like we talked about rather than being
like oh you're idiot like let's
attack
men right now but like that's just we're
trying to help yeah that's just a friend
if a friend like hey man this is why
this isn't cool maybe you should listen
to them and I realized the first thing
to do is to be defensive because you
don't ever want to admit when you're
wrong but that's human but imagine if
like there's a little kid like learning
math right and they do like two plus two
is five imagine if the teacher was like
you're so stupid you're an idiot
you didn't know that's like the kids
fine and a lot of us are like really new
to thinking about other people and
having empathy so I think that though it
sucks and we're tired less there's a lot
of times when I hear a guy say something
and I just want to go off yeah because
I'm tired easier to just ignore it but
that you're also depriving like the rest
of the world of someone who could who
might be able to change something or
grow or learn or something like that so
I definitely think that all these
conversations are so important yes it
comes down to listening challenging your
own beliefs mm-hmm being open to being
wrong and being a conversation starter
be be that girl and I think being that
girl is dope and or that guy
 guy especially it's so important
yeah it's red eyes to be that guy what a
great question thank you for asking yeah
one more thing I feel like we need to
acknowledge the fact that there are
times when as a as a white woman if your
dialogue only includes you you're on
you're on the wrong side of the right
movement mmm so it's gotta be all we got
it we got to protect trans trans trans
lives yeah you have to you know protect
people of color and it's it's all
inclusive so I just feel like we need to
remember that absolutely that was I'm
glad we talked about that yeah and I
think but let us know what your guys's
opinions on this are if there is
something we didn't cover we'd love to
hear more about this like we said like
we're gonna be the movers and shakers of
this movement a lot of sensitive stuff
