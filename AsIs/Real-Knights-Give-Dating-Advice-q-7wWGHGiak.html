hello I am Santiago the warrior priests
i am don temple of lyon
I am del mal of Valiente
I caught a lady with respect and with
patience a knight always has respect
doesn't rush anything and really lives
by the code of chivalry how the court
lady is first I would meet their mother
or their father and ask if I take their
princess out
an ideal first date for a night would be
a humongous meal maybe in a meadow or by
a pond it might involve some type of
tournament perhaps a chicken feast where
other nights might be fighting and there
would be jousting and horseback riding
shivery is dying but not dead it's up to
the individual night and the night of
today to bring a revival and shivery and
treat women with the respect they
deserve
do not force dating and really do not
rush it just let it happen don't go out
looking for anything because you might
just pick something that you shouldn't
have picked always to be respect your
princess no matter what treat her like
you would treat your queen treat your
princess as you would want to be treated
silver is not dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
