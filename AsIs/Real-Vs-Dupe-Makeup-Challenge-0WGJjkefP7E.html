face is the cheaper one makeup and
makeup makeup it's a wonderful thing
it's fun you make in the face look less
dead in the morning one thing I don't
love about makeup is that it's expensive
a F so I naturally turn to the internet
to see if there's any dupes for some of
my favorite everyday products of course
there are so I picked five cult
favorites in the realm of things that I
use every day so I you know know how to
put it on vaguely one side of my face
I'm gonna do with the expensive makeup
it's gonna be a hundred and fifty three
dollars worth of products before tax cuz
like I don't know where you live from
what your tax situation is and then the
other half is gonna be drugstore dupes
that in total is $55 my test today is
not how it feels going on what the
packaging is because that's a personal
preference if you want to feel luxurious
with your like cool ass packaging in the
morning that's awesome that's up to you
but what I want to test today is if the
product itself is indistinguishable from
the expensive product let's do this is
it fancy if I just do it on one side I
got makeup on personally speaking I
don't think that there's a difference
between the two sides I think like my
lips take my blush and my eyebrow pencil
or like slightly different colors but I
don't think that the quality of the look
is actually that different but it's not
up to me to decide I'm gonna get out of
here and see if people can tell the
difference and at the end of all that
we're gonna check back in and see how
well the two sides held up let's do it
look at my face Jade did half of my face
with expensive products and half my face
with their jewels which side is
expensive and which one is the do the
right side is more expensive my right
side are your right side
why this looks like there's more makeup
on that side I can see a little
difference but I don't know which one
would be more expensive I like I would
have to say the opposite side left I
mean your right my left can you tell
from my looking at me which one's
expensive and which one is not no I
couldn't I tell I could not tell which
one looks more expensive much the same
especially my lips if you did both sides
separately it's literally like looks
exactly the same
no your lips on the side so I'm
wondering if that is a dupe side is
expensive why do you say that because
it's still on and it's not leaking off
mascara on your right eye is kind of
doing though like black smudge
underneath the waterline thing someone
ress hmm I don't know I'm I actually am
stumped on this your blush over here is
a little bit more defined one side of
your face is better than the other and
you were correct about this being
sensitive and this being less expensive
your eyebrows and mascara and everything
it looks normal
I think it looks even we go out and buy
the l'oreal lash paradise this side of
my face the makeup costs fifty five
dollars in total this side is a hundred
and thirty three dollars so almost three
times the amount Wow you're gonna have
to give me a list of dupes because it
looks and I wish you could see this in
real life it looks the same I don't
think it's worth it at all to pay three
times the price of cheap makeup because
it's still accomplishes the same job
basically look good on both sides so it
doesn't make any difference drugstore
mascara is so much better than high-end
yeh dupes what I've concluded is that a
lot of people can't tell the difference
between dupe makeup and expensive makeup
think honestly a lot of what you're
paying for with more expensive makeup is
shade choice and you are also paying for
maybe longevity of some of these
products but not all of them my advice
is to pick the thing that you want to
spend money on splurge on that and then
go and find your dukes
cushy tushy this is a tutor she do you
think why I saw would be mad that I
called this tushy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
