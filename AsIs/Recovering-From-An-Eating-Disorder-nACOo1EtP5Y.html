all of the bad
group can be turned in
that's why I want to make this video and
tell you my story
I remember having negative body image
for as long as I've had memories when I
was around 3 years old I clearly recall
my father picking up another little girl
and saying that he couldn't pick me up
anymore because I was too heavy I
learned what a calorie was at age 5 I
grew up watching my mother diet and
exercise obsessively which led me to
stop eating breakfast and start only
drinking weight loss shakes at age 9
when I was about 10 years old I started
to feel self-conscious about my weight
by 11
I was restricting my eating severely
although I didn't really know what I was
doing I didn't yet know that I was
developing an eating disorder I made the
connection between eating less and
losing weight around the time I turned
13 and by my freshman year of high
school I started exercising counting
calories purging and restricting to the
point of hospitalization now I'm 17 and
I said the last three years of my life
in and out of hospitals and recovery
centers because that kept commencing
everyone else around me that I was well
enough to be home even when I was really
just learning more tricks to avoid
getting caught I lied to the people I
loved most and became someone completely
unrecognizable I sacrificed my strongest
morals to protect something that was
only hurting me and taking everything
from me
in doing so I've missed out on so much
of my own life I don't know who I am
without my eating disorder the one thing
I know is what keeps me fighting I want
to be here I want to be able to accept
the help support and love that surrounds
me every single day I am motivated to
finally make the changes I know I need
to make to discover who I really am when
people ask me what I want to be when I
grow up I tell them that I want to be
happy my goal is to make this year the
year I turn my life around
I want to look back on this year and
feel proud of myself my name is Harriet
and I have hope I hope that people who
don't know what it's like to have an
eating disorder will have compassion for
those who are struggling I hope that
people who do have eating disorders will
feel like they have a voice and that
they will feel less guilty alone and
hopeless if my story resonates with even
one single person I will feel like my
entire journey has been worthwhile
having an eating disorder may not be a
choice but you can choose to beat this I
can beat this you are strong enough I am
strong enough you are beautiful enough
and I am beautiful enough you are enough
my name is Harriet and I am enough
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
