kid and you're out with your parents at
like the grocery store or something and
you see your teacher and you're like oh
you exist in a totally different place
it's like well I took the subway today
oh okay
the parking garage is one floor below
so when I Drive I parked in the garage
but today I didn't drive so
that's why you weren't in the elevator
yes okay shuts off history's together
is that an actual planner mm-hmm
I rarely see those anymore
well I remember things better if I write
them down so that's why I like my phone
it'll calm smart for nothing that is not
my joke my dad told me that joke
important that you know that's not mine
well I guess we've solved the case of
the stolen joke then huh Yeah right
and that's my joke can't even blame my
dad for that one uh this is me you
should write that down
so that you don't forget it that was a
good joke right yeah it was great
so this isn't the elevator guy elevator
guy no I don't even know that guy's name

I look like I belong at a wine bar art
gallery thingy with a necklace yes right
so what time is he picking you up uh
we're meeting there oh stop it
not every girl needs to be picked up for
a date he likes art he sounds smart
I really need this one to be good okay
so could you just have a little faith

I'm sure he'll be charming nothing like
the last five I warned you about five
I'm counting the water polo player from
psych 201 oh yeah hi for what are the
odds six in a row have fun

to order some wine yes but this
gentleman was your first that's actually
an art installation oh don't be
embarrassed people have been doing it
all evening what can I get for you a
glass of the road the cab I just ran out
but the pinot gris is much better
anyways
l-3 they're asking just for a $5
donation it's to provide art programs
for foster children oh yeah of course
that jar is actually another art
installation okay perfect
enjoy
I'm very excited for this one had not
seen it yet but I've heard good things
oh boy I guess tower of shoes would be
appropriate
this is haunting what does he do isn't
this amazing um what is it raw emotion
Oh hmm should have gotten the red bar
superior
well they were out in the Mesa that this
one was actually better I actually took
wine-tasting in college so I'm in
corporate real estate I'm responsible
for a few floors and some pretty tall
building my mom's in real estate
ooh I'm not an agent I get paid more
right now I'm at 65 K when I get
promoted it'll be 70 oh that's a lot for
someone my age it's a lot trust me yeah
sure how much do you make I don't really
feel like that's a first date kind of
call you said you're in catering okay so
it can't be more than 40k you know the
only reason I'm there is to actually
learn a little bit about the business
I'm gonna open up my own food truck it's
gonna be painted like the countryside
and there's gonna be a window sill out
the back we trucks actually almost can't
even pay for their own gas well it's not
gonna be easy but it's my dream so what
do you think of this one
I actually like this one Mason I love ya
wha what a fabulous party I know I see
you got some wine
hi I'm Emma yarn you're like two too
long for or like yarn with a you like
yarn yarn is the best arts events
planner in NoHo oh dude you're a planner
I recently just met somebody who still
uses an actual planner like a book
planner not like a person planner
did you see good boy Oh simply
incredible the glaze actual soudanese
dog your Oh Mason I'm so glad that our
journeys have crossed again thank you
your first time to the city yearns
terrific I actually just spent two weeks
in London with her ever been
transformative Oh I stayed in two chums
flat I mean apartment oh I'm back in the
colonies Mason there's actually in
London Oh summer oh you should have
stayed with a local oh it stayed with my
dad dude the reason seriously though how
much do you make 35 right hmm mm not
enough to afford any of this stuff here
is it 30
you gotta invest if I can give you one
piece of advice you've gotta ain't that
you know I'm having fun girls seem to
like doing something like this more than
just going out to eat or whatever you go
on a lot of these
is the best one yet good save
now who let me get more wine that lady
gave me this crazy bitchy look it's a
donation that means option are you
serious right wait hello hello thank you
for the wine it was very good this is
for that guy I'm really sorry about what
are you doing they don't actually need
the money foster kids in this country
actually have it pretty good
okay hold on how much do you make you
for it full person actually I'm a patron
of the artistic community you're a rich
bad guy and because of your money or
whatever you're probably never gonna
address that about yourself actually ah
Wow
also whoever painted this I really
really like this this is awesome okay
is it me all these awful dates there's
only one thing in common
everyone's terrible I hope that's not
true you would have hated this guy he
kept going on and on and on about stuff
he knew nothing about a man's planer I
don't know why it's so hard for men to
listen to women right and that's it
ready just listening just a guy who
listens I think I get to want that I can
have that
yet
Felix hold on a second I got to write it
down and okay okay all right okay Liam
wants to have dinner tomorrow 7:00 yeah
