hip
in the early 1970s he and his friends
rode their bikes over 3,000 miles from
New Jersey to the Golden Gate Bridge
then they hop trains on the way home
this was the bag he brought in it he
carried a flashlight a thermos a compass
and a map they camped the whole way and
brought their food with them bread
herring and peanut butter lots and lots
of peanut butter he still has the boots
he made the trip in except now he uses
them as a makeshift pot for growing
flowers in his garden
he kept journals through the whole trip
and wrote a memoir of it so that my
brother and sister and I can read all
about what he did this is my father he's
a sailor and an adventurer and taught me
all about boating my dad is from the
coastal town of Veracruz Mexico every
year there's a famous storm called Gordo
naso the San Francisco one year my dad
was out sailing right before the storm
hit he was on the sailboat which
capsized from the heavy winds the storm
was too heavy for him to flip the boat
back over he spent all night floating in
the ocean in this great storm hoping
that the fish brushing up against his
legs were not sharks he wasn't able to
return to shore until 6:00 a.m. the next
morning this was before I was born
and my parents were broken up at the
time my mother was so worried that she
was waiting on the beach for him all
night long when he returned they got
back together
this is my dad when he was younger he
was in a band call at the mondo electric
psychedelic groove band when I was
growing up my dad was always singing and
dancing around the house and playing his
instrument at the time I didn't
understand it and I thought it was
pretty nerdy and embarrassing but when I
went away to college I gravitated
towards exploring music hey and I even
started my own band wasn't that great
and my band mates weren't either
actually we broke up after a few months
when I came home on break I found out
that my dad's band had actually been
really popular in Japan and it even
gotten a gold record there we began to
bond over music and he taught me a
couple of cool chords that's when I
really started to feel you know thankful
for my dad now I appreciate all the time
we have together yeah my dad is pretty
much the coolest guy I know my father's
bravery is the reason I was born it was
such a huge risk but he was totally
fearless I want to live like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
