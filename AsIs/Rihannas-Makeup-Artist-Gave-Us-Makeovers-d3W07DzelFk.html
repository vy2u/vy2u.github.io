hi I'm Daniella anything that you think
Rihanna would like I'm open to because
she can make anything look beautiful
start with glowy skin I love it hey
Hector I'm pitch free so excited for you
to beat my face off NT we about to do it
but I really want to bring focus on your
lips let's do it
hi Hector I'm essence so today what
we're gonna be doing on this beautiful
gorgeous model here it's focus on her
beautiful almond-shaped eyes so stay
tuned okay so the first thing I'm gonna
do I'm gonna start prepping with Fenton
ET pro filter primer so we're gonna
start from the center of the face where
cannot word play in the primer with the
foundation brush if you have dry skin
a good tip would be to blend the primer
with the foundation so two pumps of
primer and two pumps of foundation you
know start off with pro filter
foundation English it is number 150 Pro
filter foundation and 374 30 in the
perimeters and then for 20 in the center
you wanna make sure you shake come on if
you have dry skin because it's a semi
matte you might want to prep the skin
excessively more what more sure eyes on
your usual did these brushes touch
Rihanna would it be weird if I say that
I don't have those questions yes once
you apply your foundation your concealer
you want to set the parameters on the
face this one are the foundation to last
longer and will prevent from you looking
to or any tour today every day my favors
change
so today's favors gonna be lightning
doesn't fire crystal we apply like more
like a lightening effect so we're gonna
go underneath the eyes and work our way
back and forth what I'm going to use
here is a shimmer magic and cinnamon
entire lid
just diffusing into the crease you like
to do more of a swirling motion when I
apply this look because again I'm gonna
finesse more dream look so I'm going to
use a blending brush and create tons of
depth because it's slanted
you flip the lipstick this is great for
lipliner and precision so let's use the
tip to saturate that lip line because
the lip focus is a lip gloss and it's so
intense you really want to make sure
that the center is very very mad because
we're focusing so much on the eyes you
really want to make sure that that Allah
is nice and highlighted and what you can
do for extra coverage is literally swipe
the color directly into the sponge face
I feel like a lot of translucent powders
say they're translucent but when it's
time to apply they're not about that
life
especially on darker skin tone so is
this really gonna be translucent first
of all it was not translucent when I
apply it cuz I am not about to have you
looking ashy to this product was really
one of Rihanna's main focuses she
carried this product for over two years
and all the red carpets or any time she
got photographed because she really
wanted to ensure that it was translucent
I'm gonna show you the easiest way to do
a winged liner so you're gonna start
from the lower lash line is your
guidance the reason why is because that
lash line is the only one that goes up
if you follow your natural from the top
sometimes it looks a little bit droopy
and that's me just go down there you
know I'm just gonna really follow that
same shape that we did in just
exaggerate the one and only the trophy
wife and I am gonna pop it show us at
the tear duct I don't even have a mirror
but I know it's happen we just want to
bury sheer application of this just
think of the lips like a nice fleshy
color I don't want to take away again
from the eyes as it has to focus oh my
god I look like a little like a Moscow
Mule Cup right but like in the best way
possible
fancy blue is all about having fun
fingers brushes whatever makes you happy
whatever I see feel the best and the
sexiest go for it
I love it I feel like this is the most
my style because it's very like a little
edgy sexy
yes bronzy this is very I am obsessed
with this look and the reason why is
because you still don't like yourself
but you have that nice edgy like you
said funky look that really ties into
you okay I'll feel you here pop of color
is never wrong I really want you to
maintain the focus on the eyes cause
that's the focus okay I like honey I'm
loving it
oh my gosh like I look rich is so much
love Rihanna's makeup artist hexer just
lay the hell out of our faces I'm still
processing the fact that his actual
fingers touched my face because they
also touch Rihanna's face I love being
able to walk into Sephora and just feel
as though there's somebody there who
really thought what is Patrice gonna
want to rock when she wants to do a no
makeup makeup look I'm just really proud
of RiRi you know as a young black woman
to another one like she did that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
