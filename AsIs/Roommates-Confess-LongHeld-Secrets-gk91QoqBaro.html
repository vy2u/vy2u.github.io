nervous
we have been roommates for going on here
we've been friends for about three years
but roommates for three months as
roommates we are interesting I think
well managed the beauty of living with a
male roommate and being gay we there's a
lot of like common ground NAR Leah
always leaves the light on she can be
dead sleep the light is on the light is
always on you do have a lot of naked
lady posters on your wall they're not
naked and I got them just for you hello
yeah there was one time where you
allowed me to borrow your clutch when I
went to borrow your clutch I also
borrowed the green letterman jacket I
totally lost that jacket while you left
to go visit Phoenix that one weekend me
and Jenny just talked to Matt about
that orchid that we used to have on the
table you've been seeing me look all
over the place for that jacket thing is
I look - I called back at the house
parties we honestly wanted to go in like
like plant it and the dumpster something
and see if it would grow more crappy a
fake orchids oh my god okay so my
boyfriend gave me that jacket in high
school it was a bad relationship but
still you know it kept me warm I'm
anemic you guys suck I love that orchid
doesn't get any sunlight where it's at
on the table it's fake the one time you
let me drive your car girl don't know
I'm a car you love to sit on on the
couch in the living room the couch that
you sit on if you look closely you will
see that there is a big stain on it
unfortunately I kind of scraped the back
of the car I went to CVS and got some
silver paint a little silver marker
sharpie and I kind of colored in the
line that is so ghetto
that is so wretchedly you would never
know when I was dating a girl
once in the college we got intimate on
the couch she was asked order and she
squirted all over the couch but see you
know you didn't have to pay a deductible
you don't have to file a claim your best
friend took care that with the with the
start at the Sharpie you can only see it
if you look really really really close
like when I'm laying on the couch and
maybe grabbing my face in it yeah you
just can't have access to my closet
anymore which I trust that part this is
not driven a wedge I'm not afraid to go
home after work today we can easily go
out and grab a beer roomies for that we
can communicate now well you know
ignorance is bliss right
it's here it's here
what get it do it there I got it
get it yeah you get it
it's here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
