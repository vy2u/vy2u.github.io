it survives what the week oh I was a
weekend uh it was good what do you 420
hahaha listen to fish and I ordered more
CBD oil but you aren't high no but I
found out that you actually don't need a
weed card in California to just go and
get some weed some um about do that am i
right on yes you still have to use cash
though right well I feel like that would
be an efficient no one carries cash
anymore they all used to be cash only
what why I think was before was I wonder
I'll go check tonight maybe because so
many people were trying to put weed on
their credit cards that weren't like
credit cards Oh like like you know if
they were over there it was to protect
the customers or always protect the
store hmm something like that I don't
know so you're taking up smoking smoking
yeah I'm not drinking for a while Oh was
that I wondered yeah I actually talked
to a couple people about it and you
really shouldn't mix alcohol and Prozac
imagine that you know what those it
looks like I feel like that's not your
fault though because we're taught like
oh you shouldn't drink when you take an
advil or like you shouldn't drink when
you're on antibiotics but you have other
doctors are like yeah but one or two
won't hurt you right but I think you for
sure that's why like I was still
drinking anyway but then you know taking
a little inventory I've gotten into a
fight almost every time I've gotten
drunk and it goes from being like I used
to be able to put them away I watched
that I used to be able to like truly
just drink and be like I'm fine
yeah I would just get a little bit drunk
but overall I would be fine I would
never blackout but now it goes from
being like a little tipsy to full-blown
blackout and so in them that's
medication to yeah so I'm just not gonna
do
and I don't like Who I am when I'm drunk
like that so I'm just gonna I smoked a
little weed this weekend and that was
nice
what do you think the difference between
like this time I feel like I always do
that thing where I go like I'm gonna do
30 days like I'm just gonna do a cleanse
and then I always find a reason to drink
like what do you what are your tips to
like I don't know staying strong is it
just take day by day I guess I mean I
normally when I would say I'm not gonna
drink it was usually too like there it
was more like surface level stuff like
oh I'm gonna save a bunch of calories by
not drinking or oh I'm gonna see if I
could do this or whatever and those
things I don't care about so much as I
just don't like who I turn into when I
drink it's all so crazy like I thought
peer pressure was just something that
happened in high school I don't know it
wasn't until like but then because then
the word peer pressure makes it sound
like it's mean like you're a
loser if you don't do this where as an
adult it's like oh come on don't make me
drink alone
yeah it's that gazelle sale of some
people even saying anything look if
you're going on like a meeting or
something that everyone's here yeah it's
one of those things I mean I think
it's always good to give your body a
break from any kind of substance yeah
you know I did that with
the birth control not sure for 12 years
and I know that that's not good for your
body to be on for that long yeah take a
break
guess what you know if you can if you
can't yeah I mean like your goodness I
know that like I could it's not like I'm
being rigid or having a certain amount
of days or whatever I'm just I am taking
it I would drink to hide like I drink or
even eat or whatever like to hide behind
things and as it turns out I just have
to be I don't want to keep doing that
cuz eventually I'm gonna wake up and I'm
gonna be 60 and I'm gonna be
like why did I hide yeah I think it
takes a lot to cuz you know you've
noticed patterns before but it takes a
lot to go beyond the reasons you've used
before mm-hmm you know like oh well I
just I didn't want us right
they were like yeah this time it feels
different
mm-hmm that's good yeah buddy thanks
buddy Bobby yeah thanks what are you
gonna do when you feel like drinking
move read a book I only ask because I
read a book once that was like we uh no
instead do five instead x' whenever
you're trying to quit something it's not
like that for me right now
it's not like I'm like oh man I have to
quit and it's true it's like oh I'm
identifying that this thing is it is I
don't enjoy it
mm-hmm so it's just it's sort of like
what are you gonna do when you want a
slice of veal it's like I don't want the
veal you know what I mean like very
specific I I was gonna say mushrooms but
that would get confusing because of
drugs cuz I really want to try mushrooms
Oh real bad man I don't I so badly want
you I think there's something to we know
a lot of people that microdose it's the
same thing as like people taking THC to
mean to treat different sort of
invisible illnesses and there is a way
of like micro dosing helping there's
studies being done science being done
right now that's helping it the one of
the four fronts of it helping things
like bipolar disorder or PTSD yeah
anxiety and it's something where you
don't actually feel the effects of the
who's and genic yeah I mean I really
like CBD oil right now I didn't think I
like my you know order so I ordered some
for me I'll cry myself good Charlotte's
Web mm-hmm ordered some Charlotte's Web
and then I also ordered cuz I've been
listening to Pete Holmes's podcast which
I told you guys about he also talks
about alpha brain which is like an
all-natural plant extract that isn't
like a cup of coffee but it just helps
you focus and you've been taking them
for like years and it's one of his pick
everyone heard of that I mean I'm sure
that he like is sponsored by it but uh
but I know that it's one of like his
actual pick kind of like how we have our
picks of them
he doesn't in the beginning but I he
made it sound so good so I went to I
went and got it you did everything yeah
I ordered it so I'm probably gonna be
here like this week I did this thing
that it's gonna be for an Instagram
post but it's this thing where you take
a quiz online and it goes deep it goes
into your like issues as a person yeah
and then it forms all natural vitamin
packs for you better like specific to
you so I just started them yesterday
it's like I said obviously like I drink
a lot and I have like anxiety and I have
memory issues just because of like all
the nerve medications I'm gonna owe my
life but it specifies and it does like
specific pill like it's not pills it's
vitamins but yeah are you so I'm
interested to see if I start pooping
better mmm-hmm yeah interesting
Rob's uh probs I feel like I've been
pooping shreds this weekend well we also
did a lot of drinking last week and I
feel like it takes its time again I know
I know
I'm sure I were last weekend but it's a
great shirt well it's garrix last day so
we did Hawaiian themed no I am Fran so I
feel like this is prettier like sexy
Zara Hawaiian encounter well this is
Asus I did not get ready at all this
morning you went to the gynecologist
yeah I mean I guess we can get into it
it's our sort of topic for the day we're
gonna also answer a fan question later
but I have talked a lot about my vagina
here you guys know about all the issues
I was having with birth control and I
was deciding to kind of get back into
taking some some form of it and I wanted
it to be non hormonal and then I was
having a lot of weird go down and
I'm not talking about like yeast
infection UTI I was feeling like pain
 bleeding for no reason and not
like spotting bleeding like I would have
to sit on the toilet and just let myself
bleed out and for five minutes until it
kind of stopped and I was like I kept
telling myself it was just coming off
the bridge control coming off the birth
control and finally I think I got a
 gynecologist
I'm so bloated and the lady was like oh
you need to go get a ultrasound right
away so I went this morning and the
ultrasound tech was like I'm really not
supposed to tell you anything we
definitely have fibroids and there's
some cysts on ovaries and
this aren't really anything to worry
about because like a lot of women
actually have at least one sis that's
kind of like a trademark of having a
cervix a noise and it's just a matter of
like if it becomes problematic but the
fibroids are something that are a little
more alarming to be that way they used
to call it or that's why Trump was
trying to call it a pre-existing
condition yes being a woman was a pretty
 a I mean like me honestly maybe
like you who knows what then this help
expert is whispering in his ear all day
somebody would who's a good hood I saw
 once and yeah I saw it and it was
who that bitch was the guy giving her
yeah I wouldn't be surprised but we
would tell we talk a lot about it at
BuzzFeed within the women's group that
we have here a lot of women actually do
have five words and I completely fine
and live completely normal with it and
then another alarming statistic is
seventy percent of black women will have
fibroids in their lifetime so they were
giving me all these updates about like
how alarmingly common it is but it only
gets bad it it gets big and it can get
like cancerous I guess or it can just be
like hella painful and and turn
into polycystic okay it get turned into
all a bunch of that anyways so I wasn't
a bad news this morning just because
it's like sometimes I just feel like why
me a break like it's like
finally I'm starting to feel good about
the jaw pain or like finally my anxiety
feels good and this is like another
 thing and then I feel like well
I shouldn't complaints I have it so much
better than so many people I'm like I
don't know I've talked about before but
like if fibroids were a man's issue they
say it would have been solved eons ago
so it's just it's it's good that's
happening because it's opening my eyes
also to something that a lot of women
deal with and and making me realize like
how lucky I am that I find you know even
have health insurance that I find it
early that I'm taking care of my body
does it guys suck like now every
time I have sex I'm bleeding profusely
like a stab wound
damn it really brings a new meaning to
the word accident so I figured today we
could maybe talk a little about just
about the gynecologist what's that mean
how it goes what to expect what not to
expect maybe some stories about times I
mean I'll tell a story about the time
I've been I don't know if you've had
anything exciting happen ever exciting
uh you I didn't go for the first time
last year yeah yeah I'm actually due to
go again
I kept it okay yeah I started going to
the gynecologist when I was fifteen
the guy I was a bad doctor by the way
ob/gyn someone that deals with all
things vaginal or boobs
I think female hormones I don't know
what the dictionary.com version says it
is but first time I went it was because
I secretly was having sex and I hadn't
told my mom yet and I wanted to get on
birth control but then my mom was like
I'm gonna take you to the gyno I was
like oh okay she'll take me but
maybe she won't go in the room with me
so then my mom went in the room with me
and I was like and I was just
scared because I also didn't know what
was gonna happen like what she had it go
inside of you is she gonna just talk to
me
and so when when I was filling out the
questionnaire it asks do you want to be
tested for STDs and I put an X in
between the yes and no boxes I saw the
gyno came over and goes what's this she
hides it from my mom and I was like well
and I like kind of pointed and the guy
knows shoot beautiful sweet doctor guy
know you know you are she literally like
right mom out and my mom was like what
she's like get up you don't need to be
here for this and I was like oh my god
and and I was like well I'm nervous
because I'm having sex I'm not telling
her parents and she was like well you
don't need stone it's none of their
business unless you know you want break
control and then you know you can get it
from clamp and get for me but the Duff
she gave me her personal cell number and
I was like okay but now what are we
gonna tell my mom this conversation was
about she goes well I'll just tell her
you saw an ingrown hair or something and
freaked out and wanted to get it checked
out and I was like what an amazing yeah
seasoned gynecologist like she
saw that I was scared she walked me
through it she told me all of my options
she told me I didn't need my parents
permission to be doing any of this stuff
and when you're on someone's health
insurance you feel like obligated in a
weird way because they're gonna be
getting the bills or whatever yeah
there's so many resources that she told
me were available and I don't know I
just thought that was such a
good place to start with like my
relationship to someone that goes inside
of me that isn't a sexual partner that
was good of you to go to the
gynecologist I didn't know what else to
I avoided the gynecologist for years
what's that boy boy I mean eh I wasn't
sexually active B I've never really
liked I did yeah I don't know I just
didn't need
I mean I'm mmm I should have gone you
know like as an adult woman you gotta go
but I just didn't I was too like I don't
know if I was he's scared to go if I was
just to like oh I don't have a vagina
and that's gonna ignore this completely
yeah just because any sort of like me
that's that was just across the board
though any sort of need any sort of like
anything I would just ignore do you do
that with like I don't know like doctor
checkups or like dentist appointments
you just kind of feel like it'll happen
whatever I'm fine I'm fine yeah I think
they say once you start menstruating or
like you guys are having a period that
you should that's like when you should
start yeah going because then that's
when you should also start getting like
your pap smears regularly and your
breast exams and so yeah so some things
to expect when going to the gyno
boy-oh-boy
go early go at least 20 minutes before
your appointment because baby you're
gonna be filling out some paperwork even
the place that I've been going to for
like ten years every time I went I had
to fill out some new form of
some new law had gone into effect
there's some new pills an option it's
like oh really yeah every time I got or
like my insurance had changed and it was
like just go early oh I remember people
would be like it's gonna hurt like when
they do a pap smear I'll get gonna hurt
and they're like it's like I just
remember people telling me they were
like it was gonna hurt and then they
passed out or something
I like this and she's up there fiddling
around and
oh boy she's done and she's like okay
we're all good and I was like no I
needed a pap smear she goes baby that's
what it just was oh my god so you didn't
even feel it
mm-hmm see oh man I felt pap smears
where they going and they put what's
called a speculum a speculum I don't
know what the it's called it
basically looks like uh like gardening
shears but they're rounded and soft it's
kind of like a stalks like fresh daily
sure it's so tired
it's like salad dogs yeah it just opens
the puss white up and then they take a
little tiny brush and they can belt that
scrape the inside okay it sounds about
any scrape it but that's what they do
they collect the cells from the side and
they just test everything to make sure
all your cells look normal yeah so you
can if you're gonna get a wellness exam
which is what that's considered then
you're usually gonna you should expect
someone to be going inside of your body
and then also doing a breast exam
because that's also just really
important to do even if you don't do it
at the gyno you should do it yourself so
that's definitely something you should
also break and you should also expect to
get like your height and weight and
measurements done because it is also
kind of like a regular doctor's office
like baby I say like set up a table they
also check like oh my god I remember
going to one doctor it was so
annoying truly awful I was I like went
in and I she comes in and I'm like hey
do you mind if I don't get weighed like
I'm currently in the middle of eating
disorder therapy treatment do you mind
if I just don't look at the scale and
she said I mean this is Beverly Hills
and no one wants to look at this scale
oh my god please off also going to
the guy who Beverly Hills that wasn't a
guy no that was just a retired doctor
oh yeah man and you think being a woman
she would have been a little more
sensitive yeah so then I told her that I
was only Prozac and all that sort of
stuff and then she was like she told me
later when it had passed it had it had
passed like the conversation was over
and she goes she's like well you know a
little certain body types clear out of
nowhere didn't ask she was with certain
body type she'll never be super you know
supermodel thin that's
for me what if she even talking
about she's super so she was super
skinny what was she even talking about
letting me know that my body type isn't
supposed to be super skinny what issue
doctor like a doctor hey yeah yeah then
nothing liberal ass Beverly
Hills yeah they're weird oh man I had a
weird one once let's hear it okay what
I'm not saying you shouldn't go to mail
battle column I'm sorry not so much I'm
just doing writing fun bar salads huh
that's a thing right amazing you never
saw that video that went viral where the
girls like right in front of my salad
these two guys are having sex right in
front of her she's eating a salad
no for myself I'll show you that later
that's really funny I'm sure there are
plenty of male gynecologist my personal
belief is I think you should have some I
just would prefer a woman
yeah that's ideally Regina yeah I
remember going to we went to like a we
went to fyf and they that's a music
festival
yeah Music Festival in Los Angeles and
they went and they had a line for guys
and a line for girls to get like
pat-down mm-hmm and I was like can I
just get cuz the line for girls will
still long or and I was like oh
I'm just gonna stand in the line for
guys because I don't care and like I
know that it's it's a lawsuit you guys
are trying to yeah whatever but then I
was like well what do you do with if
someone's like non-binary you're just
you literally have to be in one of these
two lines
anyway so literally like what they're
dealing with with just even being able
to go pee it's crazy but that uh why did
I say that what were you just talking
about male gynecologist
oh yeah that's dealer dealer's choice
yeah I guess I think I'd rather just
have someone that has experienced those
things and I'm not saying like I would
only go yeah okay I'm sorry I would only
go to a female therapist yeah oh I wish
I could I can't find one that I
but like I I'm not saying I would only
go to a heart surgeon who's had heart
problems but I I feel in this instance
when it when it comes to something
that's like specific to also like your
vagina a tree yeah yeah like so things
spreads it open like it's good every ass
so this wasn't sorry I was gonna tell
you is that I went to my see my first
male gynecologist that I had just moved
out to LA and when the nurse was in the
room I was like oh I'm on my period so I
have a tampon and should I take it out
and she said no oh I guess she thought
maybe like we'll figure out what we're
doing first before I make you like go to
the bathroom like let's figure out if
we're just giving you an exam or what no
so the doctor comes in and he and I'm
worried you're like early 20s oh I'm not
comfortable enough yet with my like
stance on doctors to feel like I could
give them any authoritative returning
voice but he was like all right scoot
down and just take off your bottoms and
he stayed in the room which I thought
was weird and then I got in a little
like stirrups cape
he took my tampon out for me it was
though we I can still feel it happening
it was the worst feeling I have never
had anyone but myself take out something
from my vagina
except that man and I remember his name
was the only time I ever went to him
because I was so bumped by that
and I just never had like grabbing it
and then he held it by like the tail and
carried it across the ruling it was like
a mouse and then like dropped in the
trashcan and I just remember being like
are you kidding me
I just felt so weirded out by that even
though he's a vagina doctor I
just felt so uncomfortable with that
because it was something I never had
happened before and maybe some people
are okay with that but I just said well
it's weird too because I the vaginas are
such an interesting thing the way that
we like talked about it look at it treat
it all of that sort of stuff is very
interesting for him it's just work yeah
it's just like oh this is a mm-hmm it's
bleeding right now you put this in there
more simply and so you know you do what
you have to do for it but for girls like
yes you're ready like I'm the only
person that does that ritualistic act
yeah you don't know of course that I'm
older I'd like change tampons in front
of friends or like boyfriends or
whatever and I haven't but in such a lie
it says oh you're lying a weird feeling
because also it's just like it's not you
reacting yeah and I wouldn't even look
like actually a trigger warning getting
you guys a minute
trigger warning uh anyone who has any
sort of like assault or more you know
sexual misconduct hidden there in their
past that has been done to them there's
like a really weird feeling where you're
like oh I reacted yeah I reacted you
because it reacts and yeah I got the one
being like I like this yeah like kind of
like you don't like being this is
probably not a great metaphor but let's
see if you don't like being tickled
you're still laughing right yeah they're
like and you're like flinching you're
react right you don't like what's hit
what's happening to you I mean it's like
people have written into our emails
before being like hey I was sexually
assaulted
and I came and it's like that's not
that's not an incorrect thing that's
your body's physical response this man
way it's literally a reflex yeah the
same way that like I was just so bumped
by that because it just felt like an
intimate thing not that I'm like exactly
and your body's gonna react the body is
a crazy thing the brain is a
crazy thing and the first thing I'm will
always try to do is protect yourself
yeah so even if it's like that can go
down to just even why we have like
anxiety about going to doctors is
because you feel even though these
people are there to help you it's still
some it feels like an invasion of your
body it's like totally fine for doctors
and medical professionals to look at as
you know medicine and as their work or
whatever but I didn't go to medical
school
no I'm not there yet that is not just a
that's not just an open wound or I know
I'm gonna piss people off by saying that
we just said it sarcastically we got
that you know anyway yeah it's beautiful
flower oh yeah
it can be if you have a bad guy no
experience it could be
traumatizing you go back to a
gynecologist so like you know depending
on your age if you have resources to
look into you know there's different
apps like ZocDoc
or even Yelp where you can go and look
at reviews on doctors I know that they
have like specific doctor reviews but
like do your research research if you
can if you're lucky enough to have the
coverage to choose your doctor find
someone that you think you would feel
comfortable with and read and ask your
friends do they have someone that they
like they have someone that they don't
why I god what is this and the other
thing that they're gonna do is they're
going to put their fingers up in you and
feel your ovaries which is always a
weird feeling because they go up and
like to the left and right which is not
something that normally it's just such a
shitty experience but you should know
you should know what to expect
just the whole time I'm like cuz dothey
is there it acquittal I know that guys
have to get like a colonoscopy at one
point if they hold the balls to hold the
balls and cuff yeah I guess it's the
same just and when anyone is just
checking your junk but this feels way
more evasive I don't want to say
that but I well it does because you're
getting scraped then you're having
instruments inserted inside of you and
I'm just talking individually multiple
times a year yeah I'm just talking about
in terms of like someone being close to
something that's also very like in a lot
of ways reserved for something personal
and emotional mmm well you don't like
just ovaries are meant to drop eggs and
tucking whatever else they do but it
doesn't feel good when someone's putting
their little phalanges up there so
you're not so uncomfortable yeah I
 ate it it would like quick and
easy but I was just the whole time I was
lying there at
point was I like I'm totally comfortable
yeah I mean my electorate so they put
that like I can't and I think it's like
a butthole where you put you mining them
putting your face eat you out of the guy
god no I'd sarin didn't like it because
I don't like the idea of being like oh
god okay think about anything besides
yeah no breathing exercise yours now
essentially active and then someone's
down there your whole body's like
finally I have to really do so I think
I'm not kidding when I say like
breathing exercise it's like the same
thing I do on a plane when I get nervous
I do the same thing in the or like I
count the tiles on the ceiling or I just
I try to relax is the more tense you are
the harder it's gonna be for them to a
put anything in their be get samples I
tell you about the person I got waxed
that I hit her
oh yeah you did well you hit your waxer
cuz that was your body's an action yeah
hey it happens and you know I bet you
that's not the first or last time she's
gonna get slapped I just feel like I
don't know how you hate the guy
at college but you gotta go yeah the
other thing they usually have you do
with pee in a cup I love that because
they ever have to pee so bad I know if
you're not sexually active I've to pee
right now and I could fill up I can fill
up a trough baby you don't say
you're gonna fill up a trough with your
pee but I kid I can't stop visualizing
now just like a wooden wet like but you
tried you trough that like did sloshes
around yeah because he's washing yeah
no you can just dump it out whatever
it's good fertilizer so they're gonna
make you pee in a cup for a couple
reasons to make sure you're not pregnant
even if you're not sexually active they
want to test your urine levels just for
 UTIs yeast infections well I
think they test
your vag anyways they're gonna test your
pee kids very tired ah sorry that the
other thing is is you shouldn't feel
pain you should see but you should
expect to feel discomfort it shouldn't
feel like nothing you know I think
people go in being like it's it's gonna
be fine but like you should feel like
yeah I should expect that it's gonna be
expect that it's gonna be a little
uncomfortable both emotionally and
physically he doesn't have to be it's
okay no you know however you respond to
stuff but yeah like I'm used to it by
now
yeah but even when that like you know
today it's like a little alarming it was
scary so my body was a little tense and
it felt a little uncomfortable but
normally I'm just like hey girl yeah go
ahead get in there I would also just
like to say then knowing these tips of
being like basically being like oh this
is what I felt to know this is what I
felt this is my experience you could go
into a gynecologist and the not every
doctor is great now every doctor is like
very respectful or whatever not saying
that there that most of them aren't I'm
just saying that not no you know no
one's perfect and you're allowed to like
basically what happened when he took
yeah the you know what I mean like you
are fully able and capable and in your
right to say this makes me uncomfortable
and if they shush you or if they say
it's fine like that's kind you you are
working as a free agent at that point
and you could just get up and go and go
to someone else
and you don't have to be there even
though it's wildly uncomfortable because
that's literally their job and if you're
uncomfortable then then I Taliban at
their job yeah you gotta tell them you
got to be like I don't like this I don't
like that and if they're like I know
it's part of the you know if they're
like it's part of the process I'll give
you a second yeah yeah if it's like very
nice regarding your feelings like I know
you know like if they're disregarding or
just look it's fine it's whatever honest
like yeah you know when it feels like
someone's been kinda sending yeah um the
other thing I wrote down is even a when
you find someone you do like don't lie
to them don't mind that they're heard
where
they've heard worse and also like you're
not gonna shock them if you tell them
like you're bleeding because you stuck
something abnormal up there for sexual
pleasure you know what I mean did you
ever hear the rumor I feel like every
elementary school or middle school had
the rumor of one of the terrible it's
terrible you might have to cut it below
to say of like one of the gym teachers
getting a hot dog stuck up her vagina in
the ER no I feel like just because kids
are terrible and whatever but they were
hated your gym teacher it sounds like I
just think everyone back home is
homophobic hmm and anything that is like
borderline or not traditional build like
me oh this is the same thing is saying
that someone gotta like a gerbil stuck
up their butt
what wait you're gonna tell me from the
hot dog thing but you never heard the
gerbil thing no the the one the version
of your story that Florida told was hard
I forgot I guess the gym teacher put a
gerbil up his butt to make it run around
and make it feel good man see when you
said the gym teacher with the hot dog I
immediately thought female hot dog in
her vagina
yeah Oh what is that homophobic because
they were saying like basis I don't know
they were just say it was about them
being gay oh yeah well that's just yeah
first of all a hot dog would have no
problem going in a vagina it's a lot
thinner than a penis but they break easy
but it's not like it's gonna get lost up
in you you've never had to bear down and
 fish something out of your cooch
no I didn't mean that as like you well
then you haven't lived because it's not
great sometimes I wonder if I still have
a condom in me sometimes I wonder if I
have like a tampon in me from like years
ago and I'm just not getting TSS that
one I feel turns out it's just fiber
iconic damn I should go too
yeah man cuz it's good to just get it
 shut it's better to just do it
it's like going to the goddamn dentist
it's because it's gonna be so much more
worse with if you wait down the line and
something has gone wrong and then you
got to do all this and like gyno
gynecology finally it's you died alive
it's usually
by insurance so like they really have no
reason not to go if you have a vagina
even if you don't like if you're you
know dealing with anything female you
sure yesterday in your body hormones
anything but if you do what I mean I
don't want to exclude people who don't
have health insurance what's something
they could play man yeah Planned
Parenthood and if you can't get a friend
to drive you out of state to go there
are options just whatever you do do not
go to like a seedy place I've heard of
horror stories another podcast even just
about women that like didn't have access
to feminine health care and hey plan
here I know that plan parent is already
like struggling with money and whatever
but I wonder if there's some sort of
program someone could start that where
they yeah what you're gonna say what
that helps people get to places with it
yeah I'm up they do do it's like there
we go
I forget what it's called so if you
don't have if you don't feel comfortable
asking a friend or whatever look online
their figure and how to get I see if
that someone could maybe come pick you
up or they'll I you like to an abortion
doctor because if you're in a state that
like you can't or like your age or
religion or family whatever they have
people that will come and help you yeah
I wish I near the name I heard it on
another podcast balls I'm just
forgetting everything which is why I'm
taking those vitamins that are he's got
me remember some stuff anyways I'm gonna
be fine
you should go to the gyno yay
this guy's all up if it was a
dude who I couldn't get a boner yeah
that's what viagra sells more than like
any and no one cares and it's
just fine but if a woman doesn't want to
get pregnant or or wants to get
her cervix checked
oh yeah the the ultra so many people
think that that Planned Parenthood is
just to kill baby no it's it's a small
it's actually a very small percentage
that is for but a lot can go wrong down
it's mostly for sexual health so like
birth control or STD testing or a very
small portion actually abortion but
people listening to this know that yeah
it's more like share that fact with your
 you know who's the ultrasound
technicians were kind of like walking
shop this is kind of funny because like
they're not supposed to tell you things
because they don't want you to freak out
like they're allowed to die to ask you
but they're not allowed to give like
definitive diagnosis and I was like ah
cuz she wasn't making any noises they're
going like mmm or anything she just had
like a poker face and I was like
so uh she looking clean or what it's
because oh no and I was like oh she goes
yeah you definitely have a cyst right
here on the opening of your cervix and I
was like okay but is that it and she's
like and a fibroid definitely at the top
of your uterus and I was like oh but a
pretty small one she was no it's quite
large
hey wait oh okay uh I mean like I'd even
get rid of it so that's the thing is
sometimes what they what they said what
it could have been was because I was on
my birth control for so long yeah I feel
hormones were actually helping keep this
stuff at bay and so once I came off it
was kind of like a garden it just
started to gross it and the hormones
were the thing that was keeping the
garden like swelled up dang which is
something I haven't in my mom my mom had
that happen to her and they told
her she wasn't gonna be a lot of kids
that she should just have a hysterectomy
it was like a landmine in there
so it also there's a little bit
hereditary so I kind of knew that's the
other thing going in is when they I
first started going to the gynecologist
that my mom went to because it is also
important to share your family history
so things like breast cancer ovarian
cancer six five breaks PCOS whatever
mm-hmm it's good to not lie here kinda
and tell them about these things so that
you can also go because it is really
important especially if you have that
breast cancer gene to be going like
every six months get your boobs squeezed
also there are plenty of people who are
I mean yes that is important if you have
your family history yeah don't fine like
I'll figure it out yes they figure it
out and it's totally fine it might just
be kind of like a it's like a key
they're like okay you have the key great
if not we can figure I mean that
positive or you know that you can test
me for the genetic oh don't worry if you
don't have access to that and your
ovaries make noise
yeah they make like
Wow sounds like they're just swimming
because she like click the button and
all of suddenly you could hear on the
speaker now exactly dummy
yeah cuz it's your uh because that's
what happens in an ultrasound yeah
that's what I had I had a hell of a
cultures on and I had like an
interventional time oh my and so that's
the thing is they were like it would be
alarming as if we we opened this and it
we heard a heartbeat because then you're
having a topic pregnancy which is when
the uterus or the embryo gets stuck in
your ovaries or uterus and you have to
immediately go to the hospital if -
immediately sometimes women lose their
ovaries it's very like alarming so she's
like that's every ultrasound text worst
nightmare is if you do that and then you
hear that because then it's not a matter
of like breaking the news to her about
like having you know any type of
pregnancy it's like we need to get her
to a hospital stat and I was like well
we're good there right it she's like
okay it's fine I was like okay holy
Jesus now I see why they don't tell you
things anyways go to the gyno if you can
please go what's your question
the subject spline is sex traps more
like that fuzz hahahaha seriously please
help hilarious
hey ladies like every person I
love the podcast I can't thank you guys
enough why blablablabla ah thanks unto
me being horny so I've been with my
girlfriend for four years since we were
17 and pretty much everything is
incredible except when we have a weight
except we have incredibly varying sex
drives she could and has gone months
without having without anything sexual
and never initiate sex I've ride up
multiple times over the years and for a
few days afterwards she tries to mean
more into it but like always it fizzles
out my ego gets damaged when she turns
me down as well as leading to me feeling
like because she never initiate and
makes me think she doesn't want to have
sex with me but because I'm gross or not
good etc etc I would never force her to
do anything but doing anything more than
communicating about it seems rapey yeah
okay when she does feel in the mood she
goes first because she never initiates
it has multiple orgasms but when it gets
to me it always seems like an
afterthought after that kind of like a
pillow a princess
but I feel like a pillow president want
to get and sex just seems like a
thing that just happens to her I love
her with all my heart but I want to have
more than vanilla sex once every two
months I'd love to hear your thoughts
okay and they're not Paulie so that
isn't an option
mm-hmm my and I'm gonna just tell you
what my initial instinct is I don't
think that's fair to you I think if
you're you're saying you're
communicating cuz a lot of times people
were over write in and say I don't know
how to talk to them about this and I'm
like well you just talk to us about us
and there's like strangers so it seems
like you're communicating and she's not
reciprocating and you haven't mentioned
anything about her with like past sexual
history or sexual trauma so to me it
just seems what the way it's written
that you're getting ignored and I don't
think that's very fair yeah yeah also if
you've been together for four years
since you were 17 a lot of people won't
break up when you start dating someone
so young mmm because it
becomes habit and like you those are
very you know formidable years and like
huge years really so for years there is
that it actually feels like much much
longer and you know sometimes you just
get in a habit you don't know how to
break up with someone but if you're not
getting the sex that you want and you've
brought it up and you're just not
getting what you need in the
relationship it might be time to you
know move on and to it's it's okay that
to have a different sex drive than your
partner I mean I would argue that like
if that is most people because you'd
it's just that's science you know some
stress and environmental conditions can
make someone now what I've bought some
times and that's totally fine you don't
have to have the same thing but if
you're talking about it there is
different ways to sexually please you
you know and if she doesn't want to do
any of those things again I think like
Kate saying it might just be something
we're like now it's been habit for
something years but there are other ways
like it doesn't just have to be sex it
could be like like masturbating in front
of each other or like watching porn
together or like you know I hate to say
the word like spicy look through six
like but you use the word vanilla so
fine let's see you spicing up your sex
life so I don't know if you guys have
tried that introducing other methods of
orgasm meaning interior but it sounds
like into she this is a lesbian couple
so again like you guys know that
penetration does not equal sex in most
cases so I think that there is a way
that you can introduce other things but
I also don't want her to feel like it's
her job to have to carry this yeah man I
just think that you know you're young
and you know that you and if you have a
twenty one I think uh I think that if
you have these needs in these ones I
think for years you've invested a lot of
time and energy of love into this
relationship so for sure try stuff is
fun
if this is your person you know and if
you want more than just vanilla sex once
every two months it cuz I I also
understand you know her side of being
like I don't I'm not comfortable with it
or she doesn't really like it that much
or you know whatever but it shouldn't
make you feel bad or rapey or as you say
like your egos getting damaged he's like
saying right be that well I mean that's
what you said it's just I but like
that's a good feeling like yeah when
you're doing something to your partner
that even though you're in a
relationship for four years if they feel
like they don't want it then that makes
you feel bad I would just hate for you
to walk away from there like to develop
a a problem from this and being like you
know starting to be scared of asking for
what you want starting to doubt your own
sex drive starting to you know think
that you're undesirable these are all
really big things then that if the if
this was I don't know if this is
problematic or not to say I'm gonna say
it and if it is I'm sorry but I feel
like if this was if you if you were
talking to me about a guy I my first
like reaction would be like oh it kind
of sounds like he might be cheating on
you oh yeah you know what I mean and I
don't know this thing that's all I'm
saying is what I would say to a
heterosexual mm-hmm relationship our
know if it carries over I genuinely
don't know but basically regardless of
you know whatever type you know whatever
your sex what sexual orientation is I
think that if you're not getting what
you need to be happy and fulfilled then
the relationship is lacking and you
could also be like asexual and not know
it or like it there there could be
something where like she just doesn't
like having sex which is fine but if
you're going to be in a relationship
with her it I don't think it should have
to be her job to like figure out why her
partner doesn't like sex yeah I feel
like regardless of I think that's also
kind of a dangerous slope to go down
like you have to take care of you mm-hmm
and you have to make sure that you're
you're good and let her take care of
herself because if you start thinking
well she's uncomfortable with this so
you know I'm just gonna be patient about
that for a while it's like who's looking
out for you
yeah who's making sure cuz making sure
you come you know and you can only do
yourself like so much like there is an
intimacy like with another person in
another body it's like oh gosh you know
I so I get what did we sort of answer
the advice or answer the question I
guess like I think there also isn't
enough explanation on why she doesn't
want to do it besides it just seems like
she's it's a rut it seems like a four
year kind of like routine thing that
maybe so I don't know if maybe my advice
is to if you feel emotionally available
to dive deeper into why she's not
feeling it then then maybe but I could
understand - it's the same thing when
you confront someone about their
drinking they'll go like well I don't
have a problem with drinking but it is a
it's like if you can find someone about
something really like personal and
intimate like this they might get
defensive so my advice is split I say
try and help her figure out why maybe
she is you know adverse to sex with you
specifically or if it's something that's
a greater larger I don't want to say
issue because it's not an issue just a
greater larger situation yeah man I
would just bring it up ask what's going
on and just be honest with both her and
yourself about what you need and what
you want to be happy because you're just
because you've been doing something for
a long time have been in something for a
long time doesn't mean that you have to
stay there boom oh yeah so like you know
there's always you want cuz you could
just be like well we've been together
for so long well you know we'll figure
it out and keep repeating the same
pattern of talking about it and then it
gets better for a couple days and then
it goes a couple another couple months
and whatever and then before you know it
you're like seven years in and you're
like oh no now what and you live
together lives it's just those cobwebs
come on
just bring it up cool I hope that helped
thank you so much writing in we love you
too do you want to do our things of the
week I don't I still don't know what we
call this segment I don't think we don't
book sweet books this week
yes your mine is a fun fiction by Daniel
handler called the basic eight and I
read it in like a week and it's a quite
a thick book but it was it was that oh I
ran in a week and it was like pretty
thick no I'm like that's how good it was
that it would like write a thick icc you
know what I'm saying
it's like Gossip Girl Meets a true-crime
and I know true crime is so hot right
now and I live and love and
would die for Gossip Girl so if you
match those two things you get the basic
eight by Daniel handler which is crazy
because the main character is a female
and he is a male so I thought what an
interesting way to write a female
character hmm I liked it
what's yours mine is a book it is
everything is horrible and wonderful
it's by Stephanie oh shoot with her you
know her maiden name is whittles what's
I think is her last name or watch anyway
it's this this comic Harris whittles who
passed away from an overdose a couple
years ago who used to he was a writer
for Parks and Rec and he's found and
down the Sarah Silverman program all of
this very funny guy very funny guy
master of none yeah and he was just
incredibly for anybody had a drug
problem and it's from his sisters
perspective like before and after and
and everything leading up to his
overdose and it's I've lost friends to
overdoses and whatnot and it was it's
just tragic and it really does paint the
picture from all sides both of it being
like you getting mad at them and and
then feeling bad and not wanting to
enable and not knowing what to do and
not feeling real all of that sort of
stuff
Oh along with what it's like to really
grieve
and it's just a really beautiful book
and you were reading it on the plane and
Kate would literally be laughing out
loud one second and then like I don't
like oh my god you're going on like a
roller coaster is a phenomenal book you
should get it it's it makes me just I
watched it like all of his episodes of
parks and Parks and Rec all the ones I

mostly acts of exterminate or the animal
control I watched all of his episodes -
