things I cannot change the courage to
change the things I can and the wisdom
to know the difference
what you can catch the whole thing on my
snap story I peace Oh Justin please put
away your phone your friends have
something they'd like to say to you oh
hey guys what's up you're on snapchat
right now do something weird it's okay
you're in a safe place Justin that was
weird
who is this guy I'm a snapchat therapist
and this is a snapchat intervention we
asked him to help us
I don't snap chat problem you guys rude
am i right I think if you listen to your
friends you'll find out you do please
have a seat
Alan why don't you begin Justin I feel
like I don't even know who you are
anymore whenever we hang out it's like
you're not even there just snapping the
whole time like when you snap the whole
Big Sean concert we went to an hour half
story that's it's way too long
I feel like stepdad to take it away but
best Fred you know that's left is just
the white ghost
come on my followers appreciate those
stories it's not about your followers
Justin it's about you and how your
problem affects those around you sorry
who invited this guy again I am a
certified snapchat therapist okay right
Kate why don't you begin I feel your
snapchatting has become a problem it's
hurting me mainly hurting my phone
battery you sent me 400 snaps a day 150
snaps today of your Reuben sandwich
what's good sandwich yeah I've also
noticed that through excessive snapping
you've literally pressed your thumbprint
away oh my god yeah
all right I never realized your
addiction is damaging you both inside
and out
you always talk like that yes it's part
the training let's really make my blood
boil just listen
sing why don't you go it almost feels
like you're showing off all of the time
I don't need to see how much you
pre-party before you go out and party I
don't care that you go to the same
parties John Stamos goes to I don't care
how much alcohol you can drink you drink
a lot of alcohol by the way I don't I
think I might have a drinking problem
you guys now Justin Justin don't change
the subject we're talking about your
problem which is snapchat addiction we
love you
put it if you don't stop snapchatting we
are gonna have to unfriend you
I can go clean I can start by putting my
phone away right now
all right that is gone that is a great
first step
okay we're proud of you Justin being
very strong so strong that I'm gonna
snapchat it so that we could remember it
yeah you guys get it successful
intervention hey you're doing the right
thing buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
