grilled cheese also just in my personal
life I've never cooked you know like

grilled cheese the other day it was

outside of it before you put it in the
pan just a little fun trick you guys

Oh baby and then that was like growing
up for me speaking of wild house the
panty sales go oh I'm so glad you
brought that up so we announced last
week on the podcast that we were gonna
try and sell her underwear online for
money because why the not I really
truly why the not and I immediately
got an offer from someone on Instagram
because we didn't know how to really
prove
this and everything about this story
makes me so mad I didn't get a single
offer and this bitch is about to walk
away with so ok under dollar was it no
so it started at 400 i sweet-talked this
one guy up to 650 all he wanted was like
a couple pictures of me wearing it and
so I told him like I was like yeah
absolutely like you're in the running I
don't really know how long we're gonna
like do this for but I figured filled a
few offers so that what I didn't realize
though was when I got a message from
that guy was that he when you are on
Instagram you have like your regular
inbox and then inbox from people you
don't follow and so he was in the inbox
that I never get to really read and I
scroll up he had offered to buy
my panties last year and I never saw the
 message so here I am just
sitting on a goldmine literally who knew
my was worth sucking $650 last
year that's 2016 it's only gotten
better I've been talking with that guy
and obviously he's in the running right
anyways we go out here in Boca and I
meet this guy I tell him about the
podcast I tell him what I do I tell him
about the fanny pack
yeah he offers a grand for the panty
what the so he's like if no one can
beat that yeah I don't give a I'll
throw in a grand I don't give a and
I was like I was about to take off my
goddamn underwear right there and then
in the bar I was eating so I didn't you

$1,000 offers I have to add them up well
someone did message it takes two years
to make a profit should investment is
how I see it someone didn't message me

which because we plug
it every goddamn week but he said
mankind he said I'm poor but I would
give my life for Kate's panties no I

twits or something where we can talk to
you I'm starting to read all of my
messages now so but I did want to also
give an update I just got this Instagram
message from our fan that we read her
question last week about the two dudes
did she like it did she like we answered
this girl's question last week about she
went on a date with two guys and one of
the guys sent on a date and she felt
really bad yeah I'll read you what she
wrote to me she said I think I felt
filled because I was always in a
monogamous relationship and now this is
the first time I'm actually single in my
adult life nailed that oh my god oh
I'm figuring out what I like and
enjoying seeing different people at the
same time I'm hanging out with both of
them now and I was honest about not
being exclusive with either so I love
this girl now I'm just thinking I don't
have to be in a relationship to have
frequent sex and I don't have to feel
guilty for having multiple partners I
think I'm getting out of my head this
whole host status fear that I had
growing up cuz I learned you should
always be with one person I am a
feminist but always learning how to
deconstruct the sexist values thanks so
much you guys are me wait could we get
her on the podcast we should she's in
Germany right so it might be we should
just go there I want to go to Scotland
put it on the universe baby why Scotland

spit on his face when we were having sex

I'll read it really fast okay and then
just get good tell me your thoughts
mm-hmm okay you won't miss them loudly
you will miss them in the details you'll
miss them in the quiet you will miss
them in the empty moments the still
space that fills your day when you can't
convince yourself to stop diving into
your brain this is how you will miss
them you will miss them jealously your
skin will sink when you see they have
moved on instead of being happy for them
despite trying you will grip your
memories like clenched fists you will
blame them for moving on too quickly you
will judge the person they choose this
does not make you bitter or crazy this
makes you human and in your humaneness
you will breathe through empty lungs
when you see their new flame wearing the
same sweater you always reach for when
you are cold you will create hurricanes
within your chest when you wonder if
they have laughed like you explored him
like you loved passionately like you you
will never know this is why you will
miss them mattingly madding mad whatever
you will not miss them holy you will
miss them in the highlights you will
fail to remember all the mismatched
parts that led you to the decision to
move forward that led you to realize
that your heart was better off in softer
hands you will miss the morning spent
curled up in the arms forgetting that
you never truly felt like you were home
you will miss the springs in the summers
of their love but you will fail to
remember the frost that often came
between you the cold chill of their fall
the desolate and unbearable distance of
their winter above all else please
promise yourself that you will miss them
with every inch of your bleeding heart
but
not miss out on life because of it it is
important for you to live through the
growing pains for experiences will
slowly pour into your knowledge and your
soul will grow wiser you will see how
you have painted over ashy memories with
shades of rose and blush you will
remember the winters and how you hated
the cold you will sweat old love out
like scarlet fever and this this is how
you will miss them no more well that was
worth it good that was really oh my god
it just oh it makes me so emotional
I'd what's that from it was from
obviously it's someone who writes poems
for a living and they posted it on
Thought Catalog get it so I have to
figure out I might have even written it
down oh if anybody knows who did that
wait hold on I wrote it down you have it
at Rainbow salt wrote that dang that's
beautiful it was so nice and I think
that that can apply to to like any kind
of loss dude doesn't that make you feel
something I was doing well they upped my
prozac dosage and I was doing pretty
good how is prozac going going well
I like it yeah do you want to you want
to be brought down even more with our
fan question yes okay great this is a
fan question that I got from Instagram
and then I couldn't find the
handle because like I said there's one
inbox for your people that you fall on
one that you could so I couldn't forget
yeah but this is what this is what the
question was a guy might be better off
it's a pretty sensitive question it is a
yeah you're right yeah so a boyfriend
had written in saying hi me and my
girlfriend listen your podcast we love
it I wanted to write in from a guy's
point of view and ask you something
please don't mention my name because she
also sings for the podcast
oh there we go basically so good thing
you didn't find his name okay basically
he asked he's in a relationship with
this girl who has been sexually
assaulted in her past I don't know how
long ago I don't know by who but he just
found this out about her and she told
him she's fine she doesn't really need
to talk about it and she just wanted him
to know but now he feels incredibly
confused on how to feel about that
knowing that this girl that he's in a
relationship with I'm assuming I don't
know how long they've been dating but
that he cares about that this terrible
thing had happened to her and he doesn't
know what to do with that information so
he basically asked what does he do
because he feels terrible even though
she said to not bring it up so we
thought that was a really interesting
question just because yeah it's it's
it's something I never it's a point of
view I've never considered before
there's so much to that question it
feels like there's like one boundaries
if she says she doesn't want to talk
about it and she says she's fine with it
then you kind of have to just believe
her and trust her and she knows what
she's able to talk about other side of
it though is that if it's something
that's like really bothering you and
making you look at her differently and
you don't want to do that you don't want
to look at her as like wounded or broken
or anything like that that it might be
something you guys have to talk about
right
further unpacking that without with
running the risk of sounding judgmental
and I hope this isn't but also I know
it's like a really terrible thing that
happens to someone but if she's pushing
through and she's living with it then
you you might have to as well
and there's like there's kind of like a
weird stigma about like when women have
been hurt and like guys feel like I
should have been there to protect you
it's like chill dude this is our reality
this stuff happens she's not broken
she's in a relationship if she doesn't
want that part of her life to be spoken
about right now then you might have to
just but you have to figure out where
you stand do your feelings about the
situation are they gonna get in the way
of a relationship or is this something
that you could be like oh I could accept
because that's another thing I wonder
are you talking to her for her are you
talking to her for you
exactly don't make her pain your thing
cuz that's it's still pulling it away
she might not be ready to talk yet she
brought it up you know she felt
comfortable telling you about this and
if you're feeling a certain type of way
maybe what if it has something to do
with your sex life I think I would be
okay with someone bringing it up to me
in that way too because communication is
so important and like sex life really is
if you guys are having sex can be you
know a big trigger or it could be
a big deal for for someone that has gone
through sexual assault yeah I think
communication is key so like if
something like that is happening and
you're in like those moments and you're
not sure if what you're going to do is
going to be triggering then just give
her a heads up like I kind of want to do
this or whatever but I think the
important thing here is to not turn it
into her having to I'm not saying that's
what he's doing I'm just saying it runs
the risk of even though the intentions
might be fully pure and good it runs the
risk of being like hey I'm not doing
well about with the thing that happened
to you
so can you now make them calm down and
that's a job I know the inner it's just
hard it's hard it's a shitty thing that
happens and that's why stuff like this
that's why people should speak out
because stuff like this affects everyone
else it's not just just the women who it
happens to yeah I would say if nothing
has changed since she told you like
sexually or emotionally maybe just leave
it and you can always frame your
questions in a communicative way that
doesn't bring up the sexual assault you
could also talk to a professional like
you could yeah there are there are
plenty of people who are able to much
better than us who are able to be like
yeah this is how you speak and this is
how like this is that's trauma it's a
trauma and how to deal with the trauma
yeah and I think that's a really good
question it's such a good question and
I'm I'm so thankful that like a male
wrote in asking yeah like that he didn't
feel comfortable rather than just like
take assuming and kind of take taking
his feelings into action I think it was
really brave of him to to ask and I hope
that helps so Ella's got to go to a
meeting in like 20 minutes so Casey
let's bring in Casey I'm gonna intro you
okay
our guest today I'm so excited about so
I followed her on Twitter because a
friend of mine from back home would
retweet her all the time and I thought
she was super funny then I got out here
and I was doing stand-up and I met her
if you stand up and her story is
freaking so cool she's just so cool and
I've never really met someone so
unapologetic about the stuff that they
say the choices that they make so I I
can't wait for everyone to meet her so
come on in Casey
thank you everyone thank you oh thank
you yes how we have to do our podcast
yeah but cool that's cool
thanks so much I mean Kate it's the
funniest person I know so when she says
that there's someone really funny that I
need to meet like I'm super excited to
meet you and she said we would get along
really well so I'm really yeah I want to
meet in person at some point yeah yeah
that's possible go out and hang yeah
okay no who are you what do you do
what's your deal I guess like in this
day and age like we kind of define
ourselves by our titles and so for me
it's like it's just the three comic
stripper former Playboy columnist I'm a
writer how's my own podcast now but I
think yeah what's your podcast called
it's called Casey's freak show with two
E's on iTunes under meltdown comics
networks oh I love meltdown look
I'm just gonna start your podcast one
four five five yeah that's great that's
how we're doing it but yeah mostly just
a stripper and a comedian is like wait
so I looked you up on Instagram last
night I was watching all of your videos
like holy I want to know
everything okay I should preface this by
saying I grew up in Tampa Florida which
is a strip club capital of the world or
the country yeah like better than Vegas
people or like is voted better than
Vegas I guess so I grew up like for fun
we would go to ship clubs like Friday
and Saturday night we would like go out
to parties and then we'd end up at the
strip club so I am very familiar with
the strip club world I always said I
would I had definitely been a stripper
in a past life or will be in a future
life because I'm just all obsessed with
like the beauty and the sexy
Akeno can you just I don't know tell me
how how you like got into it and what
you love about it yeah it's so it's
interesting cuz like when I went for the
first time I felt the exact same way you
did which was like just to check out the
club like I had never really been before
except for one time when I was like
wasted I was like 21 when I went in on
my own accord like to go check it out
before I auditioned I felt the same way
as you where I was like wow they're
gorgeous like I think I'm pretty gay I'm
just like well like my fur I used to
masturbate to like Jazmin have a lot in
a job look it up a lot in jazz and it's
really good it's the future
no I just feel like women are so much
hotter than your both by so we're and
you know as a stripper when a lot of
girls come in and they might like mean
monkey or tree with disrespect which
does happen unfortunately a lot of time
it makes me sad cuz like when I came in
and checked it out like I felt like it
was just gorgeous
to watch and like I felt the same way as
you but I will say that yes like back
when I was younger I also I looked down
upon it like I was raised in a very
conservative region small town I'm from
like a small shitty town in Oregon okay
it's just like a shithole USA I'm like
super religious town so like I just
thought strippers were just like
horrible deviants just cuz that's what
was taught to me yeah we used to talk
about how like growing up a joke would
be like well if all else fails we'll be
a stripper yeah yeah it's like the
metric for being a failure yeah
and I would say I would next work is
yeah even though I know now obviously
it's not at all but I went to college on
a full academic scholarship I / team
that everything I did but I always had
this fascination with sex workers and
with strippers like I just anything
taboo can you explain what sex work is
like the difference between sex work and
stripping I'm stripping is sex work yeah
a lot of people get confused like they
always ask me like why do you call
yourself a sex worker and it's like well
that's just like how its categorized
like in essence we are selling some kind
of form of sexual so it's not like
necessarily like when people think sex
worker they think prostitution like
you're literally like that we have sex
yes and I don't do any like extras what
good hand job blowjob sex like anything
like that I am just strictly a stripper
but it is sexual in nature in some ways
I think Oh sometimes I think all work is
sex what's my tease belt on is everyone
getting laid eventually that was the
whole thing I feel like that's all
anybody wants yeah do you know what I
mean though like when I for a long time
I was a server in restaurants and like I
did the exact same thing which was
flirting to make tips like the exact
same way yeah yeah but you had to
remember more and do more like it's
shittier like worst hips yeah more
disrespect less control over and dirty
plates now that I guess how he got into
it was like this fascination for years
and years years I was a dancer in high
school I was it's a long story but I was
a sex addict for a couple years there in
my drug and alcohol addiction I'm sober
now I kind of I I have like all this
crazy like Scorpio sexuality and I'm a
dancer and I thought and I'm good at
selling myself you know what I mean like
I really didn't stand up you're just
like peddling yourself during yeah she's
a great stand-up as well oh my god yeah
but I'm so fascinated by the stripper
label I want to know more yeah oh yeah
so how I got into it was just that
fascination and I was sort of bottoming
out on all my addictions at that point
and I because I always had that thing
where I was like oh if I become a
stripper that I'm you know technically a
failure at life meaning but I had given
up all of those like those ideas because
I was bottoming in my addiction so I
just didn't care anymore about what
people thought which is like an odd way
to get into it most girls do not get
into stripping you know bottoming and
drugs and alcohol and sex addiction
they're just like oh like this is a you
know a job that I can do but I was
always she scared because I was an
overachiever and I thought that would
mean I was a bad person and I'm not
deserving of love and whatever or it
would mean I'd never have a boyfriend
again even though I'd been single for
many years at that point cuz I just had
a lot of issues basic right but it had
nothing to do with the stripping no no
no and again this is
most girls story I just have a very
crazy one is like there is a stigma
attached to like that it because I don't
know I think it's just the way the media
portrays it that like it is this like
night job with the that's when
everyone's on the drugs and the drinking
and yeah that's really like it's this
underworld right and it's like where the
mob hangs out it's really like I work
for him in a lot of ways totally I think
there's two sides of it and I read this
comic that Jack the stripper she's
amazing she Illustrated of an older sex
worker stripper son which was like
dripping it's like you got to ride the
wave like you're surfing like cuz there
is like just ride the wave like stay
above the current because there is an
underbelly to it there is a seedy side
but there's also like a very fun
light-hearted goofiness it's like a
bunch of girls you feel like you're in
high school did you keep joking around
all the time and just like grabbing each
others butts and it's very like immature
and silly and fun yeah and all your
videos you're like smiling which I
thought I really wanted poster one video
I was like she's smiling in this yeah
look use your just like like just happy
and like feeling yourself and be yeah
but that portrayed by a male around
media I they you may interpret it if you
look it now like the way even pole
dancing is it's sweeping the nation as a
for my daughter size and like Tony
Middle American forties housewives are
now soul dancing classes it's like yeah
it's not the same you know Miami sort of
like veiled sort of an underworld like
you mentioned you know it's there's so
much to it he and I were talking about
yeah we're talking about that yeah I
like these girls and pull classes and no
hate on them like a lot of girls do
stripping and some arm pole instructors
like you know I mean I know girls and
but in pull class like you're paying do
the exact same thing that I do in the
club or money you know for money and if
they're wearing the same things I wear
they're moving the same way and there
and it's so there is there has to be
something about that's what it's overdue
and wonderful or else yeah no woman
would do it if it's truly that terrible
but like it feels like a like not
double-edged sword it's hypocritical
yeah whatever because because
but double-standards boom there and we
got there because so much of like what
we do as women it feels like it's too
pretty to make ourselves look good and
like for almost like the male gaze right
so it's weird that when women are like
oh okay you want me to do all this for
the gays
okay I'm gonna make money off of it if I
do it anyway I'm gonna make money off it
and I'm gonna have fun do it yeah have
fun doing it is like Howard and I
thought you hated it I would just go
work a different job with other jobs
yeah I feel like an argument people
would say it's like well the money so
good that like I'll put up with a lot of
 because of the money but like you
know every job I've seen strippers like
in Miami who could make like a couple
grand a night and then I've seen
strippers who make like 200 bucks and
they're like yeah like doing it oh yeah
200 is like a pretty okay night to be
it's not that good anymore the
industry's dying there's internet porn
there's tinder there's lower price
escorts there's a dial class there's
like so many I mean like the industry
the internet version of a strip
club I completely agree with you yeah
how do you feel about like something
that's you're watching kind of the
industry the same way that like we're
kind of watching magazine and print kind
of go out of business I like is there a
next step that you can kind of take your
talents to and that's what I'm trying to
figure out I might work sometimes and
we're all like looking at the girls and
we're like I'm just like I feel like I'm
gonna sinking Titanic but I still have
enough like good nights that make up for
it and just when I start looking into
other jobs I realize like though I only
work three nights and so what stripping
affords me is a lot of free time to
write read edit perform like follow my
passions and I do love dancing like
dances always been a huge like oh I was
like God my phone was like inches away
from my face I was like laying in bed
just like oh my god I do you want to
talk ask about like dating is that
something you bring up on like a first
date do you put it in like your tinder
profile like what's dating like cuz it's
already oh my god I'm s in LA
today oh my god yeah this is order you
got a lot of stuff going on
when I went into the industry I think
one of my biggest things that I was
scared of was that no one would ever
date me right but I had sort of creeped
on all these girls so the club I work at
it's like the best club in LA I just
like it
um yeah cheetahs Hollywood I like too
much we should go oh my god I've never
been and I thought I've been Ella wants
to go to just raised her head to point
it out herself she's like been there
made it rain on those bitches no but I
looked at all the girls pages and I
noticed like before I ever audition that
some of them were married some of them
learned I had boy and I'm but in my head
I was like that means none will ever
date me and yes initially I've had a
boyfriend for over a year now we've been
together and I love him very much and he
knew about my job going into it and the
best thing I learned was to be upfront
about it like just be and and not like
when we met I was not looking for
someone which obvious is what you always
hear about dating but before him I was I
was like thirsty and I was on tinder and
I was like oh I danced it's a bikini bar
like I was so scared to say it and
English like any bar it's a strip club
but you don't take off your top or your
bottom okay no one's going to
those places no that's what hers it that
is mo yes no but it's close
like when I grow up in Florida like I
had a vagina in my face when I was like
oh yeah that's what I music you yeah I
love the bats that's what I'm like yes
that's the literally the best um yes so
he knew about it going into it and I
think I was just at that point not like
pandering to people I was just like I'm
gonna live my best life be my happiest
me and not apologize and that will
always attract the right person to you
because you're not like trying to just
like water yourself down for some guy
who's not secure and himself
yeah
wait I do want to ask about the bikini
bar why do people go if they don't see
boobs in badge vagina that like Jumbo's
is one of my favorite places cuz it's
like you go and the environment is just
so fun insects
see and like it's a great place to go
but I'm trying to think in a dude's mine
what's like the appeal yeah it's like
Jumbo's but we give more lap dances more
personal I don't know I think like
honestly a lot of guys are so nervous
about shorts when they walk in even to
the bikini 400 they're scared shitless
like they need a couple drinks in them
like if you talk to a guy straight up
the gate who's sober like a 90 95
percent of the time he's like way too
nervous to talk to you oh that's the big
difference is that you can drink in a
bikini but you can't yeah in LA like
full nude you there's no booze you can
do yeah it's the same is that you can't
drink alcohol really at some places yeah
so like if you want a drink you go to a
bikini bar but if you're already like
 up and you would go to it's very
intense
so that makes how much you can do
topless with a full bar in LA but the
thing is guys are scared of girls like
they literally tell me it's less
intimidating when we're wearing like
clothes I don't know because they still
get lap dances you know what I mean but
yeah they just they're they're scared of
women like yeah like they're scared of
us even just wearing bikinis they're
scared of pretty girl I'm
confident do you have to be to be a
stripper you can't be like well like I
don't know I've never been I'm awesome
totally a hundred percent assuming but
like I would think a guy would be like
wow this is the most confident way I can
interact with a woman I don't know I
feel like I feel like everyone should go
to strip clubs or bikini bars like
they're so there's such a good
experience it's like like you see all
these free women and for me like it
afraid of me you know like I was I was
with a group of girlfriends yesterday
and like I'm no hate on them it's just
like and they were not neighbors but
every girl was like seeing something bad
about her body you know like that scene
in Mean Girls oh yeah in the mirror
everyone kept doing that they were not
strippers and then I just thought
they're like eating fudge like quietly
because they don't feel bad about body
hair or
if I'm having a fat day or things I used
to like hate myself for because
you're just like running around in your
underwear and you just stop caring at a
certain point and it doesn't matter
anymore and you just get this like inner
confidence that's just that's so cool
yeah I feel like that that might be why
I'm gonna get heat for this but I feel
like that might be why people get so
much like strippers and sex workers get
such a bad name on them because it is
like a power switch it's fully
understanding your power and being like
oh I don't need you and then I feel like
society sort of built off of need so
it's sort of like no you should feel
this way or that way about your body or
whatever but the truth of the matter is
more than I mean no hate on porn or
anything like that but I feel like strip
clubs it's it and bikini bars it's you
see what like real women look like you
don't even like you're a people person
there's girls of all sizes of all of all
like just like personal style color and
like just like but all these different
kinds of girls just like owning their
 yeah and and it's just like it's
the most freeing thing to be your own
what's the most fun story you have from
working a bikini bar oh my gosh well
yeah I've done private nude events
before so I have done like some other
things wait what's a private nude event
Oh God wait don't you this we could cut
this out what were you at oh I went to
toast but that was not for Dan find Andy
oh no oh my god that was not she was
stripping that was just cuz like I know
a lot of people no I don't know it was
crazy
wait do you know about sex party since
I've been trying to go to a sex
party in LA sorry if that's assumptive
of me I just assumed that you would know
people do ask me but I like honestly
like that's not no I want to go so
 bad that's all I want
if I could do that she actually asked me
to text you to ask about that yeah oh
that's funny I've heard people tell me
about them all the time but I've never
you had like a swingers party yeah like
or like a voyeurism sort of thing like I
really just don't think I would even
need to try and date in LA if I could
just go to sex parties there's like
honestly I've heard that the swingers I
know are like hot and what I was shocked
by dad I was like hot people through
this yeah that sounds cool
yeah well if you know any of them my
handle is that Kelsey Darragh to invite
me well then how did you get into comedy
because that's so awesome like
you go how do you balance that schedule
because it's both nighttime job oh god
um I only worked three nights and
stand-up I moved here for like six years
ago I was like it's what I always wanted
to do so yeah I was a kid I just
wouldn't obsessively watch stand-up like
just like any form of comedy on TV and
then I just when I was in college I was
like miserable as I was studying like I
just like go and read comedy blogs and
comedians autobiographies as those my
version I was like studying to be
comedian like how did they do it like
Reid and Steve Martin bored standing up
that's like the Bible right I know
everyone says but I would just read
female comics by a skate like my wall at
home is just like always
yeah Amy Tina yeah Sam and like Kathy
Griffin's is actually the best of all
anyway I want to read it it's the best
of okay I'm gonna get it I think she's
so underrated she's one of my most
favorites and she's a hard worker yeah I
pull relation on her but she's a genius
everyone gets on though that like
all the girls who stay on the girl
always the second they get to a certain
level they're just toys and Sam
I don't know how you guys do it I did
stand-up for a little bit out in Los
Angeles and I don't miss it a yeah
I know it that's the thing is this last
year so I moved here for it six years
ago I was grinding grinding but I got
sober two and a half years ago in this
one and this last year I just like
mental health wise like I wanted to get
right you know what I mean yeah cuz I'm
sober I'm not like drinking all the
feelings away of like the misery and the
toxic energy and so I really pulled back
on it I love being on stage I don't like
all the that goes with it
open mics are you writing that's awesome
yeah and I feel like too with the
Internet these days like you don't have
to subject yourself yeah in a weird way
like sometimes women really like if you
can make it as a female comic like then
you're really like a like you really
made it and I'm like I don't want to be
 like minimize and verbally
abused and like funny funny actually
yeah yeah literally do you always have
this like people whenever I would go to
like it's like an open mic I would
always get like I'd see the guys shake
hands and then they'd always hug me and
it used to piss me off so much because I
was like just shake my hand
yeah always so like oh good for you for
trying out but what the mood get back to
their stuff in the same way and when I
stopped drinking and doing drugs I was
like oh this hurts my heart and my soul
and I want to be happy that's yeah
Nicole and I always say that
about the internet like it's gotten me
my writing jobs and now I'm like working
on a pilot with a friend we're gonna
make I'm writing a book oh yeah oh man I
cannot wait to write what I want to do
yeah okay do you have do you have a
publisher like any of that stuff yeah
literary agent yeah anyone's email if
anyone's listening rumors you've got
sorry I've got stories and people will
buy this book do you think you're funny
or sober yeah you know what's funny I
just had this conversation the other day
with a friend I used to think that whole
like I'm some broken and I have so much
damage and I need to be up to be
funny cuz that's what you convince
yourself oven and the disease of
alcoholism convinces you of that you
need it it's me know when I stopped
drinking doing drugs like my brain
restored to full health and it was like
shooting out the joke so much better cuz
I'll tell ya alive and present and yeah
you know what I mean like I used to just
think I needed that and I think my mind
you know I had a weird upbringing I'm a
weird person my mind is clever and
thinks differently so yeah always be
able to think of funny jokes yeah but
you know Marty rewired that way I talked
with Kate about this all the time that
like it's also just a cultural shift I
feel like two or three years
when like Amy Schumer was getting
popular and you were seeing that
self-deprecating women can be like
selling out Madison Square Garden it was
fine to be like I'm flawed and I'm
 up and now I own that and I feel
like now a lot of women are confident
and they're flaws and like kind of how
we were talking about like hot like
being a hot mess was like cute now with
what's going on in the world and
just like the political climate and
like it's not cute to be it's a little
selfish to be like I'm up I'm
 up it's like yeah just look
around at what is going on oh to other
people and like I think it's also you
have to you have to change with the
season I guess is what I'm trying that's
so funny you say that because I feel
like I've been talking about that with
friends so much because yeah the
self-deprecating thing is like it's easy
and I think for male comics it's their
way of being like I'm vulnerable I have
like every male comic has a bit about
his small dick well then that's not
being bullied no yeah you can feel it no
but it's like they're pretending to be
vulnerable by making fun of themselves
and I think we all should have humility
there's humor and humility but I
realized like before I got sober I was
literally suicidal and on stage I just
be tearing myself down cuz I hated
myself and audiences weren't even
feeling that they were feeling sorry for
me yeah that's another thing for women I
feel like a lot of times when we do
self-deprecating stuff where there's a
very fine line because between it being
funny and it being like oh no are you
okay honey but a guy could kind of say
the same thing and it doesn't get quite
as looked at but I wanted to ask you
about how you because you grew up very
conservative yeah well yeah my family
was I I wasn't really a yeah I was
taught a lot of things I had to unlearn
but I I was I'm learning just naturally
I'm a bleeding-heart liberal that's just
take it I'm so excited I like I'll
answer both the fact that you like let
go of that stuff and you like listen to
your own voice I feel like that's so
important I feel like our listeners
really like that and like can you talk a
little bit about what Wow oh let go of
judging like you'll be kept in the
middle of like I can't stress this
enough in the middle of stand-up like
culture and and being like all this like
the safety and judgement and society and
all this stuff and you got rid of all of
it you got sober you started dancing you
started doing all this
for you how did you have that did you do
that how would that happen up in ten
seconds please read the tasteful new
don't playboy comment the place has a
lot more than I could say right here now
but essentially I have always had to
listen to like my inner voice because I
grew up in a small town where I
literally was made fun of constantly
like I was called a weirdo and a freak I
was weird and I had developed a sense of
humor to cope but at the same time I
bonded with the other weird kids you
know what I mean like they were my
people it's a gift it's a gift to be
kind of on the outside absolutely it was
painful at the time but right now I'm 29
now and I made this joke on Twitter the
other day how like oh I'm finally the
confident older me I want to be but I
took 29 yeah it takes time even
when you feel like you have it down you
 don't like you're never done
growing you're never done like you can
change you can morph at any age it's
never too late like truly like that's
where midlife crises come from and we
stigmatize it by calling it a crisis but
I think it's like sometimes it's people
finally just doing what they want rather
than following the social norms
you only get this one gift you use it I
think you have to just like try some
stuff out I had so many itches to
scratch because I went to college on the
scholarship I did all of that to follow
the beaten path I was mostly but after
college I moved to LA to follow my
dreams and I really let loose and when I
started stripping I was so scared
because I had always had to have
straight I like I always had to be the
best in every club every team the
captain and the leader and this and that
and I was like I don't want to be a
failure you know like that's what I
perceived it as but I always thought I'd
be good at dancing you know good at the
job and I'm like let me just dabble and
see where this takes me because even
though I was so afraid of what people
would think and like excommunicating me
or making fun of me but I did it because
I have this itch and you just scratch
and it turns out like I got sober on the
same time I started stripping in that
work like you there are drugs available
you you know you can go to a dark place
pretty quickly if you want but that's
like LA like you can find that in any
town like it doesn't I mean maybe more
so that it's available in stripping or
sex or like
I like what you said about scratching
your itch is like all the listeners out
there I think more people should scratch
their itch --is and yeah I don't have
any regrets like that's my biggest fear
is like looking back on my life and
being like I should have tried that or
done that ya know like follow your heart
because I just think the universe has
something bigger for all of us plan if
we just like follow our truth and what
are you like where our light is you know
