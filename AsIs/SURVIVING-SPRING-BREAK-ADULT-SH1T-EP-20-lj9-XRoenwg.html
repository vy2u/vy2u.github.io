employees or family members of employees
and you need the hashtag contest when
you submit these things or else we can't
consider you Allah Allah there's all
these state regulations about ball ball
continental US dollar off so when you do
this week's hashtag we're just make sure
to do halftime contest when you write
your tweets at us and make sure you're
tweeting them at adult with a1 on
Twitter that will that's where we're
pulling from and before we do that
remember last week we talked about did
we keep it in the podcast that why is
being an adult so expensive I'm not even
good at but yes that was by at Raven Ben
hunt
good job right you thought that was a
funny tweet okay these were some of my
favorite tweets from the hashtag war
some of the runners-up was one from
Heather LeAnn an elephant's brain reads
away
an elephant's brain reacts to humans the
same way a human's brain reacts to
puppies they think we're cute really
cute another one I loved was from this
one almost one this one almost won at em
Eric son one two three
her tweet was just a reminder that
Australia wants wage
war on the emu population and lost so I
did googling some of this googling about
the EMU war and the evil war was also
known as the great evil war it was a
nuisance wildlife management military
operation undertaken in Australia over
the latter part of 1932 they lost that's
insane
think of commits loss to the emus that's
 hilarious
and educational so thanks for that one
here's a here's a good one and from at
sam scoot probs a snail can sleep for up
to three years that's funny
mmm-hmm how about this from really late
kate female kangaroos have three vaginas
lucky oh I thought this one was
interesting at Jen underscore Ansley
said high heels were originally created
for men butchers used to use them to
avoid stepping in blood that's cool
right you guys are just like a big ol
fat hairy sweaty butcher and like hair
vamos well generalized butchers I'm
sorry but just aren't fairly represented
in the media I don't know what any other
kind of butcher looks like what oh god
of the late 90s someone tried to get
puppy channel on cable the pilot never
took off that's rude
uh at Bill Murray said a pig's orgasm
can last up to 30 minutes
so I guess being a pig would be okay
says her hashtag yeah depending on where
in the world you were a pig true because
you're good at vidiians some things are
just wrong coming off does throw rocks
at things that show everyone's mad that
a big good orgasm for 30 cents or like
you know what's like you I'm gonna eat
you yeah or they get turned into bacon
yes also how did we I mean I know the
people is you know this isn't a new
observation but how did we pick what
animals we eat dude I see tweets about
that all the time that are like Bravo to
the man who like
eight enough plants to find out what we
could use in our spices or whatever
because probably most of those people
died trying to fish yeah Canon Kenny
shout out to those people yeah why don't
we eat emus whoa that maybe would have
solved the email over growth population
Australia did you think about that I
think we eat their eggs no they're very
big
should we announce this week's winner

in a video where we found out that the
beasts real name was Adam yeah some
Beauty and the Beast that just made me
laugh my ass off also there's

Oh mr. fake history it's very good or is
stupid history better stupid history
okay oh wait and we can do stupid with a
one okay so this week's got talking all
right this week's hashtag is stupid
history stupid spelled with a one stupid
history tell us the most stupid history
facts yes like for example we need to
have example
okay for example in 1980 which is
history if you think about it it's over
20 years ago workers in Las Vegas
hospitals were suspended because they
used to bet on when patients would die
oh my god that's so rude funny hey you
know what about would have also been a
stupid history fact that there was a
Australian once waged war on the EMU
population god that just makes me
 laugh here's a stupid history
fact in ancient Egypt people shaved
eyebrows as a mourning symbol when their
cats died what a weird thing to do I
shaved my eyebrows on accident and
seventh grade what
yeah how did you do that on accident I
didn't like plucking so I would just get
a razor under there no it was the
dumbest to go that I saved half of one
off and then I was like oh I should
probably finish the job like it just
that could be gone so I shaved the rest
of it off and then I went oh I should
make it even I shaved off my half the
one I went Fargo oh man and I was really
dude change the shape of the thing and
then I was like drawing them on as
though people couldn't tell if they were
drawn on and then but that was cool back
then at least for a little bit the real
skinny ones yeah yeah then I managed an
I went to tennis practice and I got
really sweaty and so I started this
fitness practice with eyebrows I've
ended the test
we're just blurry marks on your forehead
yeah it was rough so yeah guys make sure
you're also including the hashtag
contest or else we can't consider you
for the prize of the dope-ass care
package which we're still gonna pick to
Cather yes
but thank you for that those things made
us laugh and that really matter
week ah it's been a couple days but this
Sunday was the Oscars yeah baby that I'm
you know it's interesting how much the
America does not give a about the
Oscars it was like something like 50% of
people don't watch it but for people
like us in LA it's a Christmas
Hanukkah or Kwanzaa whatever your big
holiday celebration is did you watch I
did I would I'd watch I also played the
guessing game you know or you trying to
like do the ballot and I won what did
you think about just everything uh you
know is good I
I'm still a little heartbroken that
Timothy didn't win Timothy sha'lame the
star of here's the thing that hit Indy a
beautiful love story love story just
call me by your name call me by your
knee they won Best Adapted Screenplay
was that the only big one thing they won
yeah I think so
we should also mention Jordan Peele won
for Best Original Screenplay eight he
was the first black man to ever do that
there was a lot of big things the first
female cinematography was nominated
cinematographer DP there were the first
female director since in like 90 ever
like 8 years yeah yeah yeah yeah Greta
Gerwig there are some really big moments
but overall your biggest upset was that
Timothy sha'lame didn't win yeah what is
it with him I think he did such a good
job
I've watched call me by her name four
times in the last four days it is my
favorite lines in the speech that the
dad gives at the end oh my god I bought
the book so that I could frame this
beach oh that's a really cute also
decorating idea thank you cuz yeah
you're a writer they know it would be
fun to have your favorite books like you
and oils and stuff presents we really
ate your birthday is coming up and we
have to mention wait no this is kind of
off subject of the Oscars but you might
be going too silly because of the last
you guys might have done it we might
have convinced my boyfriend to pay for
Kate to go to Philly and if we do we're
gonna try our damnedest to try and do
some sort of live podcast so if you guys
work in like Philly theater or comedy
spaces and have a place we could just
pop in to record tweet at us yeah okay
back to the Oscars back to the Oscars I
just think that listen who was the guy
who won what's the guy's name who won
for what better admin yeah Sirius Black
I haven't seen the movie me I can't say
it was all I know is that he had you
know a whole mask on and all this stuff
and he had the whole it's
ei2 in my opinion I would assume it
would be easier to learn to get into a
character if you literally have to build
the character around your face or as
Timothy was like half naked the whole
time yeah it is like you know what I
mean I can't imagine I was so put that
into back has all those shots to like
they they played it safe they stayed in
like a nice and medium range but I feel
like to be that vulnerable you have to
have all your having a crew asset you're
having people might have seen oh my god
can i film i've had to film sex scenes
for BuzzFeed videos and it's never not
awkward no matter how well you know the
person or no matter how well you think
you're doing you're not it's not easy
and I just think that he did such a
beautiful job I really I just loved
watching him - have you seen oh you're
gonna be so pissed that me won't where
someone made it like if I can find it
wait official Instagram official
Sean Penn used to work at BuzzFeed and
she runs a hilarious Instagram that's
like curated best memes sort of like a
 Jerry or whatever posts but she
posted a tweet from at trashing gate
wheats that says Timothy sha'lame
appreciation post and the first pictures
is of timothy halliday and the other
three are of Jonathan Cheban Kardashians
I'm like oh my god do not II don't
Timothy's beautiful Jonathan is fine
she's crying they're both such like
structured like you are talking about
one of the most talented actors I'm not
denying that but I'm also not denying
that he might grow up to look like
Jonathan Cheban
oh how a husband Timothy if you're
watching come on gotta cast come on the
podcast guys just start tweeting at them
this is how we you guys have been making
movements it's all from you tweeting at
people yes all the way we do it get
anything done around here I was on a
plane for some of the Oscars why are you
poking me in the face right now no okay
uh we I was on a plane for the first
half which like nobody really cares
anything I mean a Supporting Actor yeah
oh that's true the guy from three
billboards wine but I I'm I I really
like listening to opening monologue so
they feel like that really sets the tone
mm-hmm and here's my question is what
why didn't you be Kimmel get the host
again when like they know that there
really should be like not a straight
white dude hosting or is it that they're
playing it safe the same way that like
this Super Bowl asked Justin Timberlake
to do it because they knew he wouldn't
be like controversial like he wouldn't
do he wouldn't like comment
controversial how do you say
controversial controversial no this is
your different ways but I like the way
you say it better
Oh controversial I don't know it gives
me I don't mean to be controversial
is it controversial Oh controversial
how do you say controversial
controversial doesn't even feel right
controversial oh okay I know it be
controversial controversial I don't need
to become servile anyways I heard rumors
that like the reason why they didn't ask
someone like a Kendrick Lamar or Beyonce
to perform at the Super Bowl was because
they were they were hoping they could
get someone that was that wouldn't
comment on the take any protests and and
black lives matter and I mean Jimmy
Kimmel does it anyway like he cut he
comments he commented on that stuff yeah
I guess I just would have preferred to
see someone up there like I agree XSI
oddish or someone I understand I love
Jimmy Kimmel yeah I love him I didn't
understand the hotdog throwing I missed
that part
they were shooting hot dogs into the
audience of people going to see Oh
 one time yeah I wish I also want
to go see oh because that was the thing
as they went to the Chinese Theatre next
door and surprised a bunch of people
with a bunch of Oscar winners and then
probably worship and then surprise them
with Oscar wieners ah that's funny
you don't get that I literally just said
it of course I get it you said you
didn't understand the hot tub I don't
understand why they thought it was a
good idea to throw hot
human beings oh I just laughed I thought
that anyways I think he Jimmy Kimmel
fine he did fine but I'd like to see ya
there's maybe next time what they say it
would be taking a risk but it's really
just like letting the people have what
they actually want which is kiss me
Haddish we want to finish to come on
this podcast more than anything
yeah I'm so happy for her thank you
um anything else about the Oscars these
things can get you catching Greeks and
cats and boots and cats and boots and
cats and boots and cats let's go to the
ads
I got that bad guy like spring that's
coming back in spring break yeah isn't
that isn't that from Spring Breakers yes
spring is spring break bitch spring
break bitch yeah but I think you're just
like spring break oh that movie with
something else
sounds like just spring break how bout
shark all right
who does anyone have to be invited I got
spring break the girl from Jaws oh that
was somewhere that was my that was right
before the there really is a okay so
it's spring break for most of our
designers here if you don't know what
spring break is if you're a nerd never
was there where it's not like a I think
I don't know what spring break is okay
fine also their national listeners
probably take more holidays yeah not
vacation so it is a holiday foster
culture spring holidays over spring
break in between semesters at college or
university is all you okay that's it we
love you please have us there yes and
you want to come to Monica's so we're
college age students usually go to a
tropical location where the only dress
code is the keys and Malibu rum and it's
just about getting as wasted and having
as much ridiculous fun as possible and
ask someone who grew up in Florida
mm-hmm it was one of the biggest spring
break destinations of the world and
every spring no matter if we were in
like high school or college we would go
and we would participate and I got to be
honest it was one of the most exciting
times of the year just because there's
no rules when you're on spring break
what happens on spring break
stays on spring break you've never had
any spring breaks no I thought you went
down to like New Orleans once no I've
been meaning to go oh I have still yet
to go oh but I didn't do any of that
spring drought what I do was a spring
break I'm gonna practice for the musical
which is admirable and important yes
Community Theatre Spring Break but
spring break 10 years ago down Florida
was just about getting down
there getting down going down
people drinking getting sunburned pools
getting roofied getting roofied so ok ok
listen this is gonna be a hard subject
for me to talk about and I told Kate I
messaged her this weekend and was like I
need to talk about this film because I
wish I had seen this before going on
spring break and I feel like we have so
many listeners that are gearing up to go
do this that I just want even if you're
not college everyone to watch this film
it's a documentary on Netflix called
liberated the new sexual revolution it's
a film by Benjamin Nolt and it's all
about the normalization and sexual
exploitation that happens in Panama City
over spring break they filmed it in 2017
and when I started watching this I was
like what the is this it's just
gonna it follows a group of guys who
come down to Panama City at first and
let me tell you I was fuming the first
half of the movie and I couldn't stop
watching because it is just this group
of six white men who are staying on the
beach and literally just pick women off
 bang them and hook up with them
and get them drunk and I'm not saying
that it's only the dudes doing this
because then the second half of the film
switches to a female's perspective and
boy I was so angry I cried I was enraged
it ends on a huge crazy impactful like
goose bump inducing moment and so I
don't want to spoil it for you guys and
it's not really spoiling it because it's
a true story it's a documentary in any
way look up this information but there
was a point in the documentary where
there's two girls who are too reminded
me just of me when I was in high school
on spring break who go to do this bikini
competition
and they get up on stage you know
there's hundreds of people that are like
judging their bodies and they have to
twerk for 15 seconds and before they all
go out on stage the guy who's running
the contest who obviously is someone who
like works in the industry and does this
 all the time says okay this is what
you're gonna do and he starts boiling
them up like without even asking he's
just like springs on them and it's
like you go up there you dance you don't
have to do anything you don't want to do
if you want to show your titties
obviously they're gonna like you more so
we obviously encourage that and all of
them are like no we're just gonna go up
there and twerk they go up there and
they even talk about this the whole he
starts manipulating the crowd and it's
like who wants to see her kids and of
course the crowd goes nuts and
the girl who was like no I'm not gonna
show my tits almost shows her kicks she
was like I would never go up there and
never do that but there is something
about having men validate you in a crowd
of that size that made her get like
second-guess her morals and she almost
showed her tits and then you know the
whole crowd boos her and she feels like
 about ourselves and she goes stands
back down line and the next hour all the
cops up just flips her kicked out and
the crowd goes talking wild and I just
felt so bad and then she says something
about you know all these women on spring
break there's there's two sides to it
right there is this new revelation where
now women also have or feel like they
have the power to have one-night stands
and hook up and it's not just a dude
thing anymore right like women do that
now and we're really lucky that we live
in a time where it is shifting but there
is still so the majority of these women
doing things for men's validation and it
would be one thing if you know there
were different kinds of bodies and
different races and genders represented
across the media but there is this one
specific like Victoria Secret type
bikini model that were told men won and
that's what's hot and if we're not that
then we're not sexual or sexy or
valuable or worthy and this culture the
spring-break culture is all about having
that one dude that wants to hook up with
you or like having the one like you know
hot start with your friend
drink and party but like the ultimate
goal of spring break is to and
hopefully you're getting the hottest
dude that will validate you and I think
there is a shift that's happening
there's definitely a line where I go
back and forth all the time where I'm
like I want to be needed and I want to
be wanted but also I don't give a
I'm gonna whoever I want and I wish
I had had this movie ten years ago to
watch before going on spring break and
just seeing the culture of it and it go
dives deep into sexual coercion and how
men can manipulate women being up with
them when they really didn't want to
about alcohol culture and how that
perpetuates specific types of behavior
and man it was just I would I never felt
something so much and I think it's
because I grew up with this being so
close to me and participating in it that
I just I did I was it was such a good
film because when you have feeling this
way and wanting to talk about it I think
it's even though it was a terrible
situation and terrible things happen I'm
so glad I watched it I'm interested in
what you said earlier about the girl
being on stage because I think this is I
think this is where part of my beliefs
are like a little outdated maybe but I
was raised to I'm I mean at that point
sort of like what did you expect yeah
you're getting on stage to twerk yeah on
Spring Break do you really think that
you're walking into a place where
they're going to respect you you know
what I mean I think that's it I think
that that's like a really important
thing I think we need to you know raise
our kids better or whatever but I also
think that you know if you think I've
said this on this podcast before if you
see your car flying down the street you
might be they might have a stop sign and
they should stop but if you walk out you
might still get hit so what do I want to
be right or do you want to be safe and I
think that's like I think there's like a
big argument right now with like well
things shouldn't be that way and I
totally agree but they just use but it's
also like you're at Spring Break is
notorious yeah for being shitty and
slimy and gross it is something that
Rula never appealed to me in any way I
thought about big crowds it was
dangerous oh my god I was the office all
of like the alcohol and I thought about
getting roofied which is funny because
I've tried to not get roofied my whole
life and then I got roofied as an adult
but like that's and they talk to the
women like they cut to interviews of the
beachgoers and the spring breakers and
they do this one section on talking to
the women about these staged contests
and the girls are like I said it's half
where they're like I just feel empowered
and sexy being up there and
having all these men look at me and
that's something I could never do it
like my private Christian college and
then there's the other half that are
like yeah I want that dude to think I'm
desirable and hot and that's I you know
it's it's hard to not be any people
right into that desired ya want they
want to be needed that's just basic
human instance that whole
scenario bums me out and it has always
bummed me out like my whole life yeah
because I want so badly for there to be
a world where someone would be
interested in more than just tits mmm
you know what I mean and I just had a
conversation with a friend yesterday
about this and like I lost a lot of like
hope like he he basically said all that
I mean it doesn't make he's kind of
younger so but whatever but it was like
talking about how there's like a certain
way that you like approach flirting and
a certain like you know that you have
like lower your voice and look a certain
way and lift up your tits or whatever
and I mean I've got I've heard that from
like girls too and I just I don't know I
know that there's I don't know I don't
know how to like put this into words but
let me try I know that I have gotten
really good at keeping a safe distance
because that sort of stuff makes me feel
really unsafe because I don't like the
idea of I'm not the type of person who
wants to just and then leave right
now and I think there's such a level of
like disrespect there and I wish that
this wasn't the case but I also think
that like I've always felt more
comfortable inserting myself as like a
sister
roll mm are like yeah like that you
wouldn't even think to me because
like you're holding the hair back or
like yeah yeah even this is really rule
to like guys yes so like I'm you know
one of the guys and I like joke with
them or whatever and then you know but
then they don't look at me about yeah
because that I want love I don't want
that sort of like thing but I also I
don't I don't know how to like explain
this I I'm having a hard time explaining
on I think you're hitting the nail on
the head because it's different for
every person and I think that's what
this film did great was like there are
some women who were there saying like
I'm doing this because I wanna have a
one-night stand and I want to wake up
tomorrow and never talk to this
 again and part of me was
like hell yeah girl and then the other
half of me which is terrible was like I
don't believe you
like I don't think that's what you want
because that's what I did it was
completely self projection but that
meant Spring Breaks yeah I would even
when I had boyfriend's like my boyfriend
at the time would be like yeah I don't
care if you hook up with a chick like do
what you want get crazy what
tease your concept
type what did you got just that's like I
want my girl to win that I want my girl
to be the girl that's like hooking up
with other chicks and I thought that's
what guys thought were sexy and I almost
feel like it made me kind of Who I am
today to believe that that is what I
like whoa and I it's taken a long time
Wow to realize that like okay if there's
no dudes around I'm single I'm in a
steady job I love my life I'm completely
alone is that what I really want and
there are absolutely things that I have
changed about myself that were ingrained
in me about what I thought men thought
was sexy and what I wanted like for
instance tips like I always wanted a
boob job
I want to boob job my whole life and
felt so embarrassed and when I would
have sex I wouldn't you know do
positions I showed off my boobs and I
would sell south it's so self-conscious
about it and now I would never
change my kids for the world it's what
it's my favourite thing about me but
there were times where I like question
my bisexuality because we've talked
about this before like it's something
that was for years it was appealing for
the male gaze yeah it was
yeah it was more like Oh watching how
you'd make out with this chick then like
that doodle like me yeah I think I'm so
that's really interesting how I feel
like we're we both were affected in two
different ways by almost the same thing
oh yeah um I can't help but think that
it's also because of maybe not but
looking a certain way yeah you know what
I mean like I did I never and I I don't
know I feel like there's I understand
that it's nice to like take care of
yourself and show that you're like try
and putting forth an effort and you want
to look good but I I personally feel
like I'm going more in the opposite
direction because I'm just sort of like
it's so scared of that like the onus
with other people and I think that like
the idea of going I don't know the idea
of going to spring break and just
 and drinking and I understand
what you're saying because the way that
you're talking about taking care of
yourself right like there was a time in
my life and it didn't happen till I was
older that I stopped looking
quote-unquote hot or like getting ready
or doing my hair makeup I stopped doing
it for men mm-hmm and that shift took
time and I wish I would have let that
release go when I was a teenager I wish
I would have not given a what the
dudes around me thought about me mm-hmm
because I think I would have been a lot
happier and I feel like you didn't give
a too much about the cot what the
guys running or it was a it was like a
protective thing that I did it was the
oh that's right guys but it would be
like oh yeah I don't care all this wear
this like hoodie or whatever and not do
makeup and yada yada yada and it was
like yeah I'm chill I'm cool but it was
way more armor than it was a choice and
now I feel like I'm in that sort of same
position as you was like I don't know if
that's what I actually like or like I I
don't I don't know I just I avoid
anything that would make me desirable
you know what I mean like people know
how to contour and they know how to put
on makeup and do their hair and
I'm just
no I don't want to do any of that
because I just I think I decided not to
care so that I wouldn't ever be in
danger because to me any sort of
intimacy like that felt like different
sexuality even yeah yeah there's a quote
 I forget who it is I'm gonna have
to sign it and say it next week but it
was like how many feelings of like
discontent have been our own and how
many have been because of romantic
discourse like how think about all the
time we've spent frustrated or angry or
sad or not feeling worthy or not feeling
loved because it was what we actually
felt or was it because of the actions of
trying to like please someone else yeah
and I feel like maybe you've in a weird
way got into like miss out on some of it
in the good way you know what I mean
yeah as you've kept yourself
quote-unquote seized yeah is that right
I don't know that's just what it is it's
just it is what it is
and I almost feel like it comes back to
that same saying of like it's better to
have loved and lost than to never loved
at all and I always say nah man I would
have rather me not loved at all because
that should it's not worth it
it's so not worth it it reminds me of a
quote from the end of the movie I like
to call call me by your name because to
feel nothing so as to not feel anything
what a waste
whoo mm-hmm so good say that again do
you feel the people in the back to feel
nothing so as to not feel anything what
a waste
so here's where I'm at right now okay
and I want to get back to what you were
talking don't know um yeah but I think
for so long I've been trying to not feel
anything at all
that I feel like now I'm almost like
grieving all of the times that I have to
I missed out you know what I mean and
then later but I really I talked to my
friend yesterday and it really
with me because he was just like
basically just saying like this is what
guys like and this is what guys want
very look old-school I he is unlike this
is what you know this is what will get
you attention and I don't think it upset
me that it was him saying
as much as it was a couple things one
that I always seem to find a way to find
someone who's gonna say stuff like that
you know what I mean something I
consider possible minded cool thinking
old sinking away but then the thing that
scares me the most is what if he's right
hmm that's what scares me
no because uh I'm losing faith right now
and I'm like thank God I am bisexual
because I might likely have one I might
only have the emotional capacity to be
with a woman because right now I don't
know I haven't been proven otherwise the
only time I've seen men be respectful as
the when they're in my family yeah or
it's the at work and they have to be you
know what I mean like I don't men are
and damage and that idea of being like
guys and girls can't be friends like I
do have a couple friends but then then
like that are guys but then it makes me
wonder cuz then it's like the guy was
like that's only if they don't want it
like this was it when Harry Met Sally -
that's only if they don't want to have
sex with you what are you what what are
you doing another yes watch it here it's
all a baby cool come over watch her this
and we could cook our blue apron yeah um
the hell was I saying
oh sorry um about my gang disrespectful
and then but then men like men and women
Oh straight or not straight but men and
women who would be attracted to each
other and I don't know yeah I guess
hetero or could be queer Yeah right yeah
um my hair
yikes but then I'm like oh so if they're
not attracted earth if they don't want
to me that's why we're able to be
friends and that must mean that I am
unfuckable right and so then I start
going down this and I so I said this to
him yesterday because he the guy was
talking he was like I'm not attracted to
you and I was like holy you just
called me ugly he's like no I didn't
he's like if you had like you know if
you were if you have your tits out and
you were talking like a low voice and oh
what an alert I know you see like he
doesn't know my shirt
comes back to like the toxic masculinity
like we're taught I learned that from
women i that has been dating advice that
I've gotten from women when it comes to
flirting and I'm so discouraged right
now because I want to say to like
everyone who's listening who is like
younger to and and maybe going through
it as well probably going through it as
well who doesn't go through this being
like be like there's someone out there
and there's someone and I'm not trying
to be like a debbie downer but I don't
 know because I don't I want
someone like Jim Halpert right or
someone like on it the office you know
or someone who would respect ya a woman
before that woman did something kinda
like that it just has another human
being I'd hate to say that that's like
what when I was talking about earlier
about like when I realized I was
bisexual for myself and not for men yes
like that's where that moment kind of
came from with that this could be a
broad generalization and tweet you know
 at me if I'm wrong but like I
always felt that women respected me as a
woman more and they understood me and it
was just easier as a woman it's as a
person they're they're like I have a
really I'm having a really hard time
with with that whole idea and that whole
like you have to look this way to get
this like admiration but why do you why
do you have to not want to me in
order for you to treat me mica yeah like
a friend like a or even like a person
you would want to like why can't we
be nice oh yeah why like I I and I don't
think it's all men I do think we're not
all men in here at all and I don't want
your deeming majority of the men that
I'm I'm currently drawn to and I think
that that comes from being like
self-destructive in a way of being like
it's almost like you're like a you're
drawn to a bug zapper cuz it's just like
maybe this time I'll get uh no maybe
this one won't be able to reason with
them yeah yeah made me lose faith too
cuz I'm like should I just keep talking
about this to maybe make them see the
light and then I was like is it a
problem that it can't be fixed
I don't know it is really friendly it
starts with the culture of masculinity
and how toxic it is and again and with
media and that's something that like
women play into as well and not leaving
out you know non-binary
hate-fucking going men and women cuz
they leave that that's a scale but the
majority of culture still believes in
this binary like men are supposed to be
strong blue women are supposed to be
submissive pink and obviously that's
like shifting and there is there is a
belief like I do think women are
starting to have belief in their own
power uh-huh and I worry about what that
will meet when it does meet toxic
masculinity that's yeah that's really
interesting because I was even in this
conversation I was like he mentioned
he's like well once you get to a certain
age you could understand reason so that
being raised a certain way doesn't
really and I'm like no because
culturally you're raised a certain way
and you know the way people look at you
and the way they interact with you forms
the way you see the world and conduct
yourself through the world which is very
interesting because then we have a whole
bunch of subliminal messages so there's
no one out there being like you're a
girl you gotta be soft I mean maybe
there is there's probably some dick in a
bar somewhere doing that or like has a
small penis and has never found a
clitoris but I mean if you if you want
to do yeah anyway right so then you have
like all of these underlying like things
we're like get your best body about
ideals like a revenge body or
like you know all these cleaning
commercials with women cleaning and
being like my husband you fool I'm
gonna clean up after him or like honey I
know where your keys are like she has to
have it all together and doesn't have a
whole bunch of boxes and trash but she
didn't throw out of her house yet
clothes you donate yet you don't I mean
I want to be that woman on a commercial
yeah just being like I'm tired
all day is the only thing that works
easy for my skin you know yeah like that
and that's not even likewhat being bi I
keep referring back but like it's not
being bi is about is that like you don't
you know like you're getting something
from women that you don't get from men
because I do think that that's ignorant
thinking because I think it's the it's
getting at people as genders and novice
people but everyone I mean people will
talk about everyone having masculine and
feminine energies
absolutely yeah I think I fully have big
masculine energy and I don't mean that
in the way of like of being like I'll
 whatever I want but then I think
well it's because I'm like oh Lisa and
yeah why don't ya cuz I want to but um
and then I say well it's because I'm a
leader and I'm not afraid of what people
think of me and I'm not afraid to say
what I think but then I go why does that
have to be a masculine trait why
can't that just be a strong feminine
trait right it makes me angry that's
what when people are like gender is a
construct yes for sure
Todd imagine imagine how great spring
break could be if it wasn't about
male/female yeah also imagine if it was
cool with like consent and okay so
that's a note that like man that really
obsessed
know that upset me for so many reasons
about her being on stage and like
because my initial thought is like well
don't be on stage yeah right but I said
it's like why can't you be and just
because you do feel like you have a
power over it makes you feel powerful
over that feeling of needing to validate
men it's kind of like look I'm doing
this for me not for you because again
it's like we don't believe it right we
don't believe that the girl would go up
there and do it for herself right it's
 up I don't think that no one
would I don't necessarily think that I
just think it of then she's not a
celebrity she's not gonna have you know
a bodyguard then she's gonna walk off
this tape yeah yeah and I mean then and
then you have these drunk guys who are
like well you're a spring break so
obviously you're looking for my dick and
honestly I'm gonna pound all three
inches into yunus-bek when they talk
about sexual coercion and just how I
mean it's happened to me I've had sex
with people I absolutely did not when I
have sex with I have hooked up with
people that in the moment I and I don't
 know have like when I look back
on it especially thinking about Spring
Break I think in my head how about
did I why did I do that and then I my
first thought is I blame myself and then
I blame the alcohol I go well I must
have wanted to do
since some grass er must have one of the
attention so it's my fault rather than
going there's a culture of sexual
coercion that comes from a place of
toxic masculinity that invalid just
feels real and it just feels like the
truth and then it affects women right
whereas men are going yes I add another
notch to my belt and that's what matters
and and you know and oh my god there's a
beautiful moment in this film where the
guys it comes out towards the third act
but it's like they are only doing this
for each other as dude friends they're
not actually doing it because they want
to hook up with as many girls as they
can they're doing it because they have
to ask they're labeled a of a
little bitch right like actually that's
what makes me wonder that's what makes
me wonder am I being too hopeful by
thinking that I mean no because I think
that everyone cries when they were
younger they cry when they're hungry
they're cry when they're upset and then
two people you know a amana no and a
woman that are told you're a man you're
a woman so you do this and you feel like
this and you hide your tears and you
don't know how to fix your own things
you just know what strong man to call to
fix these things for you and then and
then we kind of like continue on our way
and I do wonder what it would because
that's that's the the weird thing is
that we could move forward and you know
raise children differently but by the
time they like but then we're never I
mean it's I just don't think we'll ever
necessarily see a change it'll be for
our kids but by that time the plan it's
gonna be done um I I think it would be
cool if we gave some like I don't know
tips for anyone going on spring break
like some things obviously my initial
thing would be like be safe cover your
drinks like bring a friend with you but
I think there's something deeper than
that of like maybe before you get in
that car and take that road trip and you
know blast those hip hop songs and start
shooting pair of a in the
backseat think about what you actually
want out of this and are you doing it
for you or are you doing it for someone
else are you doing it as a man to
impress your
are you doing it so that women will feel
like about themselves later does
that make you feel good or as a female
or a women do does hooking up with a
stranger who you might never see again
actually feel good to you are you doing
it because you want to try it and see if
that feels good to you wear
protection for the love of God yeah yeah
and sunscreen wear sunscreen okay I
think that if your I have such a skewed
view of sex that's why people listen to
us cuz that different so I would say to
me it sounds like you're swimming with
sharks and so just yeah man just be
careful be don't be the bait no no I
don't mean that I just mean like the sad
reality is that if you pass out on the
beach chances are people aren't going to
help you help you unless you have some
friends who are also gonna be looking
out for themselves it's not the way
people should yeah behave or think but I
think that that is the current climate
oviya where we are and I think that just
try really hard not to be in that
position yeah I definitely think you
should be able to go and party and pass
out wake up be like ah that was
crazy you know it all the time now yeah
but I I mean it I just think that you
gotta be really wary of yeah when you
trust you know you're trusting a bunch
of drunk frat strangers yeah guys or
girls you know I'm like oh my god these
kinds of vacations can have lasting
impacts if you know something happens
not saying it doesn't happen every
single day too you know every kind of
race gender sexuality but specifically
when you're going into something like
spring break where it is about alcohol
culture it is about the hook-up culture
just know that rather be safe than sorry
is that terrible to say no I mean I wish
we didn't have to say that yeah I wish
it was different I do think that like if
you're a guy going you know please just
be respectful and
we sound like I hate that we sound like
a a little man Haiti because after
watching this film I did feel that way
so don't want us
yes I'm across as bad but I also I hate
that like weird I just am assuming the
worst of men because historically the
men have done the worst things to women
yes and I think that there's a hive mind
that's what we're yeah yeah is that
alone I I don't necessarily think these
guys to be like yeah of course I
wouldn't do that you know what I mean
like of course not but there's I mean
that's why football happens you know
what I means is people let's
rage is another team and like you know
what I mean it's cool look of this brute
strength and it's something I'll never
understand but I appreciate it and it's
cool it's a guy I like a hive mind I've
done improv but but I think that it's in
the same way that it's really hard for
women to speak up when they're feeling
unsafe it must be really hard for a man
to speak up when the vibe is unsafe yeah
because then it's unsafe for them to and
I understand that and it's all very
difficult this is all like new yeah
really because you know people have been
talking about it but not really like it
hasn't been such a movement it feels
like I would be so scared to go fight
honestly I think too because it was so
normal for me like it wasn't a scary
thing but looking back on it I cannot
believe the things I did yeah I cannot
believe the things I saw and said
nothing or did nothing I can't believe
we comforted each other every day bring
mace oh I love mace I love a great mace
get a Taser yeah yeah do that and just
remember that you have it and again I
still feel bad that it's like women
protect yourselves rather than like men
don't be rapists you know not that women
don't rape because they for sure do but
historically and in this Spring Break
culture you know I would love to go to
like a gay weekend I would love to go to
a gay Spring Break
weekend and just see how that's
different maybe see that's interesting
that you feel bad saying this thing but
that's the truth I know I just I just
what happened you know cuz it's it what
it's my guy friends from home it's my
friends that I grew up with that I have
had to detach myself and my thinking and
my morals from right and not saying like
yeh pala myself on the back like I
deserve to be awarded because now
I'm a liberal like free-thinking a good
person yeah but it's it's that same way
that things are ingrained in you from
Catholicism or whatever or the way that
it constructed your thinking to be like
well don't go on stage if you don't want
to be looked at it's it's will I know
these people I know these guys I know
that they're capable of change I know
that they aren't all bad but again like
I hate saying because I feel like I am
talking about to all these men that are
going to spring break I don't think you
have to be a bad person to do bad things
well so that's like it could be a good
guy you know it could be a good girl it
could be a but you know whatever like a
good person and then they just indulge
this yeah you know drunkenly indulges
things it and sometimes you really don't
know what the you're doing when
you're drunk I know that this pales in
comparison but I have a habit now of
getting drunk and drunk ordering GrubHub
pizza and falling asleep before I could
get it so I just keep giving you yeah it
happened twice now and I'm really upset
cuz I because when I'm drunk I'll be
like I want it all it's just pizza in a
bunch of different forms Pizza cheesy
breadsticks garlic now all that
yeah and then you know whatever but you
know I don't even want to do that at the
time the main thing is like a primal a
dog I'm gonna eat now so what I'm saying
is that what scares me is that idea of
everyone's reckless and everyone's
letting loose and there is a possibility
of someone not even knowing what they're
doing it makes so that's the Aerie - as
a guy to be like I didn't I would never
do that and then you get really drunk
and you you cross yeah you don't follow
me here
and securities and then and then you
have all your different alcohols and the
different drugs or whatever and then the
next thing you know your monster
and girls - yeah it's ten things we cry
a little bit because I also just wipe my
eye at the same time I said it makes me
cry wasn't Oh cry we're here yeah in my
heart because I joke saying that I'm so
thankful that I grew up in Florida and
got to be up and up early on
because I'm so thankful because that's
what's made me who I am today
but it also makes me incredibly sad that
that's how I gained my strength and
became like a strong independent woman
because I know that there are millions
of women that that's going to happen to
wear something terrible or terrible
things or terrible culture is gonna have
to be ingrained in them for them to be
able to as an adult look at that and go
that was so wrong rather than
recognizing it and having strength to
see it early it's makes you sad cuz it
makes me feel like Who I am who I am and
who I'm built on is like a terrible
thing no I don't think so I mean I
understand your feeling yeah you know
and being like oh it I you know you have
to unlearn a whole bunch of stuff and
whatnot and I I empathize with that
completely I know I know what that's
like yeah you do have that in a
different yeah yeah and I but I still
think that you know it still does make
you who you are whatever it did you know
yeah you're even if you even if having
the opportunity to be like I could have
been different or this could have been
different you have that perspective and
I think perspective is the most
important thing and yeah just being like
you know what I mean - like I said why
do I think this way and why am i doing I
think that's like the most important
thing a human could really ask
themselves why am I thinking this way
that's what we're trying to say I think
with this yeah if you have the
opportunity and you're listening to this
and you can really and you're younger
yeah you have with change world I was
going to college age college age and
younger if you have the chance to really
 sit
and think about these things now yeah I
don't know if saying like it'll save you
a lot of grief we're like you
know therapy bills when you're over but
some lessons have to be learned it's
fair but then you know yeah if you can
if you are injured if you're able to
take this and yeah I want them all to
know how beautiful and important it's so
crazy how quickly I turned into my
mother
oh god just that quick I mean I already
was I was the mom even when I was
younger just being like you guys be
careful text me when you get back I'm
gonna turn in and yeah but I just want
you to know that like your bodies are
yours oh you're on that's another thing
I know a lot of particularly white women
are not used to from my experience of
boundaries setting boundaries and I feel
like and I think that something that we
talked about on the podcast without
actually saying boundaries it is
boundaries I definitely think that
that's something that could be practiced
and utilized on a spring break type of
thing am I saying I know that there's
some times you feel like even how we
were just like oh I feel kind of bad cuz
it feels like I'm saying all men and
that's sort of like a trait of being
like oh I feel bad calling them out for
their actress mm you know what I mean
I'm not of course we're not saying all
that we don't want to do that we drink
that is counterproductive you know but
that's the that's what we've seen you
wanted the truth yeah Cyril ringings
you are not responsible for someone
else's feelings if you're in a dangerous
situation try to avoid them avoid it if
you can and if you if you're in a
situation where like this could get
physical and like dangerous fight really
yeah I mean but it's scary it's scary
because if they're drunk and they're
just something it's so sensitive to talk
about and the thing is like when I'm
talking about it I have in my head like
some person on the internet being like
look pic report this and show why
feminism's ruining ya saben acts like
I'm so fearful of even speaking up to
tell other people to speak out
like treat women with equality rather
than has things which is what Allah
it kick em kick them fight up the fight
back but bring mace yeah bring
 mace
I am mace you do hell yeah I don't have
mace I just have thunder thighs I always
feel like that can take care of
everything
I could literally choke a man with my
thighs that rather blind him blind and
push him out into traffic I don't care
well I do carry the one of them but I
don't think about generalize you know
what I mean and I know that that could
be really insulting to someone who's
like I'm not a bad guy I didn't do it
like I'm not a bet you know and he
wouldn't do the things that we say that
you're doing I'm not saying that you
pull it or anything like that if what
we're saying doesn't apply to you
fantastic you're doing great by
wonderful you're doing great yeah it's
nothing to worry about is it if it might
apply to you or your kind of triggered
by it maybe it does it what we're saying
is that you're not a bad person you can
stop doing shitty things though or
letting shitty things happen or having
shitty friends or should be groups of
things these are things within your
control as a thing anyway like that and
I think that's like really important is
that I don't think that it's a I'm right
you're wrong
totally x-amount get him out of here put
him on an island I don't think it's like
that I think it's a it's a really
uncomfortable process of like peeling
back layers of not who we are but who we
were taught to be and so if you're
insulted by it it's really not even you
yeah I think he started really really
good and I think that's still there so I
just think that you know it's same with
any sort of hateful that's disguised as
true feelings or actions you know what I
mean it's fear Wilson she always says
things so well you guys know she
does okay we did really good love eggs
it does I don't know man does a guy's
gain that that movie is called liberated
the new sexual revolution it's on
Netflix by Benjamin no no I don't know
how to say his last name and you know
send us your pictures for Spring Break
we love to see you and your friends
having a good time
I'd love to see that Wow shifting to
maybe a lighter thing we matter we've
been introducing this new segment where
we tell you guys are one adult thing
that felt like maybe it was helping us
be more of an adult this weekend or this
past week do you have a thing yeah it's
kind of long oh boy I know it's call me
by your name but the thing is the thing
is I had no I already said in the
beginning I know we're wrong about queer
I
oh yeah be watching queer
I because we told you we're not wrong is
one thing so call me by name I just I
want so badly to believe in true good
loves and that was just so sweet
it was so sweet so we're gonna believe
in good luck true love I want to believe
in that I don't know if it's being naive
to believe in that I still do but maybe
it only exists in books and movies in
which case that's just what I'll wear
I'll continue to dwell like that Thanks
mine is also a media recommendation I
was a documentary on Netflix again this
week and I was traveling a lot that's
why I watch so many things is a Katie
Couric dock on Netflix called something
about the gender revolution revoluciÃ³n
gender revolution you can google
it
but it I was with my parents this
weekend and of course we were talking
about just culture and my life and some
subjects came up about gender and this
documentary I feel like is a very easy
way to learn about gender and the
spectrum and intersex people all
transgender people and it was an
elementary way I felt like it would be
something that I recommend to anyone
that doesn't fully understand or feels
confused by it or scared
of learning because the fear up
or not being PC and it was something
that I would recommend to anyone who has
like parents because people love
Katie Couric parents love Katie Couric
and they trust her and they she does a
really good job of yeah explaining it
deep taking just a deep dive
into it as someone who knows nothing
about it and yeah I would recommend it
uh I want to give shoutouts this week to
