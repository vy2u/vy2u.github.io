blogger and I want to see how many
sandwiches I can find from around the
world without ever leaving LA

eat french fries and a sandwich this is
the chip buddy whoo Petra potatoes taste
like breakfast

what I did when I was growing up but we
don't have time for that we have to eat
every sandwich in the world we're used
of Los Angeles right now in Alhambra at
bon mean my toe
and we're about to eat up on me which is
similar from Vietnam
the bread is very crunchy a little too
crunchy and it's very crisp sweet spicy
this is about room and it's ham and
cheese egg
this actually tastes like a lot of
American sandwiches perfected a sandwich
that we get except it's got fresh tomato
Americans don't like crushed Tomatoes on
their breakfast sandwich I don't know
why we're Olson Scandinavian
delicatessen where I'm about to eat the
Skagen sandwich which the owner
described to me as the lobster roll of
Sweden
mmm it's delicious it's cold creamy it's
very dill filled and there's fish fry on
top so it's sort of pops in your mouth
which is
