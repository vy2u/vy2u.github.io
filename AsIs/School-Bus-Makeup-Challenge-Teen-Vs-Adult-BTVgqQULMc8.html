- So I'm about to get on this bus
and have a one on one face-off with a teen
to figure out who can do the best makeup
while the bus is moving.
- So, in this situation,
I am currently the adult.
The &amp;quot;adult.&amp;quot;
- Hi, my name is Angelica,
I've been doing my makeup
since I was probably like 12 or 13.
Currently, I'm actually a
freelance makeup artist.
People pay me to do their makeup for them.
- Hi, I'm Serina, and I'm
a teen from Los Angeles.
I have the skills.
I know the tools, I have all the brushes.
I collect makeup and I'm
also learning on Youtube.
- Makeup and I slay.
Every single day, I get up in the morning
to get ready to do my makeup.
It's my favorite part of the day.
- I do the same makeup every day,
it takes me about 15 minutes to get ready.
I 100% know that I suck.
- I do my makeup in the
car most every morning
so hopefully that gives me
some type of an advantage.
- Against an adult, I
really think I got this.
- In general, I'm probably
just gonna be very anxious
the entire time.
I also get very carsick very easily,
so we'll see what happens.
- A full face in under six minutes,
is that even a thing?
- My foundation alone
is gonna take me three.
(challenge music)
- Okay.
- Oh shit.
- [Cameraperson] Now!
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit, oh shit, okay.
- Foundation's on.
Foundation is on, foundation is on.
- [Cameraperson] All right.
- I'm blending this in.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Oh no, oh no.
- It's worse now that it's happening.
(laughs)
- I know, I was,
I can't even open my mirror.
- Beating it so hard, guys, it's fine.
- My tactic: little is a lot.
- I literally didn't even put anything on.
I'm just hitting my face.
- You're good.
- Oh shit.
Oh, that was like not even a thing.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Y'all, if this ain't my color.
- Okay, it broke off, great.
- My brows are gonna be cousins today,
they're not gonna be any type of twins.
- Okay.
- Oh, guess we're not
being very precise here.
- Okay.
- Oh no, the bus is moving.
- Oh no, oh no.
- I heard bushy brows were in.
- I see some foundation
I need to blend back in,
but I'm on brown now.
- What do you mean cateye?
(groans)
- Oh, come on.
- Oh god, oh god.
(laughs)
Oh shit.
- Got some everywhere.
(laughs)
- We're going to school.
- I literally...
(laughs)
- This is not happening!
- I can't even get it, I promise you.
- What do you?
Oh god.
No!
- Oh man, I didn't do a cateye!
- I look like a trainwreck,
guys, it's fine.
- I got some on my lid, it's cool.
Guess that's the new look today.
- Yeah, let's, there's
pedestrians, let's hold.
- This was like a day after
I've liked partied at school.
This was not like a good day
for me to come to school, guys,
like, should've stayed home.
- Gonna smoke this out a little bit.
- Oh god, you're smoking something out?
What is there to smoke out?
- [Angelica] Mine wasn't open!
Oh, there we go.
- Okay, we're going through
some red today, or pinkish red.
- I'm here for it.
(cries)
- It's a bumpy ride today.
- Overlining lips is a thing.
Kylie made it happen, and I'm
gonna make it happen today.
- We're just gonna apply this directly on.
Okay, maybe that's not the best idea,
but we're gonna figure this out.
- There, now it's art.
I added dots.
- I look just glowy enough,
maybe they'll be blinded
by the rest of my face.
- Can we stop?
Please?
I'm gonna be that kid in class
that wears their sunglasses.
- I think I did all right.
I think my lips are gonna
be the best in this.
The eyeliner was a little okay,
but the bumpiness
definitely was an issue here
but I think I'm looking pretty good.
If I was a teacher and I
graded myself on this look,
I'd give me a B minus.
- I feel super confident about my look,
I feel like my foundation is really even.
I got my highlight where I need it to be.
The only thing that I feel
like I could've done better on
is my brows, they're a
little bit less, like solid,
that they are right now.
They're a little bit
more like ombre brows.
On a grading scale of my face,
I would give myself an A minus.
- This went exactly
how I thought it would.
- [Jazzmyne] You look great!
- I would have a lot of
trouble with the eyeliner.
(laughs)
B minus?
- I'd give you an A minus.
- You know that kid that like,
knows that they have a test
but they were fucking around
too much to study for it?
That's what I am today, and
I just kind of showed up
and wrote my name down.
I'd give myself maybe like a D plus,
you're still passing, but you
know you should've studied.
You know, I feel like as
an adult, you just give up
sometimes when people tell you things.
And you're just like &amp;quot;mm.&amp;quot;
- [Angelica] You have less time left.
- Yeah, exactly.
I don't need to waste it on doing cateyes.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
