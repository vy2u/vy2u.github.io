nothing more than to punch a kid right
in the face and laugh I'm a kindergarten
teacher I like to predict the future of
my students based on their looks and how
they behave as a teacher I often play
matchmaker for my students when I assign
them partners for projects I'm a teacher
and I grade harsher when I don't like
the student I'm a high school teacher
and I wish I could tell my students have
done their Bain seriously I don't know
what they're going to do in life as the
teacher I find it hard to be nice to the
popular girls because I hated them when
I was at school I'm currently drinking a
mixed drink out of a coffee mug at work
I'm a teacher
it pisses me off at the rich kids I
teach will easily surpass me in the
future I'm a teacher and I smoke weed
every day those damn kids stress me out
I'm a teacher and I can't stand my
students all they do is talk badly about
each other I'm a teacher who also
happens to run a pawn blog I'm a teacher
and I hate it when my students tell me
about their lives because I honestly
don't care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
