archives of sexual behavior Millennials
are more tolerant of premarital sex
back in the 1970s only 29% of Americans
found favor with the statement that
premarital sex was not wrong at all
today 55 percent of Americans believe
you have to test-drive the car before
you drive it forever
that same study found that baby boomers
born in the 1950s at an average of
eleven point six eight sexual partners
while Millennials have an average of
eight point two six probably cuz of all
the key parties in the 70s but that's
just this narrators hypothesis while
Millennials reported fewer partners they
are having more casual sex forty five
percent have reported having sex with
someone who isn't a significant other
while only thirty five percent of those
born in the 60s reported the same at
that age time is why bright some might
argue that Millennials are scared of
commitment according to an analysis of
census data by the Pew Research Center
in 1960 fifty nine percent of adults
ages 18 to 29 were married compared to
today we're only 20 percent of adults
ages 18 to 29 are married but that
doesn't mean they don't want to get
married 1 2013 Gallup poll found that 56
percent of unmarried 18 to 34 year olds
reported that they do want to get
married eventually just after they pay
off their student loans oh sure
Millennials have more sex and wait
longer to get married so what about teen
pregnancy the CDC reported in 2010 that
the u.s. teen birth rate is lower than
it has been in 70 years reported 34.3
births per 1000 women aged 15 to 19 in
1960 it was 89.1 births per 1000 women
overall Millennials are more open and
tolerant in regards to same-sex marriage
acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex
marriage among young people went from 21
percent in 1960 to 56 percent in 2010 so
pat yourself on the back Millennials
you're nailing it safely
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
