co-workers anonymously and we're going
to try and help solve their sex problem
what do you do if you want to have anal
with your girlfriend and she isn't
taking you seriously I think you need to
make it really clear to her that this is
a serious request for you
she might be laughing it off just
because she's nervous or she's not sure
if you're actually being serious so talk
to her and let her know that this is
genuinely an interest that you have
what's a good way to start that
conversation I want to have anal sex
should you do that killeth oh you're
doing lines a it definitely giggling
always felts when it comes to anal sex
this one definitely from someone in the
LA office is it unhealthy to sleep with
a celebrity if you are not famous
a whole thing that celebrity has a
sexually transmitted infection so this
person writes we've been trying to get
pregnant for a while and it's taking the
sexy out of sex how do we bring sexy
back I think the most important thing
when you're trying to get pregnant is to
not make all of the sex that you're
having entirely goal oriented because it
really does suck all the fun out of it
so even though you might have specific
schedules of when you're supposed to be
having sex and what are the most optimal
times for that try to also leave some
room in your sex life we're just having
sex that's not the purpose of trying to
get pregnant this one I love My partner
and I are pretty into group sex is that
bad for our relationship no not at all
if you guys have talked about what your
boundaries are and you're both willing
participants go for it what percent of
gay men do you think are actually into
anal 5 that's a good question I don't
have any specific numbers on that one
but definitely not every gay man how do
you slow down your libido when you are
not having sex you can't really slow
down your libido I mean you can try to
do things to get yourself stressed out
or develop a health problem but I don't
think you really want to do any of those
things
it's great to have a high libido when
you're single so take care of yourself
masturbate find a couple of different
sex toys to play with there's no need to
try to slow down your libido
am i a sex addict probably not there's
conflicting evidence about whether or
not sex addiction actually exists are
there any like numbers like if you're
having sex 50 times a week are you a sex
addict there aren't any specific numbers
it really boils down to is your desire
for sex getting in the way of your
day-to-day life so if you're able to
hold up your job and have social
connections and you know have some alone
time you're probably doing okay is it
necessary for foreskin to pull back
behind the head of the penis for it to
pull back on its own or for you to pull
it back I don't know there's no pronoun
it's not necessary it'll probably feel
better for a lot of men because
uncircumcised men the heads of their
penis aren't exposed on a day-to-day
basis like circumcised men are so when
they do pull that foreskin back or it
comes you know comes back on its own and
it's gonna feel a lot more sensitive
there all right person with a really
specific question that one was for you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
