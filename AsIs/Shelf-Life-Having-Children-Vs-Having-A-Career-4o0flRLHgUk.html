grid for the rest of the day I have to

sure it'll be horrible

my purse what's the emergency I was this
close to getting financial backing from
some bigwig at my table is in the family
event exactly I need to find a way to
make it worthwhile is she really oh yes
when did you become the sadist in the
family are you okay did someone hurt you
think about it why would our lovely
sister be puking her guts now the raw
bar late onset bulimia tell her please
tell me what what you already know the
sex are you over five months pregnant no
I'm fine weeks pregnant Cassie just
pulled the daughter part over ass look
sometimes it's important to vocalize
what you want Scott is the love of my
life but I so wish I could dress him in
little skirts and braid his hair I have
not entirely sure that you don't do that
well Justin's at work it's harmless he's
barely forming memories can we go back a
few steps is it too late to have an
abortion
Stacy she's not getting an abortion
every one of her Monday Veronica you're
getting an abortion
of course she's getting an abortion she
hasn't made the portfolio man she never
made portfolio manager yet but she's 32
years old it's now or never
portfolios don't just dry up at 35 have
you ever heard of adoption or abstinence
from motherhood why would she adopt when
she's perfectly capable of delivering a
healthy baby Natalie in eight months you
already named her fetus am I the only
woman in the world who doesn't
romanticize an infant ripping my inner
heart would you just calm down please
okay this isn't like a life or death
how does anyone survive that they don't
they turn into pod people who only care
about sleep schedules and organic
formula hey I never asked you to
understand Scott sleep schedule I just
asked you to respect it is so they don't
you breathe can we please just not treat
this like it's some huge deal because
people get pregnant every day right
there's a person growing inside don't
touch me hold that moment of conception
 Cassie trust me right now
there's nothing more than a couple of
cells scrambling around your uterine
wall this doesn't have to be anything
more than a minor slip-up with some guy
who doesn't know how to use condoms Bert
okay guy mark and I are moving in
together
what German give up your apartment
you'll lose all sense of self okay so
you know what no he doesn't know I told
Manowar Colin left him on the dance
floor with bridesmaids he just he
doesn't deal well with vomit in the
major life decisions you have to tell
her what yeah I don't have to tell why
what am I gonna say to him oh hey Mark I
thought to talk to you about something
you guys look up too much no one looks
great hmm what look are you going for it
ha why do we have to tell him why I
don't want to have a kid huh I mean I do
someday but I can't I can't have a kid
right now listen you don't have to let
him have an impact on your decision but
he should know what's happening you
won't be able to maintain a healthy
relationship without honesty and
firmness okay not everyone is an island
some people actually want a family and
human connection to share over a
well-balanced meal
eh I interact with more adults in one
day than you do in a week standing next
to someone in a laboratory fiddling with
metal bits does not count as true human
interactions the metal bit mean to you
Cassie I'm so curious where are you
going you going back out to the party
sorry okay it's your body it's your life
it's your career it's that simple
why do you always assume that as soon as
woman as a kid she can have a job mom
worked mom was a teacher so it's not the
same Veronica works long hours she's on
call 24 hours a day mom got a
three-month vacation every year you
can't have the kind of jobs we have and
make it home in time for dinner I don't
know if that's true I mean many of the
partners that my work have kids they
must make it work right I mean we're not
saving lives like you cochlear implants
don't save lives can you guys please
just help me Monica you're beautiful
and smart you have to make this decision
yourself

something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
