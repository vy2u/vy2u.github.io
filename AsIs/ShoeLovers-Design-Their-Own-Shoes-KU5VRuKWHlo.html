like opening things and scared oh yeah
today we're gonna take some old sneakers
and make them cool again give them back
some life
I love sneakers I probably wear them at
least 75% of my week I've never had a
pair of shoes of mine customized
specifically what I want I'm a little
nervous but I think they wanted really
cool alright I'm excited and let's go
customize these shoes hey what's up guys
my name is Mike you guys are in be
wiring custom started designing shoes by
just being part of the 90s sneaker
culture we start off the store of being
just a total customizing store jackets
another apparel but we specialize in
shoes doing celebrities like Madonna and
Tom Cruise and a lot of Elton John shoes
who's been your own favorite client to
work with I'd like to work in with Tom
Cruise it is 16 pairs of shoes friend a
lot of shoes yeah I'm excited this is
gonna be dope yeah okay
check out the shoes I brought these air
maxes all white that light up purple
when I walk perforated leather and he's
a real customizable add a lot of color
to it
I like color I'm into letting artists do
whatever the hell they want to do
listening well take a look at some
options yeah ass whores that we've done
and maybe that can inspire you to get
creative since they light up I'm super
into like the 90s vibe it doesn't have
to be the same either Oh each shoe yeah
oh very cool I kind of actually like
that you know what you're the first
customer that has said that all right
well you run wild honey all right
Christians take a look at yours
I brought these shadow ones ones of my
favorite Jordan these kind of beat-up so
I felt like let's give them a new life
some of the things I'm into right now
kind of like the supreme Elvie collab I
too don't think that they have to be the
same you can do whatever kind of street
wear street fashion things that you
yes I supreme meets BBC yeah the other
hike do you see me dope my loafer
yeah okay got you so about how long
would this take before we get the shoes
way to be dedicated maybe three or four
days so I would say about a week and a
half every two weeks for both fair okay
I'm really excited that my shoes are
gonna be cuter than yours let me fire
the other cool today is the day we get
our shoes and I'm so excited / nervous
feel a little nervous
I've never had anything customized
specifically for me I am hoping that
I'll like them I'm pretty open to a lot
of style so I feel like it would be hard
for me not to like them that's you Oh
beautiful bugs oh this box is pretty all
right let's do it
oh these little fire I can
see like the the vape in there the
supreme on there the laces are a nice
color now these are awesome like I
definitely can wear these just came out
way better than I expected it
this is really dope these these are
 dope
holy with the little prince and you
know what he said at first that he was
thinking about doing tiger stripes and I
wasn't even down for tiger stripes I was
like whatever I won't say anything
and now it's cheetah print and I love
cheetah print there's not one part that
I'm looking at right now that I hate I
was like kind of scared because I do
love the shoes that I gave him and I
still wear them a lot that's really
fired I don't think people realize that
you can like take old things and make
them new it's always just like what's
the freshest type of sneaker this is a
dream no one will own these sneakers
except for me yeah I think if you have
some sneakers that are like dead and you
