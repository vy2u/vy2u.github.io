rapist and doesn't need sexual consent
class a university student who wrote an
article claiming he didn't need to
attend a consent class because he didn't
have to be taught to not be a rapist and
he's holding a sign that says this is
not what a rapist looks like you can't
say somebody looks whether they look
like a rapist about cuz a lot of people
don't look like serial killers but they
kill people anyone can be a rapist I
think everyone should take that class I
think he's right I think people make
choices and you choose to be a rapist
you're not taught to be a rapist you
need to be you don't need to be taught
how not to be a rapist I think it would
be bad for it maybe have like an
assembly to like where they kind of go
over like what's the rules that was out
of bounds it was not I mean even at my
job we had to have sexual harassment
class especially if you're in a
vulnerable situation if you drank too
much or whatever how to talk about if
you're okay with having sex or not
having a having sex you shouldn't be
defensive if you know if there's
obviously a problem that's happening
maybe one solution would be everyone
should take a consent class and know
what it means to say no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
