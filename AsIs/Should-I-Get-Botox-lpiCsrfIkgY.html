pretty I don't like the idea of plastic
surgery I think that it would help
Gordon go after any girls has like any
surgery takes longer to park and drive
into Beverly Hills than to get Botox
there's more to life than wrinkles and
maybe it's time I'm a rose sir no I'm a
comedian and a writer and I'm 33 years
old which I know for BuzzFeed is like
she's too old what is she doing in front
of the camera she should be dead by now
I got my very first wrinkles these two
little lines right here like a year ago
I just woke up one day I look the
mirrors wash my face and I was like what
no no way and it really freaked me out I
kept like spreading my eyebrows apart
just hoping that it wouldn't come back
of course it did that's what wrinkle is
and the first thing I thought was should
I get Botox I think the weird thing
about wrinkles and the weird thing about
being your 30s in general is clearly
being in your 30s you're still young you
still be super attractive but when you
find a wrinkle on your face it kind of
is the first time you feel a little bit
old at least I did I was like oh I'm not
like young anymore looking old in any
way I feel like and this like
youth-obsessed culture is considered
somewhat of like failure made me feel
way less attractive like no matter what
else I looked like it's like all I could
see and I've never really been that
focused on my looks before I'm 6 feet
tall I'm super skinny and I have a big
nose and I've been that way since I was
little so I never fit in or looked
normal I was teased a lot growing up I
was never like a popular girl but I
didn't care because I really liked
myself and I was cool and I was smart
and I played music and I wrote poetry
so my self-esteem and self-confidence
never came from my looks and that's why
I was feeling so conflicted about my
wrinkles is because I'm a feminist and
the people that I look up to are cool
smart intelligent women and
intellectuals and they don't give a
about the way they look but you can't
help it like I do care about the way I
look and I want to feel and look
attractive I want to feel and look my
best and that's why it's been so such a
conflict for me so what we're gonna do
is first we're gonna hit the streets and
ask regular LA citizens what they think
about my face and then I'm going to have
a consultation with a plastic surgeon
and explore that age old female
conundrum whether or not I should get
Botox let's hit the streets and find out
what's wrong with my face how old do you
think I am
and answer honestly you don't have to
worry about my feelings or anything hmm
maybe 38 perhaps nice I say 24 Oh
Courtney 37 36 35 33 but that's it okay
28 or 29 thank you 33 keeping it fresh a
little bit but also a little bit not and
that's what we're here to talk about do
you notice my wrinkles ah lip fit do you
think that I should get Botox no I don't
believe in that kind of thing
we're just meant to be like the universe
made us no and why not because it
doesn't last long enough you'd spend
fortune just trying to redo it and screw
it I think you should go on that trail
you're beautiful as is you might just
want to stop frowning so deeply when you
express yourself it's a big part of my
personality you will really regret and
like ten years from now why would I
regret it later because your face gonna
be like so different Botox stops you
from expressing your face and so much of
what is attractive in a person is how
they express themselves there's plenty
of actors and actresses that are like
just embrace that sort of like look of
the old age and who Judi Dench are you
attracted to Judi Dench hmm
people were incredibly nice and kind
most people were like no don't do it and
then a couple people were like yeah you
should definitely do it I think as long
as you're paying enough money to have
Botox and you don't it doesn't become a
disaster I think that's okay do you
think it's a good idea I don't think
it's a bad idea absolutely there's
anything that you want to fix on
yourself like why not fix it if I got
Botox then how old would I look 21
uh-oh I mind me vote ah I think a little
Botox here and there is probably one of
the least excessive way of taking care
of your skin and get to start early so
have you ever had Botox I have I'm part
of the club I may join we talked to a
woman who had had Botox and then she
couldn't do it for a year because she
was pregnant and she just had lines on
her face again so I guess Botox also
kind of feels like very existential it's
like Sisyphus tea and it's like moving
the rock of Aging up the hill just for
it to roll down again it just seems kind
of crazy to do something that's always
gonna go back how old were you when you
started doing what is it call dice for
Botox is the same family but I'm 25 but
you're not even 30 why do you get it
preventive my destiny has no wrinkles in
it I went through the same thing this
year I got some deep creases on my
forehead and I want Botox so I'm
thinking about it for Christmas inside I
feel good I don't feel like I'm old I
just don't like how my appearance is
changing to look old do you think you
would get Botox if you had wrinkles yes
probably I wouldn't be opposed to it I
mean youth is valued right yes I would
yes absolutely I do think that there's a
lot more scrutiny applied to women than
men when we age you never know I may
need a little touch-up at some point do
you think that you can still be like a
feminist and get plastic surgery oh my
god yes I hate that I don't think so
isn't that kind of weird
oh absolutely I don't think one negates
the other we're all a big massive
conflict anyway probably not because
feminism to me is all about you have to
love yourself and be comfortable in your
own body why should you kind of conform
to society's expectations that you need
to look a certain way I think if you
want to just make yourself beautified
why not I can still be a feminist girl
power
the man on the street was interesting
people were incredibly kind really open
really shared the young room in their
20s with perfectly smooth skin and no
wrinkles and no gray hairs we're like
don't get Botox that's crazy girl beat
you and as much as I love the girl power
opinion it's like you don't have any
experience yet so call me in 10 years
when you have wrinkles and then we'll
talk the older women were the ones who
are like listen sister been down that
road
the trenches now I'm a little more
conflicted because I do want to look
natural and like myself but I also want
to look bangin so we're heading to
Beverly Hills to talk to a plastic
surgeon and see what she has to say
about my wrinkles my name is dr. Linda
Lee and I'm a board-certified plastic
surgeon I have an incredibly busy Botox
practice and I see up to 20 to 30
patients a day for Botox alone so I
understand that you're interested in
some facial rejuvenation as we're
getting a little older I like he said we
that it's not just me I completely
empathize with rose and her concerns
about the way she's aging we all need a
little help we can't stop it from from
time passing but we can slow it down a
little bit when I was 31 years old I
began to notice the two little lines in
between my brows I started botoxing and
now this is me super angry I wasn't sure
about Botox to be honest I have like
trepidation I think one of my botox
fears is like I don't want to look weird
or shiny I don't want people to know
Rose is very typical in terms of her
concerns about Botox we see so many
celebrities who have been over botoxed
and they look like they have Botox in
their faces do you think I would look
younger I think would look less worried
that's my whole personality you would
look less for Jewish yeah it's still
absolutely Jewish it's an interesting
point the wrinkles that I have the
Elevens as she called them those are
wrinkles from worrying even when I'm
totally relaxed I still have them and it
looks like I'm maybe angry do you think
I should get Botox it's all about you we
can do it in a manner that allows you to
still look natural to have natural some
natural facial expression but not to the
extent where we are constantly frowning
not like yes don't do any of that no you
look great okay now what lifting our
brows and I always smile do you think
you can be a feminist and still get
plastic surgery I think the reason why
women do things like dye our hair wear
cosmetics do Botox is because we enjoy
looking
and if I want to feel good about Who I
am and if part of that is looking good
then more power to me can you tell me if
I did decide to go forward what the
procedure would be it literally takes us
30 seconds to inject you with five
little injections in between your brows
for your forehead it would be eight
little injections for your crow's feet I
do three on each side dr. Lee thank you
so much for talking to us I'm gonna have
to think about my four headed but I'm
not gonna scrunch my face well I think
and I really appreciate it absolutely my
pleasure so that concludes our Botox
adventure the question remains
should I get Botox drumroll please the
answer is no I am deciding to not get
Botox right now the truth is being in
that plastic surgeon's office kind of
felt a little off to me that just felt
like what am I doing here like all the
women that were there were much older
than I was
I think 33 is still young and I think
that I have my whole life to freak out
about my looks and I think I'm gonna
postpone that for another 20 years you
know I don't look young but I think I
like like me and that's what I want to
look like I think what the wrinkles and
the gray hair means is I need to step up
and be a real adult because my body is
telling you that I physically am one
with each new wrinkle I get I think it's
just gonna be hopefully like less
devastation over my looks being gone and
more just a little bit of a morning for
like a certain chapter of my life that's
closing this whole experience has just
left me feeling really empowered and I
think the reason why is the only reason
why anyone gets any plastic surgery is
to feel better about themselves and I'm
so excited about things that have
nothing to do with my looks like my
career and my friendships and my life I
think know what makes me feel most
attractive is when I'm happy and doing
things that I'm proud of and that I like
oh yeah I guess it's like one day I'll
have a zit on my face one day I'll have
a wrinkle whatever if I'm doing what I
love then I think I'm gonna feel bangin
this is my impression of a woman our 20s
I'm so young and free and everybody
likes me I'm the perfect age this is a
woman in her 30s I'm classy and fabulous
and I know myself better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
