them yikes
best way I tell someone that you're not
interested in them I don't think there's
ever easy way I don't like hurting
people's feelings it's weird when you're
like still too early in the relationship
we're like you can't break up because
you're not a thing yet you're not gonna
like ask them out to say you're not
interested it's either gonna go radio
silence I think most people today just
like stop responding to text messages
because if they don't contact you then
you're in the clear
I'm kind of used to like this this slow
fizzle out like the fadeaway where like
the conversation trickles to an end
hey was great hanging pretty busy
studying you have all these plans that
are coming up take it the hint oh we've
got time for like confusing nuanced
phrasings just tell me look I just want
to be friends I think you're an amazing
person
be honest and get all your feelings are
on the table I've always preferred your
straight-up honesty don't drag it out
and drop subtle hints I won't take it
first are you wasting my time
cuz I need to know right now I just need
that like concrete just tell me exactly
how you feel
but I think just straight-up ignoring
someone is the rudest to ignore a text
message you're dead to me
now question am I the type of person who
will then come out and say if I'm not
interested in the woman no I'm too much
of a coward I'll probably avoid you and
hurt your feelings sometimes it's easier
just not responding it's such a dick
move and then I'm just like oh I'm being
a hypocrite you're just panicking in the
yang you like if I don't talk to them
maybe they'll get the point and I feed
it on somebody like literally a week ago
I get actually a week ago I hate it but
I do it confrontation is hard when
people don't reply I'm like I don't I
don't care I know what I'm bringing to
the table I'm bringing the table you
know I enjoyed my life before you and
I'll enjoy it after you so that's not
that doesn't go to say that it's not so
not like huh why but then I have to like
Pat myself I feel like pet talk and be
like oh no we are independent we don't
need these people
I think maybe my ex-boyfriend my ex ex
boyfriend at one point he started
ignoring me but then I ignored him for
like
you're straight so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
