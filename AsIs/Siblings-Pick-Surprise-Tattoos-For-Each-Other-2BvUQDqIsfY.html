oh my gosh so the only reason I've never
gotten a tattoo is that I've never known
what to get myself problem solved just
take that out of the equation I picked
something for you everyone wins
unless it's awful we're here at Body
Electric tattoo we are siblings us only
19 oh you have lipstick on you said we
have chosen tattoos for each other we
have not told the other person what they
are and we won't know until it is on our
bodies forever and ever
we've worked very hard to have it be a
wonderful supportive relationship and it
could all just go to hell after this how
can we lose it's gonna be great I think
I trust you we spent a lot of time our
childhood in Colorado so there's like a
range of mountains the twin sister Peaks
I drew the mountain do you want me to
eat you all the trees so they look a
little when I make it better yeah yeah
simple geometric design and combine it
with this flower that is from a picture
from the front of our old childhood home
can be done oh great
because I don't have a backup my sister
my brother and I we all live in
different parts of the world she lives
in London we have this unique family
connection we call for whatever isn't a
flavour wavelength I know it sounds
pretty ridiculous it's like our own
family's frequency that only we have so
the word flavor and having it just kind
of subtly transitioned into like a
heartbeat a lot of people hadn't
believed that the full moon definitely
has a real impact on the world around us
he's a pretty big believer in this and
never I see a big moon in the sky
immediately text him and he gets really
excited it's like he's sending me good
vibes from wherever he is you know kind
of like a misty dark background so you
can see that it's a full moon and then a
little bit of like an abstract feel to
it I'm really excited about I think it's
gonna look sweet
I am about to get my first tattoo what
am i doing brought you ready to rock
okay let's get do it
you know when you pick someone a gift
and you're worried if it's going to be
like what they want I can't return this
and I feels like a single cat me out
like digging into you this hurts a lot
worse than I anticipated I know it hurts
we all know who the tougher sister is
regardless of what it is it'll always
make me think of you
that was quick it's a cartoon penis
isn't it so excited just a Soaker I have
no idea what was just permanently drawn
onto my body if I don't like it can I
have that scarf I really like of yours I
really want to look at my art whenever
you're ready just take a look at it oh
my god it's so cool it's gonna be there
a long time for a really long time okay
here we go oh my god no way this is so
bad this is so perfect
how do you like it yes no it's amazing
I'm so happy
whew it's a magnolia from our magnolia
tree in front of the house that's really
beautiful I thought it was really cool
that we chose different places that have
to do with their childhood to one
oh my god Wow yeah the moon is my
favorite thing in the world
sheilo is text me when there's a full
moon it's just like another extension of
the flavor wavelength yes is awesome
then it's perfect everything about this
is amazing it's my style with this
it complements the touches I already
have so solid first piece of ink on your
body yeah I'm ready to get it full
sleeve now I'm so happy that you love it
when I'm really mad at you Mitch carve
it out now when you're in London you'll
always be able to look down and just
remember your brother when are we gonna
tell mom
