is not actually hate to taste food I
thought it was a good opportunity since
you were in town to tell you something
special that I normally wouldn't get to
tell you to your plates we're not
actually here to taste cookie butter I
just wanted to tell you that I love you
I love you
it looks obviously I love you oh you're
my brother and I love you I love you we
go here we go
we used to fight a lot during high
school in college but now we actually
are very very close and so that was a
sweet thing to hear I got to tell her I
loved her to her face which I normally
don't get to do cuz she lives in Chicago
usually and I love you between us would
be maybe I buy them lunch that we live
with each other so we're like five and a
half feet away from each other all the
time so that's why we don't always say I
love you we say like I hate you and
that's our way of saying I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
