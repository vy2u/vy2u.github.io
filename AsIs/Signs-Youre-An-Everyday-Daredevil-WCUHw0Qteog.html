buildings but let's not pretend you
don't take risks you are an everyday
daredevil you sometimes forget to set an
alarm but you wake up anyway
you brush your teeth and then drink
orange juice you drive on an empty tank
of gas while other men live their lives
as society dictates you start puzzles
from the center when you drop ice you
kick it under the fridge you maverick
you skip tutorials you eat after 9:00
p.m. and you check your Facebook during
work for the thrill you get in the front
seat of taxis and cook chicken that's
been in the fridge for four days all of
your passwords are the same you
risk-taker and they don't contain
numbers and letters you wear white and
eat spaghetti
you are the volunteer and you ask for
the recommendation when something needs
to be thrown away you toss it like
Jordan in the fourth quarter
you don't let a blinking hand tell you
when to stop
electrical plugs from the cord you'll
open that without even tapping the top
you don't inject you won't spill and
you'll do all those groceries in one
trip you guess it man Daniel and when
you have a crush at work you always uh I
was wondering if um maybe you want to go
over to the the conference room we have
a meeting and oh yeah okay okay great
huh
okay bye you'll get him next time
daredevil Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
