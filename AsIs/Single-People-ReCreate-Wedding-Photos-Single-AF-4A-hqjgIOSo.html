taking wedding photos thank you for the
reminder that I'm very far away from
that
wedding photos always kind of look
awkward I have zero emotional connection
to wedding photography I mean for some
reason people are always standing in
like tall grass and their wedding photos
the process for getting the photos done
I think is too long and over drawn out
usually a pretty cliche pretty try it's
good to have photos you want to get like
blacked out drunk at your wedding so
it's good for someone to be documenting
go to the train tracks and your holds
hands and you say how happy you are even
though there's a train about to barrel
towards you and ruin your life I can
laugh myself a little bit and not have
to have another person to complete the
perfect picture hi I'm Courtney Lindberg
and I'm a photographer anytime that you
go on the internet and you type in
wedding photos there's gonna be some top
poses and styles today I'm taking a
wedding photo with something that I
truly love cake I'm gonna be doing the
photo where the groom is holding the
bride except I'll be holding a dog so
today I'm gonna be recreating a photo of
a girl holding bouquet but I'm gonna be
holding wine I don't know what the pose
is called but it looks like she's
falling she's just so in love that it
just knocks her off her feet the bride
looking down at her flowers
I couldn't say anything about this I
think it will be interesting perspective
to switch all of these traditional
wedding poses and place them on a single
person we're gonna have a lot of fun so
let's set up the shot a little bit I'm
gonna have you actually lay down on the
ground you go mine this is really
uncomfortable
Oh what happens if a bride doesn't shave
like her armpits is that bad how are you
feeling oh I'm gonna eat this chicken
yeah baby get it
Oh gorgeous really put me to shame here
dude good peg is way better it's been a
person all right let's see how we did
Wow check you out it looks like my bar
mitzva it's a moment of pure
unadulterated bliss holy crap
whoa look at that beauty I actually look
really cool if I hung this up in my
house people would be like you're
obsessing yourself okay yeah I know
that's why I'm single
feel like I've made that emotional jump
and I'm I'm ready to take it all the way
quit the chicken I would probably put it
somewhere in my apartment far as
actually holding my bridal day I get
married probably not something I will do
a lot of single people should just get
in front of the camera don't feel bad
just because you're in a photo by
yourself makes for great tinder profile
photos that was actually really fun I'm
now very excited to get married
in case I don't get married in case that
never happens it's nice to just have a
nice picture of myself that I can laugh
at and appreciate give it a try when you
do get married if you're going to get
married if not I would say just give it
a try anyway part of being single is
looking for someone to share your life
with but also I think part of being
single is learning how to be happy with
yourself this makes me happy and I'm
glad that I got to celebrate that
happiness today I do I do expect and
hope that someday I will do this with a
person with a pulse they're gonna have a
tough act to follow it's pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
