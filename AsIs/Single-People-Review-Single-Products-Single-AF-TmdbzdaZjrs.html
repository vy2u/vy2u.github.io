on wait I like being single I just don't
understand why will single people need a
certain type of product like why single
me out for the wet fun there no no I
feel like this is gonna remind me of
like how single I am grow a boyfriend
not pretend when you grow the perfect
friend this is basically a shading gift
like hey do since night and mosquitoes
will bite you
here you go it's so funny because I
actually bought my dad one of these but
I do like the concept at this point
especially being in the dating scene out
here I probably would have better luck
trying to grow a boyfriend Oh Stu sixth
time its original size go for her in and
let's see oh I think she's gonna grow up
side with these are the things that man
has to go through it's okay go I think
this is like this is definitely a cute
gift that I would buy like one of my
best friends the thing that I love about
being in a relationship is cuddling oh I
know a lot of single people and I've
never seen this this is so awkward
I feel like for how much it is it is
worth getting a whole pillow how dare
you give me half a pillow at a whole
pillow price I'll be honest she'll never
cut it with this oh my gosh I'm so gonna
buy this like it can't cuddle me back
you know and that's the best part it's
just having like a nice arm gripping
around you what this was like something
from the puzzle place I try and like get
up on this on the table would do it I
was in the Navy again like I would be
like you know what this has been nine
months hell no I wouldn't use this look
at this am I gonna go out and buy this
tomorrow
no but if someone gave it to me would I
be mad probably not
if you're lonely you go outside you get
a dog
you get a fish you don't get this wait
what oh it's a phone case
oh no I also find it really disturbing
that it's only in women's hands and
child hand sizes there's some people you
just don't give this to okay
I don't know connect to people over
FaceTime let alone holding a rubber
hands it will never get to the point
where I need the mold of a fake hand
yeah I'm not with it it's creepy whoever
has this on their phone Yubel has to
borrow their phone that's all I'm saying
I'm single series happening is only
neither part that exists it's true cuz
I'm a serious dude I mean I don't wanna
play no games you know me
definitely not probably not clothing
like this hurts my heart and people that
wear it like if somebody were to wear
this in public they're bold as hell this
is too much hella extra I think if
anything it would keep people away from
you if somebody got this for me I again
would be like just give me the money
that you want to waste like I could take
myself out to eat
my favorite product was definitely the
arm pillow and I think if they should
have like a really cool shirt ooh the
other hairy arms I might like it anymore
these products are kind of a little
annoying because it makes it seem like
when you are single all you're thinking
about is trying to get into a
relationship
I think people misunderstand basing for
me and when you're single you have to
really enjoy being single and really be
there for yourself boom that was the
best fish Steve Harvey and gosh on
that my girlfriend what's up boo put you
up to mummy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
