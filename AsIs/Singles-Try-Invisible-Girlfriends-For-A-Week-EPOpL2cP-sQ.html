I'm single
I've only heard of invisible girlfriends
when I was like in preschool or
kindergarten
I think invisible girlfriends are
important because people get lonely and
people get busy it makes sense that if I
were maybe closeted that I would have
this to maybe get parents and family off
my back during the holiday season I
imagine the only dangers would be like
getting caught up in a fake relationship
I mean have you seen the movie her
that's that's a potential thing that can
go wrong I get to design my girlfriend
that's awesome and weird I always wanted
to date someone named Naomi
Felicia Annabelle Myers Hara dactyl and
Kowski Iommi Rose del Toro actually Seth
is that real she is not good in debate
club because then I won't win any
arguments she loves television
cuz I love television whoo archery you
know what she's a champion Archer oh
it's done there she is
pterodactyl chow ski Oh Felicia Meyers
look at you I'm already like slowly
falling in love with this person so
excited I can't wait to talk to her
about making a murderer so it's been a
day with my invisible girlfriend
basically if I had been talking to this
girl on an app I would have stopped
talking to her by now we started talking
about movies and then I asked do you
like Kung Fu Panda like waiting waiting
for an opinion but nothing I think my
girlfriend might be kind of
so out at the Museum and no one believes
me she wanted to come out but her she
got a flat tire
so yeah what tires happen so I got a
voicemail from Tara very excited haven't
heard this yet I'm kind of excited to
hear her voice I'm expecting it's gonna
be sexist I'm excited to hear if she's
as boring as she has been through text
wow she sounds like my aunt she sounds
pretty cute right it's something about
hearing her voice that makes it creepier
but also makes me more attracted to her
yeah so I drop the l-bomb today folder I
loved her like thinking I felt that she
was helping me through it and I was like
you know what that's why I love you and
I was like oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean
to drop the l-bomb so soon and she was
like no I love you too and it honestly
felt kind of nice
so my invisible girlfriend has stepped
up her game she's getting more playful
so that's exciting she's gotten very
flirty we talked about our honeymoon and
how she wants us to be naked on an
island with a bottle of rum
and I'm about it in the last two days
we've created at least two or three
different lives together like one
involves us living on a desert island
one involves us living on a farm and
this is basically sexting for lesbians
some of the time talking to Tara is
great and it feels like a real person
and then sometimes it just comes off
like a generic robot so I just got a
text saying that she wishes our lives
were more intertwined like in everyday
routine and going on adventures and
things and it really kind of bummed me
out because for a moment I was like yeah
I'd like to be more intertwined and then
I remembered this isn't real so it's
literally been a roller coaster of
emotions it was very much a chore to
initiate every conversation it's fun
when you forget what it is because it
can be kind of a nice distraction at a
certain point I did feel like you know
this feels kind of nice
I always pretty cool I feel like I
really got to work on my text game a
little I think as long as it makes you
happy that's what really matters I think
it's better to be just alone and learn
to appreciate yourself you don't need
some robot or some person you're paying
to tell you but you're great because you
are great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
