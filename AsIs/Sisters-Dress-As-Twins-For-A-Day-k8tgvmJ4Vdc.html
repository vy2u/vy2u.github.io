so we're sisters definitely not twins
I've always kind of been fascinated by
twins just the idea that there's two
people that are like so incredibly
similar and they usually really really
really close yeah there was always some
mystique around I think they're very
interesting so throughout our lives
we've been called friends sisters and
twins quite a people and so I am curious
to see that if we dress completely the
same whether people are gonna start
thinking were twins
I think they'll think we're doing some
kind of schtick all right well I guess
that's go find an outfit that we can
agree on so we have some of the same
clothes that we're going to try and put
into the outfit but we also have to go
shopping do you like this so does this
look like a robe like a middle-aged
ladies natella bar this is proving
Democrat
really faggy so we need to find
stockings fairly unique looking so that
it's obvious that we're like matching
because if we're just gonna wear like a
pair jeans and a black top that's not
very exciting
oh yeah there's two it looks like
they're showing me I feel like between
them I feel like those are the last I am
inviting cracks you're gonna look pretty
much like hipster twins not just twins
the lady at the checkout is like
swimming but anything else our phrase
but yes we are
I felt like an idiot just buying all the
same stuff it's like you show yourself
our personalities it's just like here's
a woman and there's another woman it's
the same the reason that we have these
shoes on oh yes we didn't have anything
other ones that match considering never
miss a good at fashion particular I feel
like we pulled an outfit together that
we didn't need to spend much money on
yeah so now we look the same outfit wise
do you think we look more the same face
wise I think we found the same so I
think people would maybe believe we're
paternal twins
you people get repro enough by the fact
that we're different color hair and I
didn't want to have like a cheap wig
that's just gonna look crazy let's see
we'll think of this these videos the
seeing it is like just awful
we accidentally have a sensible yeah
it's great for this video we're very
aware of sun damage we're like we're
handsome glasses the better way right
yes that's exactly it
so we've come to see our friend that
works at a bar and just surprised her
she doesn't know what's going on just
even kids to imagine if I wasn't really
close friends with you guys definitely
you would find them similar with the
accent of course and not knowing you as
well you don't really see the
differences much you guys do have
similar looks especially in the eyes so
that might be tomato when sisters that
you're definitely related uniform yeah
it could be a arm like a bar you're
never on the street and I'm very
embarrassed oh and I think you think so
much thank you people keep treating us
like tourists maybe turn crimson tears
just come to LA and dress like twins
alright the winds cool pinky no first a
woman's it adorable and I was like
Jordan in a video no no I'm like oh no I
was in fasting let my hat blew off we're
in another bar and honestly we're
feeling just a little bit wait well this
one's looking ass down the street it was
a lot our own fault
we're in the dumpers who cost I was in
these outfits you're definitely not
tourists
you have very different noses it's
almost like you guys are like
bridesmaids as ice come back I'm looking
at the eyes her eyes there's a little
bit higher than yours so I'm like maybe
they're not sisters my person initial
reaction I've been coming from a wedding
and then my second reaction I'm like I'm
seeing blonde and dark hair and then I
saw the profiles and I might to me you
look like you are either twins or
sisters for sure like the five siblings
were extremely close so I've never had
that desire of like who I wish I had a
twin it'd be nice to go people and
figure out what they think but like me
feel so judged as a pair and it happened
to the time anyway is this so yeah we're
kind of getting fed up with the whole
like directly compare us aren't you it's
difficult when you you know it's a
person having security people are like
judging directly how you look different
and it might be something they pick out
that you don't like by yourself they're
like well this one has a bigger XYZ her
eyes are a little bit higher than
you have very different noses
whereabouts gave me of best friends and
see what they think we're so used to us
not dressing the same obviously today
you guys just look different enough even
like an outfit guys I had a pair of
friends who were identical twins so two
of them went to different colleges and
they try to kind of separate themselves
because they were so closely associated
it's like a singular unit I think it's
good you always have a partner in crime
sometimes they as much as I love you I'm
very happy to be back in my own clothes
what we thought was gonna happen is
absolute opposite of what happened and
we ended up getting judged completely on
how different we are
I really did think but at least a few
people would say we're twins but we got
mostly that we weren't even related like
I have twins I think because most people
think adult siblings want to be
different from each other and friends
maybe think it's like a novelty to be
the same once in a while I would be
interested to do it wearing the same
color hair hair is such a thing that
people can't get past I guess you really
don't look that similar and that's the
cross we have to bear
hopefully we'll comb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
