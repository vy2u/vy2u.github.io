so we're sisters and we're also best
friends so we spend a lot of time
together but because we're sisters we
get irritated with each other really
quickly and usually we can just split
off and like calm down hope doesn't get
violent so here's the thing we don't get
undressed together we don't pee in the
same room there's a boundary between us
that I think is gonna have to be broken
I'll prove myself before I prove in
front of it we like really
self-conscious people anyway it's like
being attached in public yes I'll die
the thing that I'm looking for at least
is trying to sleep because I can't sleep
with someone super close to me or we
scheduled this shoot I scheduled a date
I guess this is just a nightmare
oh yeah which hands cuz we're both
right-handed okay the only thing I will
say is because I broke my wrist my right
wrist I got very used to using my hand I
am NOT ambidextrous at all we're doing
it one two three oh she's gonna already
well I guess we're going somewhere now
he's working and I'm bored
yeah it looks straight out of BuzzFeed
and into champagne we're scared of
handcuffs so we have to numb the pain
now oh we just walked into a
restaurant and the nice house try to put
as at the table where we were accustomed
each other but we literally had to say
it so many people that we were
handcuffed to kill and it was completely
silent and ever
laughs I guess so we got on meal and we
cut it in half and it's actually easier
to eat than we thought
yeah no here's my advice to you they're
ever going to a restaurant handcuffed
and expect no one to notice they even
ask how you don't use the bathroom we
were like just wash their watch
appears I'm now on the date obviously
you left the key home now I have any
circulation I'm in peril quick well so
far no one has noticed that we have
handcuffs are in this glass that's good
yes nice three fun walking next to two
people who are holding hands when you're
attached to one of them one of the
perils have been hanging comfortably
accidentally pulled down we're trying to
get changed for bed and we realized that
there's literally no way to take your
top off business yeah it's not science I
guess we're sleeping your shirts all
right well it's time for bed hope you
like sleeping on your back the entire
night
last night was interesting I didn't have
as much of a problem as you I just
wanted to be alone in a corner and now
we're gonna try and do some makeup it's
like not so good
I think the eyeliner is gonna be a bit
where we're challenged Becky should I
change she like so freaking slow cause
like what would be like if you had a
giant family that you had to get ready
walking down the street just embarrassed
so we're just having to hide okay we'd
like old ladies going for a stroll oh I
got a nice morning else Kylie Margaret
we're in Marshalls to try and buy a
selfie stick because I was broke and I
think we work really well together
that's what I'm realizing or so look at
these llama Christmas leggings like we
came in here to get a selfie stick
nope we're getting larva like it's
telling interpretive EMS because the car
is huge the oils are tiny so when
someone comes down an island we can't
get out the way
feels like All Souls yeah so it's just a
bit
oh good she's going it's like bull in a
china shop just back from not a very
tiring thing to do and we are dead so
hot so tired my wrist this hurts me as I
try to avoid people because we didn't
want to be like sorry can you move
because we can't yeah why old lady here
comes barely walk out the bloody way no
it's gonna do yoga in the same shirt
this show is disgusting now I don't have
a shower because I don't want to go
shower with her no no any times thank
you so much
we have unless you drew it yet so this
is the first
I am scared okay
oh no you have to get in Ryan a friend
Ryan needs to get okay let's just get
your arm up fellow times I know Big Joe
Wow every Saturday I normally do yoga
please attach to me I suck knows what's
gonna happen and it has to be a teacher
yeah okay arms up stretch again it's a
prayer then not all we call parent wrist
I just can't okay this should be the
other election usually back-to-back on
opposite legs
Maggie wanted to do a scorpion and I
can't do that fall in line so we're
trying to be quick because we have to
take these things off somewhere
we have 20 minutes left just want to
take it mom I'm dragging you around
you're dragging me around
the time is up and you don't be happier
this point yep let's get get out
what do you first Oh even this is hard I
get out my god just chill
I'm a DJ I never leave you thank you
I think 24 hours was like the maxims
amount of time because I could feel
myself getting really irritable towards
the end yeah really do like feeling
embarrassed yeah at the beginning we
were really self-conscious towards the
end I was like I can't I'm just gonna be
out in the open with it it kind of made
me realize that you shouldn't give a
 or people think of you I did not
enjoy being a third wheel on a date I
didn't enjoy not being able to make out
with him you did make out with him most
fun I think the best part was realizing
how well we actually do work together we
will get like a little bit annoyed and
then it would be like well we're still
together so we have to calm down and
have to keep going that showed
perseverance and patience mom would be
proud
yeah I try to understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
