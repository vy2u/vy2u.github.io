sisters and we do have a lot of
similarities but we do have kind of a
different style
Chloe's style is more like cutesy yeah I
like things with small prints on like
tiny animals all over myself I don't
think boys find it for attractive but I
don't really care
mine's more like well I don't want to
say sexy I've always tried to be more of
a saucy minx
look what a both single weave similar
body shapes but we have a different
torso to leg ratio not gonna put you in
anything unflattering I'm just gonna
take you straight yeah your comfort zone
you're gonna really wear some sort of
baby bird button-up shirt I've never
done your makeup I feel like you have
giant eyeballs we have convinced two men
who don't know each other to go on a
double date with us we go on a date you
are obviously feeling look your best so
I'm a little nervous to do that in the
hands of my sister I think you'll just
be a night of definitely not looking
your best and maybe not a second date
all right so this is Becky's closet
Becky is actually running camera so you
can make comments but you are not
allowed to refuse anything it's really
hard cuz all these clothes are very you
so I think the only thing I could do is
pair to things you wouldn't even pair I
thought one dress is goodbye yeah
there's some pass oh right
it was pretty oh yeah so it's sweaty I
guess I want to find like a tighter top
you normally wear like a flow to your
shirt loose any glittery things look at
this this is tight it's not really sure
I'm going to be a crop top I do like
this I love this shape of a top maybe
we'd like a chain like over it that
might be cool yeah I gave you this
because I wouldn't wear it because it
was too innocent looking I'm gonna have
to look at your skirts to figure out
what to do they're falling they're
falling but she's found something
what am I an 11 year old roller skater
it's leather but it's still like very
cutesy flour so it has wick dots on it
like toothpaste I warn that really I
don't like it I just don't know how to
wear it I do like the idea of this I
think this is gonna be flattering we'll
try this in if you've said you never
worn it
that's kind of nice yeah but it's tight
I like these colors together because
they're less possibly than you'd
normally work all right
shoes I kind of want to put you in these
bad boys oh that's so high there we go
finished do these colors go together
I don't know dudes I'm not like a
fashion kneestr manga these are pretty
you never wear heels I mean neither of
us do I honestly kind of like these ones
like they're still high and the beige
goes with the pink too boring but in a
good way
staple let's do the gray ones yes yeah I
think I'm gonna go with these my quality
place I keep a wine packs make skin
situation colors go here you see
actually I could look pre snazzy this is
fun it's like having a Barbie look at
this yeah all right
okay bag is chosen yeah I'm doing this
this is the final answer and now jewelry
it's a little studs and a little
necklace I didn't want anything to go if
I went for a masculine geometric shape
all right is make up time I'm kind of
nervous to do this and I'm gonna try and
be professional and use a brush even
though I hate them color white little
streaks on the nose there where I'm
going through a car wash so because you
have like a newly dusty Dusty dusty
palette of your outfit I'm gonna stick
on some like goldie light eyeshadow
tapping is my I unn sensitive or are you
putting it everywhere but my eyelids in
sorry no it's got white mixed in with
it's a great color it's more with your
eye color not just the blue nice doesn't
matter
it looks a bit messy violist that's a
lot I don't really want to go out
looking crazy you're not gonna look
crazy I'm not finished
and that's all I can really hope for now
I have to do the scariest part eyeliner
it's not much more I can do with that
it's a little punched stretch it out
like a paint-by-numbers yes oh haha
you've got such a lot of eyelid it's
like the line it just has to keep going
my god you are pressing hard so
following the natural shape of your
eyebrows in photos that we usually do
because it doesn't look the same ones
really high upper ones low which is best
let's pick one and make that the Phoebe
scared
looks nice good in a way they're a
little thick but I like that that seems
a lot I'm glad it isn't with
self-loathing someone else you're very
tricky lip you're right done oh I think
in the dark
Oh blimey oh I look 89 what I think no
if I need silver and red that's not true
something about what you do that makes
me look so old and like a surprised mine
is happening don't paint balling on my
face can you appreciate it well done
yeah no you did the eyeliner very well
like a blush in the highlight alright
it's very nice thank you
go try outfits on leave oh wow
quite like this I would never pick it
but like for some reason it all works
together
I really like the skirt and top together
that looks really good the skirts
actually better than I thought it was on
me so that's nice to know before we
would never do this again I don't know
about the purse with the shoes
it's good right gray yeah you got a
match somewhere here but they're like a
different shade of grey well done
excellent
focus now we going on date hey Josh what
do you think of flower you look I mean
there's maybe like a little bit more on
the I've seen it brings out your
beautiful what do you think of Becky's
look the necklace very cool very
Cleopatra white your granny
never
Zak grandmother's very stylish Mikey I
probably would like do you think from
usual experience I have massive eyebrows
one of the big like blackness
all-nighters I'm so used to having like
your like how I feel like they're like
oh it's coming out the line of melted
off apparently I can't do liquid
eyeliner cuz I've been weeping the
outfits were great yeah I really think
you look very nice in what I chose yeah
equally I really like what you chose for
me it's just funny when someone else's
on your wardrobe because they pick out
things you never wear like I haven't
worn this sweater once I bought it like
two years ago ah but we learned that men
don't really notice or care about what
you're wearing or what you put you in
your face because they like this anyway
which is nice how do that also it was
quite dark in the restroom I can't wait
to take my makeup off and put sweatpants
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
