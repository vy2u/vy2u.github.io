okay that's how we're gonna start it
right off with Cheyenne was difficult
because she's a very demanding try hold
we hate each other on a daily no we
don't well when I hear from other
sisters I hear that they did
passive-aggressive stuff she would do
something and I really like mmm that's
good
people would be like Gabby your sisters
in trouble and I'd be like why is this
my problem why am i as you're supposed
to take care of me when you say sibling
fight I just have a montage of our
carpools through all of elementary
school in middle school from you guys
with car Gabby was in the front and I
would sit with us
Gabby would change the radio for
something I was like singing along to
mom would be like looking forward
driving and you'd hit me and then I go
she detect me in the eagle I didn't I'm
all the way over here and you'd have
like crawled to the back of the van like
antagonizing me so then I would like
step on the back of her she fell over
that Assad would pull forward and she
would get stuck and I see you forgot
about that and then stepping on this ed
med I would jump to the backseat my mom
would be like what is she new toggler
she's in the backseat is it bad that I
have no memory of mom or dad ever and
intervening they were just like eyes on
the road like just like we're going to
our destination like just this they're
animals and other people had to deal
with us yeah that's true God about the
seatbelt thing so mean and hurt I think
I was nine and you were you were six so
we're in the kitchen Camille comes in
she says what happened to the last
tropical punch fruit roll-up
everybody knows the top of my favorite
labor I'm sorry I was hungry I wanted it
you got to sit in the front seat
yesterday I guess this was just the
breaking point I was so
had all I knew how to do was cry and
scream for my mom I was like you know
what girl and she goes to the kitchen
and she comes back to her bedroom with a
loaf of bread and my dad's in there and
she goes did you eat this bread and my
dad goes yeah so I ate the bread and she
goes that was my bread and she throws
the bread at him they were screaming at
each other they were talking about how
they didn't want to be together anymore
we thought we were seeing our parents
marital issues through this loaf of
bread and we're like oh my god mommy and
daddy a fight between our parents just
completely flatlined yeah there was
silence and my mom slowly turns to us
with the loaf of bread and goes do you
like it when mommy and daddy fight I was
so confused
aren't you guys fighting over bread that
seems like a reasonable argument they
were showing us yeah how ridiculous we
looked when we fought over food her like
I guess that was kind of ridiculous but
she still took the last fruit roll-up
and I think mom just bought another pack
yeah I think she just bought a new box
it's better after college like even
older in college get things to talk
about we found better ways to talk to
each other we're not as mentally and
physically abusive but we're still very
possessive and food driven good to have
a sister because you have someone that
has context for all the stuff that you
grew up with which is nice
yes you love each other best friends but
we literally had a fight about sourdough
bread two weeks ago we actually had a
fight over a loaf of bread even if we're
not on the same page we're like in the
same book so it works yes
oh my god you had a duty line you do
read of all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
