cards I'm typically a skeptical person
not sure that I need someone to tell me
things I already know about my life had
random readings at bars she said that
like I would meet a guy this year and
that he would be rich I'm a church-going
person so
you ready I know you're nervous okay I
am nervous go ahead and shuffle for me
this is my energy it's a hot mess
I'm fully consensual for you to snoop
deep inside us see what we've got here
you like that don't freak out with that
by the way everyone freaks out I know it
looks scary well like that so this is my
future this is possible future okay
where I read is like you get it psychic
information from higher and you do with
it what you choose to they keep sending
any hall so there's something about a
modern day romance getting written
that's canids do well I haven't Annie
Hall poster hanging in my bedroom oh my
gosh
they're giving me a three and that's
like one of your magical times to write
three a I'm not 3 p.m. 3 a.m. okay
usually I am sleep at 3 a.m. a lot of
film energy they're also showing the
encased members of a Geisha so it's a
drama but it's set in an Asian country
so that's a feature film you're gonna be
in as a Geisha feel like you moved to
Los Angeles oh that's right I did and I
feel like you are like I'm doing it oh
my god I'm doing it and everyone's so
like shocked they're a little bit like
are you sure you want to go there
dangerous place skin min tips oh yeah I
do
I want to have to I'm sweating Panama
fingers should be dancing with you
really important do you zoom be' no i
swing dance swing dance all i love swing
dancing that's fishing me writing as
well but it's like journaling with the
panned written and journaling also
really really powerful for you they're
saying you need to get out more and it's
not a judgement it's just like you need
to have more fun they're shiny more sex
in the city less work home work home
like living cycle city instead of
watching yeah this isn't this is
building up the home right now building
up a living environment that feels
really great it feels like it could be
the valley actually oh I know
Oh easy big backyard okay it also I'm
not sure what I'm seeing it feels like
that so love coming that's exciting
really really soon
she feels like she may be from the
Midwest not sure about that one maybe
the south dude they have kind of similar
energy I'm petite lighter hair really
sweet this is like baptism and babies
and this is like nostalgia and family so
this is also your family loving him too
they don't like him have they met him
yet yeah and I have got do they like him
they're obsessing them you'll be dating
more than one you don't normally do that
but I see it happening like it's new to
you a being more social that tell your
guy comes in he's very funny and very
intellectual they'll always be romantic
interests coming in and out I'm until
you found one that you're really ready
to settle with but I'm not I'm not
getting that's anywhere close right now
it's all about you
this is commitment to self commitment to
career it isn't about the guy coming to
rescue you I call that Prince Charming
complex you're making your own way in
the world and what I've heard is you're
just getting started yeah I'm shaking up
your steel because it's just like how do
you know all these things I loved it it
was I don't even know I'm like kind of a
little bit shaken up right now it was
pretty good news so I hope that all
comes true people are very spiritually
in tune to things and I respect
everybody and Irish definitely respect
this reading and it's change allowed me
from just sitting here I don't like the
idea that someone can know me without
knowing me I'm like very skeptical of
these kinds of things but there's no way
that like she will known that I'm just
the type who really wants to know what
all the cards actually mean so I might
go up have to go home and read about it
I think I had a late a lot of ladies in
my cards I know what that means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
