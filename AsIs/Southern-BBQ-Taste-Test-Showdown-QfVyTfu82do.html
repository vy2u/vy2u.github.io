me like meeting a salad just alight mmm
salad for lunch
my ball hummock vinaigrette with a whole
bunch of pork cutlet mrs. Texas meat it
was thinking the fact because
everything's bigger that I'm a king in
Texas
the first time I had southern brisket it
blew my mind because I grew up eating
Jewish brisket that is perfect that is
fast
that is good this is some crap it was
like way too soft and fatty
I thought Carolina style referred to
both North and South Carolina I thought
it was a sex position oh yeah it sounds
fantastic
this is the weirdest sauce I've ever
seen there's more of an Aussie than a
sauce this looks like crab meat the meat
is a plus yeah you see that's exactly
what poor course should be oh my god it
was amazing it's like going home have a
drink

could do it hahahaha this will wait you

hell's this horse turd hashed Bert
crushed bugs Bert
we're in ok sounds appetizing ooh look
at that thick thick sauce stop things
are like body odor if you share this
with someone you definitely want to talk
about the sauce before
that's a good and the definition of one
man's trash MMS treasure
yeah what is it you know that's like
mice in it he's drooling
it's literally that's why he's drooling
I mean it's delicious
whichever Kansas City it is I think it's
me I don't think Kansas cantaloupe North
Carolina differently Memphis I love
those ribs even you a green at the
distance test if you're doing barbecue
