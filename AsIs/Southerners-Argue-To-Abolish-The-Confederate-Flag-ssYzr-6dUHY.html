Confederate flag because I'm from
Owensboro Kentucky
I'm from Norfolk Virginia I'm from
Shreveport Louisiana Charlotte North
Carolina Asheville North Carolina
Cleveland Tennessee Miami Florida
Richmond Virginia where I'm from it's
one of the things that you saw around
occasionally but it wasn't everywhere
instead of a confederate flag on my
pillow because I had a Dukes of Hazzard
pillowcase one of my friends had like a
rebel flag on his keychain if you saw a
Confederate flag it was completely
normal it would be in the backs of
people's windows driving it beyond
license plates and in people's yard guys
wearing it as bandanas
I remember in middle school my sister's
getting bullied by a guy who wore
confederate flag on his hat I remember
it being a very like sort of a
rebellious thing and in the back of my
head I was always kind of like doesn't
that represent like slavery
to me the Confederate flag represents
building an identity out of a past that
is not something to be proud of I think
it's just uh you know a tradition of
privilege and it represents an ignorance
to how horrible that past was the flag
represents being proud of and standing
up for slavery
I think symbolically it hurts a lot of
people when I see it I just think it's a
representation of mistreatment when I
see people displaying it very proudly a
little sad for the folks who still
believe that white is the supreme race
that's their that's their flag that's
their symbol that's what they believe in
regardless of if that's like why people
connect with it now or not like that's
what that symbolizes
if you really believe that everyone
should be treated equally then you
shouldn't have a confederate flag and I
think it's time for us to grow and move
on and I think that means leaving that
symbol behind I'm really proud to be
from the South the Confederate flag is
embarrassing to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
