romantic trapped in the body of a killer
who knows so these are the Buffy
magazines there's a spike interview I am
a big fan of sight come selves that
people love the whole show Buffy the
Vampire Slayer I liked it was both it
was both scary and a love story just
attracted everybody he actually I think
represents the total rainbow that is
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Mike had a
mouth on him and I appreciated that I'm
like yo girls like this guy cool cuz I
got a mouth on me he's like that punk
rocker boyfriend that you wanted to eat
in high school but you're kind of like
waiting for him to grow up a little bit
at going heart of gold yeah it was very
sensory sensitive at your fantasy center
panic saying like I want to know like
was it mostly improv what's the first
step to becoming a vampire
does he like keep in touch with any of
the other actors from the show on set
worked with people for so long there had
to be some sort of romantic connection
at some point was someone there right
I yeah I don't I mean that would never
happen yes he's here I'm sweating so
much
oh it's a total fake hi hi hey that's
like private whatever it's really wrong
very sweaty right now really try to keep
it cool right I'm feeling a little
nauseous
no yeah definitely in a blackout lasted
thing about about prob you okay not one
word was that fraught right not one
comma was in trouble always I like to be
on a show that was just so incredibly
progressive like from like a feminist
standpoint from an LGBT standpoint that
was my favorite my favorite thing about
buffy is that we had the first teenage
lesbian kiss on chest
what is the episode you have the most
fondest memories from filming or just
watching my favorite episode probably
was the musical but how does he develop
feelings for Drusilla that's a very deft
thing to notice I got this role NMC they
said you're gonna be five episode arc
and then you get to your debt and a
really great show and I thought I don't
want to be that and so I held on to love
because that's what the audience always
responds to so I looked around and said
well he loves his girlfriend it's not
every day that you need the man that
your girlfriend would leave you for
there is that football player who you
know is the biggest jerk in the world
and all the women are going for that and
there you're just like here's like
really yeah that's what you guys like
you like the evil guy yeah exactly I was
kind of having the react that reaction
to the whole spike thing I was like wow
you're out what made you like no my
sister would be freaking out my entire
family my mom would be fangirling right
now everyone knows because I insert a
Buffy reference until like every video I
do is that it's a very important part of
me when I was growing up and still even
now it's just awesome to like meet
someone in like here about how they were
feeling and that it was just as
important to them as it was to us yeah
this is completely unfair oh look it's
me Scarah on there yeah I wore more
makeup Clara they always used to say
that we need more time with him she's
easy this guy needs a lot of help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
