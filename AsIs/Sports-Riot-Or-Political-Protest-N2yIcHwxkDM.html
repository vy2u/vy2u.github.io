give you some facts about riots and
you're just gonna guess why the right
happened in 2011 almost 100 people were
arrested and around 150 were injured
during a ride at Vancouver I was
referred to by the New York Times it's
one of the worst episodes of rioting
Canada has seen in decades but this
happened because of a foreign policy be
police brutality see sports or de labor
movements I had the guest sports the
police brutality against the students
I'm I'm gonna guess labor movements
police brutality that one was actually
cuz the sports yeah and that's loss of
the Bruins and in the Stanley Cup Finals
yeah Wow there was a riot because the
sports team the next one in a 1984 in
Detroit a riot left 80 injured one dead
and millions of dollars in property
damage as well as eight reported rapes
did this happen because of a foreign
policy be police brutality see sports or
the labor movements D labor movements
there's never an excuse for rape so I'm
not really sure it's known and I had to
go with maybe be this one was also
sports 1984 the Detroit Tigers beat the
Padres the World Series
yeah so they decided to rape people in
2014 in Keene New Hampshire a riot broke
out the resulted in flipped cars fires
and dozens of arrests one participant in
the riot described it as it's a rush
you're revolting from the cops was this
a foreign policy be police brutality see
sports or D partying I'm gonna go police
brutality well I don't they have to say
police brutality because you will tell
me either sports Oh panting I don't know
maybe parching I think I think it was
because of the police personally amazed
it was party it was because there is a
2014 Pumpkin Festival how do you think
the coverage of these riots differs from
that of the coverage of the riots in
Baltimore or in Ferguson white people
rioting people that neighbors don't care
about white people rioting
they're the white guy police brutality
is so much more of a controversial
subject that writes about those just
stir up a lot more commotion
I don't believe riots lead to happen I
think that's the worst way to go about
it why would you try to destroy stuff
that's in your community your have the
you can destroy today and then you're
gonna have to walk past it the rest of
your life I'm walking down the streets
like you know police capture me I get
beat up and killed you know what I want
my family to riot like not really but
I'd be down for them you know going to
the police office and making something
happen maybe people are not being hurt
and this this results in riots riots are
happening for stupid reasons than police
brutality and then calling these ones
where there's somewhat of a reason to
actually be angry and calling them you
know names about is kind of wrong and
weird I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
