- Yeah.
- Three, two, one.
(laughs)
(soft music)
Hi I'm Ryann and we're in
the streets of Hollywood.
We're gonna see if people can find
the true meaning of beauty.
We're gonna have strangers
walk up to this beautiful work
of art but what they
don't know is that they
are the actual work of art inside.
Let's find out what people
love about themselves.
So could you just tell me
your name one more time?
- Blair.
- Jay.
- I'm Valentina.
- Maggie.
- Ashley.
- I'm Shane.
- Shane, awesome, are you
a big art connoisseur?
- Not at all, I don't know much about art.
- Okay, so this might be
a tough challenge for you
to judge a work of art?
- Yeah, no, I wouldn't
take my word for it at all.
- Love art, yeah of course.
- I love art.
- I'm the pursuer of the arts,
not the doer of the arts.
(laughs)
- I'm ready.
- Oh god, okay.
I worked really hard on it, so like,
be honest, I want your honest opinions.
I'm just gonna drop this cloak
and I want you to give me
the first things that
come to your mind okay?
Three, two, one.
- Oh me.
(laughs)
- Oh (beeps).
- Can we switch.
(laughs)
- I think it's perfect.
- Oh wow.
What a head turner,
it's me isn't it?
- It is.
It's you.
- I'm a little too tall though,
I gotta like crouch down to see it.
- We didn't plan for that.
So what do you love
about this piece of art?
- I mean there are so
many thing I could say.
- Look at this gorgeous woman.
- Yeah right?
- Cute outfit.
(laughs)
- Nice tattoos.
- I need to take a shower.
(laughs)
- I'm enough, we're enough.
I think everybody should
think that they're enough.
Good, look in the mirror
and say I'm beautiful.
- Do you think it's
important to love yourself?
- A hundred percent, yeah.
- I have to love myself, 'cause
no one's gonna do it for me.
- See who you are and like
what makes you different
is what actually makes
you better in the world.
You don't wanna be just
another cookie cutter.
- I was in the closet for so long like
trying to hide being gay and
stuff and like once I came out
that gave me a completely
different like sense of self love.
So I think it's super important.
- How would you encourage
someone who might be struggling
with like being bullied
or self confidence,
how would you encourage that?
- I got bullied so much
when I was younger.
Honestly I'd say probably just
like find your inner light.
- There are gonna be people
who area gonna judge us
and we're not gonna like
the things that they say
but that doesn't mean that you know,
we have to agree with them.
- You need to look at the people.
See somebody who's struggling,
go over and say hello.
- Smile.
- Smile.
- Smile more regularly.
(laughs)
- People depend on other
people to give compliments
but sometimes we have to
give ourselves compliments
in order to receive those
compliments from people
because those people will come around,
you know what I mean?
- [Ryann] Yes, I love that.
- [Jay] Yeah.
- Thank you so much, I appreciate it.
(upbeat music)
we did it, we came to Hollywood
and found the true meaning of beauty.
Tell us why you love yourself
in the comments below.
Or post a selfie on
Instagram using the hashtag
me crush Monday.
And the next time you look in the mirror,
don't forget to tell
yourself you're enough,
love yourself everybody.
(laughs)
