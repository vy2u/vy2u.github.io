see if we can get two strangers on the
streets of Hollywood to make out
blindfolded and see how much they learn
it's kissing important to you yes it's a
connection with a person well the first
kiss is really important because that
kind of sets up a lot about the person
do you think you can learn a lot from
kissing someone like you can't learn
math from a kiss if they're sloppy if
they're prude you can learn if they
connect well with you whether that
person is good at sex or not everything
I need to know would you kiss a random
stranger on the street no no no cuz I'm
a germaphobe not right now because I
have a boyfriend you know a random
stranger Oh any random stranger I'd have
to see the random stranger yes for what
for what sort of in like website or a
BuzzFeed video oh no sure would you do a
blindfolded probably not uh yeah all
right we got one sure all right you do
it I would do it we couldn't get a
fourth person on the street to kiss
blindfolded so we called Devin from our
office who is more adventurous than
anyone else at BuzzFeed Devin are you
willing to kiss someone blindfolded yeah
I got the okay for my boyfriend
okay what do you think you know about
that person do you really want to know
take clips probably between the ages of
25 and 30 but not their personality yet
cause he was kind of like quick was just
like 1 2 maybe darker skin than mine I
feel like he's he might be in music in
the arts you if he was tongue action
maybe I could have take something but it
was way too quick for me to catch she
seemed very sweet her lips were soft
he had very soft hands she definitely
seems like a kind person maybe like a
little shy he seems like a very caring
dude her mid-20s maybe like 20 to 5 11 I
think he's probably my height maybe a
little taller she smells pretty
yeah I'll hug you now oh isn't that
interesting
it's interesting what do you I think
that you were taller than me and I
thought you were kind a little shy
I thought you were between 25 and 30 I'm
probably a little wrong you're a little
younger than
yeah and I thought I felt you had darker
skin than I did but yeah you're in music
or the Arts she got that right very like
a warm nice person and you had soft lips
and you smell nice too
thank you I feel like Oh someone knows
yeah Phil Knight but I didn't say you
down I said that I thought you were very
kind and compassionate and tall as well
and I like that you hold my hands like
both the same Heights - but I knew had
the lips than most people her lips like
my bollocks yeah thank you
yeah essentialist I thought you were
blond I don't know I just sound like a
blonde vibe off of you but you was old
up but you had like two skin and I was
right I thought that maybe that you
might have been like a different
ethnicity than you are was a pleasure
commended yeah so you guys would kiss
