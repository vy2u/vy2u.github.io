you're single you use online dating but
what happens after you match with
someone you have to send them fun witty
messages I'm no good at it so I said
 it and I brought in two comedians
we're gonna do it for me
hey I'm Jake and I'm Amir and we are
Zack for the week we are competing to
get Zack the most days but not just the
most matches new match Jessica a message
Sarah a message hey Liam s it's about
finding him his soul mate comedy writers
don't have a lot of advantages in life
but when it comes to texting with
strangers that's our wheelhouse my
message Jennifer what's your venmo I'll
pay your student loans right now and and
she was so repulsed by us that she
didn't respond will the other person
understand our jokes most of the times
maybe not but at the very least we're
making each other laugh which is really
a lot of oh yeah not the point
so Jake and Amir are both gonna set up
rivalin tinder profiles are both going
to be swiping as me for a week and then
at the end of the week we're gonna check
back and see who was the better sack am
i being dishonest to people sure but is
it for a good reason
kind of profiles good to go we are
embellishing your highlights diminishing
your low lights I think this is the
perfect profile I look forward to seeing
what Jake comes up with hot hot fun fun
funny okay
so whoa this guy's hot I'll see his
other photos whoa this guy's really hot
well then wow this guy has a lot of fun
oh man he has a lot of fun and he's
funny then that's what the ramifications
of having two strangers swipe for me for
a week is only now starting to settle in
this potentially was a mistake best
thing about waking up when you're on
tinder every frickin morning is
Christmas morning hey I got some gifts
they're shaped like Chelsea sending me a
giffy I think that it's always easier to
swipe for someone else like when I take
someone else's tinder I have no problem
with it all of a sudden I know what to
say I know how to be cool and confident
but when you're doing it for yourself
it's so easy to get in your own head my
sister has
never told you I look like Ryan Gosling
both of them are doing things that I
wouldn't do for myself but also what I'm
doing for myself isn't working so that's
probably a good thing where did you go
to college Emerson College let's do
let's do Yale this lady works at NASA
Jet Propulsion lab what really cool just
just like you went to Yale she said I
was helping her out when she's at NASA
I'm like oh basically I'm an astronaut
and then she's like yeah I guess you are
and then I said call me BuzzFeed Aldrin
just pretty solid toilet time is tinder
time you got a swipe wipe and tight
right this is me all day long all day
long all day long oh I messaged somebody
named Juliet Juliet it's me Romeo I'm
him my name is Zack what I'm making a
romantic Shakespeare reference to show
you I'm literate
now I'm subverting the pickup line to
show you I'm self-aware and understand
this must be the only pick-up line you
get on this app anyway hey this girl I
matched with named TIFF and I said TIFF
you're named after my favorite photo
file you should meet my friend jiff he's
just like you only more animated and
then she blocked me this girl but I
didn't think this ex soul mate only
sending one message
the chance would be back she's a
humanoid mouse yep
and here this is my favorite picture I
think I've ever seen on tinder she's
drinking out of a toilet uh so I said I
miss her let's stop playing these cat
and mouse games because she's dressed as
a mouse I've got cats and she wrote shut
up you loved it based on that response I
was ready to marry her and I wrote
you're right and then I was like oh no
I'm nervous so I asked her a stupid-ass
question I said I'm sure you hear it all
the time but would you mind explaining
the toilet water fountain I don't know I
have no excuse all right
last day how we feeling confident I know
for a fact
Zack will find his lover he will find
his soulmate he will find his future
ex-wife when he looks at the tinder that
I curated yes he any given week for you
how many matches are you acquiring in a
normal week I feel like I would get like
three that that's like I like man's ex
crushing it this week I've got you 51
matches what I got you 79 matches my god
I think that both of you did a lot of
really good work here I really love the
hot hot fun fun funny
on the downside I think that you got a
little flustered by Mesa you strayed
from your own strategy which was just to
keep it light and have fun it's true on
this side holy those are some of
the most beautiful people that I've ever
talked to me on the downside I do think
that there's a little bit of
manipulation and misinformation going to
Yale if you went to school in the
Northeast I think that in reality I'm
going to probably mash both techniques
together but if I had to choose one
phone
congratulations you did really great
words really thank you thank you thank
you son I don't know what to do with
this this power and this knowledge it's
definitely fun and I think that's the
power and the knowledge just do this how
just have fun yeah if you sleep with any
of these people I'm gonna count that
towards my total that's fair that's fair
I think that's very I'll call it an
assist for sure how many assists equals
one point I think it's a totally
separate stat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
