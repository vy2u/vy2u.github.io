borrow something ooh I love that can I
borrow that for tomorrow sign ding thing

and that terrifying moment when you
think you're wearing your trademark all
black but your shirt doesn't exactly
match your pants damn it and then
there's laundry day where you may be
forced to wear those dreaded shirts at
the back of your closet Green are you ok

worst color known to mankind

maybe navy blue to have you Navy to have
you and then there are those that would
try and crimp your style are you most
are you gonna stop yeah seriously it's a
baby shower the baby hasn't even been
born yet you don't know a sense of style

wardrobe for anything because nothing
will ever be the new black
