promising a Hufflepuff people seemed to
think being a Hufflepuff is a bad thing
you're not a Hufflepuff are you I'm
totally a Hufflepuff they consider them
dumb boring but hufflepuffs are boring
no they're not and even though their
life is seemingly simple there are
certain struggles that come with being
the kindest house of the bunch
just kidding I gotta be mad at you
the problem with being the friendliest
house is people may misunderstand their
kindness for flirting
he's totally hitting up nicely nice
don't drink that what he's a Slytherin
can you really trust him being
continually positive all the time means
friends may not always take them
seriously do you think I can pull this
shirt off yeah definitely you always say
that though look great huh you're too
nice okay what do I use leather and what
do you think no thank you
putting others first can sometimes make
them late sorry I'm late I was helping a
stranger with a way of crisis but I
brought cookies but it's always for a
good reason like taking the time to
listen to someone having a bad day it
was that huh
my cookie duh being able to make friends
with anyone often puts them in the
middle of heated arguments gross
silly others befriend people often
underestimate your intelligence you lay
bare yourself yeah how do you do it and
they think the only thing you're good
for I lost my phone is finding things oh
thank you but that's okay hufflepuffs
aren't wants to brag about their talents
or complain hey Tay brought you coffee
they're too busy being the best friend
anyone could ever ask for
if you're a Hufflepuff don't let those
struggles get you down because this
world needs badass badges like you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
