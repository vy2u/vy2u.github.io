outside of school I'm sorry that I don't
want to be doing six hours of homework a
night they pick on you even if you don't
have your hand up if I don't have my
hand up I don't know the answer they act
like they've never been in our positions
when they hate their jobs the students
know it and probably devalue the
material the way they expect you to know
what you're doing after one
demonstration they make me speak in
front of class and do presentations when
I have anxiety they compared me to my
older and smarter siblings when they
treat their class like everyone's gonna
die without it when you ask them a
question and they tell you to find the
answer in the book I think those
students are all the same
some of us could use different methods
of teaching going on about something
irrelevant for half the lesson you don't
need to know the true Chi like children
and expect you to behave like adults not
coordinating with each other and making
us have hell week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
