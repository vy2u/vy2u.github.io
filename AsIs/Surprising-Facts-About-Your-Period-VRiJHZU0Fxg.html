I think I'm gonna do good because I got
five sisters oh and you know we strong I
am very confident about periods because
I've experienced it all my life
I'm actually a PMSing right now I like
don't know a lot of scientific stuff is
an egg really know if their period
questions that are super scientific and
thought after they ask me like how much
I hate myself when I'm on my period or
like how many barbecue potato chips I
eat those I can get alright let's answer
some period facts to riffles it's
possible that our periods are linked to
the lunar cycle I hope because that
would be so true true I'll say
true
I think it's false kerubim is I just
can't add another mystic thing I know
women are witches that's true I'm right
eleven study found that twenty eight
point three percent of 826 participants
began their period near the new moon
this was a notably larger majority than
any other start time so we don't have
like the definitive science but I'm
gonna say it's true women are witches we
can do anything you don't even have a
period so I don't know why you got that
question right five sisters University
of Phoenix
true or false periods typically lasts
for about eight days I feel like eight
days is a long ass yeah that was true I
think we'd all be like oh that's false
false
five days am i right that feels long
here's the thing mine used to only be
four to five days and then all of a
sudden past couple years it started
being like eight to ten days false
oh the length of most periods is about
three to five days and the average
length of the menstrual cycle is 28 days
the NSA found a next question true or
false period blood can vary in
consistency and color the throughout a
period and can even be an indicator of
your there's the thin blood
there's like the really red blood do you
have the dark blood there's just lots of
blood yeah sure the blood is not gonna
be the same every time and if you're
sick and you got some in your blood
things are gonna change some days that's
just brown some days I just read some
days that she's black because it's like
purpley is it boy
sometimes drew write cranberry red
period blood mmm is a sign of healthy
regular period its period blood that is
pink and color may indicate low estrogen
level which may in turn affect the
regularity of period low estrogen can
increase the risk of osteoporosis or
indicate polycystic ovary system or
premenopause it's like a nice wine the
longer it's the average amount of blood
loss during a period is 1.5 cups which
is equivalent to a can of soda I don't
know how much we bleed a month that
feels like enough I'm fit balls
pulse I'm gonna say pulse I'm gonna say
truly the woman always knows man's

the average amount of blood loss Serena
period could range from a few
tablespoons to a cup so that was saying
that was too much y'all true or false
women's bras why we're talking about
titties pick them differently depending
on what phase they are in their master
cycle I want to cover my answer because
I don't want you to copy me true as a
woman with no tits I can strongly talk
about it as a woman who has enough tips
for us both I guarantee you that is true
it's true and I'm gonna go as far as
saying everything fits you differently
when you're on your period including
your thoughts and the people you're
having sex with I think it's true I
think your true research shows that
profit is related to Metro cycle stages
and it's especially influenced by
hormonal changes or one's reproductive
stage true or false
Disney produced an animated short film
called the story of menstrual
I've seen that I hope that's true that
would be right as if it was I feel like
I would have watched it in sex ed I'm
gonna say true I say true I mean if you
said you saw it if you are up
off all series with this Sunday I'm
gonna be mad true the 10 minute 1946
cartoon produced by Disney and
collaboration with Co tox illustrates
the story of menstruation yo Disney
remake that yeah I get like the
Kota Fanning to voice the girl or some
 also this fact is only in here
because sissy is making this video and
she's obsessed with Disney just thought
I'd point that out
true or false hormonal changes during
your period can affect your poop yes
this is a true statement
ever since sometimes I get a little
watery dairy you get watery there yep
 on your period is the worst
thing ever I called the wood chipper say
true I would say true we're gonna go
with true chemicals that help the uterus
shed its lining during ones period and
also travel to the bowels forcing them
to also contract and increasing the need
to poop in addition progesterone levels
a hormone that can be constipating
decreased during menstruation making
poop even we've gotten everyone right so
far true false
mr. flow contains only blood posture
thank you
I think the weird shouldn't my
balls Wow give it to me if this is if
this is wrong I'm walking out ventral
flow contains tissue and mucus in
addition to blood during the menstrual
phase the lining of the uterus and as
the endometrium is shut out of the
cervix and
I think like boys should be required to
see a period at least once in their life
percent you know so it's not so taboo I
was surprised with how much I knew
because we got our majority of the
questions right I am NOT shocked that me
and Chrissy actually knew all of them ok
low-key I'm actually very surprised I
feel like I went into this being very
confident but wow I learned a lot I feel
like as a woman with your period you
need to know what's going on with your
body there's no reason why we in our 20s
should know all of these it should be
taught so that there's no questions
about it on to say his periods are
 insane yeah it's crazy that we
can do so much with our bods and yeah I
feel like a woman oh did we get these as
a prize yeah do we get prizes so these
are good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
