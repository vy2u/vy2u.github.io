okay click on my profile picture oh my
god here we go
I certainly think it's a funny picture
and that's why it's profile so I'm
clicking on the first one to hit the
backer okay oh oh gosh yes
yeah that's my first profile picture
it's my freshman year homecoming
this picture of me and a guy who was my
best friend at the time
I don't know I'm scowling and I don't
know why I'm standing on a rooftop it's
me and it's in my brother's bathroom in
my parents house I'm pretty sure he was
like hey and just like snapped the photo
man it's weird to look through these
yeah this is a picture of me standing
next to a dinosaur well I was biking
down the Pacific Coast about ten years
ago one of the best trips in my life
this is oh this is on my trip to Hawaii
my dam and I remember I thought it was
like the coolest thing the world this is
us all together hanging out at night I
don't know what I was considerably more
fit and I was so skinny you know what's
weird about looking through your old
profile pictures and your old pictures
is realizing how much as you grow up an
adult you get to know yourself it's like
a weird encapsulation of me growing up
I'm wearing an embarrassing crystal it
kind of makes me feel like an idiot
because I know when I posted this I was
like all those pictures I needed friends
and
guidance generally on Facebook I think
people are trying to put their best face
forward or they're trying to portray the
sort of persona that might be marketable
it is weird to go through your airs of
Facebook photos and just realize how
much you've changed that is now my
husband so it worked out I don't mind
looking at pictures of my past generally
it's a good portrait of the journey from
here to there and it's been a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
