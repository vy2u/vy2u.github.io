are not many things I hate grab the
cheese is like the look I'm getting in
I understand there are real problems in
the world
I'm Sheridan and I am 6 feet tall my
name is Lindsay and I'm 5 10 5 10 and a
half
being tall is great when you're at a
concert you can always see no one loses
me in a crowd anywhere but in terms of
shopping and finding clothes that fit it
can really suck I think growing up it
was way worse for me because nothing
would fit me I really like shopping
online for clothes there just tends to
be more options those for tall people
and plus-sized people I'm one of those
people that love shopping for myself at
the same time I wish someone could just
hand it to me today I'm gonna be trying
style boxes for the first time they send
you the clothes and you don't pick them
and for someone who has extreme control
issues is probably gonna keep me up at
night but always up for a new experience
I'm really looking forward to just
getting something new to put in my
closet that I wouldn't picked off
Michael we're gonna be trying three
different style boxes the first one is
called wantable second one is called
stitch fix and the third one is called
NATO's no classy a little French and
they're huntable I like that name edit
your look love your style got7 premium
hand-picked pieces to try before you buy
so this is not a choose your own one
okay and you get five days to try
everything on at home I feel like I'm
either teen or like night out man this
is like really forcing you to think
about what you I'd say I'm more of like
a Megan Marco Kate Middleton and this
seems to kind of like cover that all
right stitch fix let's get started okay
a personal stylist would curate five
pieces for you buy what you love send
back the rest love your look sounds easy
enough
oh cool quiz do you enjoy shopping oh
yes how much effort do you spend on your
look tongues do you like to experiment
with new styles yes oh that was it that
was three questions ready there's only
based on those three
oh well then why can't you just like add
clothes to a box of exactly what you
want okay they don't wear all the
clothes you choose with no commitment
wear as long as you want then return
with prepaid shipping customize your
looks to fit your agenda you decide
what's in the box
I like that jumpsuits oh my god I'm
really excited it's like my dream just
to be like surprised with the jumpsuit
all right so I'm gonna finish putting in
all my information
you're gonna give my life to them and
trust that I'll get some cool stuff out
of it I'm excited I'm nervous mostly
goodness we've gotten all our boxes
we're gonna open them up so I feel like
nothing good ordering online you know
and hoping it fit
I have low expectations but I'm excited
because it's close and I love clothes
this is very true
so the first one we're doing is wantable
we ended up like not being able to try
on our clothes right away
and they actually let us extend having
our boxes before we had to return the
items mad props
yay customer service picking oh we got
the same quote beauty begins the moment
you decide to be yourself great that is
great beautiful of that is just a
regular t-shirt wait what is it front
look like it's literally a t-shirt I
loved how soft everything was a soft
fabric for her so no I guess it's like a
it's like a back oh wait no this is that
it's not necessarily about having a look
more about finding those items to like
remix items already in your wardrobe I
love this dress it's just a really giant
t-shirt is this a graphic tee oh my god
oh wait I think this is the box for I
was like edgy this is everything I got
it
rocker chic okay that looks small it
looks great
oh it's a wrap dress you don't like red
dresses I just personally feel like a
lot of times plus-sized lines totally
rely on wrap dress yes they're like we
don't know how to put a zipper on the
plus-sized dress yeah I feel great
I don't owe my own fashion this would
fit me go take it off and ride on if I
fit the cymbidium the wonders it would
do for my self-esteem little tight on
the arms not The Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants moment we thought this
would be I give up
so this is a sweatshirt we weren't quite
sure what it was hey it's like a back oh
wait no this is the back I feel like
classiest ballerinas wear this around
what would it look like if I did it the
other way around try it well I like it
like this to wear it oh thank you for
the price of one I'm looking at the side
on my sleeve okay mine no see I like
yours and really like mine sure did this
car looks great on you yeah I just feel
like the prettiest chowster you ever
seen office Lee you need to like do a
little tuck II oh wow this changed
everything
do I look like the coolest mom at the
PTA meeting yes do you do I would say
super strategy lobster boy Harry's like
I could just squat oh yeah I really like
the jeans and I really like the t-shirt
this hole right here is very close to
being over in it you're welcome oh sure
Oh what is this why are you upset just
because you have to go do magic at a
little kid's birthday party right after
this she's gonna mime her way right out
of here I don't hate this if I was the
kind of person who went dancing
maybe but like it's not really me I
think you look hot though thank you I do
Olay if I were to grade this as far as
fashion goes I'd give it a see sometimes
people want sex and good stuff that like
quality reliable and
just deliver let's call this the not so
basic bitch box Nexus stitch fix why is
your box bigger I know they say size
doesn't matter
but stitch fix felt the most personal
out of all of them they've wrote us a
note they looked at my Instagram they're
like this is your style this is what I
think you would look so good in I
actually felt like I had a personal
shopper wow oh my god this is like
Lindsay's dream top but these shoes
though oh okay
pick skinny I have a feeling I'm really
gonna like these but I feel no knock on
wood I might own these but like not as
nice quality all right you got a
sweatshirt I like my inspirational
sweatshirt adventure but uh that dress
we need to talk about this dress I mean
ignore it and pretend like it never
happens I look at my box and I think
Lindsey I look at sharing these box and
I think not shared and it's for like
literally like a 50 year old yeah
bohemian romance fashionable share it in
I don't feel my best also the way these
jeans are hitting I don't know want to
pull them up but they don't want to go
all the way up the jeans are good but I
do a sort of like a bit higher hit in
the middle it's really uncomfortable
cause a slight thing well they look
great I like the bodysuit the best thing
that's funny about this shirt is it's
like ironically this is not an
adventurous t-shirt I'm really comfy I
will say that the shoes are not your
favorite they are not the worst they are
not the best well let's talk about good
stuff
okay this top I'm obsessive I hope you
love it because I really really love it
it's very fun it's just so she is a
luxury I wouldn't wear this with jeans
you know what did this would look you
with is like my leathers everything I
want it give it
oh cool I like mine Shh this is the
library please don't raise your voice
this pattern is aggressive and I'm
pretty sure I specifically said I don't
like a lot of you
and the necklace just is so aging you
know what the only thing saving this
dress is your hot bod yeah
people tell me about all the time I love
this this is more of my style
I just want to steal all your clothes I
feel like the part in a superhero movie
right before she like rips off a really
aging old outfit to reveal the hot
superhero bod underneath I want to show
that yeah this is Princess Diaries pre
manga this put me in the red Sheridan
states I think this box just was totally
for the wrong person there's definitely
things in mind I would totally keep
which i think is great lucky you
big momma got the big one this time
little mama got the little one I believe
this is the style box that we got to
swap out items we did not like it is
cool that they gave us the option to see
what was in the box before we got it
basically if this doesn't work it's RJ
I'm Paul let's see welcome to later this
looks so different
oh it's like a slouchy jumpsuit oh my
god it's so small oh my god it's so
small why is this so small I just might
see your couch I've been waiting for
this day for so long a turtleneck dress
looks a little tight and with my boobs
you're gonna be seeing some of my couch
chair yeah being and I have not shaved
since the Civil War so enjoy the sights
yeah I was just about to say that I know
you were the photo made it look like
more of a jacket this is definitely a
sweater maybe look sure you put it on
because it doesn't has the ruffles I'm
down for this yes I needed some good
news hey my last item is a bohemian
style purse so I never thought I'd be
into but you know what I saw a photo and
I was
for it I'm about to break human decency
laws it's supposed to be a dress really
it is more of a shirt wow this would be
great for like lana kane cosplay from
archer but other than that um i don't
think i should be legally allowed to
wear this cuz i'm my crotch isn't very
surprising um love that dress and it
fits really well it's ocean oh and like
if i want i am red i would probably wear
with like my van shoes and make it more
like chill looking and not like dress it
up I just tried to make this crossbody
and it didn't work this out was a bad
mistake so close from being like a wedge
wedge said even it's almost there but
it's not it's a very classy sweater it
is you look like a business oh my god
also we kind of match oh my god people
say when you find the one you just know
I'm not into this I would totally wear
this out how I don't have anything like
it which is what I like about it they
rule in tension chic while we both
sounds like we like to the same this is
my new favorite jacket this is my new
fave going out dress you know what you
got to kiss a lot of frogs before you
find that prince or princess let out
look more like look great we both really
like this box pops-up admit we had a
hands and choosing the items cuz we were
able to swap out some stuff I do
appreciate how the other box is I had to
get out of my comfort zone and being
tall as you know can be difficult to
find clothes it's really nice to kind of
take a little bit of the guests element
out of it and be like yo my height is
your problem now
this style box go for the gold if you
love surprises you love gifts it's such
a treat it's funny because even the
clothes I really liked out of everything
else there is still didn't feel
completely loved because I didn't pick
it out for myself but here's the thing
there were items like that dressy long
enough at one when you saw it you were
like nah and then you put it on you were
like hell yeah you might have never have
tried that on if you didn't have someone
else choosing that for you so so true
boom sometimes we got to give up a
little bit of control it was very fun
yeah I love doing the beauty oh my god I
need to shop together more off so you
might have noticed fold leaves now as is
but don't worry you'll still get all the
same awesome content you used to Plus
even more new great stuff click to
