kids hi I'm jasmine and I'm 27 years old
I don't know if you guys have noticed
but teens these days are on a whole
nother fashion level kids are walking
around looking like mini Rihanna's up in
here and when I was a teenager I don't
know what the hell I was doing so I
decided to challenge a 17 year old in a
fashion face-off we're both going to
concerts tonight and we need the proper
each other's looks all right bring in
the team hello
Hey are we going what's your name right
now the line nice to meet you I'm Avalon
I'm 17 what do you think about 27 year
old I think they're great I do I would
prefer it don't talk about me like an
old bug I think you're fresh you're
smarter you're you're you're cured like
now what do you think of seventeen year
old at a young age of 17 you guys are
figuring out some stuff about yourself
that I didn't know about myself until I
was way older I mean when your pictures
don't get lights right nightmare tell me
about your style how do you describe
yourself basically your mama I'm kinda
your mama that's cool oh yeah come on
come on I think my style reflects Who I
am practical pragmatic
I suppose my style is like bold yes and
maybe unpredictable
I love street style but there are times
where I look like a real high-class
bitch so I'm all over the place I could
definitely imagine myself and what
Jazwares but I don't think I ever would
what kind of concert are you going to
ideally it would be like gum it's like a
Fabio Fabio explain the classical guitar
and everyone could have taste Fabio in
concert wasn't even there makes me cry
Mancha Rihanna concert because also you
can wear almost anything that I think
shopping for Avalon is going to be very
interesting we're both so extremely
opposite of each other you are so
beautiful and I just want to make you
glow and I want Rihanna to see you from
the crowd I like I wanted our season and
Avalon are here in forever 21 we have 30
minutes to shop for each other no I'm
really nervous but Rihanna gameplan i
internet stalked her last night and I
saw what her style was I see she always
wears black and I said I'm not doing it
she's not getting black so I'm thinking
I'm gonna play a lot with some ruffles
maybe some like roses that she talked
about some like salsa dancing as soon as
I went to explore I was like yeah heck
yeah
they actually look at the clothes and I
was like no that's not cute at all
you know white you know can you see the
exhaustion in my face like this is a
issues intense this would consume her
you can pull her right out okay 30
minutes sorry omg omg
but is it gonna look like your grandma
it's gonna look like a I knew going into
it I wanted to plan to the fall Fabio is
romantic yeah this feels her that I just
brushed up against this dark green
velvet jacket which like she has red
hair green red oh okay we'll keep it
going
have any of you seen Jasmine in a skirt
cuz I know I have it
or have I okay I'm keeping this one
she's gonna have this and we're gonna
find her a jacket I just kind of like
the Jean combo but we're not trying to
be basic these are great because you'll
have protection cuz people get a little
wild at the concerts if they're joking
around
uh-uh is her size it's the right color
it's beautiful
goodbye goodbye I don't like you bags
with this I was walking around and just
saw this envelope with my name on it
this is the Hunger Games
this has my name on it a little scary
honestly Jasmine you're halfway through
your shopping three but oh you want to
save money for a concert team the entire
outfit must come under 7 B echo xoxo
here I was thinking I was disposable but
then like 20 20 20 20 give my mixtape
shake it I actually didn't have to
right on target I'm gonna put this down
but can I hit these boots because now I
have a budget yes I think I do okay
I think I did better we are back I think
I did good I have a lot of experience
shopping some years on yeah but I also
like have never shopped in your size we
have two totally different styles so I
hope you like it I hope so I can't go
off I'm a little nervous because I think
this will be pushing
Avalon's boundaries just a little bit
all right let's see my outfit oh this is
great when I walk out of the closet and
I look in the mirror my thoughts were
van girl we're looking good
oh you look like you're ready for
something a little bit fancy but
everybody knows you're good
Oh pop Takada yeah I think you did
absolutely amazing I'm so proud of all
of it are you ready
I think jazz is really gonna like this
all right let's see your look oh my god
rooo I love it you did I truly loved it
it looked like a hipster American flag
up in here I'm so patriotic but for
myself proud that there's like this
emptiness here and it
with my socks the imagination in this
child is amazing I think so many props
to her I feel like you look like the 27
year old and I look like I have a new
revelation about 27 year olds they're
not much different I mean they're more
youthful than I am I can't wait to
evolve it today it's not even age that
matters it's just like personal style
let's turn teams like no they're sure
they're really growing into being them
confident selves every daughter now will
go to her father concert</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
