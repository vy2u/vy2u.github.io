minutes and I have two options because
I'm really good at shopping I don't know
what what go well with our trucks
oh hello didn't see you there
I'm jasmine and last time you saw me I
challenged my friend Kelsey to pick out
a going-out look for a team so we're
back bitches with a little holiday twist
let's welcome this week's twenty
seven-year-old to see you too my name is
Sarah and I'm 27 just like heaven you
have like a super your own aesthetic I'm
so excited to see that translate like
you picking out clothes for someone else
this 17 year old is first of all
adorable second of all reminds me very
much of you clean aesthetic but she's
herself
I'm excited yes let me go get the team
nice to meet there I'm Rebecca and I'm
17 years old we're wearing like the same
thing I'm excited for you to pick up my
outfit I'm excited too so what kind of
things do you like to do I like to dance
and I like boxing
what's my first impression of Roddick is
that she's really mature and she has a
very chic sense of style what do you do
I play a lot of video games and I use
Twitter I thought Sarah is really cool
and quirky I love her hair when I think
of 27 year olds it can do whatever they
want in life
it's mostly just about like scheduling
appointments and then sometimes having
fun I don't want to grow up yeah me
neither
you're already way more put together
than I was at 17 by 27 you'll be like
the queen of Los Angeles how would you
describe your style you think it's more
like rocker chic usually just wear black
that's my favorite color
she had that like awesome leather jacket
on or I was like okay she's kind of edgy
what about you I like a lot of textures
and patterns my clothes is sort of like
a funhouse I'm Indian we don't really
have a concept of Christmas actually
don't celebrate the holidays that much
cuz I'm Jewish I didn't even know for a
long time that like
holiday outfits was a thing until a
couple years ago and then I was like Oh
everyone's wearing sequins which are
some of my favorite things I like faux
fur or anything that would make me look
taller my mom thinks I'm really sure I'm
a little nervous because I don't exactly
know what she would like but I'm also
excited because I want to see how good I
am at picking out someone else's outfit
so do you want to go pick out outfits no
let's do it
sound excited I am this is excitement my
level all right ladies we are here at
Nordstrom you guys have 30 minutes to
shop for each other for a holiday party
look I will be checking in with you guys
20 minutes in to leave you a little
surprise get ready let's go you don't
know what's appropriate for a team I
don't want to like force someone to wear
something like super rich wait this way
this way this way
I know this Nordstrom like the back of
my hand it's three floors I didn't know
where to go this come to dressing I'm
thinking about others something that
matches with her hair
maybe maybe when it comes to shopping
and I'm pretty efficient my game plan is
to get something classy but also once
you saw it you'd be like whoa that teeth
is cool this is pretty awesome
it's a right undergarments it would work
al Sousa maybe but it's a slip dress I
don't know if that's her style okay
maybe this is cute sir came into this
challenge and the literally had her done
in ten minutes
Rattata on the other hand walked around
the whole store and just grabbed and
everything I don't know which one to
choose
we need fancy shoes just gonna put it
there hope no one takes it she told me
that she likes splash of color in her
clothing or red okay this sounds good
since we have time we have time then I
was like bags and that would go with the
dress the goggle doesn't match
I guess I'll look at excessive
oh my god how's it going good I think
then I've got some stuff going on here
yeah yeah already said I've got a new
career I have this little note for you
Oh know what this looks good I'm waiting
for the challenge let's see how that
changes everything Yuri :
I'm also here to tell you you have 10
minutes left
Jasmine came along with the worst poem
I've ever heard before you're done
shopping just a quick heads up you can't
forget to bundle up add a jacket to your
outfit to cover up and don't be afraid
to mix it up y'all rhymed up with up up
up and up I'm not that smart but I know
that's not how poems work just kidding I
am that smart so I have to get some kind
of jacket that's gonna keep her cozy on
those cold winter nights I just
literally became stressed out and picked
out like 10 different coats from the
racks shopping should be an exercise I
only have food it's hard to find a
jacket or something warm that's gonna be
adding to your look and isn't just like
oh now I'm wearing my puffy down coat
over my nice outfit and there were some
leather jackets a radical already had a
leather jacket that she was wearing so I
was like lint
let's get her something that she
probably wouldn't get for herself I feel
close to something what if she just had
a fur is this too luxurious for
a teenager so I finished with time to
spare so what else should I do but pick
up a couple things for myself oh okay
this is and
this okay I think I'm done I'm alright
ladies your 30 minutes is done I feel
super confident in these looks you both
did amazing we should go check it out
let's go all right we have your holiday
looks let's try it here you go
I'm excited do you think she gonna like
it I think you're I don't know how it's
gonna fit her I'm also just slightly
concerned that it might be too long I'm
not nervous about the fake fur though
alrighty I think she's ready erotica I
really like the outfit especially the
fur and the color oh my god you look
expensive I know you know that's what I
was actually surprised because I usually
don't choose a lot of colors in my
outfit plus I really love the color of
the shoes is this something you would
choose for yourself I probably wouldn't
but I'm glad that you chose it for me
you know woman the confidence I know
Sarah you were worried about this
consuming her but honestly I really
think this gives her some length and
then the heels being a different color
too it's just fun I love it
you're like a Christmas prisoner all
right well obviously you look amazing
yes we need to see sir I hope you like
it I'm nervous I think confidence in my
outfit choice but I'm also nervous
because I obviously want her to like it
I think it's gonna look great but let's
see it for ourselves
she's expensive I'm a rich lady yeah I
own a couple houses a couple summer home
that's the vibe it's going and you
nailed it
I definitely feel more mature than I
actually am it definitely has a vintage
vibe which isn't something that I
necessarily seek out I can see how this
is on the spectrum of like what I
described is my style but it's a lot of
fabric I honestly thought that the dress
was much shorter I did not realize that
it was gonna be longer this long but I
think it looks great on you I love the
red shoes are you sure I'm not super
into pointy toe but they are cute it's
the pop of color you you should be like
I do like that pop of color a lot and I
like the little M's and sparkly bit
definitely makes me think vintage
Christmas which is you look like the
widow who was acquitted of murdering her
rich ex-husband I think maybe in 20
years I'd be able to pull off this look
a little bit better it Sarah
did have a little bit more of a mature
look to her but I think it was good for
her to see herself like that and she can
definitely bring like her youthful fun
energy back Radhika
looked amazing it was way more bold than
she was used to which I think really
pushed her out of her comfort zone and
let her know like girl you can do that
you both look amazing and like you're
ready and prepared for this holiday
party you guys go off and be home by
midnight
I think Sarah is amazing she trusts me
in an outfit that cooler than any outfit
I would have chosen for myself I think I
look forward to being 27 I'm gonna have
ten dogs bungee-jumping just have fun 17
year olds are cool they definitely have
more of a sense of who they are than I
did when I was 17 but again they're not
that different from being 27 they just
have less freedom to waste money on
things they don't eat I'm gonna use the
rest this fabric to make a jacket it's
gonna be a new year but one of my
friends needs a new look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
