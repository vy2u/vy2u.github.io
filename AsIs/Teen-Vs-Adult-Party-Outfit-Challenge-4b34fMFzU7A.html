sure you don't know that boxers oh hello
and welcome back to 17 vs. 27 we have
done it all here concert looks going out
looks holiday look date night looks now
it's time for the ultimate party oh yes
girl work how are you okay thanks for
asking hi I'm quality and I'm 27 years
old this team Michele she's dope as
great style I'm very excited to see you
too and got clothes for each other
because you guys are totally
different they always say opposites
attract if anything that makes it more
exciting
exactly I was born a black woman let me
go get your chance she kyleannie mrs.
selle and i'm 17 your outfit so cute
thank you I love yours too I love that
you're like showing off the mid-drift
very body positive power yeah when I
first saw Michelle I was like incredibly
blown away by how confident and
vivacious she was so tell me about your
weekends what you do
so I'm pretty much in the gym or if
shopping I love their stores so we have
that in common
I don't really do the gym I really like
being outside so I go hiking my first
impression of Valenti she was like
really chill vibe like someone you could
go up to and say hi so what do you think
of a 27 year old my brother is 27 you
sort of old-school but still very modern
you nailed it so how would you describe
your style it's always like switching so
sometimes I go like super vintage with
it my style would best be described as
unique I care about color patterns and I
really like unique signature pieces it's
Friday night you're going out what's
this party like very chill but still
like a lot of dancing so you want
something that looks good on the dance
floor but they even still like move in
yeah comfortable okay rad how about you
I go to a lot of holiday parties for
work so I think something that I could
wear around my boss but still maybe get
laid you know some of that pulls a
little tail but still gets me that rage
yes is there anything you hate like if I
were to pick you something that you'd be
like I can't believe she did that
no I'm very open-minded to everything
about you I don't wear pants at all I
have never had anyone shop for me but
I'm really interested to see what she's
gonna style me are you ready to do this
yeah let's go shopping here's okay we're
at H&amp;amp;M you guys have 30 minutes I'll be
checking in 15 minutes in time startsnow
my game time was something chic and
modern looks hot
oh no never mind so dress I want to find
something that's like a signature piece
and then build the rest of the lift
around that I like this color it's
bright well let go simple skirt on the
bottom now we gotta look for a skirt so
she's not a pantsless and I was actually
thinking of putting her back she would
probably kill me what make me look
at first I was looking at a lot of the
elegant stuff but then I realized
halfway through that that's what I would
wear so I like regrouped and went
straight to like the street wear section
I want to go something that's like super
sexy but in a positive way I have a plan
start with the sex and then lead with
the sports so I found this Nicki Minaj
leather pleated skirt and kind of built
the rest of the look from there
I definitely added on top and she has a
pattern blazer and I found this jacket I
was thinking maybe like a vandal on the
bottom or just a bra then I remembered
her boss is gonna be there so no but I
want something like this in black
amazing I'm a little surprised at how
chill Kalani was during this she just
went for it and knew what she wanted and
had a clear vision she said a lot
earlier about like how she liked
dressing by different decades so I found
this really oversized sweaters everyone
was wearing in the 90s but had been
turned into a crop top it's a mom shop
for their kids they're like I think this
is what the teens are wearing and now
what I'm thinking is this is happening
so I feel like the final touches send
you out for their accessories and I saw
these heart-shaped earrings with eyes in
the middle some gold Sparkle tights that
I think will just hide a little bit of
sex to the left
spider Michelle thought she was hot with
her outfit oh I really like this
that's a great and then I came in and
throw a little wrench in her plan yeah
good luck Davis
how's it going I think I found my luck
it looks like you're dressing like a
Nicki Minaj Barbie dolls yes you go over
well this is for you you have 15 minutes
left
good luck before the party starts
tonight your outfit is not quite right
there's one more thing you need to add
to your collection a piece of clothing
from the men's section yes bitch this is
a men's shirt I live for that let's go
I thought no this can't be happening how
they gonna throw money like Oh first
thing I noticed when we hit the Med
section was it was like all of the color
had been turned down and then I see
these ha very much reminded me of
something that you'd see Arthur wearing
that kind of had like oversized sleeves
that you could easily wipe away tears
when I was kind a lot in high school I
don't know about her how are we gonna do
this there's guys accessories can their
boxers this may be the best party of her
life or she'll get food out of the party
I don't know oh they have gloves I
spotted some black gloves and I thought
why not it's so good I'm just obsessed
with this so maybe I'll just put it on
and then I actually changed my back and
I went back to my original code idea and
found this like a really incredible baby
inspired huffy jacket yeah really
feeling this really great so I'm
finished with my look before the time
you're doing Oh
we're gonna get shoes or no I heard it
off with some really basic relaxed feel
because want her to be a little taller
we got 30 more seconds all right your
time is up I'm a little surprised at
what we got each other but I'm excited
to see let's go all right I am so
excited to see both of these looks so
we'll Eleni pass yours off first darlin
I hope you like it I'm realizing that
looks exactly like what you're wearing
but it's not I'm walking on I feel like
even if she doesn't like it she'll at
least get to try some things that she
might not have picked out for herself so
I'm feeling pretty good about it
all right cool honey are you ready to
see Michelle I'm so excited oh I love
how you're wearing it off the shoulder
too stylin profilin I was very surprised
I'm one who's 10 years older than me was
pick an outfit like this it's very like
you know that I'm a wild card
I love the please this is working so
well in your butt I never thought that I
would wear the skirt to be honest but if
it's perfect and then the jacket if we
need a Rihanna vibe you know my favorite
part would probably be the top because
it's this okay and that's like my
favorite work you got the pops of yellow
got a little skirt but you're still a
little like athletics I am czar very
playful but earrings are like really
elegant at all I'm feeling very proud of
myself and now I want to go out and give
birth to a fully fledged 18 year old
teen skip the whole children part and
just get straight to dress him yeah
mm-hmm all right you ready it's funny
I'm not nervous at all about her trying
out my clothes but me trying out our her
clothes mix much my pants
yeah minute I pulled out the pants I was
like we talked about this I told her I
don't wear the pants and then I saw them
on that it's so good I mean incredibly
modest dresser didn't really realize
until I was wearing a spaghetti strap I
was like the world marked C my shoulders
this shirt and the scarf mom I love it -
I was like what good attention to detail
she looked at me and everything I chose
the spider cause like you like hiking
outside in the nature kill of that as
opposed to inside on the treadmill I
would never think to put pink velvet
with this like hounds - but I loved it
then girl no I love them and the shoes I
never wear high heels I'm like oh my god
I'm so tall
well can see the burl for the challenge
yeah I really throw we know we dig love
yeah you could kill someone yeah we're
gonna fit am i right
have you walked in at a party I would be
like okay she's serious I know I feel
like if I walk through the parties like
this I wouldn't be single all right you
both look so good I think it's party
time
I'll see you maybe next week and you got
to be home at 10:00 I uh I think every
generation of women hopes to pave the
way for the next generation of women and
being around her gave me a lot of hope I
think with this experience I'm gonna
revisit some other things what I don't
do cuz I might have some insecurities
that are just like hanging around
my younger days that are both 27 year
olds are really cool and they still got
spice in them but I like being a
teenager but she'll said that she would
never wear a skirt and then she put one
on and looking hot in it with quill
Eleni this bitch put on pants and was a
whole new woman which one of my friends
should I challenge mags no one because
the season's over this was the finale
but if you want us to come back maybe
watch some more can't do it just watch
it have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
