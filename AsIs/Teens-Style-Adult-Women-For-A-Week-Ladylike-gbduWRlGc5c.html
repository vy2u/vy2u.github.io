pretty stylist but what do the youths
think of our wardrobe its ladylike and
we're letting teens justice for a week
my style I think is more mom meets
sorority girl I wear a lot of sneakers I
don't really venture into like heels or
booties too much unless I have to
some days I feel like I'm super edgy
kind of like cool hip lesbian when I was
a teen I was wearing a lot of bright
colors I would wear hats from time to
time early 2000s was just a bad time for
fashion I'm actually demonstrating the
most high school outfit because I would
wear plain blouse jeans a splendid
cardigan of some sort yeah I'm excited I
want to fit in with the team
let's go get everybody dressed no I
think will be really easy for Jen to
incorporate what teens are wearing
we just need to incorporate her natural
style I don't think it would be hard for
Candice to pull off a team look it's
just all about owning it
I feel really futuristic right now like
ripped jeans cerulean right now like the
choker necklace is from the 90s are
definitely coming back
high-waisted skirts high-waisted pants
high-waisted shorts definitely crop tops
for sure they will be in forever
I can't do crop tops and on about that
line
I lost my Sheen again today was good it
was fun I feel like I bonded with the
youth yeah I appreciated how good they
were at respecting boundaries yeah yeah
we're excited it's pumping gonna be a
good week yeah it's pumping it's Palm
Bay so we've got all these clothes
yesterday I was feeling good and I woke
up and I felt so nervous is it gonna be
cool enough is it really with the teens
are wearing am I gonna make Liz proud
I'm kind of nervous that I'm gonna look
like a weirdo not because the outfit is
bad I'm just worried I'll look weird
because I'll feel uncomfortable and then
I'll be self-conscious got my Kylie lip
kit on so I'm ready to slay these tweens
90's resurgence and full effect
so what the kids are doing is what is
this what's this little getup Mart what
do you what are you referring to are
with the problems like super mist are
you supposed to button this I don't
think so
so I'm actually a lot more comfortable
in the outfit that I'm wearing today
it's a bit closer to what I would
actually wear just like as myself it's
cute you look like you have you do look
like a this is the tiniest thing I've
ever put on my daughter Oh
Humphry today I'm wearing nothing you're
doing spandex I'm wearing nothing under
this oh god what do you guys think of my
outfit it's gorgeous
I didn't realize with dressing for teens
I don't have the outfit I don't have the
accessories to wear the stuff that
Jasmine picked out for me like I don't
ruin the strapless bra so if you put me
in a tube tank it's like you're
tube top whatever I'm getting 90s
dominatrix vibes from my outfit today
but I like it it's quite revealing this
is the thickest choker I think I've ever
seen in my life
this outfits inspired by the teens how
do you feel I thought it was just
something you would wear like it looks
like a canvas house one winter pants you
have a lot of bra action no nothing it's
just like not Jen stop or alien hat
because she's on trend with the teens I
bought this off my own accord it's
Saturday it's my last day and I'm gonna
wear overalls and a baseball hat and
like any teen would do I'm gonna go to
the movies you look very cute it's very
short shorter than usual oh all right
all right
camera appear I let a team dress me for
a week and the results were slightly
uncomfortable pretty cool Pleasant but a
little scantily clad I have never
received more compliments than this week
I love these overalls but they were so
short like they were just booty shorts
which was fine for the beach but not
really for the office when I say some of
the clothing was uncomfortable sometimes
I mean that it was uncomfortable in that
I didn't feel like myself and sometimes
I mean it was uncomfortable in that it
like literally was uncomfortable this
see-through jacket was insane but I got
so many compliments it opened my eyes to
the fact that I'm not as team hip as I
thought I was I think on my next actual
shopping trip I'm gonna bring Liz so she
can guide
in the right rich it's okay to like get
out of your comfort zone and try
different things that you've always been
afraid to because when I did everything
was so great and people complimented me
and it was so nice and I felt cool
everybody like can pull off this stuff I
think or you can try to at the very
least it's just like you know you just
got to figure out where you're
comfortable listen to teens I'm just
kidding never listening but but teens
know where it's at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
