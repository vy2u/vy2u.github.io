hurt my vagina I'm pretty sure I got a
concussion that day my family we like to
vacation at lakes my dad my brother and
I would go out every Sunday and ride our
dirt bike this one like we would go to
had a lot of like paths that we could
ride our bikes on we come to this like
super steep hill and we're like yeah
whatever let's go there was a parking
lot where people would then Park the
empty boat trailers there was one of
those bike trails that led straight down
into that parking lot and so I'm zooming
up the hill as I'm coming down going
really fast
my sister is on her bike behind me a car
is coming I turn I say hey watch out for
this car and so as soon as I'm coming
over the top of this hill dead smack in
the middle of the path is a tree and
then by the time I look forward again
it's too damn late
I am inches from hitting a boat trailer
my bike went straight into the tree I
pluck and slam into that bitch just
 hit it my bike tire goes under
the trailer bucks me from the bike I
came up off my bike airborne as I fly
and land and just like if this is the
tree and this is me
crotch and face first if that's even
possible the Mac literally just legs
spread hit hit a bar to Mac and I was a
dumb kid so I wasn't wearing a helmet
it completely straddled it pull-on hit
that tree with so much I just fell to
the ground i black out I think I think I
got a concussion that day I never got
checked out and I was like I don't think
I can walk I think I broke my vagina
like I think it's broken I woke up maybe
like a half a minute later I had to
wobble back to the campsite um and yeah
you know yet again I'm surprised I still
have feeling in my vagina
um that was pretty bad and embarrassing
and then I didn't have a bike anymore
