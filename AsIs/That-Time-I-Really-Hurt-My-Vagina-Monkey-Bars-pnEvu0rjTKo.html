a really awkward moment with my mom it
was great it was so great and when I
think about it today I always crossed my
legs a little tighter I was about eight
years old um in elementary school it had
just rained I was standing on the monkey
bars to go across and the ladder you
would step up was just the metal bars I
was on the monkey bars with my sister it
was like a swing set where the swings
are attached and so I was waiting my
turn on the metal bars as the person was
finishing going across I was also
wearing these loose shorts at the time
and I fell down it was a rope swing I
slip my legs split and I fall right like
that onto the metal bar it was old
disgusting rough rope and it decided to
ride up my leg and I proceeded to rope
burn my lady part does not feel good at
all
I unhinged myself from the bar and was
in complete pain paralyzing pain I
couldn't move like I don't know what
just happened I'm a young child my
sister who was eight just like runs
inside comes out with my mom dad was
there too but he was like oh I don't
know what to do with this I like went as
fast as I could wobble to the classroom
start crying to her like oh my god ice
there was white men's there were tears
I'm really honestly just thankful I
still have feeling in my clit after that
because I'm sure I did some damage hit
it so hard on it fell
like real like imagine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
