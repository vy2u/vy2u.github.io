How about some dessert?
(lighthearted orchestral music)
- Don't get any ideas.
- No, no ideas here.
- I mean, there's no way to
eat this without, you know.
- So, where are you originally from?
- Oh, I'm actually from,
like, San Francisco, actually.
Right now I'm just like working
in LA. Just doing my thing.
- Umm, hmm.
- Hey, waiter.
(lighthearted orchestral music)
- Good.
(lighthearted orchestral music)
- I'm, um, I'm not actually sure.
Do got like, um... the
crack... the cracky thing?
In two, ooh. Uh, oh.
Do you want some?

(lighthearted orchestral music)
- Did I get it?
- No.
- Where? Did I get it?
- Um, somehow it's a lot worse.
- Oh.
- Yeah? Got it?
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.
(lighthearted orchestral music)
- Mmm. Oh my God, they do not
make it like this anymore.
Is it in my hair? Oh shit. Geez.
I think I just made it worse.
- I can't believe that happened.
I still can't believe that happened.
- I've had a really
good time on this date.
- Really? Yeah, this has
been a really great date.
I feel the same way.
- Yeah, maybe next time we
won't go to a restaurant.
- Yeah, we don't have to
go out for food next time.
We could go anywhere.
Let's get out of here.
