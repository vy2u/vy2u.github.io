that updated this is you okay well
actually this is me but imagine that
it's you I am you get it okay cool
let's move on it all started with Monday
like always Monday hits you like stack
of bricks huge was an understatement for
her personality you probably dated her
early on like maybe high school
ultimately she tried to fix you she was
too focused on the future have you
submitted your college applications yet
what are your career goals I want to get
married after college and then you met
her her name is blanking on me let's
just move on after that girl you decided
to try to mix it up you pretended to
like slam poetry and vegan bacon this is
Wednesday Wednesday gives you the urge
to start anew but at the end of the day
what is she that tree is no longer
because of you you'll never understand
poetry next came Thursday she got you
back on track
yeah Thursday was pretty and fun but it
felt like a filler you had things you
loved about her sure but it felt like a
routine it always felt like you were
waiting for something else it always
felt like you had to work at it Friday
was a perfect 10 pretty much the dream
she was a payday you felt free with
Friday but then Friday got a little
you couldn't keep up with Friday and
ended with tears and grouse after you
recovered from Friday you met Saturday
aren't we all just racing through Monday
through Friday in hopes that we can
finally meet Saturday Saturday was fun
and exciting she was different than any
other girl you've been with
you fell in love with Saturday
sometimes Saturdays don't always work
out we've had plans and hopes for
Saturday but at the end of the day you
look back and realize maybe Saturday was
a little disappointing maybe Saturday
wasn't everything that you wanted it to
be Saturday broke your heart and that
happens but I promise for every Saturday
you face there will be a Sunday you know
when you meet someone and then suddenly
everything makes sense that's Sunday you
can be yourself around Sunday Sunday's
help you reflect and be thankful for the
journey you've been on with Sunday
things are just easy Sunday's are
peaceful Sunday's help you become a
better person
I think everyone could use the Sunday
maybe things didn't work out with all
the other girls but you wouldn't change
that for anything the path to love is a
journey sometimes it can suck but it
helps to become the person you are today
Oh Tuesday how did I forget about
Tuesday your name's Tuesday
well Tuesday's aren't that memorable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
