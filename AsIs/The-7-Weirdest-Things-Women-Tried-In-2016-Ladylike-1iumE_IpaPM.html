don't want that one I want that we also
have a placenta masks and then we have
damn you get 20 to 30 minutes my skin
kind of feels like moisturize doesn't
feel dry or anything it just feels feels
new I do feel like it did sort of
rejuvenate the skin so I mean I feel
like I did its job this is like a
terrible trip to Home Depot burns real
bad so this is only making my skin drier
Oh fine oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's all
done whoa it's like a lawnmower I
wouldn't let this near my nipple but I
imagine if you had more precision this
could be good for nipple hair we're
doing it again airbrush makeup but this
time these brows well that was kind of
nice actually I might have picked the
wrong color actually that's pretty
precise for size okay this took two
seconds straight up I can definitely see
these little guys when they're here so I
wish the stencil were a little bit
bigger from the middle to the end it's a
little bit thinner than I would like for
them to be but all in all I'd be fine
leaving this room like this yes you
heard that right
sheet masks for your boob it's ladylike
and today we're trying breast masks and
I'm now excited just because these are
so cute feels like I just got slimed
it does feel moisturized and I feel
sticky I don't feel flaky I mean I feel
colder
I just feel soothed and nicely scented
it's ladylike and we're oiling our pubes
for week
they're also tried the pew oil it did it
didn't really do anything for me I kind
of felt like um Justin Bieber it was
very fun but nothing really happened can
you how do you wash your hands
I'm becoming each year oh I don't think
you can
well you can I think you have to wash
them like this just keep working this is
fancy eight and the question was can you
DIY intricate nail art the answer must
be no resounding No
when I did wear pads the butt part was
always the one that would get me cuz you
know when you're like sleeping or lying
down or sitting the stains end up like
back here but then you also have to be
sure that you don't slide it too far
back because then you miss stuff from
the front hey I'll click on that post
over there to see more videos from our
channel some of our favorites are in
there and some we like just okay but
watch anyway because he loves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
