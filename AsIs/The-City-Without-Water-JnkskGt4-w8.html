never earthquake you just don't see it
this problem is not gonna be resolved
you know I think this is kind of like a
a slow thing almost like a disease that
kind of takes over it's slow you don't
see it until it starts just taking home
last year was actually the driest year
ever in the corn history in California
what nature had not provided watered
down in the valley millions of acres
would have remained a barren waste if
the men who settled this part of the
valley had not used their knowledge and
strength they dug wells worlds were
people's wells are going dry that that's
never occurred before when I started
going door-to-door I realized what
terrible conditions people were living
in because of lack of water so I got
donations and my husband and I also
bought some water and started helping
people
this is lucky sometimes I was so thirsty
and I just find this angel in the middle
of the desert yeah you are in cheer for
me me and my neighbors we are getting
drinking what a big round that
somebody's done it these showers right
here have not only the shower but they
have toilets inside this is for the
handicapped we have two units right here
we have 24 units over there a week ago
they said 596 homes without any water
but on a daily basis you gear up another
whirl that went right I live the Bakken
and the Sun so I think that's the child
right there in the middle of the of my
jar
because my kids they already grown up I
have three sons some acting two are in
the military service on top in happiness
to to our poor country President Obama
sent them a lots of water and food for
all their countries what about us we are
in the same country we need the help too
we need the home
and city council day I went or when to
two of them for help they said no lady
they told me Miss Beltran she said no
because you don't have cancer and you
don't have any disease due to the
drought parents have no jobs this is a
farming community if there is no water
nobody's farming most of these people
are either unemployed right now or will
be unemployed person the federal
government has done nothing really at
this point is this is a natural disaster
it needs to be treated as such and it
hasn't been police don't lose hope
things are going to get better and for
those that are listening if you could
help different organizations or myself
get more supplies to people I would be
really grateful and most of all the
people are grateful because they realize
each time you come and say people care
that people care that they're not
forgotten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
