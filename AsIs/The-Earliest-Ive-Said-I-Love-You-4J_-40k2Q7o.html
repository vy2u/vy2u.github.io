us dating got him I'm starting to get
hot this story ah
quickest I've ever said I love you to
someone was my high school boyfriend
because he said it first at like three
weeks in okay I think six months six
months certainly not early three months
two months into a relationship my first
love in seventh grade only lasted a
summer but I'm sure within that summer
we dropped the bomb a few times a year
I'm not the one to say at first but I
always feel it first I flew across the
country to New York and after about five
days we were in a cab on the Queensboro
Bridge and I just I just had to say it
we were at a rave we were highschool
loves like that did end up happening but
at the time I was like I think the first
time that we said it was actually
through it like it was through like
messaging like a sea of people in the
stand and we were up in the stadium and
I was like I love you and my vision just
went red cuz I was like what did I just
do I just said that and but he said it
back that was good it can be too soon to
tell someone that you love them it is
when you're young you're just so excited
to be in love with somebody because you
haven't been in love with somebody
before so you're like oh maybe this
feeling of super infatuation is love I'm
just going to say that it's love you're
like you got to wait it's got to really
mean something you know got a count if
you were in a monogamous exclusive
relationship I don't think it's ever
really too soon if you actually feel
that way I think that if you're really
in tune with your partner um you kind of
sense when the right time or you have
like an arranged when the right time is
to say it when you know you know but
you're afraid to tell the other person
you know it's like it's more of like an
understanding of a conversation need to
have if you're legitimately in love with
someone and it's like legit and it's
okay to tell them whatever you want if
you're gonna harm your relationship by
tying someone that you love them too
soon then there's a lot of other issues
going on at the end of the day you
should have a oh why did I say that
verses out what if because that person
could get hit by a bus
and then you're gonna regret not saying
it you're never going to know if they
felt it back I think you should say I
love you without expecting anything in
return if you say it too soon sometimes
there's nothing wrong with that I feel
like the beautiful thing with I love you
is that you could say it in a bunch of
different ways don't forget an umbrella
it's raining the little things you do
like brushing someone's hair back behind
your ear getting that piece of food out
of their teeth when you feel it you feel
it right no no I don't know when you
actually know you're in love
maybe when you have the strength to say
that you're in love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
