prove I wasn't gay I dated so many dudes
as a way of saying look at this guy I'm
dating I'm totally not gay instead I was
only fooling myself first there was the
dreamboat
who's the definition of manliness and
the dream guy of any straight girl he
was fit and objectively sexy and the
ultimate demise of the relationship was
my unwillingness to have sex with him
next came the sensitive artist a mutual
love for art and poetry brought us so
close actually felt a genuine connection
to him it was much more of a friendship
than a relationship you know you're my
best friend
yeah totally next was the long-distance
boyfriend this was great because it was
100% emotional and 0% physical but when
he wanted to come visit and I said
please don't
it started the beginning of the end a
movie honestly really the only one who's
sure to love for brown ales and baseball
like I do sometimes I listen for the
sheer fact I no longer have a sports
watching bro just laughed in the chain
of fake boyfriend's the fellow
closet-case Tim and I were both so deep
in the closet we were finding Christmas
presents our fashion sense was nearly
identical and our deep concern for LGBT
equality was both suspicious to the
other I couldn't play this game anymore
finally I stopped pretending to be
someone I'm not
it's great to finally experience life
with someone I truly care about and want
to be with and I've never been happier
it's here it's here here what get it
there I got it get it yeah you get
it it's here quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
