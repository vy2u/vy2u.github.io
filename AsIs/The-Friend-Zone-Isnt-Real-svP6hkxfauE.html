perfect you're the best I'm gonna go get
some nails all right yeah what's up Tom
yeah man I'm at Jane's dude she has me
hanging picture frames dude you're
totally right I'm totally in the friend
zone ah we've all seen this before boy
meets girl boy and girl get along boy
and girl don't sleep together and then
boy resents girl for not reciprocating
feelings but I just helped her move and
hang these picture frames I mean that's
got to get me something right like at
least her love and affection no Alex it
doesn't as you can see it's become an
epidemic one that's been around since
your dad pledged alpha sig and it has a
name the friend but what is it the
friendzone is a term created to define
the relationship between one person
seeking sexual intimacy with another
person who is not this affliction makes
a person believe that because they're
nice they're entitled to sex it's a
psychological phenomenon that occurs
when a person cannot cope with rejection
due to their fragile fragile eco if you
or someone you know has been affected by
the friendzone you're not alone my best
friend of 10 years
Timmy thought the friendzone existed I
found him screaming into a pillow in the
middle of the night when my boyfriend
and I were staying in the room next door
you know we've been friends for 10 years
and he never expressed any sort of
interest in me
and here's if he had I mean yeah I don't
think I would have been into it and
that's no one's fault
it's just how attraction works that's my
friend Tiffany to help me move into my
apartment but she just kind of never
left when I asked her to help me go to
bed not share one when Travis asked me
out for drinks I made it clear I just
wanted friendship seriously I said okay
but just as friends two gin and tonics
later he's putting on Natalie Imbruglia
Storn on the jukebox and it's calling me
a heartless bitch
while there is currently no cure you can
take action start by doing small things
like telling your friend affected that
you will never ever ever ever sleep with
them and eliminate any shred of doubt
Wow
I see now that just doing nice things
for friends because the only thing I
should expect in return is friendship
if I tell Jane how I feel and she
doesn't feel the same way I can feel
hurt but I shouldn't take it out on her
exactly got the nails
hey you ain't gets pizza after this I'm
starving sure you're such a great friend
and I'm okay with that
Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
