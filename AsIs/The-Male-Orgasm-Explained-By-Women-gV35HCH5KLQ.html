like I think I don't think it'll be hard
I'm pretty good at arts and crafts
male orgasm seemed pretty cut-and-dry
like I did it I'm done my work here is
finished an eruption of good feeling I'm
not like lava lava sacks so like maybe
like rainbows yeah let's do a purple
volcano because that's a magical color
male orgasm is a massive confusion first
step is just like knowing that this is
your end goal these are the happy little
spermies it's like you're taking a kid
to Disneyland and waiting in line for
hours to go on a ride and then the ride
is two seconds so this is like the first
stage of the male orgasm when they lose
their minds and they can't think about
anything else except for the fact that
they're about to have an orgasm this is
exactly what an orgasm feels like like
smiley faces shooting out of a horse
oh that got graphic quickly the eyeball
is part of the mass confusion of the
initial like am I about to come really
intense and violent now I'm just
thinking of pompey maybe as metaphor
whatever we're sticking with it and then
we go into like the hazy part where it's
all like colors and bright and it's like
an LSD trip sighted energy going off in
different directions I'm shadowing
because I feel like Bob Ross this is the
end result probably should have done a
man falling asleep feel like when you
have an orgasm your ability to
articulate kind of falls away I think
capturing the male orgasm on paper is
much easier than it would have been if
it was a female orgasm I don't know if I
think a man's orgasm is better they're
just different it's a rite of passage to
be a man I had an orgasm I'm gonna go
tell all my friends that I had one I
really couldn't save man's orgasm was
better than I was orgasm cuz like
sexuality is such a diverse and
beautiful thing there are so many
categories have been in between that EP
because they had to work less hard to
get there it's like not as enriching
like maybe are like rainbow volcano is
more fantastic like Care Bear level
right
maybe there's this like five-year-old
drawing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
