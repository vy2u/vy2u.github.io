right path hoping to bring a lot of
spunk and a whole lot of smizing to this
competition who I am more than what I
look like is my secret weapon
yung Chaka Khan I'm every woman got
better watch out cuz I'm scared so I
think that advantage from he is being
almost 50 years old I have a little bit
of wisdom to have they selected me for a
reason
and girl let me tell you something I'm
not to bring her to the competition this
week's celebrity guest judge is the one
and only Ashley Nell Tipton not only did
she win Project Runway Season 14 but she
also is a design consultant and even has
her own apparel eyewear and jewelry line
Ashley thank you so much for being here
for having me hoarse I am honestly
honored to be in your presence and I'm
so excited for you to be here during our
Fifi Michelle I'm excited yeah that's
some work since I know
we got a day this week the challenge was
hashtag no filter and our competitors
were sent a little video made by me
let's see it
hey contestants and welcome to your
first challenge for feed famous a lot of
people on your feed use apps like Beauty
cam facetune and Photoshop to clean up
their little imperfections on their
photos but here on feed famous we ain't
about that life we want you to embrace
your imperfections and show us who you
really are
this week's challenge is called hashtag
no filter I want to see the raw
unfiltered confident aesthetic you being
your most honest true self
is gonna make you the most confident you
four literally the rest of your life so
let's start it now remember you can only
use your phones and no filters good luck
friends how do you feel about the
hashtag no filter challenge I think it's
great we need to be real with ourselves
and real with this world and show them
who we are because no one's perfect
we're all beautiful in our own ways and
I think this is such a great challenge
that I might go home and do it okay this
week our contestants will be judged on
three factors the first factor is
composition we're looking at framing
we're looking at posing we're looking at
lighting the second factor we're looking
for is the brunette factor did they go
over and beyond the last factor we're
looking for is the feed worthiness would
you scroll past their picture or would
you be double tapping that picture would
you leave a comment
our first competitor that we're looking
at this week is divinity divinity is
from LA and is also like this boss ass
woman that I'm so excited for I'm
already excited yeah let's see what she
got good morning my name is Tiffany and
I'm ready to slap a hoe it flip wigs
it's gonna be great only I don't know
what I'm gonna be doing hashtag
no filter which I find particularly odd
because I'm like the filter Queen like
being vulnerable and showing the real
you all your imperfections should be go
for head or for me my eyebrows being
like the whole Grand Canyon apart from
each other I'm excited about the
challenge in that aspect place so all
the colors only and I put other people
and create real relationships it just
pushes you to embrace the things that
makes you like everyone else cuz
everyone has something you know what I'm
saying like everybody got something is
to embrace that and to push myself to
that limit because honey I'm ready so
let let's do this
I really really love this photo she
looks like she's enjoying herself I love
that she doesn't have a wig on or makeup
she's just bare and it's pure beauty in
this pose that's like a part of your
body that I feel like nobody has ever
been likely I just leave the back of my
thighs and there she is like rocking
composition wise I think she did amazing
but so well lit the poses perfect like
she looks great I think she really
excelled for the brunette factor because
I really just like trust her with this
but she just looks so good and so
comfortable yes I think for feed
worthiness it would get like four tops I
honestly yes save a comment screenshot
everything this powerful our next
competitor is Victoria Victoria is
originally from Venezuela okay lives in
LA now and is a paralegal I know
hi everyone Vicki here's challenge
number one no filter challenge I know
crazy it's one thing supporting natural
beauty and it's another thing to
actually do it in front of the whole
world so I'm here at the Malibu Creek
State Park and I'm going to the bull
Creek the weather is kind of chilly and
there's so much wind you guys not only
follow me it's for sure Wow can we go do
this right after we're done hard to like
put down the wall of insecurities that I
have
have a lot of stretch marks everywhere I
tend to hide them
another one of my securities are my arms
because they are very big and they're
like just I don't love my arms so you're
just gonna see everything but this is
our first challenge I see what you guys
did there okay you're just trying to
color hide so feel like you just want to
see all our garden abilities and as hard
as it may be I'm gonna try to give it to
you
this is beautiful to me this is natural
beauty she's in nature this is our first
person we get to see outside of the
natural lighting in her environment yes
I love I should just stop right now
we don't need to look at anyone no I'm
kidding composition wise the lighting is
insane every pose is different yeah and
she carries the same vibe in each shot
her bring it factor like that's out the
window I mean you saw her she was in the
water she has all the elements here she
pushed herself it's creative it's
fashionable I could see this in a
magazine or in a somewhere you know like
follow her on Instagram right now and
just look at her worthiness actually
this is great I'm like I'm blown away so
katie is from Dallas Texas accent right
yeah she is so cute and so sweet and I'm
interested to see how Katy pushed
herself this week let's see so for our
first challenge I wanted a really
organic what was most important to me
was to go bare face and have my hair
pulled back that is such a huge security
blanket for me I actually never came
picture without any makeup on you know I
always feel like you know everything has
to be perfect my hair my makeup my
outfit and you know I am worthy to feel
beautiful and confident when it's just
me
okay I need you about this she looks
cute we have our third no makeup yes the
setting is cute
yeah I'm just missing like creativity
yes yes I'm just missing a little like
huh it's a beautiful picture yeah she
got the pouty lips right she's beautiful
as far as composition wise even if she
kept on that outfit but just did a
different pose I think it might be more
interesting it's like she's trying to
hide me I agree with nothing wrong with
that damn right for the bring it factor
I think it was a little short you have
to get creative with your natural
lighting basically would they go a great
wall or a great backdrop that's going to
bring everything together for the feed
worthiness I don't know if this is
something that I would like aspire to
recreate I like that she took a
challenge for herself I do agree she put
her hair up I feel like this would be
one of those pictures that she would
like post and then this would inspire
her to like okay next time I'm gonna
push myself more exactly
moving on Tony I don't know even needs
an introduction Tony is from Philly and
we're just gonna roll on Tony because
Tony Tony
Tony's here sorry for the beat I just
took a picture for Instagram you know
how to serve up some 60s film is a
little bit of you know lady vagabond
this way but anyways just like I wake up
like this literally SH my inspiration
Wow
research and I was thinking if you'd
stripped me from all my makeup stripped
me from all my clothes I'm basically
baring my true soul shave my armpits to
be like a commercial and my true self is
a voice for people that are scared to be
themselves and that are scared of what
people are gonna say about them I'm
thinking of myself as an angel you know
Gambetta buckley dog thief cause y'all
know y'all and fall Oh
Wow
okay Tony won't leave Wow literally
always I think I need this printed out
above my art gallery okay first category
composition so I'm a little confused
I thought Photoshop was not allowed this
challenge I think I'm okay with the fact
that he used Photoshop in the background
as long as it's not on him which it
doesn't appear to be for the bring it
factor
I feel like Tony brought it but the
other way the creativity is definitely
there
lastly feed worthiness I think I would
probably like this yeah and I would
comment like Tony what the exactly like
I want to know what his caption is all
right Tony thank you rosie is up next
Rosie lives in West Hollywood now and is
also our oldest competitor at 48 years
old you better bring it I know I'm
excited no filter as you can see I am
completely unfiltered with my face oh my
guy I gotta be honest I'm a little
scared but I'm gonna go out of my
comfort zone big-time I'm wearing this
piece that's from 1950s it's kind of
like a bra panty onesie kind of like a
bathing suit but I would never wear it
out I'm gonna be exposing a part of my
body that I have not liked since I was
10 the thighs I've had weight
fluctuations for the past 20 years I've
been as small as a hundred and five
pounds and as big as 200 pounds who
cares it's not the point because it is
about loving yourself I am gonna wear
one of my fans to dance eat mmm
you know what do you call this necklaces
you go and get myself outside it might
be people out at 7:00 a.m. in West
Hollywood
use your bathing suit showing all my
naughty bits you know what challenge on
yes her not smiling almost makes it
better the fifties like pin-up girls
they're always just like smiling or
smirking and she's like no no no I get
ya owning what she's wearing yeah energy
everything I feel like Rosie did okay
composition wise I like the angle I wish
it was just a little bit brighter I
would have left to see more of her face
Beauty gonna bring it factor I think it
has been brought to you she brought it
that's really gutsy to go outside and
wear that at 7:00 a.m. yeah four feet
worthiness what are you thinking I wish
like you said there was a little bit
more lighting I dress there's must be a
contrast that really stands out besides
her in her position and her energy this
picture if it was on my feet it would
have to be a big caption and I would
have read it exactly than just seeing
the picture and being like oh this is
great
you know our last competitor that we're
reviewing is Oso Oso is from
Jacksonville Florida you can just tell
by looking at him and watching him he is
just a ball of sunshine I'm ready yes
yes all right y'all so we just found out
our first challenge and guys this is not
a drill I am cringing I am panicking
I am scared I am also have an addict and
this is my intervention
I love filters honestly it's something
that helps me embrace one of my
insecurities which is fresh shoulders
I know y'all would say shave it but then
it comes back darker and we're not
having that so I'm thinking about
embracing that insecurity for this
challenge so we'll see
he got real creative with the lighting
shading and he had like a story behind
it I just jumped right in no no I agree
I just think he looks so beautiful and
peaceful and stylish at the same time I
think composition wise he looks well lit
where he's supposed to be in the shadows
hit perfectly I also feel like he
brought it like I feel like the styling
right yes he pushed himself the last
factor feed worthiness I would like this
like it's gonna change those were six
competitors
I am super nervous but also very excited
because we need to now pick out who is
our winner
and who is being kicked off the feed the
thing that I love about Divinity's
picture is that Katie had the same
mindset right but divinity took us there
with composition with the lighting with
the pose if you want to do a bedroom
shot yes how you do a bedroom shot like
any personality to shine through you can
tell that she's kind of uncomfortable
doing this no filter shot I really
appreciate her pushing herself out of
her color zone I just wish it was just a
little bit more so with Rosie's the way
she described herself and what she's
doing and what this challenge meant to
her you can see off the bat or if it
comes from with this picture I wish it
was just a little bit more creative all
right Victoria I love this photo this I
think holistically is like what I would
have wanted yeah like if you were to see
a title that said no filter and then you
see this right underneath it makes
complete sense she doesn't even need the
makeup this could be winning material
for me
I agree oh so was definitely in my top 2
looking at the shadows looking at the
lighting Oh so brought it he did I
definitely loved his spirit
energy it's so strong but I think
comparatively Victoria still just
brought me to like a new place osos was
great though I'm so pleased with this
tell me you you're confused he's
creative yes I don't know if he really
hit the challenge I agree what we were
expecting even if this part of him was
blown up more exactly see him more
because the focus point is the wings
it's not him that's not gonna last very
easily yeah it was good but I think it's
just a little missed yeah all right
I think we know who is this week's
winner and who is unfortunately off the
feed let's give them a call do this hi
