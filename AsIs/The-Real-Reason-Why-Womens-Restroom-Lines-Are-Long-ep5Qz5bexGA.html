until you have to use the bathroom and
you realize the woman's restroom line is
longer than the Great Wall of China how
exactly does this happen at the end of
the day we all do the same thing we piss
we poo and we go before a woman it's a
long wait before we even get inside the
restroom according to a study by Ghent
University woman on average wait about 6
minutes and 19 seconds compared to men
who weigh about 11 seconds a woman's
restroom break takes about a minute and
a half on average while a men's restroom
break takes only about a minute reasons
why women tend to take long in the
restroom include sitting to pee opening
and locking restroom doors clothing that
takes longer to take on and off tending
to menstruation needs using toilet paper
more often than men tending to
children's restroom needs more often
than men and sometimes women
breastfeeding feel more pressured to use
bathrooms so a quick solution to this
problem is larger women's restrooms the
same space that can accommodate 10
toilets in a woman's restroom can hold
10 urinals and 2 toilets in a men's
restroom thus allowing men to move in
and out of the bathroom much quicker
than women in order to average out the
wait time the woman's restroom would
need 1.5 to 2 times as many toilets
flush journals as the men's room another
remedy to this problem is designating
all bathrooms as unisex in a study done
with gender-neutral restrooms with 20
toilets the average wait time for
everyone was 2 minutes and 10 seconds so
at the end of the day we have the tools
and the resources to make waiting the
women's restroom line a little less
shitty thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
