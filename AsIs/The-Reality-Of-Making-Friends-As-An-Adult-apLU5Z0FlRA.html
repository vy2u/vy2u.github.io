like literally yours ask someone to play
with you and then your friends when
you're a teenager your friend group will
become more defined and in college it
will expand but after college everything
can change and your friends from
childhood might not be around anymore
you may assume that everyone already has
established friends and isn't looking
for anymore ah this can make you feel
like an ugly duckling all over again
quack quack even a duck needs friends
families work responsibilities who has
time for friends with all that making
new friends can also be really awkward
basically just as awkward is dating oh
my god that movie look so good yeah I
totally want to see it yeah okay okay
bye bye just ask them to hang out
they're probably waiting for you to ask
we are all passengers on the SS
friendship
see see what I did the friendship you
have to make time to hang out you me
8:30 drinks follow your passions take a
class
chances are you make a new friend I like
your boss oh my gosh thank you friend
embrace people that are different from
you after all
variety is the spice of life once you
open yourself up
friendship is inevitable meow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
