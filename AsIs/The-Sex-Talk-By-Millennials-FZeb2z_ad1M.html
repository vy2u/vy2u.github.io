consisted of me being 12 years old in a
Chinese restaurant and my dad had me in
very old condom underneath the table and
he simply said for practice my mom just
said she wanted to talk and brought out
a book to help depict you know what
happens when a man and woman fall in
love it was just like this is a penis
and this is a vagina and this is what
happens my dad talked about sex me once
and he told me that the way sex happens
is you eat a watermelon seed and then it
grows and then they cut your stomach
open and then it becomes a baby I've
never had the talk with my parents oh
man this is a complicated conversation
and it's kind of like think oh god this
dip it's okay it's difficult I see why
parents dread this it always starts it's
like when a man and a woman really or
when two people now I'm getting paranoid
about the genders um when TV well are
you know I love and they care about each
other
you talked about it you're both in
agreement they decide to become one with
each other through um yeah unifying
bodies your private area connects with
their private area this is a thing you
have an emotional connection sometimes
it is to have a baby sometimes it's to
show your love for someone um sometimes
it's out of passion sex is very
vulnerable and it's fun it's super
important that you feel good and it's
normal it's totally cool whatever you
think you're going through or thinking
about that makes you feel alone and like
you're super weird and you're a freak
and you're a pervert you're not unique
you are not unique don't be embarrassed
it's totally human nature everyone does
it it's how we are here sex isn't just a
conversation that's about an activity
it's about identity and gender issues
and emotional relationships between
people you need to make sure that every
step of the way everyone is on the same
page and having a good time even if you
have certain beliefs like you know that
you need to wait and you need to do
certain things it doesn't mean you're
not a sexual person who's having all
these feelings so you should probably
still be allowed to talk about them
being comfortable with your sexual
health and being able to express
yourself sexually is a really important
part of who you are as a person I knew
more and yeah I'd feel more comfortable
with myself in my body and you know took
a while to get there because no one ever
talked to me about it
I know that people don't ask these
questions because it's awkward and
shameful and it's embarrassing
I feel like erasing the shame around
anything that's happening for kids that
truly is like super important the way to
improve I think we shouldn't put
negative stigma against like exploring
the body if we from an early age we
started talking about biology and
Anatomy we could get past that awkward
phase a lot faster we see sex as this
like bad word and until it's not a bad
word anymore it's always going to be
awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
