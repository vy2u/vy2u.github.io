something you do not have to be afraid
of sex is awesome sex can be a lot of
fun but you just need to know your body
and know that you're comfortable with
what's happening sex obviously should be
consensual and that you should be
comfortable with the other person but
first and foremost you should be
comfortable with yourself communication
is very important in sex and if you
don't feel like you can talk to the
person you're having sex with you
shouldn't be having sex with that person
your body parts shouldn't have like
nicknames like you should call it what
it is like vagina pain is and it doesn't
matter if you feel like your friends are
having sex before you wait you cannot
wait as long as it's something that
you're making that decision for yourself
if you're a girl you do not have to have
sex with a boy and if you're a boy you
don't have to have sex with a girl you
shouldn't be nervous or embarrassed
about your body I think a lot of times
for people who don't fit like a very
narrow mold that that message is not
said often enough or loud enough sex
should be a pleasurable experience and
it's not going to be if you don't know
how to take care of yourself
masturbation is good people think that
like sex is going to be like the movies
a bit sex is probably gonna be a little
awkward the first time or the first
couple of times like putting a contact
in it's weird for the first couple of
times there's a lot of other ways to do
it so this doesn't doesn't have to be
the full definition and there's no shame
or nothing wrong with having it you just
need to be aware of the risk STDs are
real be safe
listen to your doctor use protection
comes are very important one of the most
damaging things that people think about
sex is that once you've had it that
something is missing or gone especially
for women and that's people put
way too much pressure on the first time
having sex like there's going to be
plenty of other times it's not this like
one all be all kind of thing
it's gonna smell like a vagina and if
you as a person who's in close contact
with the vagina has a problem with that
you're not mature enough to be in close
contact with a vagina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
