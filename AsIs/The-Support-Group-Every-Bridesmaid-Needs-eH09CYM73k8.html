bridesmaid 17 times
welcome to bridesmaids Anonymous let's
get started shall we

nervous

never been a bridesmaid but my best
friend just asked me to be in her
wedding which is great she's great
cept she's started changing I knew I
needed help when she asked me to dye my
hair blonde because she's the only
brunette allowed I'm in the alternate
this is a safe space to heal and grow
from not only our past in your case
future nuptial tormenters we are safe we
are loved we should not have to throw an
extra for you to have a mimosa fountain
at your bridal shower well can I just
talk to her reason with her okay you're
serious okay um sorry I'm Lauren I've
been a bridesmaid six times hi Lauren I
was in my childhood best friend's
wedding she dictated everything I had to
wear for every single wedding related
event all of which had huge ash flows
everywhere she made me do this weird
wedding diet with her I was eating for
three months we're smoothies made of
fiber diet pills
and dish oil so that's not even the
worst thing they had a cash bar I'm
Brianna I've been a bridesmaid five
times I ran the last wedding I
bridesmaid it was in Philadelphia dead
of winter but the theme was summer she
had us where these strapless tropical
dresses and said that if we wore jackets
it would suspend the disbelief of the
vibe I ended up guzzling champagne to
stay warm and passed out during her
mother's speech about unconditional life
I woke up in a frozen puddle of my own
piss maybe I can ask her to let me wear
a blonde wig right make things better
um I'm Brittany I've been a bridesmaid
eight times hi Brittany uh yeah the last
time that I had bridesmaid Duty her
designer friend he basically just
wrapped me in Tolle ribbon that was the
color of circus patience then she taught
us it's like intense choreography to
Nicki Minaj's anaconda and that's
ribbon dress unraveled from the middle
of my twerk pivot
and my friends my family and my
childhood Minister saw my vagina saw my
vagina it's important to remember that
we will be here for you well can't I
