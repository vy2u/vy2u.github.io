doing a glitter makeup challenge we're
gonna create a makeup look with as much
glitter as possible I think glitter has
always been a staple in like the makeup
lover community I freaking love anything
sparkly it's definitely a trend one that
I'm scared of there's like the no makeup
makeup trend and then there's the like
yeah I'm being wearing makeup makeup
lovers are brave souls they're not
afraid to like get it in their eyes I'm
pretty sure I'm gonna get all so I've
been literally served glitter makeup on
a platter it's like in my face
glitter makeup am I gonna go for I
normally go for like a minimal makeup
look but glitter makes me want to go all
in what I usually like to do is I like
to start with in a lighter color on the
inner part of my lid and then go for a
darker towards the outer it's like a
makeup chef I want more gladder I always
end up just putting on too much and then
there's no way to go back and then I
have to walk outside looking crazy I
feel like I need to hear like some sort
of crazy 80s pop music while putting all
this glitter on glitter everywhere let's
go for some glitter liner I look like I
came out of the club at 3:00 a.m. and
I'm still looking for an after party a
little Instagram baddie know start
that's pretty cool actually like that oh
my god I will walk outside looking like
this and dare someone to say something
they always do this thing in the nose
and then they apply little bit here and
then they go like this and then here
this is actually really cool oh my god
so I'm lining the lips so you can see my
lip shape and not just have it look like
I've put a bunch of glitter on a plate
and then kissed it I a such a good idea
it worked oh that worked I always do
primer on our eyebrows oh I got it on my
teeth here and hopefully all of this
will come off later otherwise I'm gonna
look like a holographic princess for the
rest of the day part of the pleasure of
also the glitter lips is that like men
will be like oh why would you put that
on your lips and it's like this isn't
for you this is for me this is as far as
I want to go I'm really feeling baha'i
lighter you didn't go from mermaid to
executive from the future I'm honestly
in love with this highlighter go for the
holo highlighter you feel like a
sparkling Pony that's a really cool
thing that people are enjoying wearing
makeup and using it in a way where it
kind of sparks joy for yourself
I'm really glad glitter is back as
glitter is fun don't think that a
particular glitter or whatever is not
for you you know whether that's because
you have a certain complexion or you
know certain hairstyle or just a certain
style in general definitely experiment
and play with all the glitter that you
can get your hands on don't take
yourself too seriously guys life's too
short for that glitter yourself up the
world glare all the way in
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
