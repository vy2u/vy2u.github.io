hello it's Jasmine here and we're in
Union Square Park in New York and we got
some lipsticks and we got some New York
Street food and we're trying this
out it's off what are you doing I'm
trying the NYX liquid suede in the color
Oh put it on and I will I will put it on
I'm a big fan of dark lipsticks liquid
lipsticks and NYX so I'm hoping this
will go well I'm also a big fan of hot
dogs okay here we go I say this color is
gorgeous I into it oh you look so good I
feel more connected with you right now
what do you think of the color I mean
I'm very into this color formulas like a
little bit sticky well it's dark so it's
a little unforgiving how's the dog look
at this dark ring around the tip of my
wiener we don't like that no I've
definitely marked my territory here you
know this is my hot dog and no one
else's go suck go soft you know what not
horrible
most of the kind of fallout or the
residue with on the hot dog itself which
is fine because I ate it and I eat so
much lipstick I'm sure anyway that it
doesn't really matter a little bit of my
butthole lip has appeared the butthole
lip I would give this like an 8 out of
10 I think you still look great yeah
definitely
Gus so what lipstick are you trying to
that the new Mac lip density collection
this little beautiful fuchsia let's try
putting it on very buttery very lips
after you eat popcorn at the movies more
Barbie than I usually go but I feel like
if you wear it with black it balances
out the happy and the satin our life I'm
eating a chili dog with onions and
sauerkraut so get ready to make out out
for this I really would like to end
lipstick right off on my cheek
first of all how was the hotdog I've had
better honestly
besides my chin tattoo I actually think
this is great and it feels fine out of
ten what would you get this like a nine
honestly I mean the only negative is
this but that's just genetics that's
just like how my face is
Catherine tell us about the lipstick
you're about to put on this is
Maybelline um midnight blue let's try it
on
ah see I'm not a femme already not
liking them now what do they expect you
to do about like this under lip how do
you feel about the color on my
complexion I expected a darker color so
I feel like it doesn't look bad for
color why don't you tell us what you're
about to eat I have a chicken gyro I've
had gyros before I've never had it with
broccoli let's dig and you can totally
see the lipstick right they're very
moisturized which is nice
I don't know it just it doesn't feel
like something that would last all day
and this Charles not all that I'm sorry
I'm a New Yorker yeah now I'm scheduled
1 to 10 1 I mean color wise maybe like a
fun if I was going for color probably
gonna go a little bit higher red because
I know that it'll last a little longer
what are we trying today as lipstick
we're doing the Revlon Super Lustrous
lipstick in love is on love is on only
if my lipstick is on so let's put it on
love the color red lipstick all day
every day Oh Oh my teeth and what are we
eating classic New York pretzel very
salty I'm a little nervous because I'm a
chronic lipstick on chin lesser known
problem lipstick on the bottom of my
nose when I eat all right
that's almost look on there I'm Adam
Mitchell's Jenna out of ten just
everything you want in a warm pretzel I
don't have I don't have chin issues I
don't have under the nose issues I have
it all over my hands
I definitely ate some I'm like
pleasantly surprised it's moisturizing
it's good the color payoff is great
didn't take a long time to put on I
would say like eight or nine am
impressive I love
okay so we've tested these four
lipsticks and I feel like the verdict is
that this whole lipstick under the chin
thing is very common we also worry about
this little like water line stuff called
it like the inside of our lips not
having lipstick on it it's one of my
biggest fears I think that our overall
winner here is the Revlon red lipstick
Maitland at the end I think it came in
strong it looked exactly the same at the
beginning of the pretzel at the end
alright and that's a wrap on lipstick
versus New York Street food may your
lipstick last longer than your hot dog I
can't thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
