everyone agrees is the best part about
it is taking it up but is there actually
shapewear that's both comfortable and
functional its ladylike today we're
getting fabulous how long you been on
there
are you wearing space you need those
what do you have a nipple II I never
wear shapewear I feel like people
normally wear shapewear
on the red carpet or to a club or
anything fancy that they just want to
make a statement with there but I just
look like a man wrestler you don't even
do that every day like what I'm going to
Walgreens I don't need to make a scene
here is all of my secrets my biggest
concerns with shapewear is where it ends
perhaps a random muffin talk right here
lots of potential lies that could show
through also it's very sweaty I hadn't
thought about sweating I don't love
tightening so I think it's just gonna
make me feel claustrophobic we're going
to put four different brands of
shapewear to the test through a series
of Olympic events hey girl
I didn't shave
neither cross-list I'm already sweating
all right y'all ready yep oh wait that
wait wait bed number one the panty line
test the growth have to get past the
paparazzo without showing any panty
lines
Kristen
okay so the big winner really I
personally have taken points off just
because you can see it out here you and
I mean but I mean this part looks pretty
smooth Crispin's my number two it held
up pretty well I was very surprised from
the back it's a solid situation looking
back at the actual photos there aren't
as many visible lags that thought there
would be so I'm pretty proud what about
me you're my number four one two out of
four um curly is my biggest troll and I
think that he was not able to be
objective in this matter and I demand a
rematch event number two the PETA first
one who removed their shapewear and
throw it over the stall win
whoa
round two go
final round go I thought I was gonna
kill this event and I did not I won I
credit a life in the theater doing quick
changes for that the space that got come
up at all I got caught on my sandal kept
pulling down my bra those are just
pulling down the sheets I think I could
pee in these really well in real life
which is good because I actually do have
to be event number three the sweat test
did the girls sweat enough to apply
their temporary tattoos without any
water so we're gonna put these tattoos
on our body without water and then at
the end of the day we'll see if we've
sweat enough to make it stick ladies we
are going to sweat now okay now run
around in a circle chase each other
chase these kind of it get up get up I
need to hear breathing
you are a gazelle and you are a tiger
shoot hotter hotter it just hit me what
the is going on so now we'll see
which ladies sweat it them both Oh
Chantal never thought I'd see the side
of you nothing I got all completely
don't smell that Justin yeah this
definitely feels wetter than Chantal a
good thing it wasn't for twixt my thighs
because that's definitely where the fire
is a burnin this one is definitely more
sticky nothing my friend I'm saying
speaking stick angry let's see it's like
a little bit more than Freddy's but it's
like the same a little bit more time we
could have had a party on your side well
honestly I feel the sweatiest in places
that are not the Spanx area the winner
of this competition is the very
beautiful the very troll like the very
lovely shuns how but the winner of the
whole competition is
my shape where they were not life
changing they were very sexy but no DKNY
not too shabby
I enjoy them l wear them for this I like
sakes they're pretty good maybe feel
like cool shiny slippery person which I
liked a lot
i has a miracle suit I thought I did
pretty well overall I will wear these
again
I wish it were acceptable for me to just
wear these and run at the gym my target
shape where it kept me stuck tucked and
locked in it did the job it also made me
look super hot in this dress so I'm not
mad
oh hello baby tested ladylike Carly says
the very troll like this is what I'm
saying this is why he's a pig also I
think I deserve the Congress Evan in
this the whole day so bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
