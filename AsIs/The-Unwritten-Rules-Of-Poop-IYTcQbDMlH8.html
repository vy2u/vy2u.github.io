we talk about things people generally
don't talk about and then try to come up
with rules for that subject
my name is Keith and I have a but my
name is Hilary and I also have a butt
and today we're gonna be talking about
what comes out of our butts poop very
nice Keith thank you so I hit the
streets to see if anybody would talk to
me about a long-standing duty rumor I'm
here on the streets of Hollywood to find
out the answer to one special question
do you know if women poop I don't think
so now I've never seen it happen
no women don't no of course not
why do you think people are going around
saying that women don't poop because
people probably think that like it's
gross for women to poop people don't
like to see women like not necessarily
dirty but like I should I know how to
put it I think it sounds mighty like
we're supposed to be like lady lady legs
not ladylike what about it is unladylike
being a human women are human why do you
think that originates from uh fear
misogyny big time definitely that I
think that this illusion that you speak
of should be a smash I think that we
should all be proud of that of what of
pooping hi poop you poop yes we do women
do poop yeah boo we have to everybody
poops
Sookie according to the people of Los
Angeles a very popular children's book
and science we find ourselves at the
first rule everybody poops yeah which is
exactly the problem especially when
you're out of your element it's
impossible to know where to find a good
safe clean bathroom so I went into the
heart of Hollywood to cut the crap and
survey the public toilet options do you
know of a place I can use the bathroom
then like where's a good public bathroom
here over 40 million people visit Los
Angeles every year now that is a lot of
butts I'm here in Hollywood to find out
what makes a good public bathroom and
what makes one safe enough to poop in is
there any way to make a public bathroom
feel safe enough to poop in
No how do you decide which business to
choose I mean I think a department store
is always a safe bet from the look of
the building you can see if the
bathrooms clean or not so if you think
the facade of the building is sexy the
bathroom is good when I come to
Hollywood I go clubbing so I'll just use
the bathroom at the club Oh Hollywood I
don't think has a great bathroom game
but I'm gonna try to find the one good
bathroom that we gotta have somewhere
okay
we're in the car right now on our way to
our first stop and I realize that I'm
actually starting to have to poop like
for reals
this is the exact scenario I was fearing
for all of our tourists and now here I
am experiencing it myself we got to find
a restaurant we got to find a department
store and I just got to find a normal
public restroom so we're in this small
ah level 3 and level 2 side to level 2
I'll take care of it from here beer
expecting shoe crowded this is never
gonna work
we're going to the third floor there
were just so many people there how could
that have been a queen bathroom well
maybe it was though maybe that's why I
was so popular let's get a look here
flatter whose seat
there's pee on the seat I can't sit down
on that my legs will get wet with urine
let's keep looking okay so one of our
rules was to find a place with a
beautiful exterior so I thought maybe
this Victoria's Secret I'm gonna see if
they have a bathroom just that they
could take it let me use here's one that
bathrooms here to you others are public
bathrooms you know that are there any
like secret nicer bathrooms around here
no no nice bathrooms here
well no it's good to know my sipper is
down oops we are at a preposterous ly
crowded Starbucks and I'm gonna see if I
can possibly use their bathroom high
drive to buy anything to use the
bathroom don't need to buy anything
we're good it's a public bathroom look
at this look at this claim back there's
only one speculative baker-bots toilet
paper around seat covers available
please see I can't poop here because
there's a lot of ladies in line
I can't do that to them cannot leave
them with the pool bathroom and it was a
really nice bathroom like and this is in
the center of Hollywood there must be
dozens of people using this bathroom all
the time so props to Starbucks for
having like actually the cleanest
bathroom I've encountered but wait
that's another public restroom maybe
they can redeem themselves got pee on
the seat stop paying on the seat there's
pee on the seat let's try Dave &amp;amp;
Buster's it's like a department store
for fun like there's so much fun
right good do you guys have a bathroom I
could use this place is incredible
okay this is pretty good there's on the
floor but it's the whole roll it's clean
it is 22
so as he covers this is a good bathroom
and the items had any money playing
games all I want to
we didn't find a place to poop and now
guys let's play some video games okay
let's play some video games let's get
the BuzzFeed card and get ourselves some
fun at David Buster's wacky the struggle
is real
yes Hill's a legit had a hard time
finding a place to poop and while I did
end up at David and Buster's I have to
admit that probably the cleanest and
most globally available bathroom is
Starbucks which leads us to rule number
Deuce when in doubt just go to the bucks
what Starbucks oh I mean it does make
sense they sell coffee which is a
laxative right and I wonder to learn
more about what makes our poop the way
it is so I sat down with experts I'm
here today with dr. talev who is a poop
expert also known as a
gastroenterologist right yes okay and
what does that mean exactly that's a
doctor takes care of people with
problems with their swallowing their
stomach for their guests okay so you see
a lot of poop see a lot of Lee I asked
my co-workers to send me pictures of
their poop butt and they did and it was
so gross that I could not show them to
you it was I I questioned my sanity
looking at my co-workers poops so then
what I had them do was describe them to
an artist who made some artist
renderings I was wondering if you could
grade the poop absolutely here we have
this one yeah those are little couple
like stools and the reason they're like
that is because the poop is taking too
long to get through the gut so it's
getting dried out so that's a sign of
constipation that's one person who I
guess is constipated so this is a poop
that's not the ideal poop but it's still
within a normal range it's slightly
constipated it's rocks kind of
congregated into a sausage and that's
it's a little more on the constipated
side than a smooth sausage would be the
perfect sausage that's a log that's if
you want a stool it looks like the ideal
poop this is the ideal poop this is it
whoever gave me this one I think it was
you you got the perfect poop
what's a green so Green is okay Green is
a perfect poop yeah normals brown green
or yellow that's all normal we got this
one
some mushy your stools so that looks
like it's heading towards diarrhea with
when you're getting these little flakes
that are kind of watery at the edges so
that suggests you're developing a looser
stool if that's not your normal pattern
and then you have to wonder about
dietary things you might be ingesting
like maybe lactose if you're lactose
intolerant or fructose if you're
fructose intolerant too many dried fruit
too many dried fruits too much fruit
juice alright so that's a very nicely
shaped log with some corn in it that's
perfectly normal
why do we see it why does it just come
out as course not well digested and so
it travels through you and that's
probably a good thing it means your
transit time from mouth to the toilet
bowl is fast this is I've not really
seen a Mount Everest looking stool but
it looks to me like this came out more
like toothpaste and again it's a softer
stool so some people have have a looot
one loose stool today and if that's your
normal pattern that can be okay how do
you know when you're having to poop that
like problematic so you probably should
see a doctor if what you're normally
doing suddenly changes you should see a
doctor if your stools are suddenly
coming out pencil-thin consistently not
one day but consistently coming out
really thin or if it's coming out really
funny colors like pitch black or bloody
or white Hilary we can learn a lot from
our poop oh well so what's rule number
three it is okay to look at your poop
great but Hilary I have a confession to
make whenever I poop I look at my phone
oh that's no big deal I think everyone
does oh well to test this theory I asked
what my co-workers do when they evacuate
their bowels evacuate their balance I'm
uh I'm gonna interview people a BuzzFeed
about what they do while they poop how
do they keep themselves entertained it's
so boring SEC what do you do while you
poop I go on my phone I always all the
time one hand is dedicated to my phone
one hand is dedicated to touching dirty
things uh-huh so opening the door taking
off my pants touching the toilet seat
and off your pants with one hand yeah I
can do it do it this is gonna be
incredible sag is taking off his pants
at work and he has to because I asked
him so it's not an HR violation right I
get into it and then
just go like that boom Wow pooping Wow
so you only need one hand to poop why
don't you take your pants off and then
pull your phone out of your pocket once
your pants are down I could but just in
general I guess what it comes down to is
like when it comes time to take take my
wee-wee out of my pants that hand is now
dedicated as my dirty hand okay do you
retouch your wee-wee after touching
other things so you're not concerned
about your wee-wee at all nice dude you
gotta be concerned about that we we e so
Zack works very hard to keep his phone
clean probably because he knows from a
previous BuzzFeed video that using your
phone while pooping can lead to a germ
covered phone but the best way to ensure
that it's clean would just be not to
bring it in the bathroom at all so I
decided to issue a challenge
give me a clap no don't do that it's bad
for microphone I'm here with zack zack
is about to go poop don't I've decided
to give you a challenge it's just so I
mean you can't use your phone while
you're in there and then I want you to
report back up what the experience was
like whoa okay how exciting doesn't get
much more exciting than this right ned
sure doesn't what are we talking about
a few minutes later zack returned from
the men's room i feel really
accomplished i just pooped and i didn't
use my phone so at first i was bored and
i didn't know what to do and I thought
this was stupid I was mad at you I was
mad at the world but as time went on my
mind cleared and my thoughts were free
to explore you know who come without
your phone you could do it would you do
it again probably not now I want to
check Instagram oh wow that Kornfeld
full surprises so uh was there a rule
there oh yeah if you want to bring your
phone bring your phone just be sure to
clean it sometimes which leads us to our
final messy situation and to protect the
identity of our unfortunate poopa
traitor Hillary and I recreated his
crappy nightmare
you'll want to pull up a stool for this
one feel like you got a good amount of
puns in there yeah I think we dropped
some solids
so a few years ago my girlfriend and I
we decided to go see a movie downtown
and for some idiotic reason we decided
to buy one of those giant buckets of pop
one and I actually ended up eating most
if not all of it before the movie had
even started so stupid decision and I
guess you could say that's where the
real drama begins after the movie ends
we'll walk into the car and I just feel
sick but I'm able to fight that off we
think you know what it's 25 minutes so
we get home it's not really going to be
a problem so we get into the car and
we're driving often the pop one of my
body just decides to change direction
towards the poop realm and I'm not going
to share this with my girlfriend so I
just keep it to myself my body is just
rigid with tension trying to hold this
in so we're driving and we just run into
a giant wall of bumper-to-bumper traffic
I think oh my god this is the end my
girlfriend can clearly sense that
something is wrong so she looks over at
me and calmly but blatantly just goes do
you have to poop and our relationship
wasn't necessarily at poop status yet
but I just kind of looked straight
forward and just said yep we think okay
you know what our best option is
probably to take the next exit whatever
it is however the next exit that was
coming up was just a really bad
neighborhood but we decided you know
what that's what has to happen so we cut
off the exit and I'm driving like Jason
Bourne I'm just weaving in and out of
traffic and you make a turn and I can
see there's a is in the distance and I
think oh my god salvation but then this
really fast all process just Rockets
through my head and I think no this
can't be an option because if you go in
there and there's someone in the
bathroom or they're cleaning it or it's
locked or whatever the reason you're
gonna poop your pants in front of three
plus people in a bad neighborhood
so all those kind of mark off the
checklist this isn't going to work and
it just decided you know what gametime
decision let's drive my car
sidewalk and just behind this abandoned
factory building I scamper out of this
car like a wild animal
I run behind a dumpster and I just
my brains out I've never felt lower as a
human being in my entire life but the
next step now is how do I clean myself
up
so I ditch the underwear use that as
toilet paper and I'm looking around for
what else I can use and think no you're
behind an abandoned Factory you don't
need a tetanus shot in your asshole so
that's not going to be an option so I
pull my pants up I kind of wattle back
to the car my girlfriend is hysterically
laughing this entire time and I'm
cleaned out my car the day before so
there was nothing I can use napkins
paper towels nothing but there were a
Google map Direction so I decided to use
those go back behind the dumpster clean
myself up as best as I can to that point
get back to the car I'm smelling
terrible continue our drive home
eventually we make at home I take a
shower I'm back to a full human being
status and for the rest of that day and
into the night this thought process that
just kind of lodged itself in my brain
was what if someone goes behind that
dumpster and they see this just messages
she wouldn't poop everywhere and they
think oh my god who did this what kind
of disgusting monster is responsible for
this and then his partner I guess picks
up a piece of paper and says here's his
google map directions his address is
right here let's go get him and I that
doesn't make any sense but that's what I
had in my head so needless to say I was
never held accountable for my actions so
that is good and I'm proud to say that
the brave lady in that story is still my
girlfriend today and I would say that
poop brought us closer together well
keep that strange story actually did
have a happily ever after so it's
Hillary and that leads us to rule number
five love is greater than poop well I'm
Keith and that's it for this go I'm
Hilary thanks for tuning in to another
episode of unwritten rule we'll see you
next time
coconut a conference sometimes it's not
a matter of control you don't have to
well but can you like make them go a
mile away if icky all I'm gonna start
running this way you run that way have
you ever tried running them had to take
a huge dump yeah I have and I admit it's
not a good run in terms of quality of
run but you can you can skitter well
