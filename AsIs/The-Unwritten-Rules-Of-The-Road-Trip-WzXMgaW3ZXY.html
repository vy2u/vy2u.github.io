life but on a road trip you make your
own these are the unwritten rules of the
road the hierarchy is simple the driver
drives the co-pilot navigates and
controls the stereo under the direction
of the driver of course a co-pilots free
hands are the most valuable thing a
driver can have every moment you're on
the road is a chance to connect with a
fellow motorist you should wave to them
it will make you feel good and you might
make their day also I should mention
getting truckers to honk never gets old
if they were up to me I would never go
to the bathroom ever actually that would
be really weird but when it comes to
road trips
you should only take a bathroom break
when you really need to pee like bladder
exploding peaks otherwise keep motoring
why stop at a gas station you can stop
at a truck stop to side you pumps gas
get creative oh and since you've already
stopped check out your surroundings you
might find something cool just around
the corner
if you've never stationed danced you
should alright speaking it this may be
the only exercise you get on my ankle it
is crazy
Oh baby
only twice our cars no it's better than
people do they see us every day they
listen to a sing they watch us pick our
noses they deserve a name fail
sandy closer getting work okay um wait
would go on road trips
she is Blair Chia SAS
after a long cross-country journey the
driver should thank the copilot and the
copilot should thank the driver you will
feel closer to the people that went on
the adventure with you that's real you
will never be the same person after a
good road trip embrace it make your own
rule
what are your road trip role
