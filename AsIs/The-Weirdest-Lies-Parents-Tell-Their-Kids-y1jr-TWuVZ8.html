if I continuously played with my belly
button it would come untied causing my
butt to fall off because that's how my
butt was attached
when I used to go to church when I was
little and they talked about the Virgin
Mary I asked my parents what a virgin
was and they told me was someone who
never ate meat so as a six-year-old I
went around telling everyone I could
never be a virgin because I liked meat
too much when I was 8 or 9 my father
enjoyed telling me that age 11 the webs
between my fingers and my toes needed to
be cut zipped off when I was 10 years
old my dad told me that my pet guinea
pig was given away to a nun that a nun
knocked on her door and said that the
orphanage needed pets for the kids to
play with so he gave her mine I was like
dad you're Jewish like why do you care
two men said my parents told me the lie
that since my vehicle was so old that
the speedometer was off and it was fast
five miles an hour I believed that lie
for about five years and I always drove
five miles under the speed limit until I
found out that was not true when I was
five and I would want ice cream my dad
would say oh no you can't have any ice
cream because you know the man who makes
the ice cream he died when he lose teeth
if you throw them on top of the roof all
right we'll come and say them away
light bulbs if they break they release
the world most toxic gas so I didn't
change light bulbs and tell an adult a
week ago
a lot I told me was that if you don't
eat your vegetables you'll grow worms so
of course I grew up told my children the
things that you told me think they need
vegetables that worms will come out of
their book
when I was four years old my mother told
me that if i sat too close to the TV
they'd have to scoop my eyeballs out
with teaspoons and I passed that one on
to my three-year-old daughter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
