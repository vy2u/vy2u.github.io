and she gets confused and she's not even
following the real one she's following
the fake one my name is Amanda Leander I
am a fine artist and a Paris cover and
this is my life what's up everybody
welcome hi everyone so you guys are
behind the scenes with the BuzzFeed this
is Steven with BuzzFeed what's up my
friend called me and said Amanda there's
this app you should check it out I went
on periscope I started reading The
Giving Tree live and talking to people
let's see who gets in first I give a
shout-out to the first person that ends
up speaking on the chat and there's 200
people 200 want people before somebody
is able to say something and it was
Martha media Martha media Wow hey Martha
this is the first time you're in first
on the chat welcome I became the top
periscope or I think within the first
week it happened so quickly it was crazy
the reason that everything happened so
quickly was one because I started it on
the second day the warrant as many users
and to because I started giving content
that was interesting for other people
the day of the life of an artist so they
got to see the process and it was kind
of like a show for that I was thinking
if PETA isn't married I can make a date
with my grandfather PETA shoot me girl I
said how old is your grandfather my
grandma's name is beatta that's her
nickname that I gave her and everybody
on periscope she just became really
popular in periscope you see I algo de
Miguel que decir el mundo que me molesta
que nunca tapa Nicole crack that's the
one thing that you would say never how
much I make on periscope zero people ask
me that all the time I've had people ask
to pay me to show their products and big
companies but I haven't accepted any of
that just because right now I'm really
just concentrating on my artwork and
connecting with people and that's what
it's about for me okay
at four o'clock this is what we're going
to do if you're performers if you sing
if you dance if you breakdance whatever
you do click at Amanda Leander on your
topic and I will find you on Twitter and
I will share it at four o'clock and then
somebody said show boobs
I dude you're missing out on some really
fun stuff you're about to be blocked
forever
he's blocked the periscope is very
different than any other app first of
all there's no filters so which I love a
periscope is so live you always know
this is happening right now the
community huge this was like the main
thing actually the same people come in
all the time so they don't only interact
with me but they interact with each
other now people get to see the artist
behind the artwork I can create work
that I'm inspired to do and I can
actually hold off on commissioned work
now it's 359 and I am going to pick
somebody to share let's see who's this
person awesome jam sessions ah she's so
cute so now I'm gonna share her channel
share with all followers this is my
favorite part she's really good I'm
really excited almost 700 people she had
35 people and ash has almost 700 people
with a touch of a button I think also
it's it's it's inspiring for other
people because like she just learned the
ukulele and now she has all these
followers or gonna ask her when are you
gonna play next when you're gonna play
next so now it's gonna inspire people to
keep painting and keep playing the piano
and keep learning so I don't know
sometimes I get emotional so gym mama
Joe manna I love you
I got nothing I think it's the first
month when this started hopping to me I
guess I realized how much of a
difference I can make with periscope I
don't know it's touching when you think
about it now how technology with just
the push of a button you can share
somebody's channel and make such a big
difference at the comfort of like the
park there are so many talented people
out there and all they need is a voice
so I don't think of it as competition
really I just love sharing other
people's channel and it makes me happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
