I'm bisexual
hi I'm Ryo I'm 29 and I'm bisexual my
name is AJ Marberry and I am 24 years
old and I identify as bisexual if I was
able to just choose one or the other I
probably wouldn't put myself in the
position of calling myself bisexual it's
like you like vanilla and you like
chocolates right but you can like both I
think that if people like stuff you like
stuff you say bisexual and people
instantly go oh okay okay well let me
know we can talk when you do if you know
14 years of the phase then sure let's
see how long I can rock this phase I
actually knew I was by before I knew
there was a word for it every time
somebody tells me that I'm just I'm just
like whoa it's how I feel it's who I am
and if you don't believe it that's your
problem if I were gay I would very
happily be gay it's almost more
complicated to be bisexual well you are
half gay you're half straight I feel
like it has to cut off a part of myself
to be able to say yes I am straight or I
am lesbian it's just not true I can't
identify as one or the other liars liars
about what I personally look incredibly
honest person I just think that it's
British shallow of people that they
cannot believe what we feel honestly if
I were to talk to
younger generations my sole advice would
be just to be honest with yourselves you
are who you are and you're beautiful as
you are and don't worry
somebody out there loves you more than
you ever could possibly understand and
it may take you a while to find them but
once you do it's it's like magic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
