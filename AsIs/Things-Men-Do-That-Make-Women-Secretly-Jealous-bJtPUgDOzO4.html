one pair of pants that fit and then buy
multiples of those and then just wear
that exam outfit every day until they
die and nobody says anything about it
buying underwear is so much easier for
guys like bras are so complicated the
guy can throw on a button-up a nice pair
of pants and he's good to go and girls
are sitting there staring at their
closet do I want a v-neck do I want a
scoop neck
do I want short sleeve quarter sleeves
I'm really annoyed that like guys can
literally eat whatever the hell they
want and it goes nowhere eyes are told
to eat more like if you're kind of a
slender guy and you want to get more
muscles and then let's say it does go
somewhere it'll just melt off of them
their ability to pee wherever and
whenever they want to pee standing up
they get to pee against the wall I feel
like so many times girls are waiting in
these long lines and guys walk 10 feet
away face a tree and just do their thing
and it's all done that guys can sort of
be more forward the guys the pursuance
and the girl is like oh he's looking at
me I wonder if he'll come over and speak
to me sort of thing and then any woman
who makes out a dance comes off as kind
of oppressive then get to have sex with
whoever whenever and wherever they want
and it's basically socially acceptable
five acts are you during sex is so much
easier for guys like it's like when
humans were created it's like men with
their sexuality we're given a
tic-tac-toe game to figure out and women
were given a Rubik's Cube and it's like
clearly one is harder than the other
it'd be really awesome to think about my
future and not be like ah childbirth
what it will do to my body in my career
shaving is a choice for a guy like guys
can just have like these hairy pits and
arms and faces and legs they can just be
a big ball of hair and nobody judges
that let me walk around as a hairy ball
and see how many guys I'm gonna get I
feel bad that men can't express
themselves emotionally you can't have a
good cry you can't you
lean on your Bros for support you can't
explore fashion as much as they want to
because they're told that's too girly
and that they're forced to man up
I think that's really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
