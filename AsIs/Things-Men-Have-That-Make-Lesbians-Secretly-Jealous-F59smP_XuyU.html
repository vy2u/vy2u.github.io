you're jealous of in life I brought a
list there cuts jacking off going to the
gym the fact we have to strap down these
twins and men just walk in with a shirt
and a singlet and I'm almost working
myself in the face I have a bit of penis
envy only purely for the fact that they
can pee standing up cuz if you've ever
tried it as a woman it's very messy they
just like whack their hand around it
give it a few tugs and they're in the
state of ecstasy I mean most women
require a little bit more work in the
bedroom I think they have it a lot
easier one plus one equals orgasm
wearing button-up shirts look you'll
just want to keep busting out but I like
about really nice triangular back and it
like it's like nice muscles
and that killer V and that ass oh
actually I got a good ass having the
ability to grow a really awesome beard I
mean I can probably give them a run for
their money no bras no periods the whole
like inequality across the world aspect
they seem to be able to buff up in like
a week don't call us clothes man I'm
jealous of men's aureole I apparently
they're not offensive or frightening it
would be great to live a a day even as a
straight guy obviously not having to
come out and deal with all of that just
so that I don't have to censor my
relationship in public that's something
that really affects you every day
let's see the whole erection thing
because I feel like if I had a dick I
would have a hard-on 24/7 masturbation
is basically practice for the real thing
you hear a lot about how when men have
sex is a woman it's a lot harder for a
woman to reach orgasm than when it's two
women together you can have sex and
multiple orgasms we can just keep going
and going we get to double our wardrobe
we get to share all our clothes not
having to worry about impregnating
someone is really fun of course it comes
at a cost as well you get to make out in
sneaky places such as the change rooms
or the restroom female ejaculation hot
male ejaculation maybe at another
lifetime
when Fifty Shades blew up and took over
the world I think that was testament of
how many men aren't there aren't doing
the best job in the sack that made me
feel really really lucky to be a big
lesbian</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
