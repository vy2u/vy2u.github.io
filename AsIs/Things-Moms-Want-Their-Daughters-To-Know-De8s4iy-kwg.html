most exciting and challenging time
I want you to know that being beautiful
doesn't necessarily mean you always like
what you see when you look in a mirror
I've felt horrible about the way I've
looked it's not about living up to
society's ideals or looking like a
supermodel people are telling you
already that your body has to look a
certain way and you're only six that is
not true at all your body is beautiful
love it and respect it no matter what
shape or size it comes in own it when
you are comfortable in your own skin
people feel that because when you feel
good about yourself you feel good about
the world around you live it's beautiful
beautiful
however it's not easy I don't want you
to be afraid to make mistakes sometimes
you won't succeed what really matters is
what you do next this is your
opportunity to rise to the occasion I
want you to be vulnerable whatever your
heart guides you and takes you to do you
can and should do I don't want you to be
afraid of anything if someone tells you
you can't do something especially a boy
because you are a girl fight against it
being a woman doesn't mean you have to
be passive don't let anything hold you
back go with what you like and you know
ignore the haters you should not let
anybody get in the way or try to cloud
your judgment of who you really are
always surround yourself with genuine
people people who inspire you who are
not afraid to make fun of themselves let
yourself love love isn't about receiving
but it's about giving I love you the way
you are I love you so much I love you I
love you of you are the love of my life
and I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
