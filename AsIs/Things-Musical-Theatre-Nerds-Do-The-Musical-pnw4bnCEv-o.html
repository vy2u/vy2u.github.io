♫ Do you sing in the shower
♫ For your sixth Halloween
♫ Were you dressed as a cat
♫ Will you wake up early
♫ To get a theater discount
♫ Then you're a musical
nerd by every account
Things All Musical Nerds Do
♫ Were you overly open
telling how you feel
♫ With a show-stopping number
♫ The performance you'll steal
♫ You try to sing with your friends
♫ When you're out and about
♫ But they pretend they don't know you
♫ 'Cause you're weirding them out
♫ If you don't think that's absurd
♫ You're a musical nerd
♫ Repeating songs from every soundtrack
♫ You've ever heard
♫ Reviewing old tap routines in hiding
♫ For musical ideas you
never got to writing
♫ These the things that musical nerds do
♫ Your approach for high notes
♫ Is perfect and pristine
♫ You know every show's history
♫ And can quote every scene
♫ You still remember every
single one of your cues
♫ And you can't bring
yourself to throw out
♫ Your high school jazz shoes
♫ You'll get nude on the stage
♫ You're a professional star
♫ If the role calls for it
♫ You can wail on guitar
♫ You'll act out shows with friends
♫ In the car at high speeds
♫ But you'll never agree
♫ Who takes harmonies and leads
♫ Musical nerds may seem so absurd
♫ Repeating songs from every sountrack
♫ We've ever heard
♫ You either love or you
hate the TV show Glee
♫ Depends on how you find its accuracy
♫ These are the things
that musical nerds do
♫ When someone says Sondheim writes scams
♫ That person's not an
authentic musical fan
♫ When they tell you that Wicked
♫ Is their favorite show
♫ You laugh at how truly little they know
♫ If you live far away
from a coast with a stage
♫ And you secretly yearn
to be an artist assuaged
♫ When your favorite
show is adapted to screen
♫ And they miscast a star
♫ You want to rip out his spleen
♫ Musical nerds may seem so absurd
♫ Repeating songs from every soundtrack
♫ We've ever heard
♫ We'd give up everything that we own
♫ To see Bernadette or Patti Lupone
♫ These are the things
that musical nerds do
♫ Musical nerds may seem so absurd
♫ Since Lion King we describe
our friends as a herd
♫ To Les Miserables we know every word
♫ We mentally cast our friends
♫ In every show we go to
♫ These are the things
♫ That musical nerds do
