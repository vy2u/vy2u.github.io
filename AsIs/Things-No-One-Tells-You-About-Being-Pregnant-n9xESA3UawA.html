pregnancy was that it does not it is not
joyful for everybody I always wanted to
be a mom but I never wanted to be
pregnant because I always was really
freaked out about the whole confinement
of it that's what it always seemed like
to me I thought that being pregnant was
going to be awesome just a magical time
of just rest and relaxation I just
thought it was going to be like the
cutest you know they kind of glamorized
it on in the media and I think I was
especially excited about not having a
sucking my gut yes there will come a day
when you realize you can't see your
vagina and you can't like print how hard
it would be to experience the skin
stretching out morning sickness doesn't
mean you throw up sometimes it means you
feel nauseous for like three months I
wouldn't really be able to fall asleep
easily even though you don't have your
period for whatever ten months or
something you still have to wear a panty
liner every single day because you will
have crazy disgusting discharge I didn't
know just how much space
my stomach was gonna take up and it's
scary to see your body change so
drastically in such a short amount of
time when I became devastatingly sad at
22 weeks pregnant I had no idea that
what I was dealing with was antepartum
depression I haven't had a very strong
relationship with my mother and so
becoming a mom has been a very
interesting journey and postpartum
depression in general I think maternal
mental health overall was something that
I felt really unprepared to deal with
I had never struggled in my life with
mental illness the fear is intense fear
is present we are all the worst father
ever
in her own minds I think postpartum
depression or not there is a moment
where you will feel like you have done
everything wrong and it feels out of
control and that's the big thing I think
I
learn from pregnancy is that it is the
ultimate lesson and learning to let go
it's worth it in the end it's it's truly
a magical experience for me it's been
very messy and very primal and
empowering at the same time and exciting
and scary so I think you just have to
kind of keep the faith that like you
know yeah you're gonna mess up and
they're going to be moments when you
feel like oh my god my baby's screaming
and I'm sweating and I can't get my boob
out and everyone's looking at me and I'm
a terrible parent but you're the perfect
parent for your child</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
