allowed to be depressed however much you
might think you can do it on your own
it's unlikely that you can nobody tells
you how boring it is because you're just
not able to do anything even choosing
the pair of socks in the morning can be
difficult everyone thinks that they were
alone everyone thinks they're suffering
in silence it turns out everyone thinks
that everyone else has got it all
figured out and they don't nobody told
me about people would be there for me
being depressed is really expensive and
not everyone can afford to pay for their
medication and that kind of makes you
feel quite guilty as well but depression
is actually manageable I characterize it
as how like you know having a dodging
knee that flares up every now and again
you know there are ways you can deal
with it depression is like a monster and
it's wearing like a human sort of
costume was like a big smile on its face
and like no one would ever say like are
you depressed because people can't see
it they think it's not real but actually
what goes on up in your head is it's
just as significant as what goes on in
your body there's no end result really
with with depression treatment it's all
about the periods all about processes
ultimately it's a human experience and
the more like you open up about it the
more like the person you're talking to
you will also be like oh hang on it kind
of relate to that having depression has
actually given me a bit of fire you have
to learn to just let yourself live as
well this doesn't make you any less of a
person at all it is just a condition but
you are dealing with in the same way
about many of the people are dealing
with all sorts of different things so
don't be hard on yourself
and and get help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
