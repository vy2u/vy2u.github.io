my heart if it came out the other end

are doing what she told you to do we
used to call her the warden sarcastic

really intense really fiery she's
adorable and sweet that's my mom's
personality Tulsi Noel come here come

crying I would give you something to cry
about

lights on and we weren't in the room she
always be like we opened up the fridge
