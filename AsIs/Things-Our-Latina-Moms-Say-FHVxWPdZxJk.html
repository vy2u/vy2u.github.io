like for the love of God
clean your goddamn room my mom is a very
shy person but she has that kind of
personality that you don't want to mess
with he's very loud
she's even louder when she's with her
sisters happy positive personality loves
to dance
loves to gossip she dresses like a boss
her jewelry is always on point no matter
where you've been no matter what your
story is
my mother has open arms and a full place
she's the boss of the house so she runs
the show she calls the shots I would
always want to go out and have all these
sleepovers and she's like you don't come
and go like this is a hotel my mom and
my grandma when they scold you they'll
go from like kind of loud voices super
high pitch like not gonna Segura the
whispering voice was much more harsher
than the loud voice audit of a severe
climatic on a yacht La Casa and we never
wanted to find out what would happened
when we got home when I was little I
would be misbehaving in public with my
little brother she would go for like
this part of the arm for like a pinch
like even now if someone like touches me
here it's like and sometimes latina moms
don't have to say anything
that's all you need to know if something
wasn't up to perfect standards she
wouldn't want any company everything is
a pork area like the house is a pork
area the cars of work area my room is a
pork area if anything is going wrong in
my life it's always as I haven't
showered
she calls me twice a day she's always
asking if I'm showering she like huh
bean bed when your friends are gonna
think that your mother doesn't care for
you they might isn't iron your clothes
I'm like mom no one cares at all she's
always asking me if I'm eating did you
eat
you either eat too much you eat too
little there's no in-between the thing
that every mother will say to their kids
you're hungry again
I just gave you like 13 purposes can you
think sit down and stop talking you were
driving by McDonald's you'd be like well
yeah my get on my doughnuts and she'd be
like then I mostly HOTAS and I guess she
was gonna take you home and have you eat
a bowl of beans and your ass better like
it because this isn't a restaurant she
would say things like hi me like a cute
I get pretty my favorites thanks to God
thanks to God
it's not like thank God it's like
thankful God when she asks for something
like if it's like the remote
or like she's like lost her cellphone
and she'll be like ah where's the Tiki
Tiki everything is the Tiki Tiki if I
was on my high horse growing up she'd be
like oh the grass moyamoya get us beep
it is nice anytime I would get a bump or
a bruise or scrape my mom would tell me
sana sana colita de Rana which
translates to heel heel tail of a frog
don't know what that's supposed to do
but apparently they think it works they
have their own language and it's not
Spanish it's not English I understand
why she was so harsh that was her way of
disciplining that's what she learned
from my grandparents I do wish I was had
more connection sometimes my Colombian
roots simply cause it's something I want
to pass on to my my kids and I do think
of being a mom and all I think about is
guess I got so no zone hotel living so
far away from my mom recently has been
very tough because I miss her loudness I
miss her gossiping even though I don't
know who the heck she's talking about
I miss her positivity and I miss her
