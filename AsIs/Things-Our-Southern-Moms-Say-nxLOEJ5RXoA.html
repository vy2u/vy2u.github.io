okay and then you know what she's really
thinking is I'll see you at home
my mother is probably one of the most
fabulous people I know my mom loves
Southern Comfort and southern
hospitality and you always feel really
warm and comfortable and welcome in our
house my mom's super sassy she's just an
all-around wonderful human my mom never
raised her voice when she got mad with
us it was always just a very serious
deliberate tone well if that's the
attitude you want to have all right then
it was those eyes you know like that I
see you I see what you're doing
discipline was all in the eyes you want
to be doing that right now or I'm gonna
Tan your hide if you don't quit doing
that her thing was like slapping me on
the knees if I did something stupid she
would just be like BAM I did not get
spanked for my sister sure did my
brother on the other hand he was the bad
one he got spanked a lot more than me I
was faced not in a way that was abusive
at all it was just the way our household
worked
oh she calls me everything she'll call
me ask me how I am I'll say one sentence
and then she'll just immediately dive
into everything that's happening at
church like oh well that's great well
I'm leading the prayer group now so I
made for prayer blankets and next week
I'm leaving the congregation if I miss
one day of calling her when I call her
the next day she's like you didn't call
me in today you feel like hey are you
sick eating well you hanging out with
friends have you found a church have you
found a gym are you working out really
do a regular schedule and anytime I have
to do anything that might take me
somewhere out of like the vicinity of
where I live
she's like super worried about it so
food in the south is a huge huge deal my
mom loves to cook well there was my
grandmother like making them from
scratch or even my mom just making
frozen biscuits we always had biscuit
whenever I told her that I was bringing
over any more than five people over to
the house to hang out I would come home
and there would be like a buffet of food
that looked like it had been catered so
now like when I'm coming home like two
to three weeks out and mom will say I'm
going to the store today is anything you
to get for you while you're home what do
you want to eat I've already got like
the roast and the freezer ready for you
to Mike do come home and she'll say
she's cooked a healthy meal for me when
in fact it's always gonna be chili and
cornbread and she says there's your
protein there's your carbs eight o'clock
in the morning she starts cooking dinner
and that's just beans and rice or gumbo
fills a whole house in the southern like
community like you see all of the same
things on the dinner table because these
have been packed on from the different
moms and the family southern moms
they're very loving
I think southern moms are definitely a
special green not to say that like other
moms aren't involved but there my mom
was super involved because they are just
so sweet and nice and care about their
kids so much and just have this rich
history tradition if they want to pass
on that I think that really grows some
of the best people around now you saw
what I tagged you in on Facebook right I
like the dog too
did you see that one that's AG doing the
dog on the shoe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
