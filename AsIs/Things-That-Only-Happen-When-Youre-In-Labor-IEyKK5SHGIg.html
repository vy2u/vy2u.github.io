(beep) selfie right now?
- (whispering) Three, two, one, no.
(upbeat music)
- You're doing good honey.
You're doing good.
- Okay.
- Hello, I'm Dr. Ben
and I'm here to do your pelvic.
- Nope.
Female doctor.
Ugly doctor.
Any other doctor.
- Do you have to urinate?
- I don't think so.
- I'm just gonna gently
push on your bladder.
Okay!
- I haven't eaten anything in 15 hours.
- You're glowing.
- I will never want to
remember this moment.
- I'm guessing seven pounds, nine ounces.
- I think it's a ten-er.
- Loser buys quesalupa?
- After this, I can not eat Mexican.
I'm sorry.
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- I can't do this.
- I'm not ready for a baby.
- I'm ready to go home!
I'm gonna go home now!
- I'll come back when I'm feeling
a little more ready.
- Get your hand, out of me!
- I can't, you're contracting.
Relax.
- Oh, it looks like the
baby pooped in the pool.
- I shouldn't have looked.
- Oh beautiful, do you want a mirror?
- You don't want a mirror right now.
You look beautiful.
- I don't feel well.
- Oh, that makes sense.
We're moving most of your organs.
- She's gotta stop pushing.
She's gonna rip her asshole.
- Honey, I need you to stop pushing.
- Do you feel my fingers?
Push right there.
- (strains) That's awkward.
- This is the best day of my life.
- (crying) I hate you so much!
- Push like you're pooping.
- I don't wanna poo!
- Just go, poop is part
of the program here.
(screaming and cheering)
- It doesn't feel like I'm pushing!
- Is that supposed to happen?
You're gonna fix that right?
(baby cries)
- We did it.
(baby cries)
- Um, excuse me,
is anyone gonna give me my baby?
- Okay, you ready to
deliver your placenta?
- [Woman] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(beep) that.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
