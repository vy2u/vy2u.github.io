of information and the kind of news you
get about it is not that Pleasant and
you kind of get a sense that you have to
 people to like get a job or you
have to do things like that when you
don't like it's very professional I've
always been the rebel I've been the
black sheep of the family my uncle who
said that oh she should not be posing
like this and why is her dad allowing
for this my mom is super cool and I
think as long as she sees that things
are tastefully done I come home I seek
family where we're not even allowed to
trim my hair they really supported me
once I started doing some good jobs that
just because I'm doing a PhD then I'm
smart and if I'm doing modeling then I'm
not smart and they'll be like oh that's
great are you studying to be something
else now someone just want me to like
poop on the floor early a jewelry on me
so it was just me covered with lots of
jewelry well I was on skype and I was
like what like who's gonna clean it up
off so there were a couple of
fourteen-year-old boys in they which is
getting really excited so they were just
really cute boobs
if you audition for 10 ads 15 ads 20 ads
sometimes you may not even land one and
there's always like a hundred other
people sitting around watching you you
got to do it because you have a natural
disadvantage because you're dark-skinned
sometimes you have to do really weird
things like you have to dance or like
they want something really bizarre I
don't want to be one of the 30,000
assembly line girls that look like each
other yes surprisingly I really like
doing naked to bits feel so comfortable
I only shot with my friends our
photographers were really professional
they're being test shoots in like a
close and one everyone else just leaves
the room and it's just you in the
photographer and you feel comfortable if
a great photographer out there asked me
to do it I do it because I would totally
trust him and I know he's gonna make me
look nice every model that I've met is
they eat properly I eat everything I
don't stop myself I eat in small
proportions so that I don't have to feel
guilty about it the next day I love
brownies I love oatmeal cookies
we don't make as much money as you guys
think people think that to be a model
you have to show up and get your hair
and makeup done or whatever and then
just stand around there's a lot of
Abhinay involved video in front of the
camera either you're like exceptionally
good-looking right or you're an
exceptionally good actor these are the
two criterias right if you're none then
you're wasting your time have to deal
with the mental pressure of knowing that
people are literally gonna be looking at
you every single day like you're an
object you have three thick skin you
have to be very thick-skinned and
thankfully now I'm at a point where yeah
the camera doesn't scare me as much as
it used to
it's here what get it there honey I got
it get it yeah yeah you get it it's here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
