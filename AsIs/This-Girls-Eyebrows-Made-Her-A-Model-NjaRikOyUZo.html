enjoy here you so this is insane when I
was younger I was really insecure about
where I came from
when I lived in Puerto Rico having body
hair was never ever an issue when I came
to the United States everything changed
as I started getting more attention on
social media I started seeing that many
people were listening to me and looking
up to me now I kind of have this mission
to show that being unique and being
yourself can go a long way hi my
autistics meet all I might not have
perfect skin
I have bushy brows but that's who I am
