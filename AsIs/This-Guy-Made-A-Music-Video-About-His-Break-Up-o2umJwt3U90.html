music video about our breakup I don't
really know how I felt at the time when
I watched I was kind of kind of ticked
off a little bit I just felt this sense
of like yes I won the break-up remember
just like sitting down my computer and
going over and I just cuz I nope nope
not gonna do it not just knit I'm not
gonna watch it you might be dating a
hotter newer dye but I've got a music
video I caught my boyfriend singing this
in the kitchen yes your vindication he's
like humming it all the time it's try me
bananas well I guess let's get to it
let's watch the video yet what are you
wearing I'm the captain
is that that's just a friend of mine
Jenna face see that's not to talk about
I never called you my straight gay
friend either it was just the way I felt
at the time like I felt like what do you
want me to be like a gay friend is like
rotting with underpay you're so angry
more awkward to film than you might
think
uh she's half-naked yeah this never
happened yeah I never asked you to paint
my room we want to disgrace I don't
think ever did that either jumping on
the bed like that maybe that was the
problem maybe if you've been jumping
around more in my underwear yeah in your
underwear on the bed that's the secret
you can never have enough friends I
don't know what you're talking about
okay maybe that's a lie it's really
funny to like see all of my friends and
me yelling at you
yeah I have no interest in being oh no
angry we're at the end I know that's my
thing I'm angry
Wow yeah so it just brings back like a
lot of memories
oh yeah for sure watch the video and
then like you're here yeah weird it was
really what did you think back then when
you like saw it what were your thoughts
luckily so mad I'm so mad I seriously
was like yeah we can I mean I understand
why we couldn't be friends that I wanted
to I hate that I caused somebody so much
pain but didn't cause me I got you some
pain but look what you did with this
okay well nobody wants to be friends
after they've been dumped by somebody no
not at all that I mean what was I
supposed to say I don't know like how
you really felt
you're right you're right I don't know
what you say like it's just awkward all
around high five that happened not doing
it Isis I'm not taking it you're fine I
brought something for you you can keep
this I was wondering what that well I
had to keep it you don't have to you can
have it yes a shirt that conveys a
message I think is just perfect for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
