in March my daughter came to set up a
surprise date for her dad a night where
I can do this for my parents because
they usually don't get half time without
us last time we actually went somewhere
on her own like that that was more that
was really was a date that was like fun
I don't know it's been a while usually
work gets in their way and sometimes us
and one of the things we've been
noticing is that we miss each other if I
was planning a June date with my parents
I would think maybe a picnic since they
love going outside and I love healthy
food I'm feeling a little nervous a
little apprehensive excited so is it Pan
Pacific Park I can't believe I
remembered we used to come here what has
an I dreamed up it should be under a
tree on a hill with a picnic basket
and with a blanket or a quilt and then
they start eating I'm feeling a little
nervous a little apprehensive oh my gosh
whoo Oh what she made a card to take me
picnics in the park and like by
ourselves and
never yep nature's here's what I love
you so much
all right I definitely was little bit I
think there to feel very happy and they
feel very loved
happy Valentine's Day
that's so sweet Thank You sanaya Thank
You sleigh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
