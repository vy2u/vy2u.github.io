if you noticed anything out of the
ordinary in my living room other than
the bandaid on my head but let's just
ignore that part yes you might be saying
that looks like a box spring and a
mattress in her living room
it's actually been sitting there for
about six months
I thought about donating it I thought
about what I could do to destroy it and
I thought about just throwing it out so
I've decided finally that I should
participate in this me too movement
about ten years ago tirana Burke used
the phrase me too for the first time
creating a movement and Alyssa Milano
recently tweeted me too which has made
the phrase me to take off on social
media a little backstory I was raped a
few years ago and without getting into
the specifics I'm not sure that that
really matters I kept sleeping on the
mattress that I was raped I am going to
move this mattress into my front yard
tomorrow morning and I'm gonna write
hashtag me too
real big with sharpies and then I'm
gonna weave a bunch of sharpies and a
note to welcome other people to write a
message sheriffs anything they want this
seemed like a better idea than my other
options okay good morning there is the
day the mattress goes outside and I know
it's time to get up because my dog
sitting on me let's do this
I think I kept sleeping on this mattress
because I still had so much anger and
shame that I was holding on to and I'm
not gonna do it anymore I'm over this I
am over letting this control my life
I got sharpies and I have puffy paint so
I'm gonna leave this out for people
right now I'm feeling pretty nervous
about doing this it was so important for
me to know that I wasn't alone and
you're not alone there is help out there
there are others who have been through
this I'm not sure that you ever feel
completely healed but you make progress
I kind of feel like I want to cry I kind
of want to smile we have a lot of
emotions going through me that I'm
having a hard time identifying but I
think it feels good I think one of them
the biggest parts for me was writing
underneath me too on this bed in my
house on a second day this unfortunate
experience I think always stays with you
and there are constantly new ways in
which it presents itself in situations
and conversations in your mind and I
think it's important to recognize that
and find ways to empower yourself and
not be afraid and not be ashamed of what
happened because it's not your fault it
wasn't my fault
it wasn't your fault and you do the best
that you can so this is me taking
another step moving towards another
direction of reclaiming in my life and
empowering myself
to say that it's gonna be okay I'm
feeling pretty proud of myself little
strong nervous I wanted to just tell
people it's a weird thing to want to
tell people I think it's time to go to
work
okay I'd see another day let's go see
what this mattress looks like
oh my god people did write on it yeah I
am a little stunned I didn't know what
to expect I think I needed to process a
little bit I have you all right on it
yeah I left notes out here people have
just done writing on it I put it out
this morning
because I have this is amazing I write
on it yeah
I worked for BuzzFeed for over two years
I've helped make a number of videos but
I've never made a video like this or one
by myself before so it feels a little
crazy but it's also empowering and while
it doesn't go away there is hope it's
kind of a relief I never thought I would
do anything like this
it's pretty amazing the impact that one
person can have on another it matters to
be heard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
