a week ago I asked if we could talk and
you penciled me in you can tell
something is wrong and I can tell you no
something is wrong but neither of us are
going to say anything I'm late as usual
you give me a hug and a kiss and you can
tell I'm nervous for how quickly I let
go I'm immediately annoyed how far we're
sitting from one another but also kind
of grateful for how far we're sitting
from one another because I don't know if
I could say this up close I skim the
menu and ask you how your day was trying
to avoid eye contact you talk about
nothing but work as per usual and you
don't ask me about my day as per usual
recognizing this is getting awkward I
say do you want to drink I'm trying to
break the tension but I could also just
really use a drink right now when I
think about what you look like I
remember you know closer than eight feet
away looking at your phone on your way
out the door to go do something that
isn't spending time with me but right
now when you're right in front of me
you're leaning in for the first time in
forever asking what's wrong without
saying where it's more present than
you've ever been this just got a lot
harder
suddenly I remember the moment we met
when you looked at me the way you're
looking at me now with the kindest eyes
I've ever seen that stopped me in my
tracks
this is the moment I almost get cold
feet but before those eyes can stop me
again I look down at my drink and say I
think we should break up you go silent
as your eyes scan every inch of my face
trying to get a grip on what I just said
dammit you're beautiful even when you're
in shock you open your mouth like you're
about to say something and close it
again unsure of what to say and now my
heart is sinking because now I'm
remembering all the reasons I fell for
you in the first place all the memories
and moments that made me put this off as
long as I did and now we're sitting here
staring at each other for what feels
like an eternity and finally my anxiety
boils up out of me are you gonna say
anything the last you break eye contact
look down and whisper I don't know what
to say
and I whisper back I'm sorry I shouldn't
have blindsided you like this now this
is the loudest moment of silence I've
ever sat through like you wouldn't give
me the time of day I had to schedule I
break up a week in advance and you lean
back and say no I understand but you you
didn't reply to my text I got one-word
answers I was skipping meals so we could
eat together sorry if I got tired of
waiting you look back at me and say I'm
sorry I know I haven't been I don't know
we talked for a while and call it a
night you give me another hug and kissed
me on the cheek the way you know I love
and this time I don't want to let go I
can't count how many times I've come
back to this restaurant at this table
with this waitress and replayed that
conversation in my head
rewriting the things I wish I had said
regretting the things I didn't give you
a chance to say wishing I told you
sooner that something was wrong and
wondering if maybe you cared more than I
thought this is where we broke up
I guess I wish it had gone differently
