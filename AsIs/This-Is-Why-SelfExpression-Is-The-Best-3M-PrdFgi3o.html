me what else I do besides art and I said
I play golf her jaw just like dropped to
the floor most people are really
surprised at you acting because most of
them just think I would be like sports
I'm not as like girly as people some
people think I am bi like the clothes I
wear I love like camping
okay I love to cook I feel like I should
be a vegan but like I like burgers too
much if these people can build a
defenders then I want to see if I can i
express myself through my decorations in
my room I want to just write music that
expresses Who I am
I have a jar on my nightstand called
money for adventures we all have
different styles in different ways we
skate or dance a lot of fashion I think
is to represent like a change in your
life and to represent like growth it's
very classic let's see here it's pretty
much the personality that I am I'm not
always that like professional uptight
kind of person I'm more of a chill and
laid-back one my grams owns a farmer
usually kind of wears like colors and
like flannels like this so kinda remind
me of like his farm it's kind of fun
ooh Burgundy my style is just like
everything I've definitely noticed my
style changing as I came into high
school I hope that people remember me as
the girl that had kind of her own
personal touch I want people to remember
me making them laugh in class I hope
they'll remember my good attitude I also
am sometimes like quiet and shy and like
feel uncomfortable expressing myself to
just like make sure you
really love yourself and just make sure
that you're doing what you want to do be
yourself
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
