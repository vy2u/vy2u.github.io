rid of me I've always understood the
concept that beauty is more than a size
I'm a size 14 and I'm 5 7 motherhood
modeling business owner girl you know
just being a woman
there is a woman who her entire life has
fought to be a size two she grew up in a
generation that firmly pushed the ideal
that skinny is what's beautiful and as a
Latin woman I'm not going to lie the
pressures are insane and I think that's
where my self-love journey really
started was seeing my mom struggle so
hard to find it it took her to a runway
show that I was a part of and she saw
this absolutely beautiful community of
curvy women who were absolutely
unapologetic I think it was the first
hand that she realized look at all these
beautiful women they're not ashamed of
what size they wear why the hell should
I be
I'm thrilled to be doing something that
means so much not just to me but to
women around the world I wanted to
create a platform where women can reach
out to me and know that they have a
friend and support within me because
damn if I have this platform what the
hell is the point if I don't help other
women do things that are badass I was
really worried that this industry would
almost devour me and it actually had the
reverse effect one season I had the
opportunity to open the chrome app show
close the Serena Williams show and
pretty much break the rules and
boundaries for absolutely everyone this
is what our industry needed we needed
that change we needed the acceptance I
think that that's what that moment
symbolized why it was me I don't know
but I know that I wouldn't take it back
