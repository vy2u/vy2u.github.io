itself but it couldn't be it hasn't been
a month has it ah this is the worst day
of my life
oh so that's why I cried and broke up
with my girlfriend yesterday after she
told me she didn't like Lauren order I
definitely get to eat whatever the
I want today I can't even remember the
last time I got my period feels like
maybe two weeks or five months bad bad
terrible ah maybe I should just get
pregnant and give myself a break for a
little while look at Nick little Nick
not a care in the world
little privileged manchild friend who
will never know the joys of having a
shedding uterine uh-huh hey mate hey
everything hurts and I'm dying why do I
never put enough tampons in my bag when
I'm gonna get my together this
happens every month I think I actually
might be dying
good wonder if anyone else has their
period at work today
god I'm so ignorant I mean not all women
have wombs and not all women get their
periods I'm such a bath for them is it
too early to start drinking has it
always hurt this much women get their
period have to enjoy this four decades
of their lights then I'll sustain
full-time jobs despite how much we had
our lives at the time and yet we were
used to back down we are bad-ass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
