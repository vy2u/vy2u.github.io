of you there's been a few hiccups sure
but on the whole you've managed to come
across as a normal moderately functional
human being that's more than can be said
for the last day we block it down block
it out all we have left is a kiss
goodbye and then we can flip that
autopilot switch and finish binge
watching ancient aliens number - status
report how close are we to final
destination approaching the front
doorsteps now so kay let's step in and
take manual control of the situation I
want full cognitive access of the entire
body pulling up live visuals audio and
sensory information now truffle butter
truffle butter don't say truffle butter
don't truffle butter Oh
why would you fix this uh you've got
some stuff in your gutter you should
clean it up oh yeah yeah I got it better
get a handyman um I have a lot of fun
with you today um thanks for walking me
home - uh yeah me too okay what now guys
we should ask her a question to keep the
conversation moving before trial joke
something from earlier uh can't say the
same about that turkey bake just can't
say the same for that turkey we just ate
oh god what did I just do yeah you're
right and though I imagine there's no
good time to be a turkey true true
okay I'm changing the subject not too
hot out today right uh no no not oh hey
hey hey keep eyes on the visual keep
visuals on the eyes oh sorry sir we
should just tell her we want to kiss her
and no magic at all we need to keep
sending signals that to test the waters
and then react accordingly try brushing
something out of her hair you've got
something in your hair
oh really what what is it nothing it's a
leaf I think
okay did anyone pick up on any signals
