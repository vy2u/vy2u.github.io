- Yeah.
- I get to the party and then she
tells me she has a boyfriend.
- Oh my--now that is crazy.
Ah, shit, hey, I gotta get going.
(gun cocking and firing)
[Voiceover] Why the hell
didn't Steve shake my hand?
Ah, he probably didn't see it.
Okay, no, he saw my hand, he saw it.
I'm not gonna go through this again.
Did I do something to offend Steven?
Is Steven not my friend anymore?
What if Steven has never liked me at all?
Alex, you are taking this too far,
he didn't see the hand.
Dude, he saw the fucking hand.
Alright, let's go over this,
what was he saying to you before
you tried to shake his hand?
- She tells me she has a boyfriend.
- [Voiceover] Is that what he said?
I think it was more like...
- I fucking hate you!
- [Voiceover] He's probably joking,
this is probably all just a big joke.
He probably thinks I'm obsessing over it.
(groaning)
Yeah, maybe I should just text him,
smooth the whole thing over.
This is stupid.
No, it's not stupid, he
didn't shake your hand.
I'm not gonna text him over this.
Fuck this! This is what he wants!
Calm down.
Just text him, just do it!
Fuck that!
Oh, shit! That was an iPhone 6 Plus!
- So, she invites me to New Year's,
- Yeah.
- I get to the party and then she
tells me she has a boyfriend.
- Oh my--, now that is crazy.
- I mean they've gotta
be able to, you know,
- [Steven] some sort of...
- [Alex] Shit.
- [Alex] Hey, Steven, I gotta run, man,
but it was great to see you.
- Yeah, catch ya.
♫ She's a hipster
♫ She's a hipster
♫ She's a hipster ♫
I'll call you soon.
- Okay, text me later.
- [Voiceover] Where's Alex?
Did he leave without saying goodbye?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
