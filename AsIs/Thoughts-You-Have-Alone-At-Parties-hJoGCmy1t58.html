party Sam thanks for inviting me
everyone's gonna love you I'm gonna run
to the bathroom okay yeah totally okay
okay you got this nobody's even looking
over here oh where am I supposed to go
my whole thing is beer weird how do we
go hold things everyone here probably
wants to talk to me but they're
intimidated however maybe they're all
best friends and nobody likes me oh I
kind of know that person okay I want to
die now okay what if I'm being rude I'm
such an asshole
how do people look cool parties just Bob
your head to the music and smile there
you go
job we got this you are a confident
woman oh yeah she wants to come and talk
to me got a friend
oh no she just wants to get to the part
I hope nobody thinks I came here alone
like not there's anything wrong with
that I should be able to do this like
being by myself is a skill I should have
developed wonder if there's a dog here
it should be legally mandated to have a
dog at every party but if I truck this
drink and you go get another drink and
that'll give me something to do
chug chug chug I hate beer but would
beyoncé do what am i doing I can't pull
that off how long does it take for Ally
to pee I've been standing there for like
five hours she probably found somebody
she liked better and then just abandoned
me at this bar to die a slow and
agonizing death damn you bathroom gods
hey hey anything happened when I was
gone nothing never leave me again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
