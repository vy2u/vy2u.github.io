falling over I bet they're special
training for that our brand new
gender-neutral bathrooms oh oh oh I
don't think I've ever heard of
gender-neutral bathroom mom it's 2014 we
need someplace to meet people
is it true that we are the top Polo
University in the world we are the top
it's a little presumptuous you haven't
even gotten in yet isn't looking at the
school before I get in kind of putting
the cart before the horse is it so
expensive because there are so many
flowers everywhere where are all the
acapella groups what if I don't get in
here what if I don't get in anywhere I
wonder if the tour guide has a say in
admissions wait don't be stupid of
course he doesn't
is it true that the school has the
hottest students all right everybody
really is attractive here do you think
you get hot before you get in or after
ah I'm so hungry
I wish the store had hors d'oeuvres they
could call them toward herbs oh that's
good
I should rub my essay on that oh yeah
I'm double majoring in biology and
partying so a young man where would the
nearest hospital be Oh mom stop asking
so many questions
oh it's okay in a few months I'll be all
my own if I get in anywhere of course
