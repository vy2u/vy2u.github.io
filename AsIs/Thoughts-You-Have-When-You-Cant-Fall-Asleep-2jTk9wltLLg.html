still get eight hours of sleep so all I
have to do is fall asleep right damn it
I have to pee again
false alarm I hope no one saw me trip
today at lashing pecky saw I hope she's
the only one she told everybody else and
now no one thinks I know how to walk
it's way too hot in here
I forgot to set my alarm ah too bright
and now I'm too cold
wait did I forget to lock the door well
I don't really have any enemies mm-hmm
okay I need to get off my phone and I
never set my alarm okay it's only been
an hour if I fall asleep now I can still
get seven hours of sleep it's too bright
in here maybe you need to move or maybe
huh no one ever post anything
interesting at night without was that
this is because I didn't lock the door
do I need to stop eating in bed and I
feel like a hostage I'm gonna take these
off where's where's where's my phone
where's there it is how do we find peace
in the Middle East
oh god it's 5 a.m. what happened I think
I'm finally falling asleep damn it I
have to pee
