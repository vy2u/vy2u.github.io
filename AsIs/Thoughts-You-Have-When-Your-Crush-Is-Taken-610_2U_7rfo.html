a relationship what the is this oh my
god I'm gonna be a cat lady for the rest
of my life well he's a Gemini and she's
a Virgo so it can't last forever right
look at that gap of space that he left
between them in that photo asking for
physical space means that he obviously
wants to break up what if they get
married there's no way right of course
I'm right
okay okay let's Google what do you do
when you found your soul mate but
they're taken
Wiki oh is this the best article this
looks good how to make someone fall in
love with you I don't know if I'm the
only one who's noticed but he also never
mentions her when I'm around that's like
a sign right I mean this girlfriend's
cute I guess they're an okay couple but
real talk
we would look so much better and then
there was that time in the kitchen where
we both reached for the cereal at the
same time they've been together two
years oh they're gonna break up any day
now huh maybe I should see a psychic but
for real Pharaoh what about the hug at
that party it was for like two seconds
too long and I remember reading
somewhere in Cosmo I mean cats are cool
chefs
so who's texting me Oh guess who's
single oh my god he wants me I know you
want this and do you want this yes okay
let's calm down no one likes it they're
stupid
