women addresses our relationship with
dresses as a little girl I like dreaded
dresses I hated dresses I always felt
like I was getting in trouble because I
would be running or jumping and like
everyone would see my ass I feel like
I'm just gonna be like frustrated and
also super insecure all week new
addresses is that they're sort of
presented at this like feminine ideal
like they're just very feminine womanly
sometimes like very sexualized article
of clothing I've never worn a dress and
I'm like this is me I volunteered
because I was like this shouldn't be
hard and I'm like like what am i doing
I'm about to put on the first dress of
the week it's gonna be fun the difficult
thing is not necessarily getting a dress
on it's zipping the dress oh my god you
guys this is my dress though I mean I
had my mom bought it for me trying to
like pick something up with like you're
gonna give everybody like a show oh no
my chapstick you have to be like
basically do like a curtsy a big test of
everything is whether you can sit in a
 dress and not look like an idiot
I feel like I'm already flashing you my
butt I'm gonna dress this this
week was not as bad as I thought it was
gonna be it was fine but too annoying to
do by choice
my dress has risen up for work I had to
film a video and so I was trying to set
up lights and run around set and I just
felt like physically I couldn't get all
that I needed to get done I don't think
my lifestyle is conducive to wearing
dresses all the time
Jordan doesn't know how to get off the
feedback I don't I don't know how to do
it without flashing everybody
it just seems like when I was wearing a
dress people had a lot more to say about
my body guys would just like check me
out more and it was a little bit more
uncomfortable and I just felt more
vulnerable it's weird it's just a dress
but it was like the most uncomfortable
thing ever wear whatever you want but
also it's sort of like it's true that
people might think of you differently
simply because of what you're wearing
and like you can't really separate
yourself from that I think it's just
super important to wear stuff that
you're like comfortable win and like
yourself close serve a purpose of
self-expression and that's kind of it
Thanks exactly a new t-shirt I'm really
excited about it don't be it do nothing
it's Ronda Rousey
ah just my woman crush Wednesday - yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
