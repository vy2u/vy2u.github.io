hi I'm Ashley and my name is miles Finn
we've been together for seven years
seven and a half years I'm ADA and I'm
Theresa we've been together about two
and a half years I'm Solomon and I'm
Evelyn this is baby harmony and we've
been together for three months but we've
known each other for a bit we met at a
play one of my best friends came to one
of my birthday parties and brought her
along I moved through into the change is
a fundraiser for trans people we were
together almost three years before I
started transition or started coming up
more and more for me it wasn't until
about what six months maybe nine months
into our relationship that I really
decided that I needed to transition
after had been coming up again and again
she kind of stopped me and said okay so
what's what's next it was um it was a
little tricky at first having to
readjust myself to getting used to like
being with a like a male partner was was
a bit different I think people don't
realize a lot of the time just how fluid
sexuality is in sexual orientation that
just because you're transitioning to a
gender that your partner is not normally
attracted to it doesn't mean they'll
necessarily want to leave you and just
love him that's all I know I don't think
it matters that you're transgender if
you're straight you're gay if you know
you're anything in between as long as
you find something that you love and
you're happy being who you are
it shouldn't matter I don't want to say
too much like I'm normal I'm normal like
I'm just like you so don't be scared of
me
because I think that there's a lot of
value in being different a relationship
gives me strength he has really taught
me how to communicate I really don't
think that I would have been able to
achieve half the things I have in my
life without having him in it this
relationship has kind of taught me what
love really is it's awesome like the
feeling I couldn't want to be loved she
loves me really well once you find
somebody that is accepting of who you
are and that and that loves you the same
way that you love them and you guys are
able to work in that way then hold on
tight to that because it's that's that's
a rarity there's nobody else that I
would rather like take on this adventure
with me you know
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
