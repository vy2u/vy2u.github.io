forever together and laughing and and
and being very open so I I feel like we
need to talk more about love over the
years I have tried I think every single
online dating app that is available I've
used everything from OkCupid to tinder
yes passion and yes dating I'm thinking
about Christian mingle but I don't
qualify for that one in the past I
wouldn't disclose that I was trans but I
definitely got into some sticky
situations that weren't so safe I wanted
to know what I'm looking for I wanted to
know that I'm someone who is happy
someone who got has goals someone who
has a happy life and then I shared that
I am a transgender woman and I that that
doesn't define who I am I just was first
and foremost that I am trans because I'm
proud of being trans and I think they
should be proud to be with the trans
woman because there's nothing weird
about it I think the main challenges are
misogyny you get hit up by all these
different types of trolls and they're
disgusting they're like the scum of the
earth like they're obsessed with trans
porn and it's ruined them basically they
don't treat us like people you know like
they treat us like objects there's so
much ignorance and misunderstanding and
Prejudice around trans bodies
particularly when it comes to sexuality
and gender I think there is this
misconception about a man dating a trans
woman which is okay you were a trans
woman so now I'm gay you don't need to
define yourself different because you're
still a guy and I'm still girl
I had a couple of long-term
relationships that came out of online
dating and these were with men who were
fairly centered in their identity and so
what when other people questioned their
identity for dating a trans woman or
accused them of being gay for dating a
trans woman they had enough security and
their own identity to to know that that
wasn't the case my ex-boyfriend we have
like a seven years relationship we met
online and it was beautiful so that make
me think like somewhere somewhere
somehow is looking for me online also
looking for that woman with something
special that they can date and have a
fun life don't compromise don't
compromise what you're looking for don't
compromise yourself even if you get
beyond all these other issues about
disclosure about sex and like finding
the right person for still the issue do
you just like the person as a person I
have sometimes been on dates with people
who found out I was trans we're okay
with it and then I just realized they
weren't the right person for me just as
a person for does that who just starting
transitioning or does you looking for
love I believe it's possible I believe
you have to continue doing what you do
going to school working and being a good
person and that one day someone will
value that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
