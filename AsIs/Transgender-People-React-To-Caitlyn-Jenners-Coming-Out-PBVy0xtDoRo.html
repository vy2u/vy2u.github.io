there was like the other was his overly
happiness really kind of thrilled for a
massive deal I felt like it was a
positive thing in a lot of ways and I
had like a really transformative day
it's the first time I've been given a
chance to change the way that media
perceives us just feeling good about
myself and feel like goodbye my friends
as well our identity was like
acknowledged as likely like a legitimate
identity or like such like I'm at scale
and everyone knows who came in January
is prior to the Kardashians and I'd say
it's a massive deal for young trans
United States initially you know there's
that feeling of well great you know
there is somebody else who's finally
living true themselves and on some level
I think this is really good for kind of
trans exposure as well but it's a mixed
bag in the sense that here's this like
white wealthy white trans woman who's
able to become a lot of the barriers
that are faced by most trans women so
obviously those issued privilege that
that's not the average experience for a
trans woman young trans people facing an
enormous amount of disadvantage and
oppression and marginalization in
Melbourne there is one hospital really
in the entire
truth that it's tucking in focus towards
young people and they found that more
than half of the kids who are on that
waiting list and I thought about suicide
or had made an attempt I don't think
there's a single trans person that
hasn't touched any of those stats I'm
liable to tentative because I didn't
think I feel and didn't have the support
that I made my daily experience of being
trans is like a cop a lot of abuse just
walking down the street so when I was
growing up I liked a trans life like
wasn't really considered by me because
like the media representations of trans
people were just like the parent most of
these media coverages deal with people
who are in very advanced stages of their
transition and I think that really
paints a kind of banal picture of the
experiences and kind of internal and
external struggles that gender-variant
people have hopefully they'll be a
little bit more sensitivity around
transphobia I just hope that if maybe if
anything that like the discussion
continues in like this unrelenting
manner I can only hope that you'll use
her relative power and influence to talk
about these issues facing those trans
women general greater acceptance of
trans female identity as real we should
be celebrated for being you know how and
bodies transfer and where humans just
like anyone else we should be seen as
individuals and treated as such this
uncertain trans women that don't wanna
change their bodies very much and that
should be celebrated as beautiful as
well it's just that there is no where no
wrong way to be trans every point of
your transition your with gender
identity and your expression thereof is
still loud and should be recognized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
