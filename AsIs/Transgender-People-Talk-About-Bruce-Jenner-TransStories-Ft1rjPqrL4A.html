Bruce Jenner and I understand it's the
most visible Tran story but I just don't
really have some feelings about it as a
kind of social moment it's only
important to me and as much as it
elevates the visibility of the entire
community and the entire movement that
Bruce Jenner and him coming out and I
used him because that's what he
requested it's a good thing and I think
that originally when there were rumors
that he was going to be coming out I was
concerned the only kind of hiccup with
with accepting Bruce and Bruce's path to
transition was was feeling like they're
losing Bruce I think you know that will
come with time maybe they'll see that
they don't lose Bruce that Bruce is the
same person that Bruce is just now gets
to live as the gender that Bruce wanted
to be for their entire life
transgenderism honestly it's not
mainstream yet even if he has the best
intentions and I'm totally wrong it's
still hard to see this this new reality
documentary show is anything but
sensationalism I'm afraid that it's
going to be transportation which would
which is a thing it's the most
revolutionary thing that's happened on
mainstream television I feel like the
world can't go back now so people might
think like okay people are fine but
trans people are weird and I don't know
a trans person but 17 million people
watch that Bruce Jenner interview so now
17 million people know a trans person
here's this athlete who's a Republican
who then is like a transsexual because
these are things that we hold as like an
athlete can't like a very hyper
masculine eyes athlete could never be a
transsexual nor could a Republican those
two things wouldn't happen and then BOOM
the interview was great I think that the
process that has
that he's going through is great I think
that it has the potential to enlighten
people trans people transition
differently everyone transitions
differently some people decide to have
facial feminization surgery some people
decide to do hormones some people decide
to do SRS for someone like that to
transition I think is an opportunity for
a teachable moment we're in a moment of
increased transmissibility a kind of
renaissance of it really but we're
seeing one particular story more than
any other and that's the story of people
who were straight white men there is no
one way to be trans and there is no one
trans experience we have to listen to
the full range of them we're really
going to understand trans issues and
prioritize needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
