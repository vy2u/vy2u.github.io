different but I don't I didn't you know
what that meant I had always felt some
kind of issue around my gender even
though I never had words for it when I
started college it was like okay I'm
gonna be a normal guy yeah that didn't
happen cuz it an early age I knew that I
didn't feel comfortable as like assigned
female I came out to my parents in high
school my senior year I had attempted to
commit suicide my body was what felt the
most alienating and alien to me but that
kind of asked me out of everything
because I didn't understand where I fit
I felt really displaced coming from a
very traditional southern background
house had a very firm sense of how I was
supposed to act as a man when I first
came out to them it was very difficult
for them being trans wasn't as accepted
as it is now I struggled a lot and I and
I thought that maybe by by conquering it
every day that I would become the
stronger person I was deeply unhappy and
I was just using that as an excuse to
not transition the fracture between my
brain and my body just kept getting
bigger as I got older you know it felt
devastating and I couldn't find anyone
that not only anyone that was like me
but anyone that understood me so and my
email was basically one paragraph in it
it basically said you know dear everyone
I've decided to change my name and
gender please update your records
accordingly and that was pretty much it
and I was jamming as people to use Chi
pronouns people change their names to me
this was just as casual if you don't
talk to someone for six months they
might have changed their gender they
might have changed their name I came out
to my mom first
called her on a payphone and just was
like listen there's this thing and I'm
that and that thing is like a trans male
which means this it was seamless for her
she immediately switched over with
pronouns and then my dad just was like
his attachment to it in the beginning
felt like he imagined that this was
going to be a passing phase my mom was
gonna be the hardest person to tell you
know both my parents they're they're
they're pretty conservative
we're not a family that talks about our
feelings so I I wrote a very long
eloquent email that would address any
questions they might have it was just
really well thought out she was like
what do you what do you want me to say
and I said all I want you to say is that
you love me and she was like of course I
love you you're my child being able to
transition and to live as me just makes
me a whole person it's like going from a
2-dimensional person to a 3-dimensional
person I'm just a better person because
of it my being Tran doesn't demand
anything of anyone else except the
barriers just the barest modicum of like
respect and dignity change name and
pronoun that's it
