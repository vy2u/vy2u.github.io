probably don't have to wonder how we
ended up here I'm Laura and I'm Kelsey
and we've made so many damn videos about
our chronic pain we can't even believe
we're still talking about this
I've got trigeminal neuralgia which is a
neuropathic chronic pain disorder that
was the result of a doctor's mistake who
damaged my nerve during surgery I've
also got a fun to say
anesthesia Dolorosa in the bottom half
of my face chin and neck which in Latin
means numb pain so my face is numb and
in the ship to the pain just all the
time and I've got a ton of vagina
problems for the last 10 years I've
basically had endometriosis which then
developed into vaginosis which then gave
me bull Virginia which sin was aDNA my
OSIS which then was pelvic pain
dysfunction all over interstitial
cystitis I don't even know basically my
face hurts and Laura's vagina
hurts all the time and these are not
things you can fix overnight we tried
everything from acupuncture this is our
acupuncture so peop say hi massages
surgeries pills sound therapy crystal
healing we've really tried it all so you
could see why we'd be skeptical when
someone popped into our inbox talking
about a non-invasive no pain possible
cure for our pain lasers this
serendipitous email led us down a
YouTube rabbit hole that led us to find
Carmen care laser Center in
but 2,000 miles away so we've trying to
figure out how to get from Los Angeles
to Boca and the most pain free way
possible over the next three weeks
you're going to watch our twelfth day
hopefully life-changing journey there
will be tears there all do laughter
there will be paint I wonder if my
stomach out of my body but hopefully
it'll be worth them going into this when
we first started planning this trip and
first to realize that we are gonna go to
Florida and do this crazy thing and like
get this laser therapy I never really
once let myself think what if it works
because I've been down that road so many
 times before
and I don't know emotionally if I can go
down that road again what percentage
would you say that you buy at this
moment I'm gonna honestly say 50/50
because you're more optimistic about
this I am because I don't have like a
choice I'm still in that optimism phase
you're like I'm like over it over it I
mean I am going away for two weeks
essentially just Laura and I on what's
supposed to be a life-changing trip is
so hard to become Lonnie I play I mean
for normal people yeah add in some
chronic pain oh I love the idea of being
away from my comfort zone which is my
bed and my room and where my doctors are
and where my therapists are away from my
friends I am really nervous I don't like
being away from my apartment and being
away from my heating pads and being away
from my bathroom and being away from all
the things that I know make me
comfortable when I'm in that amount of
pain I have been working on it with my
therapist for the last year or so about
traveling with the pain because I have
become a bit of an agoraphobe sense
I started having more bad pain days my
biggest fear
ever is having a TN attack while I'm not
home I've skipped out on trips to
amazing locations because I've been
afraid of the travel time of the flight
feeling like I have no control of the
time I could or could not be in pain
gives me way too much anxiety to follow
through with any travel plans and in
2012 when I was accepted into grad
school in London aka my dream I
ended up having to turn it down because
of the amount of pain I was in day to
day I think about it all the time what
my life might have been like if I had
moved to London and attended grad school
there I always thought that I would be
living in London or like moving to
Australia and as I've gotten older like
I've become kind of like a hermit like
it's terrifying to think if I had an
attack where I'm passing out or throwing
up from the pain on an airplane like
please no
without further ado here's Kelsey and
Lara's packing tips for traveling with
chronic pain anyone with chronic pain
can tell you that packing double is just
kind of part of the traveling process in
order to make myself comfortable while
traveling I literally always go and buy
those CDs that's that you can like wrap
around your stomach I also always try to
take in cells with me my carry-on
vibrator gets in spots that like no
massager can get in whatever little
massagers pill to know that if I was
trying to take pain killers on the plane
no one would say to me and to know
that if people knew what this was and
saw it in my bag I could possibly go to
jail that stresses me house beyond
belief but you know what stresses me out
more putting myself in pain for 12 days
when I know that there's a simple
solution that could help me
portable cover pens has CBD oil bringing
a bunch of book that I have yet to read
about pain like I have to bring this
shirt seems appropriate for the trip
comfortable socks for bad pain it's
eating and cooling pads for pain now I
have to fit all this in a bag ha ha ha
this is pepper sometimes when you have
chronic pain you kind of just want to
stay in bed and you don't want to leave
it so it's been really good for me to
have her because otherwise if I didn't
have her I don't know if I would get out
of that some days I'm supposed to be
packing for this life-changing trip and
there's a funk you everything hurts it's
like it's like trying to function with
just a blowtorch on your body sometimes
I just wonder what it would feel like to
be just not feeling anything at 27 like
packing a bag shouldn't take this
 much out of me okay we must
persist sitting in the same position or
sitting on a hard surface causes me a
mints leg back hip pain for days after
and I literally will pay lots of extra
money to get myself as much leg room as
possible keeping myself a little bit
more comfortable
next $179 a it's not gonna pay for
a girl can dream
I think I'm going in 90% thinking it's
not gonna work and there's like a little
10% of me thinking but what if it does
my eye is starting to twitch I'm so
nervous
morning of the trip how you feeling
normally we would be having some of that
but we're trying to stay sober
to give our bodies the best chance at
being the best they can be
I think this is gonna be harder than
traveling our suggestions for travel
outfits for people specifically with
chronic pain are as follows flat shoes
because when you're already in pain you
want to make sure your body works the
least amount as possible plus people
that wear heeled shoes the airport are
like some sort of mutant superhero
people yep it's stretchy leggings
because regular pants would constrict my
abdomen or my vagina and we aren't
having any of that a thick jacket to
hide that endo blow and also to keep my
stomach warmer yeah and you can roll it
up and use it as a pillow for your face
a sports bra to keep your boobs company
especially if you have hormonal issues
that make them sensitive as hell or no
bra that's just a personal preference
before I go off the plane I always put
rub on my ass
I try to meditate and for as much as we
did prepping for this shoot four weeks
beforehand we still forgot some of the
essential yeah it's a good one for only
$40 Mara decided to buy Germany because
she doesn't know she's gonna be able to
sleep on the place
as they say in chronic pain better buy
everything at the airport store and be
safe than sorry
$91 just to be comfortable
pressure
chicken
Piper
we're here how would you say
comparatively to other flights you've
had was this travel day a six out of ten
so I got up once to pee and the lady
next to me acted like it was not her so
I just didn't get up again after that
and I wish that I would have yeah I
thought it now cuz I'm like it's like we
put ourselves you and even more
uncomfortable position yeah you can move
that's how planes work yeah so I
guess we're just gonna call it a night
and then get up early and like it's day
one little worried about Laura when we
woke up the first thing she said was
that she was nervous and should we even
have come and done it it started to hit
me like maybe this is stupid what I'm
doing I don't know if this is gonna work
I don't know much about this lady what
if I like messes me up way more I don't
know hey do you go on a walk we gotta go
see if we can be fixed because we're
broken
next time on can we cure the plan is
first we're gonna sit together and I'm
gonna really understand where is your
pain coming from so you're gonna get
laser therapy for the pain
refractory then we're gonna do laser
energy detoxification I know there's
like so often probably weird and then
we're going to also do psych a sessions
and then we can really figure out okay
how many treatments of what are we going
to need this could be the dumbest
 thing we've ever wasted money on
a certain video or it works I don't know
