yeah it's a hipster condiment delicious
as always not that spicy it's not too
spicy but the flavor is unbelievable
and it goes well with everything one of
my personal favorites Cholula a classy
lady
it's like tangy you have to eat the
entire bottle in order to get the kick
Panola clearly hot sauce and it's clear
hello worried that it just got kicked up
a notch
all in all I'm getting a real gross vibe
from this thing oh nothing happened it's
vinegar in a bottle with a pepper and
some garlic I would put that stuff in my
eyes bunker-buster deep penetrating hot
sauce there's no hiding from this heat
let's do it earthy taste a little earthy
renovate it's like jalapenos with a lot
of oil it tastes like what you would
taste at the bottom of a burrito I have
not ever gotten a colon cleanse it
smelled like a spicy version of the
sauce you get in Lunchables there's like
a sweetness there's definitely a
sweetness you could really taste the
vinegar they like penetrates like three
layers down in your tongue that's pod
Dave's insanity sauce and it's the
original hottest sauce in the universe
cheers fellas
oh my god that's the hottest one my
emergency contact number is somewhere on
file here there's no sensation is left
in my mouth okay no more the last time I
drank this month milk
it's actually my birthday today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
