Holiday Collection
I'm not into the holiday makeup kit by
situation there's lots of glitter lots
of shine I'd rather wear that on my body
and keep my normal makeup routine as
opposed to like switching it up all the
holidays deserve makeup collections that
cost too much money yeah oh it's a fact
I feel like every year people are like
amped about it and it seems like a good
deal at the times you're like I need
this and it's limited edition and then
you never use it again
why are we so obsessed with the
Nutcracker it is boring okay first of
all I'm already very excited because I
love the Nutcracker okay this is a
complete 182 seconds ago she was like I
don't even like holiday makeup and now
we're into it Oh glamorous what the
whole bag the same tricks oh my god look
it looks like a little
something-something Nutcracker ass hmm
light and wispy yeah wow those few hairs
are really truly becoming pronounced
mrs. dream scene prolongwear paint pops
this color reminds me of what I thought
Lance Bass was straight okay this is
just a little eyeliner pencil hmm oh
that's nice very pigmented and smooth
okay ooh I like this one this little
darker fathoms deep oh this is a pretty
color though I kind of put this on
smokey under our I don't think you're
getting a great deal but I think it's
probably worth 42 bucks it's pretty cute
I was not ready for this this is so
people oh I was just like it's not that
it's not like emerged this one is called
flan voice
neon colors are really hard to figure
out like in terms of formulas so I think
they figured it out here and I would buy
this look at how it's hot summer melanin
okay and this one is like a very lighter
one this is interesting
the thing about this is like I actually
think this is kind of fun at first I was
afraid and now I think it's kind of fun
but it doesn't scream holiday to me No
oh wow hey this is like a nude palette
plus two accent colors you know what it
is a little bit it's very like ballet
yeah
ballet slippers pink since I have yet to
see pink eyeshadow like on a human being
in the real world are you ready I don't
like this this color calling my name
so I'm gonna try and squash that word oh
wow like you're not really nice on you
like look nice
I like it yeah subtle the interesting
thing about this is that knowing that I
would like to see this as a present
maybe I'd buy it as a present for
someone else so it's like you probably
don't have those already so here they
are right whoo oh that is more Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works than I thought it would be
whoa that looks like blood it does it's
and you're a little too excited ooh I
like the lipstick what is this color
called Oh candy cane this is not okay I
like the motto this gloss
I'm just keep looking at it I love
things that make me look like I just ate
someone okay I'm diggie mess I'm getting
excited about this oh I'm I'm jazz this
is a nicer pig that's gonna look good on
you Oh playing it away very smooth it
goes on so smooth it doesn't feel like a
lipstick it feels really creamy I
probably wouldn't wear this one but I
love the consistency I like that I like
it it's pretty it's not as much as the
first pale pink but I like it look at
this highlighting it looks like a planet
oh my god the lights just hitting me
such a beautiful way it's very ice-cream
he's what I'll say like it's a really
pale and it's definitely like serving a
specific kind of look I think that
everything was very fun and every single
thing that we tried I would be happy to
receive as a gift maybe it's not for me
very like I'm wearing makeup and I'm
more like is she wearing Bangka you know
like I said before I'm not really into
like holiday packages or holiday sets
because it feels glittery and kind of
like a one-time use only kind of
situation and these things seem to
really be pretty versatile so I would
definitely get this I definitely I have
a lot of girlfriends who would love this
this line is a look and you have to be
aware of that yeah but it's fun to just
like experiment and like try out these
things that you may not otherwise take
for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
