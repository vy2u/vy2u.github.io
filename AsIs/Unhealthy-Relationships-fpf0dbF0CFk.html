got cheated on her last relationship she
has certain triggers but there isn't a
single moment this weekend where I felt
like she treats you okay
it's just crazy lesbian drama no it's
crazy crazy person drama what so she's a
woman so she's excused from treating
other women like she's in chainmail

treated me like this we would hate him
forever feel like she's just completely
manipulated you into feeling like you
deserve this
