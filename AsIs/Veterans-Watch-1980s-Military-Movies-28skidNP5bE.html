don't get injured that's what we've
learned here I was in the Army for four
years I was an infantry officer for six
years I was in the Air Force for 12
years and oh come on highway to the
dangerzone
war is often romanticized probably 90%
of my time overseas was playing
volleyball shirtless with dudes how much
baby oil was used to make this seen a
lot of ABS I feel bad for goose because
he's the only dude that just didn't have
the body to take his shirt off oh god
they look good you never forget your
drill instructor or drill sergeants name
he's basically the gold standard for all
drill instructors of all time I was I
was in the Air Force they didn't they
didn't even yell at us drill instructors
did this now they would probably go to
jail cussing yelling hitting not gonna
work these insults are more creative
than anything that I have ever done in
my entire life
all right commando yeah nice grenade
toss nice backflip yeah the nice thing
about his camo job is that it
accentuates the muscles and that's
important it's not just about
concealment it's about looking good
while you kill people Arnold's biceps
just glistening in the Sun it's more
majestic than like a unicorn in a
rainbow no reason to spread out let's
just run right at the guy with the
automatic weapon yes that guy just felt
like a blind roofer I feel like this is
the way to every veterans heart is
thrown on some solid 1980s action movies
the 80s are the best these guys go to
like backflip school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
