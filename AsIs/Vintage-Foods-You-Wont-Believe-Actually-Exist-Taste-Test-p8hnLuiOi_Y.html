that's like a come Bloody Mary on bad
tastes like congealed v8 I feel like I'm
on an alien planet eating this just
looks like a pill of puke it's just so
good for lunch mayonnaise I thought
maybe like this aren't gonna be as bad
as they sound but in reading about that
there's the really bad mostly just
tastes like potato salad was like a
weird cheese thing on top I'm totally
into this
are you serious
with tune on top yeah my throat won't
accept it I don't know why you do this
it's like a recipe that you would make
if you had never heard of food before oh
whoa whoa other weird flavors underneath
it but it's mostly just a pile of tuna
oh this smells miss one gosh
this is aggressive one so far I'm
gagging a little bit just cutting it
apart that's not fun Oh awful like I
feel like I don't want to ever have ham
or bananas or hollandaise sauce ever
again it makes for an interesting
dessert I think I regret doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
