we up so you don't have to any it's
spelled with the one also in case you're
still confused about it mm-hmm it wasn't
our choice no it wasn't I'm Kelsey and
I'm Kate
guys we heard you loud and clear last
week you a fairy I thought I thought we
didn't include a Kate come update I get
it listen something you gotta give me a
break yeah you get a freakin coven and
also we forgot and we just silently
forgot lastly there's a little bit of a
whoo oh yeah yeah last week was rough
you did have you took a few days off mhm
which was how was it good I took the
days off because Pete got neutered so I
stayed home with him there's still the
same he's filming so he's at yeah he
didn't he wasn't even sedated when I got
him home he was you know when perfectly
explained it's like a happy thing in TV
shows are like movies when a box starts
shaking a whole bunch because there's an
animal in it that was him in his carrier
I buckles him I always buckle him in but
I buckled the carrier it and it was just
like yeah you know he's the exact same
cat nothing changed yeah no nothing at
all he would not keep the coat on I
think you should get a second cat I
can't in my apartment right now okay
that's for sure is it it would stink to
high heavens did you play with your
diddle at all on all these days off I
call my vagina I did a little did you
spit all your dough I hate it when
people say that I yeah hi Leigh did you
 you flick the bean yeah you
never heard that it looks like a bean I
guess I understand the sentiment there
it's just the idea of a puppet king
you're like it to be flicked I don't
know okay ball no judgment hey hey I'm
not judging
I didn't of course not okay here's the
thing I went to go use the pearly rabbit
and it died and there's got it I know
and then the news of it not honestly to
God not even that much I just I think it
was only kind of charged which makes me
wonder was it you dog oh he's a cat Oh
cat dog so the thing is though is that I
don't know where the charger is like the
bow well the box didn't come with a
charger yes you did oh we did it I'll
bring you the box is it allowed
repowered I don't even know how to oh it
says rechargeable so I don't know where
the charger is so they're listening it
would be awesome if you sent me a charge
or if you figured out how to open the
back where you put the batteries in
because I'm always rechargeable maybe
rechargeable batteries I don't
know and you know I finally started my
period hurry my cycle was like
30-something days long like literally 36
days or something I just like didn't
have a period for this month cat game uh
it's here its back with a
vengeance and I just wanted to shout
everyone out
I never had so many people write in also
talking about their problems and
all the that vagina vaginas are
nuts women go through so much I've had
so many extensive conversations about
people who had IUDs and the shots and
the pills and then don't do any of it
and just how many of you guys I just
feel like the more we talk about this
the more we realized how many people
actually do go through these issues yeah
and I think it'll take away like how
gross things are if we just talk about
them more I mean I don't think we hope
gross is it is gross it is we have an oh
we have a constantly open wound
it's not a wound it's not broken it's
self-cleaning itself we just have like
this functioning nothing else in our our
body like stays open all the time the
way our vagina your mouth does
am i right
I'll be quiet you take the lead take the
reins guilty you want to take this by
yourself hi please no go ahead steer
this no you guys all know that all the
comments are just about how wisdom in it
how wisdom you are you're so you're so
excited a you want to see wisdom step up
to the plate oh no oh boy no but
seriously I think what I'm gonna end up
doing is going on some progesterone I
know I said I did want corn mo Joshua
but I heard that why are you sorry
that's what you do
silly babe it apparently is the hormone
that doesn't with your mood or
anything like it's it's in birth control
is estrogen and progesterone and I guess
also if I'm wrong please let me know
before I do this but i just heard way
too many horror stories about a copper
IUD i heard a story from me touching you
sorry because it was it's such a hard
story so this shirt that I'm wearing
says power to the and it's a sure
my kid Belle that mom we're definitely
gonna have her on soon and she was
telling me a horror story about her IUD
dose it's it's shaped like a tea with
like hooks like a vagina
kind of yeah and her she was getting
 by this guy who had such a big
dick that her ie D Pierce on her own
 cervix wall and she had to go to
the ER she made him take her it like
fish hooked into her body and I was like
nope thank you so much have a nice day I
will not be getting the IUD I'm
too much that's too much risk you
imagine fishhooking it's like finding
your own self no I go down there no we
need to wake it up maybe you should do
it have you ever thought about never
mind what what I was just gonna say have
you ever thought about like maybe go on
birth control to help regulate some
hormones like the same way that getting
off of it made me super horny maybe you
going on it no okay guys we have a new
email address that
then a lot of you guys send this
questions via Twitter and Instagram hmm
but we made one finally it is adult
podcast at gmail.com that is adult
 spelled with the wine podcast at
gmail dude cool we should actually let's
take a question from there oh let's do a
random question so Francis wrote thank
you so much for doing the podcast I
especially identified with Caden the
episode about falling in love did you
have a question though I struggled daily
with my anxiety and depressive mood
swings my best friend was recently
diagnosed as cancer and is undergoing
treatment I would do anything for her
but my mental state makes it difficult
to be talkative interesting and selfless
she has struggled with her own
depression and I know this is the
hardest she's ever had it whenever I
spend time with her I just like on what
to say it's so hard to make jokes I
don't want to talk about myself I just
want to be able to make her feel happy
any good advice thing you guys are being
so awesome Francis first of all sorry
your friends go through yeah that's
terrible
very sorry I'm hard to watch a friend go
through something tough yeah and it's
even tougher when you feel like you
can't do anything yes can't be that far
though I mean I think one of the hardest
things is just knowing that you can't
truly do anything but practical advice
and not to get like there I'm sure
there's a ton of like emotional
unpacking that we could do but why um I
think my suggestion honestly would be
watch a funny show together watch like
ya re watching the office together maybe
like 30 rock or parks and rank or that
one I told you somebody feed Phil on
yeah it looks it's a Food Show with this
dopey old dad goes around and eats and
it's hilarious find something
that is nothing but uplifting and
light-hearted and fun and that you guys
could start watching and you could joke
about the TV show
cuz there's nothing really you could say
this is you and her talking and you want
to take that's your friend and you
wanted to get her mind off of it but
it's also that's your friend yeah you
can't help but think like so it's
not different yeah so maybe just try to
make it there's nothing we could do
about the facts but there is something
to do about how you feel a
moment-to-moment so and you also have to
take care of yourself right cuz like I'm
someone that one
to help people like what somebody's that
in need I I almost go overboard
yeah and I've learned that the best
thing to do is to just and if she's your
best friend just ask her be like look I
know you know don't try and dance around
how terrible this is and how terrible
you feel and how terrible she feels you
should be able to be terrible talking
about terrible things together and maybe
that's what she also does neither
someone that she can talk about the
terrible with yeah keeping it all
inside and I would I think if I forced
me to do that you call me one that you
know I'm having bad days and I'll be
like I'm fine and you're like yeah but
like how are you actually I'm like five
yeah you're like but actually and I'm
like and then it's like a 30 minute
conversation yeah and I think that an
important thing is that she is still a
person and still your best friend and
probably doesn't want that dynamic to
change because so many things are
happening right now so try to keep it
normal try to keep it if you just go in
and you're like cuz okay I stayed with
my grandfather when he was sick in the
hospital and at first he was like he was
being so he was so moody at
first and he was just like cursing this
guy who he was sharing the hospital room
with act ask to get switched because I
was like I need to be positive when I go
into my surgery yeah and I finally like
I had had enough with him and I was like
listen if you don't want to fight I'm
not gonna fight for you but if you're
willing to fight let's fight and you
know you I left that day and then I came
back and he was better so I think that
just not letting that cuz you're gonna
they're gonna you you want to just be
like you just want something to be
normal everything so not normal just
have something to be normal I I know if
I were in that situation I would prefer
a friend to come in and force fun on me
I swear to God I would want my friend my
best friend from home Rory she would
come in I know she would she would just
walk in and be like alright that's it
we're watching this I'm getting you some
balloons we read somebody we're gonna
goddamn watch this movie we're gonna
laugh at it anyone has could shut up
doing all of that while acknowledging
like well the reality of life you know
like not trying to gloss over skip over
it like let's just try and stay positive
up there like
not anything shitty was it but like how
you're saying I ain't saying you face it
together and take care of yourself
because you just gotta take a step back
and make sure you're also taking care of
yourself so that you can be there for
someone and it's too much take a little
break yeah I I agree with that I'm not
that type of I'm the type of person who
doesn't know it's too much until after
it's over hmm I need to go oh I would
barrel through and just be like yeah I'm
having a really hard time but not until
way later so just listen listen to
yourself and listen to your friend and
try hard try your best
she's already fighting this try your
best to to fight with her and you know
controlling what you can control which
is like the food and your perspective
and keeping the honesty and openness
there that's that's always been in your
friendship that was like us or something
and you were just like do you want
anything I do it I want you to
leave are you kidding cuz you don't want
to feel like I would literally go and
I'd be like yeah all we can do
is yeah and you know just let her know
well you could even have a conversation
I know I'm talking a lot about this now
but even just let her know and the
beginning just be like look here's where
I met I think we're gonna we should do
this we will watch these movies watch
this show I'm just as scared if you want
to talk talk if you want to cry cry yeah
I'm fighting for you you know what I
mean like let her know a lot no in time
let her react the way she needs to react
yeah this is my girl over the place
that's emotional a one day she
might be like super in the moon the
other day she might not be you might
lash out that's why it also the chemo
and stuff like that does stuff to your
emotion yeah and if you're already
dealing with emotional try not to
take anything personal and try to just
you know be there and hang out with her
as much as you can you have to and I
hope everything is okay yeah we're gonna
send them positive vibes everybody right
now everybody goes in your car or in
your room or in your kitchen or in space
everyone let's send a big positive vibe
push ya Francis's friend we answered a
live question right then and there from
our brand new email account adult
podcast at gmail good clue ah
do you know what day was yesterday
you're doing the math right Valentine's
Day yeah they're today or tomorrow
yesterday I bet you guys all thought
this would be a Valentine's Day episode
but boy do we have some surprises in
store for you but we should talk about
it yeah we could talk about it for you
what are your thoughts on Valentine's
Day me know the other person I do this
podcast with Warren she just waved to a
non-existing person in the corner named
Warren apparently uh you know I think
it's great I really do I think
Valentine's Day is great what a fun time
to you know celebrate being in love as
someone who has truly never had a
Valentine you've never had a Valentine
no what about no oh yeah even it was
little
what about kick it right when everyone's
everyone's Valentine I mean I was like
the hot piece in kinder not sexualize
yourself as a baby we're do I don't
never said it's your body weight let's
not weird how did what do you do last
Valentine's Day I don't even know what
it did this Valentine's Day I don't know
I think all of my friends are in
relationships so I think I just went
home or something it's a lot of pressure
to do something on Valentine's Day I
don't really like it I think it's a
holiday that just makes extra pressure
for someone that like me that doesn't
like to be surprised that is a planner
that likes to in I want to be
waiting I want someone to surprise me
and I'm not gonna get my hopes up but
you know what in my wildest fantasies
what I want someone to surprise me with
you know flowers and a gift and be like
I've loved you for years
 you I'm sorry I just think it's a
it's a holiday made for corporations
that sell stuff or to buy into the idea
of a fancy meal which yes that's what
I'm doing it's an opportunity to indulge
that's the way I look at it as how I
look at all of capitalism
and boy we subscribe i'm i my guy that
I'm dating but earlier she said I'm
doing like she couldn't even say dating
say it by uh uni uni he had plans and
then I guessed them so I was like let me
do this and he was like what and I was
like I'm gonna play in it don't worry
so I'm planned the rest of the
Valentine's I'm taking him to a very
nice dinner at a restaurant called Gwen
in Los Angeles we're both huge foodies
and it's a really cool it's curtis
stone's restaurant it's just it's all
meats it's it's what so that's what I
will be recovering from so things were
getting pretty things are pretty serious
between you and Leigh - ah okay we all
know he's a DJ okay he just came out
with this song your body's rejecting it
out of DJ's so did mine for a while so
he just came out with this song right
and it's perfect for like he's really
really stood last week but it's like
doing it on Valentine's Day it's called
a hangover love and I so where to
Kate I think 99.9% sure this song is
about conversations we've had I'm like
if you listen to it okay wait now I
kinda have to play some of it okay you
think he wrote a song about you guys
gonna release it on Valentine's Day yeah
like nah I don't like Valentine's
goddamn days artists here except slap
okay you can't slap what does cap slap
even mean slap a cap that's his DJ man
now everybody knows let's cap what's
what does it mean good you had like I
think a cuz he was in a fraternity I
think I don't
oh my god this is God exponentially
worse as potentially exponentially the
rats are trash that's where you started
playing my cat but I can't ain't no I
don't know cuz I don't care cannot be
true but okay this is the song that's
good okay listen to the word Lister's
we drink up Oh God
I
tasting
hey this isn't are you no way I'm talked
about it
you haven't talked to gosh-dang bad
enough no but it like it sounds exactly
like if we had an extra phone I would
say let's call him sure no idea is this
bad so like just this song it's like all
about like drinking what if I call them
and then I FaceTime and I'm just like
hey buddy you gotta let me know right

me about what that we're doing this to
him oh that's laughs we have a question
listen yeah cages listen to your sock I
liked it I liked it it's funny it's
bumpy it's good here's my question isn't
it about anyone in particular no no I
don't think I just think it's unique
you're giving me right now I
want to know that's about a specific
person or if you were just writing for
the masses I think it's a it's for the
masses anyone can can can understand
people we've all been in those
situations where you've been so
hung over but you're like
was it the alcohol or I do like I feel
something or am I gonna puke
I'm gonna abandon I'll let you guys make
your hair look nice oh thank you very
much
guess what else we're doing we're gonna
go get tattoos oh that brings us to our
next segment
all right cats left we got gum buddy
anyways whatever it's a good song I like
it I want to bone to it um guys the
episode today is about fear I don't know
why I wrote down spiders question why
slash untucked potential yeah that's
what I fear this was Kate's idea so go
ahead and tell us what that what's up
okay so as you guys know I have been
going to oh it won't stop it just won't
stop there it is oh my god did you hear
that it's not coming from oh hey sorry
guys um my biggest fear is truly
everything I could overanalyze anything
would be scared of it talk myself out of
editing oh if we go to therapy and a lot
of stuff that I'm always scared to pick
I remember telling you guys I don't have
a favorite color I don't have a favorite
this I don't have I don't have a lot of
favorite things so I'm trying to
experiment more with what my favorite
things are huh Adams right I have a big
fear of commitment and a huge fear of
decision making oh my god ladies and
gentlemen let me tell you how
many times I've asked Kate there that's
died on something and the
just can't I feel like you need an app
on your phone that just flips a coin
cuz you truly what is it about decisions
I didn't say that this is a sore subject
please Jack I have in my head like that
there is this we have like a weird
perception and judgment of something is
right and something is wrong and I'm
waiting for someone to tell me what's
right here I act quickly - sometimes
I'll be like don't do that Kate thing
where you like immediately react because
sometimes we'll say things and you'll be
like well no and I'm like we'll just
wait a second I hurt my back so bad when
he said that what don't do that Kate
thing the first time you said it well
you have a Kate thing I have Kelsey
things also one thing that I've been
trying is exposure therapy so anything
you're scared of you just go ahead and
face yeah and one thing I really want to
do and I've always wanted to do is just
get a tattoo you have enough tattoos I
have no tattoos brush clean slaver I
only have my ears pierced
what a badass
thank you um what exposure-therapy have
you done thus far uh lets you ask that
guy out you were scared yeah I was
scared I asked that guy out who rejected
me
I've looked still living I wore a boob
shirt he'll yeah you did he looks
how did do something with balance
trying to like sit in uncomfortable
feelings and stuff like that so this is
a way a fun exposure therapy to I'm
gonna make decisions and I and it's
commitment forever you have it forever
unless you get laser but don't do that
but the the a big thing with me is like
I've always been very like obviously
insecure of my body and it's always been
like that my body holds so much weight
in my hand like how I feel you know so I
wanted to do something where I didn't
cuz the idea of getting a tattoo I was
like oh I have to get something that's
perfect that you know something that
everyone will agree is awesome and then
I was like or is my body it's my body
French and I could just get a fun little
outline of a flower that was on my hip
or my she also has not thought this
through like she doesn't have a design
she doesn't have any she knows that she
maybe once for sure maybe possibly a
flower yeah or some sort of foliage as
someone that has eight tattoos that all
are quite dumb in their own way I have
found that people don't want an
explanation for your tattoo but they're
constantly given so like when people say
like yeah that's not some tattoo I I
used to feel like I needed to be like
yeah so this one's actually it's an M
for my mom my dad my sister and the
woman who raised me they all their
letters all start with letter M and like
you know it's a story attached to it but
what I love and what I've learned after
having them for so long is that the
stories are for me yes like they all
have some sort of insane story attached
to why I got it and how I got it as
opposed to like now that saw my body I
need to represent something about I kind
of like that it doesn't really represent
the tattoo itself like the piece itself
doesn't really represent anything but
the act of getting it represented
something so I'm cool with it just being
something that I find pretty right now
and maybe when I'm older I won't but
I'll remember this time in my life being
like oh I was putting in work do you
want to go in on your lip no guys
see the Sun boldly or on if you're only
listening I have a tattoo on my lip that
used to say let it be because now it
says now it just kind of smeared font
this one smeared I got a lot of smeared
tacks and I love them all yeah so I'm
excited I don't know where do you think
if you get it on my under bootleg I'm
gonna probably do something here here
and or I was gonna do but you don't have
to ever wear a bra so you know I was
also gonna do my hip I heard that though
if you want my hips let me see this one
got kind of smeared uh-huh cuz it's old
that one's my old this one and then that
one too yeah I like them on the hips to
the hips are a good place so what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna pause this
we're gonna call the couple couple
tattoo shops up buzz Vienna's worked
with in the past on some tattoo shows
and tattoo videos and we're gonna see if
we can walk in because we know normal
people would plan and make an
appointment but not this baby not adult
 we're making mistakes so that you
don't have to we're gonna find a place
and then next time you guys hear from us
Kate will be laying on a tattoo table
giving her first tattoo this may be
terribly awesome idea I came up with it
I thought just Adam oh that was a blue
it's like Johnny cakes I don't know
to be super quick for pizzas
where are we welcome don't tell me what
we're doing here
what are your buddies down in your lines
he's gonna do something custom he does
it right here on his iPad does that make
you nervous at all to put get the
control and a complete smells Hellboy
you're gonna look literally I never had
more calm I swear to God really I swear
to God I can't wait for it
hey darling
first thing that we called
phone-a-friend where we call our very
dear friends but remember anthem and we
get her opinion on things let me ask you
what you think about that do you think
this is a dumb idea our friend Fred good
because I'm going next okay so Kate is
getting her tattoo done right now she's
almost done we can't record in there cuz
it's really loud and they're playing
like loud ass rock music and there's
like a ton of people I'm but she's
doing so good
she didn't even flinch when they
put the needle on her I screamed the
first time I got at that dude so yeah
she's almost done and I'm really nervous
and excited but it looks amazing I mean
the placing is so pretty you guys will
say it but it she's doing it
it's so excited okay Kate's done I've
done bitches how did it feel it
definitely hurt but it didn't hurt the
way I thought it was going to her I
thought was gonna be like ah but it was
just like a little scratch yeah cat
scratch do yeah it's so good you didn't
make a sad wouldn't talk to kill
what's up do you like it I love
it and what I like say hey or at least
so you I know I don't think about having
something on your body for that I feel
like I love it I look I'm so
glad we did this
I'm so glad that I was just really
nervous at all like were you afraid you
were gonna get up and be like what the
 no I trusted him I like the way he
drew so I'm fine with it yeah yeah and
I'm really really high love it do it

before like I went to a tattoo place
before and I was like I want a bird in a
cage what coming out of the cage or
maybe someone jumping off a diving board
and it was like and there was like I'm
Joe drunk I'm going home and then I left
and then I that was like three years ago

everyone there was like covered in
tattoos and no it I don't know it's just
it's something that like most things in
my life I read too much into so I'm sort
of like so for most of the things that I
like pick or whatever Michael but it has
to be perfect and I have to never ever
regret it but I love this I'm so
happy I did it I'm like really proud I
did give it too much thought into it
either like I was like oh my god she's
just going really Neely but it's so you
yeah it's perfect it's I think that's
the thing is that the longer I take to
do things the more
