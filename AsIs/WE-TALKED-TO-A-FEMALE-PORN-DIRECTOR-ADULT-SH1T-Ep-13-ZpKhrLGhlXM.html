show called corporate on Comedy Central
I that's what I'm watching oh okay it
just sounded so official and I didn't
believe you I'm starting corporate into
summer
no I'm watching the show called
corporate it's really funny I just
finished I just rewatched the office for
like the thousandth time reading I
ordered Their Eyes Were Watching God I
haven't read that yet
I didn't read like anything in high
school I just lied to get out of all of
the assignments or just like look did
like sparknotes or something like that
so so I just ordered I just got their
eyes are watching cut so I'm gonna read
that yeah and I feel like we we excuse
that in high school cos I was high
the entire time I was in high school so
don't remember anything but I remember
reading hatchet like three times oh do
you didn't read that good no I
didn't read anything you know what
they're not teaching us about in high
school that matters
IBEX in taxes honestly even
basic ass cooking yeah
class called like repercussions like a
hypothetical life and then you choose
this and then it shows what will
actually happen to you if you knew his
path oh you don't want to pay your car
insurance for a couple months
here's what happens we should start
teaching know each other no one with
Joss efficient speaking of not knowing
about sex in high school I want to bring
in our next guest she is a maybe like
one of the only feminist porn directors
ladies and gentlemen I want to introduce
I got this week air to last this is
Erica get in here oh no hi Erica so
she's in Barcelona I'm good how are you
Vegas so you okay
you're what you do is crazy to
Americans but I think in Europe what you
do is pretty dope can you
explain a little bit about who you are
what you do what's your vibe well I
started to make films around the 14
years ago 2004 and made my first short
film it was called the good girl and it
was a short film showing wasted good
good girl why did you choose that time I
felt like I was a good girl okay and I
kind of turned and so it had to do with
other and a good girl mantasy and what I
really wanted
okay and this was a film showing
explicit sex but from my previous
success it's that you see everything you
see that the sex is really happened you
show penetrative sex exactly and oral
sex and whatever I know the sex
you wanna show and what happened was
that I had of course watched porn before
as so many people who's growing up
wanting to learn about sex and going to
poor to find out how it is actually done
but I had always felt a little
disappointed when it was due because it
felt like poor it was so much about the
man men about daily use somehow to
satisfy them but he's always say that
that's obviously not a believe women
matter can you believe it pleasure
matters yes
not sure matter and that was your first
no that was my first film and I was my
first thought and then it kind of there
I sent the film to a few festivals who
started to win prizes and I put it up
online and a few weeks after that
suddenly I had to millions of downloads
and I couldn't believe it and I went
like what what happened here this was
just kind of an experimental film right
and people wanted more and they wrote to
me and they were like Erika please make
more we want to see more of this kind of
in the adult style film so what was
different like how did you watch porn
and what did you do differently as a
filmmaker that would like make people
and watch especially do you have like a
larger female audience or what did you
do differently well I guess I kind of
done everything different from the
beginning dude and it's like there
sometimes I say it's like going to
McDonald's or a fast-food restaurant or
going to a small little family
restaurant it's like everything is
different from the kind of ingredients
that you put in the food or their style
that that you want to show
in your films you know when I make a
film I care about all the details I care
about the cast obviously who I'm
choosing right I try to choose people
that shows society as diverse a disease
naturally but yeah I'm very fed up with
the mainstream porn and the way they're
only show very young slim girls and it's
like they all look like teenagers like
they turned 18 and I want to see real
people you want to see real people I
feel like that makes you more involved
in the experience like when you thought
the same way that it's like if you see
yourself involved in film and television
and movies you can identify with it
harder the same way that like if you see
yourself in porn maybe it's easier to
get off representation it's a matter you
see us not really and then it's also
about how you produce the films some of
the values you have behind and I have a
crew of women basically most of the
people working in my company here in
Barcelona and that are working on my
film crew they are women you know the
director of photography the science and
designer the art director the assistant
director you know the whole crew and
women that's power yeah as I said I see
that the actresses they feel so much
more you know what comfortable in a
place where you know that their words
matter they can you know feel
comfortable exactly the question about
the about to act like the actors that
you get actors and actresses that you
get for this how are they like are they
people who are already into like like I
know that some people are like would you
do would you do like a nude scene or
something like that like I don't know if
there's cuz you're certain sounds kind
of like you're creating almost a new
genre absolutely I used to call it in
the adult because that's really what I'm
trying to do you know I'm trying
something different from like the basic
idea we have a porn and I think
many people have all this this kind of
dirty nasty connotation right and it's
like oh this girl gets or this
guy like dis you're learning it's not a
big dude already a lot of what I call
punished women in mainstream
yeah you know it's not even about having
a good time together or having pleasure
together they just kind of smash up the
bitch against the wall and kind of but
that shouldn't be 90% of what you're
finally it's so much more yes yes it's
really feeling it's wonderful and great
thing with people they're halfway I
wouldn't watch your films yeah I feel
like we should talk about this because
while we have Erica here it would be
weird if we didn't bring it up that Kate
has never had an orgasm okay it happens
for so many wait a minute and I get so
many emails from especially young women
yeah saying that they think that
something is wrong with them and their
bodies because they can't feel it
and then what when you start talking to
them really most of them have seen so
much mainstream important and what
happens in mainstream porn well you know
women normally or these actresses they
come from penetration because most women
needs to use their hands to feel
themselves and they need time for
themselves and many many women use toys
obviously to get to you know to learn
how your own body work and I mean that's
totally an implementation with no I mean
I don't wanna speak for you but for its
it's a lot of shame to like feeling good
it's shameful to women in America
but like I can only speak to our
experiences is that it feels shameful
and it feels wrong just want to feel
good and to get to that point of like
coming or orgasming it feels wrong and
so I think a lot of people go so far in
their life feeling like they're doing as
much as they can but then to actually do
it but I also think that a lot of people
kind of wait for someone to make it
happen for them no I mean I'm not it's
just it's more psychological than
anything else it's more the idea of
pleasure and shame but not just pleasure
like it's not specifically like sexual
it's just any sort of pleasure and this
feeling of like worthlessness and shame
and I mean it's more than just it's it's
more than just stuff about like it's
more than just coming it's more than
just that it's it's everything I don't
have a favorite color I don't have like
I don't know it it's not I like I know I
don't I don't have favorite things I
don't know what I like that's something
that I that's why when everyone's like
oh it's about this you just haven't seen
them write this or done they're right
that that's not necessarily my situation
because I always be like Kate watch for
and watch this board and watch like
amateur porn watch porn that's like made
for women by women and it's like it's
more psychological than that I think if
you just have this trait if you already
have this trait right which is like oh
I'm not going to indulge in anything
that I actually like then the problem is
the the feeling of wanting to indulge in
things and following what feels good
right and that's not really that's one
problem that is not mutually exclusive
to just one area of your life that
bleeds into everything so I think a lot
of times and I end up getting like super
defensive about it because when people
are like oh maybe you should try it like
this or try it like that and it's like
yeah and as I know that it's hard for
people to understand I feel like a lot
of times it's it people are sort of like
they want to help and I know that that
that you know overall what people
they're like oh but you're you're living
without this great thing it's like I
know
I am going to therapy and like trying to
work all that sort of stuff out but I
think that it speaks to a much larger
group of yeah of women who don't follow
their good feelings which is interesting
which is why I'm so interested to talk
to you about the type of movies that you
make because it's like you saw one area
where yeah it wasn't a representation of
women going after what they want and
there's a lot of shame specifically even
important I remember like my friends
didn't even say that they watched porn
until like we were really drunk like in
college or something that is where I
always like let's go down to be 12 years
old and go out to porn so like I think
that I'm sort of a personification of a
culture like I'm still yeah I'm the
result of this type of shame and stigma
and whatnot and I think a lot of women
are so I think it's really interesting
to talk to someone who anyway but it is
very interesting and it starts at a very
early age for so many women but because
we are seeing since we are really young
young girls you know it starts when we
start touching ourselves and our parents
our mothers especially start telling us
don't do that yep told me my vagina was
gonna fall off I was like I was watching
Titanic and I just started masturbating
I don't even know what it was and she
came in my room and was like don't do
that I do it yeah like when I became a
teenager she was like do whatever you
gotta do to release these
hormones because you're a very angry
teenager but as a kid it was it was like
shamed upon and I think it starts there
for a lot of women because for guys it's
not that way you know that you're
watching themself and it's like oh it's
cute this is little dick yet you know
what it's like they are not telling them
not to do it and that should be it would
be so much better if parents just could
say you know maybe you should have do
that in the living room hope your old
young man
in your bed or you know yes nice and
helping kids saying it's nice to touch
yourself it feels good you know and
nobody keeps coming you know then
suddenly you you start developing a body
and breast and everything and they start
looking at you and laughing at you and
commenting and then if you're a girl who
wants to have sex and we're starting to
have sex than your son then you're a
whore and you are horrible and all these
things they do get into our head and and
I do think that that they distract us
from getting to know our own pleasure
and what yeah what a knight's right
right yes like what we see on porn is
supposed to be what makes you calm and
it's not always yeah like we even joked
about it but like reading fanfiction or
whatever it like yeah some the settings
right like fetishizing or whatever is is
it's a thing because it's a thing we
shouldn't yes feel wrong we shouldn't
feel punished and we shouldn't feel bad
because you like something that isn't
normal or because you like something
that's not seen in mainstream porn and I
feel like we see a very specific agenda
hmm not to sound like a feminazi
but like it's very Mel driven it's very
point of view it's very like I mean TV
comes is that though it's even that like
saying like feminazi like I know that
that was just like some people could be
radical in any way that they think but
to compare somebody who's just like try
what I like so Nazi that's it
yeah like I just wanna come in
here and I compare me to a Nazi and I
feel like that that idea of like I think
women I don't know how it is in
Barcelona like I don't know if it's a
little bit different I know my own
experience was also like women are
supposed to like certain things so
you're supposed to put up with a lot of
 because that's when nice girls
do you're supposed to not think about
sex because that's not what nice girls
do you're supposed to only like like eat
like a bird you're not supposed to enjoy
food because god forbid you gain weight
and those to me I think probably the two
best things in the world are probably
food and sex it'll make the
world go round
so ofcourse those are the two things we
need as a human race to survive yeah
it's sex so we can become more yes yeah
eating and I think that that is so for
me I just I personally processed all of
those limitations very personally yeah
so it's just like I am not supposed to
have sex and I'm not supposed to eat
what I want to eat and that then there
came an eating disorder and then there
came this sexual problem but it's so
interesting to now talk to people who
are like yeah it doesn't have to be this
way hey doing the podcast too like we've
gotten so many messages realizing that
that's not an insane thing to have gone
like yes not that crazy
- of course you're talking about I think
that 30% of women or idiots
it's do CH numbers you know what you
think you've common enemy yes there's a
lot of pressure there also there's a lot
like orgasm pressure and I see it you
know and when when I shoot my films
because people are always asking me but
do they really calm you know do they
women do they come in your films and I
always say it's like in real life
sometimes they do sometimes they don't
sometimes you think they did yeah it's
not easy see you you look at them and
you say I don't know I don't know if you
can you tell it's something you can tell
you starting to get better at it because
I've seen it so many times so I can see
it in like the small things you know the
redness yeah and the eyes and you know
that the respiration and how they
breathe and you know this kind of thing
but in the end I mean how I am put it
with a woman you can never ever really
really know it's not like with a guy
there's you know it's it's it's obvious
yeah
you see already taught so many few times
there's an ejaculation right where you
feel about female ejaculation well I do
definitely believe in it good I think
it's I've seen it I've been around but I
haven't really experienced it myself
so tell us a little bit more about what
you're doing to change the norm because
I feel like it's so much sure that you
have done is already super revolutionary
and all the words you're doing and like
what else you what else do you want to
do what else do I want to do well I've
started a little more than a year ago
with a new project because I have been
working for the last four years on a
project called X confessions and now
that it's a super great website actually
where people from all around the world
are sending in their fantasies and
there's adventures under it you know six
stories and I picked two every month and
I make short sense out of them what yes
and I read short film a hundred yes and
I can't do it by self any longer so a
year ago I invited other female
filmmakers to join me in this project
and start making films with yeah with
different perspective and everything to
cater writer course because what are we
gonna do I'm gonna sit around and wait
for men to change genders know we do
there any industry you know how it is
it's run by men men are the producers
the directors dearly women business
owners they are doing I was raising
money and women I think that we can't
lead born behind because I think it's
way too important because it's really a
discourse that talks about sexuality and
about sexual behavior and how we
interact and I want that to show you
know a more human sexuality than it's
doing today because it's these matters
group of memory we are very alike even
if they are from Los Angeles or
Barcelona or Budapest you know it's the
same kind of man and he's doing the same
kind of film and because it's his way of
looking at your sexuality and what's
sexy and my concept is completely
different and I think that women needs
to get involved and they need to you
know to start telling the way we are
living our sexuality in our female
bodies and what we like and what we
don't like
girl dude I love her I wish you could be
here okay because like this office it's
all women
it's totally it feels so like just
feminine as but also like really
sexy and it's all run by women for it
just it makes me feel really good know
what you're here but should we answer to
Barcelona should we do our question
let's do it guys we're good yeah we're
doing something a little different
normally we we read a fan question but
we're gonna read a live question said by
someone who is in this room we don't
have to say his name then I feel like
the three perspectives that we have here
are so ridiculously vital and important
that I think we could probably solve his
or her problem hey person that is not
gonna be in the video okay so our
anonymous live question me what is the
work what was the question that I'm
asking about your porn it's okay
that's a strong work so I've been single
for about two maybe three years now okay
um dating apps whatever I do okay I have
a job that I'm fortunate enough I get to
travel a lot I'm in situations where
there are a lot of girls all the time
so you know meeting people isn't any
girls it's not an issue the past six
months
surprise girl for the first time I
struggle to get it up be with a new girl
if I'm with a girl that I've slept with
before or dumped it before no serious
dilemma me so I'm trying a new thing now
where I'm going to stop watching porn to
the I think it's a sensitization thing
porn addiction like yeah sure I watch
porn once every day once every two days
something like that I like it after the
gym after I boxed calm down a little bit
whatever so you're you're not able to
satisfy yourself or other chicks because
you think you're desensitize kiss that's
right because imagine corn you know
since I was obviously 13 or 14 like a
dude in the US
hello I don't know who should take this
first because like I feel like we're all
gonna have different answers I think
Erica you should go so it's not it's and
I know it's not a physical thing as I
still wake up in the morning with
morning wood and I yeah like I said I
really came with someone the other night
with someone that you had a connection
with with you know other girls that I've
been seeing for a longer period of time
that's a thing that happens it's so like
one-night stands you're not able to get
it off because it it's very different in
the beginning then it gets better
yes yes yes yes you kind of needed to
get like more intense where we cover all
that I've been seeing for a little bit
it's a medium right no hurt but I still
think it's a desensitization thing so
you're giving up porn for the next I'm
gonna give it up for a month and see
what happen yeah and see what happens
two dollars Erica what do you think well
I think it probably has to do with
security no because I feel already have
sex with that person you know that it
didn't
and then you feel secure enough and what
happens with porn sometimes if you watch
it a lot we can kind of dehumanize
people women treated like some kind of
sex dolls but many many times are
treated like they're like this muscular
penetrate their machines like the
curious part of it is this is a new
thing this is only in the past mind of
sounds like it's becoming like one
dimensional for you like it's it's no
longer kind of like it's like empty
calories right now porn is so like you
watch it and you're like okay this it
stimulates me it's cool or whatever but
then when it comes to like actually
being with someone I feel like you've
only had like the one-dimensional thing
like oh it's purely physical or it's
pretty it's almost like a fantasy now
look if you watch if the porn gets like
more and more intricate and kind of a
little bit abnormal then how would you
how is real life going to compare that
that's that's detox I mean it kind of
sounds like wanting yeah wanting a
little bit more like maybe you you've
seen all of you that you can see from
porn you seen that and you're like okay
now what there's something more to this
than just being physically aroused
there's something emotional maybe or
there's something like but you like you
said like with security it could just be
you might be in entering a new part of
your life do you think that not watching
porn though is gonna change anything um
I don't know I'm no expert but I think
that it could also be like it might be
that you want maybe with the people that
you're like hooking up with maybe
introduced porn with like both of you or
like
but then also I hear this from a lot of
men but I start talking to them about
porn and it's a shitty porn that but
there's so much of online and then I
tell them to look at it and focus on
this and suddenly they say to me
Erica now you kind of destroyed
important for me she's not happy this is
not yet great any anymore you know so
it's about awareness or no somehow and
you are becoming aware of something then
you are changing your taste it takes a
change imagine if you were to change one
little thing that could totally redirect
what you feel sexually imagine that
right like I feel like we we go to our
cell phones or computers or whatever we
go to our category and we scroll through
a category that we know we like and we
go okay here's a different excuse me a
different person that is doing the thing
that I like and we can it's become sort
of like not sure yeah yeah it's almost
like how you if you are to make
something at home like food at home it
might be really good from the restaurant
or whatever you make it at home it might
not be the best right off the bat but
then you learn how to season it I don't
know if that works but your practice we
have a we have an audience question okay
you guys are like on a macro level
can you hear Kate yeah like I was
watching this video recently about
people that are like sexually attracted
to objects or I'm to porn that is not
realistic
do you think that watching different and
more healthy porn as the answer or like
what is the answer to like a sexual
thing that you craving or head that
might not be so realistic or appropriate
for that matter what's the best way to
like think about it in circumventing so
that you can better suit yourself in
your project well I think that if it's a
fetish that doesn't hurt other people
it's okay but that's always the limit
right they don't want to hurt other
pinyon so when it comes to porn it's
also important to think about the
ethical aspects of it it's like how has
it been produced who's behind it who's
gonna making the porn that you are what
do you know when women aren't enjoying
it you know and we've talked
about this day we've talked about it
we're like it doesn't feel like anyone's
having fun it's interesting that both
sides like it feels like both sides want
what the other side has been taught is
normal so like I feel like it kind of
sounds like from what we got just today
men are trying to understand how to make
it more like more of a connection how to
have it be a little bit more than just
sex and women are trying to figure out
how they could do yeah well because we
already were able to learn how to have a
connection with people or that we're
supposed to or whatever and guys are
always like no you're just gonna
bitches and keep going it's like or you
might want love to maybe maybe it's a
crazy notion that our connection doesn't
have to be love you have to feel
something just there there shouldn't be
an end goal of coming the same way that
like sex isn't just about coming like
sex can feel so good and you still gonna
have to orgasm
it's about feeling something and feeling
is the root of all how any one
experience is anything but there's too
much pressure no pun intended on coming
for sex and pour yeah
times it gets very technical because
it's like okay so how do I do this how
do I make this happen and then it's not
about just that yeah you know that the
good I was thinking about another thing
and that is that when you start to
obsess about something because it didn't
happen once and then you start to obsess
about it and then you start blocking
yourself and it keeps happening
happening this has become a thing now
and like my group chat with my friends
where we call it it's called having the
seed of doubt and now now I've now you
have the seed of doubt and you have to
figure out how to make the seed of doubt
go away because now it's like a
self-fulfilling prophecy I know it's
just it happened one so it's just gonna
keep happening over and over and over
actually it is very true because I mean
sex really where does it start
I mean it starts in there and yeah brain
it's your fantasy justice system that
connects you to your body and there's
Sunday the body starts reacting right
but you need that turn on things that
provokes you that you know wanting more
foreplay is underrated is gonna be the
hash tag of this mental foreplay
if a guy or a chick were to whisper some
 in my ear that would feel so much
 better than or look even a
 lock yeah what starts in
situation can start hours before the
actual encounter you know today we have
also be have all of this this iPhone
since March so again you can start a
message to someone you can send a
picture soon when you can't
before than getting into that doorman
yeah one of the things that I work a lot
yes
cinematic films that are beautiful in
InDesign and inviting and then you know
the locations and the way we are
dressing and and doing the makeup of our
characters but also the narrative who
are these people why are they coming
together where does the passion comes
from what is their thing I kind of want
to know you know that context to the
sexual situation that swear you're
missing to be honest
the same way when you're watching like a
movie and then you accidentally have to
jerk off where you're like wait I wasn't
expecting that like it imagine Alex
Warren right like if you were you know
what's gonna happen what porn he's Santa
comes probably on her face and
everyone's done if you I think everyone
just once overall it seems like everyone
just got pieces of a whole experience
like this piece is enjoyed by men this
piece is enjoyed by people like this
this piece is enjoyed by people like
this and I think what we're sort of
coming around to is that everybody in a
way craves their own full well-rounded
whole experience when it comes to just
meeting to meet are very smart and I say
that all the time when it comes
to like meeting the people and like
getting that excitement and being like
oh my god do I want this person in bed
like do what do what do I want to be
with this person I like their smell I
like the idea of it - seeing how it
actually comes to fruition if it does
like there's so many its emotions can
play such a great part in it it's part
of a fictional generation emotions yeah
yeah so important no the only point is
penetration and coming whereas there are
so many other beautiful ways to feel
great things that have these amazing
moments and relationships comes I come
looking at flowers
I get turned on by like see like I what
makes me feel good it shouldn't always
be sex yeah it's in there okay Erica
