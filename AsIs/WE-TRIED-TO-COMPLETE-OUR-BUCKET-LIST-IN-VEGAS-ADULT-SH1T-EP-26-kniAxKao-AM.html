a month here in Vegas just being
crazy was the what I'm gonna spend the
rest of my life with and just going like
balls to the wall whatever you want to
do crazy stuff our taxi driver on the
way over here did say that he's never

for two years he originally is from
France and then he was here for two
years three years yeah where were you

days I'm ready to go home the veil kind
of disappears it's a little I don't
agree rare skies
how many times have you been to Vegas
you remember les that was my first time
in Vegas that's why we walked to the
window
listen did we immediately get Miller
Lite sand or milk Miller highlights and
drink them along way over here you can
do that but we should start this episode
off with a shot to our friend coat maybe
the next 24 hours be the best and worst
of our lives oh yeah okay now that we've
done that let's just say why we are here
yes this is still a work trip and we are
doing our Vegas
kaitlin's title wait you guys get cable
loves the title it's our Vegas 24-hour
bucket bucket list
challenge for 24 hours we've created a
bucket list of things we want to try and
do my chest is actually burning it's
weird so we have a list of things that
we're gonna try and accomplish in 24
hours I'm gonna get a fight today we're
here a little bit in 24 hours but we're
not counting flight time and like
that how do you feel you we've never
really had like the only male guests
we've had on with palm fronds yeah I
mean I I have a lot to live up to
yeah is it weird being here with two
chicks that are crazier than you if I
hadn't done this before absolutely
because literally a year ago today we
were talking about we pretty much did
the same thing yes did another podcast
yeah yeah we were just filming okay we
were filming and that it didn't work out
and then if you want to see what we
ended up filming look we still it's
still not out well no what we ended up
what we were going to film here on this
trip but then we ended up having to film
on site
BuzzFeed was oh great what happened to
Grandma yeah that was an adult up
is the series finale it seriously and
honestly it was definitely one of my
faves it was so fun to do
what's even more fun to do though is
that we're gonna include like a fun
little montage but here's how this
episode's gonna go we're recording a
pasty episode today while we're getting
nice and drunk and then we're gonna
record half of it tomorrow after we've
had 24 hours to try and our bucket list
to see how far we've gone and you'll get
little bits and pieces of us doing
different things if you want to see that
you have to make sure you're subscribed
to youtube.com slash as is that way you
can watch it because if you're just
listening it's just gonna be music and
ads oh here are audio one day yeah but
it might not make sense unless we do
timestamp everything which I'm leaving
that up to you to remember I just will
have to figure that out that's why every
so yeah I'm already let's go down our
bucket list first and then we've got
some accolade so if we're gonna make
predictions of the night
okay so bucket list ride the New York
New York rollercoaster boom go do Ivy
Lynn sorry I don't mean to interrupt but
here we are too late
does the roller-coaster go upside down
it does it does I will not be doing good
okay
I have vertigo I can't my vertigo yeah
you don't have vertigo literally had
inner ear surgery I have vertigo I mean
do you see me waking in a camera I'm not
doing it I will throw up well what if we
drink a lot before I will uh I'll throw
up twice why did you let us put it on
the list I didn't realize I thought it
was one of those okay so hold the
list okay sometimes you have to take the
risk no reward
no I just think you shot all right
here's a really good lesson kids I don't
know one to say no and no matter how
much beer and why are you saying really
 kill the vibe here
get list means get as drunk as possible
in the coziest place possible which is
this attack that's ranked in LA that's
really looked over to me very seriously
this was not a joke is that I just want
to stay in the hotel
alright number two Jew IV therapy which
is for our hangovers tomorrow let's
explain what IV therapy is cuz some
people don't know what IV therapy is a
service that you either go to it's like
a wellness clinic or they come to your
house and they literally give you an IV
of different fluids and nutrients to get
rid of your hangover in 20 minutes I
would like hydration I would like more
than anything for us to order room
service and IV therapy and to all stay
in bed in her underwear it isn't like
will just get postmates so just weekend
will have a Netflix night here that was
my row god let's do what we do in LA
every weekend I don't get it there's the
or room service in LA I didn't grub and
you forget and they deliver your pizza
and you don't answer your phone I
haven't done that in a while
like two weeks okay so yeah we want to
put $100 on black for roulette a hundred
dollars how much money did each of us
take out should we say yeah okay
I took out a modest three hundred
dollars okay
that's modest I got a bit of an
addictive ginam that runs in my family I
mean I took up to 50 I think I would
have felt bad if Kelsey wasn't you know
I didn't take out a higher amount so I
feel pretty good about that I still feel
a little bit like a piece of but
yeah okay the $3 towards that should be
in the ATM which is amazing for Vegas is
that last year so tonight when we landed
Kelsey's plane was late yeah super
delicious yeah oops delayed so we came
all the way to the hotel the second we
got off the plane we charted gambling at
slot machines and stuff
I want 20 dollars and I was like this is
my first time in Vegas this is Vegas
baby which is very dangerous for anyone
who's never been to Vegas if you the
first time you gamma base that's a very
important kind of moe
that's gonna determine whether or not
this airport yeah but then but then yeah
but then I lost every time soon but then
I was up I was so mad but I was up like
a hundred and forty five dollars at one
point you were killing I was killing it
and so stove looks over and he goes I
think we should walk away yeah and I
went you should walk away and I was like
I was both hungover and a drunk because
they bring you free beer then and I was
like you know there but look that's the
thing if you sit at the poker tables
there's also you drink for free yeah
yeah it was $5.00 hands and I walked
away with two chips there was a point
where still when I looked at each other
we were kind of walking around in the
background what coat was still playing
and we were like should we actually
thank you guys we're just saying it's
fabulous so I only took 40 out because
I'll just do 21 7 2012 so if we do win
our hundred on black are we gonna go in
again I think we split it and then I go
play black we have to turn this no we
can't yeah we decide in the moment cuz
you're always gonna play it to tomorrow
we did decide I think whatever we put in
we just make back if we put 100 on black
you're 100 what do we yeah do we go in
again do we do like 50 then cuz then
we're still at 50 bucks see this yeah
yeah yeah yeah well we spend it on
something stupid oh oh like we use that
maybe we should go do that first and
like let that pay for our like
adventures I mean or just losing it a
super bummer time alright what is that
can you read the next one Kate makes out
with someone that is your suggestion
doing quite honest the guy driving the
cab over here what he was cute
France guy you should have gotten his
number it was from France but he
so many people he said he's like I've
been through everything I did ask if
he's ever blown cocaina someone's butt
hole and he said no I said well then you
haven't praying like it was
packed seeing around
act like a Vegas veteran you've
been here two years it's okay are you
tonight what's the criteria can we tell
them we're like filming a podcast and
you need to make out someone it's a
bucket list okay very easily do that I
mean like on the screen Vegas baby
anything can go you can make you could
pretend to be a completely different
person it could be like I'm sexual okay
we did say last week if Kate does have a
potential hookup we would leave the room
she cool that's so funny because if I
was just a regular regular smuggler put
the cardi B says it a sexually
active person uh-huh you guys would
never leave your hotel room for me to
hook I absolutely would you ever been on
a cruise ship when like your friend
really oh no five hours Oh a friends do
that for friends I would help you do
that for me but I have a boyfriend next
we are gonna ride the gondolas at the
Venetian we have we just have to it's
not gonna be fun we use super over this
what I'm actually excited about stove
you tell us about this one
we got the link ferris wheel so this is
based on the the iconic London I've
never done it I hear you get drinks yeah
you basically go in a giant Ferris wheel
that looks like the one that I go around
months yes pretty simple like that one
where when we were walking in the one
that looks like the London Eye yeah but
it's like one of the newer it's one of
the newer stops how about this one
hmmm get into a club and sit at
someone's table and drink for free we
here's know I think it's Monday it's my
we could do this pretty well also pretty
easily
maybe I don't know I'm talking like I've
been here before but also I just bought
a new body super bizarre and it really
shows we're gonna use that to our
advantage tonight because we're in Vegas
and that's what you can do things you
know it's crazy
mm-hmm this is gonna be embarrassing
well our flight and they had a lot of
turbulence like a lot the end again
got it was really bad and I watch out
for the sound but I put my head in like
this and honestly my own boobs gave my
own self a lot of comfort good that's
half what they're there for
I don't have them I don't know well I
mean they're mainly there to feed
children just any random kid talking
about why men have nipples yeah why do
men so Oh turns out it's really just
because we start with the same DNA
saying it's a very simple answer made
still body shame because if they have
like different looking nipples oh that's
yeah my wife I was I was told that I had
pepperoni okay
I'm with girls you'll have a problem
with if you big nipples article baby
want bigger nipples oh I saw an article
the other day that was talking about how
people are asking like you know when
people used to go to plastic surgeons
and be like I want the Kylie Jenner lips
now they're asking for the kendall
Jenner nips this small oh shut her keep
tight that's what I got so I'm thrilled
I wasn't the first time anyone's wanted
anything nipple wise who I said I was
she has she done no photo shoots no oh
yes yes she's a model so she had nude
photo shoots and she also has nipple
ring and one in one of her ring that's
pretty trending yeah people are asking
for that but my question is what
long-term do you want someone who wants
you to have fake nipples do you want
someone who's like it's small nipples or
 I don't if they want it right
like the same way that when we talked
with a labiaplasty future if you were
like oh my pepperoni nips are gross
which they're not delicious maybe it
would make you feel better I guess I
just have a hard time with sorry to
bring it down a notch but I know people
who have had doubled
second amis has women and they also
identify as women and there was a which
I'm sure people have dealt with on very
different levels but bless you remember
see like seeing women being like I don't
know boobs and nipples are such a fight
just to have for so many people who
identify as women and it just feels it I
don't know I've I got guys I am on the
side of nipples on this one I don't know
how we got on this I don't either but
I'm thrilled because it's the first time
I've ever been like yes I have something
that apparently people desire and you're
about titties oh give it a year and then
there'll be a new Kardashian
they don't have a different kind of
nipple then that'll be in yeah back to
our this Kate Fox a high rollers what's
a high roll over 50,000 we talk a
transaction dollar hands because the
people literally our rollers are
just like I am a vagina and I'm just
gonna just sit on it and that's not me I
want to talk about what's your favorite
show what what can you do that okay
that's right you guys are spoiler alert
I'm the most judgmental person you'll
ever meet
true okay move on or do we actually want
to do this yeah okay yeah but I've ever
been with I've ever been single no oh so
I feel a bit but related we also want to
try and go to the Chippendales tonight
or slash thunder down under' thunder see
up on it I would love nothing more than
to ride one of the guys from thunder
down under' and kill those sweet sweet
sunrise we want to go to the Eiffel
Tower do we do we want to go zipline
either through the
or through the building not today too
drunk I will throw up that and the road
are you drunk are you no no are you
hamed I feel like if anything I'm
parched from too much sodium I should
have some water yeah I'll just put my
face it's all sort of your birthday yeah
we want to go to Taco Bell bar which
that's just a personal what that is it's
a bar that serves Taco Bell yeah that's
about it but it's also a bar so we drink
exactly we want to get a yard
oh Jesus we want to get a yard long and
walk down the strip cuz you can drink
outside Vegas it's much like come on
nobody yard log in oh it's a yard long
of alcohol and finally buffet good daddy
we're in Vegas how many do you guys
think well that's yummy house we have 15
things 24 hours
let's get predictions how many do you
think we're gonna do four I might go
high I'm gonna say ten stove what you
predict twelve whoa I think we can do
this guy's yeah okay it easy do
that IV therapy okay so our accolades
right we're gonna make predictions of
these following things see how many were
right for I'm drunk you're beautiful
okay you can't be drunk or anything
that's one of the accolades is who you
got drunk first
yeah posturing you know emotionally
please don't want my face it's broken so
just awkward
alright accolades who is good hold on
your knee okay who is gonna cry first
number one me or stove Wow Wow
we're right Wow okay so you think
because the emotionally turbulent state
of my life yes your signal for the first
time in five years but I think you're
emotionally stable I would hope so but I
don't know when you drink you might get
all fat I think you're so you so the
bets on me to cry first I'm gonna say
that's gonna be it's gonna be happy
tears though who's gonna be the drunkest
we both pointed to Kate if you aren't
watching who is gonna be the first to
suggest shot well I guess I lost huh
yeah you did already lost who's gonna
lose the most money okay okay here's the
thing okay wait wait here's a question
the money that you start with or is it
the most money that you had and then
lost
I think it's who loses like when we go
up you because I thought that I put $20
down you pulled a hundred down the time
that we went need to lie down I feel
like you put a lot down I put 20 and
then I was up one 45 and you were up and
then you're like this time to leave and
I was like not me baby when I guys so
 should've so I'm only took 40
out so I'm only gonna I say let's say
whoever loses the most because what if
we go up what if you go up a thousand
bucks you know what I mean yeah I
favorite from your top earning to me
what you run yeah I lost $145 yeah and I
only have two dollars to show for you
can I smell like eggs awesome
I think I'm gonna go mean losing the
money I think it's because I get in that
mindset of like wow yellow you're also
starting with the most so you have
probably the most yeah the most to lose
the most a game but I think look I've
never seen someone boss out the way that
you boss out in Vegas but it's not
bossing out it's it's I can't I go home
and I cry about it no yeah I think when
we were gambling you were just like I
know better than that that's like it
that's really you know what people are
gonna you over know like what so I
think you're like yeah actually
really good a high-roller one day and I
think stove is gonna lose the buzz whoa
okay okay who's gonna win the most money
you know I'm gonna give this on a stove
he needs a win right now so yeah okay I
don't think it'll be me but are you a
good gambler I'm I'm okay I'm okay I
play blackjack
that's pretty much it same so I'll graph
I think between amount of consumed
alcohol and just total loss well this is
interesting because I know that like I
talked to my dad about this he was like
in Atlantic City they do not help you a
month well I also have the advantage of
being a girl when I go up to a table and
it's like a $5 hand the dealer is gonna
help me what why he helps eight it's a
five dollar head and if I go I don't
know are you assuming the dealer's a guy
though there's just as many female
dealers well even so you're saying even
so yeah but okay mainly the dealer wants
you to win because the dealer's gonna
get paid what they get paid from the
house anyway when they know they're
 you anyway because right but
it's they if they if you win they get
tipped cuz you it's an asshole move to
not tip right so if they help you when
you definitely get they definitely get
tips so they're literally they're gonna
get paid regardless but they may get
paid more if you win so they are on your
side the house is not on your side the
dealer is but I mean they're not gonna
like fix it or whatever but so what I'm
there and I'm just sort of like you
don't know what the middle they're
really nice and they're like Oh split
these or like Dumble Dan on this or
whatever that's true I do wonder and I'm
not saying it is or it isn't but I do
wonder if it's the same for guys cuz I
know that was my experience and all I
know is that I'm a girl I've definitely
never had them yeah I've never really
exact the same table last year and he
was helping me to be fearful eyes I got
cocky but also to be fair this was your
first time in Beijing it was
yeah gambling I think you were like open
about that's the other thing if you walk
up to the table like acting like you
know what you're doing that series go in
with the idea that it was our first show
oh I see you're saying I don't think so
you speak a role like yeah I'm Claire
the the baccarat champion from the South
of France
and I played this $5.00 and I don't know
who I am
oh maybe you'll find yourself tonight
along the strip so with the most money
who's gonna get the first fight is the
longest info me who's gonna puke first I
don't puke I love you goes long I mean
oh yeah I think you're gonna whoop you
are you pukers I'm a poop I'm a next day
puker I never puke the night of I always
feet the next day if I'm too hungover
yeah yeah it's gonna be you or me okay
and who makes out first
Oh coats gonna be the list okay can we
be done you're really happy yes oh my
god given your predictions we've given
you our list next time we see you will
be tomorrow morning afternoon after we
tried to do it all so best of luck

think you technically lost I think no
when you give okay who gets into a
fistfight or who gets into a fight we
said Kate it was case I didn't get into
a fight but I tried to fight every
single trip and Kate was furious that
she she got a cold on stage in the first
round and you had to do what you had to
perform a task it was like a race like
who could dress the Chippendale the
fastest and they wouldn't let me ask a
question what remember I raised my hand
I gotta fight she goes there are no
questions I was like awesome and you
dress your Chippendale you're
Neal cheated he threw his clothes off
when you put them on and then you got
last place so you got taken off stage
and it was all downhill from there the
host was talking around the way down he

excuses for
why some of these didn't work like
number one the New York New York
rollercoasters they closed it because of
the winds it's very windy here hurricane
style wind so they we couldn't get on
that but Ryan said IV therapy did it
healed it it was easy
we had Ryan he was a beautiful nurse it
take IV therapy is the best thing ever
for when you have a hangover I want to
be honestly honest yeah I'd do it again
in a heartbeat and get your liver gates
open cuz your livers working extra hard
if I'm this hungover after IV therapy
which helped what would I be if I didn't
have that IV therapy yeah to be fair you
wanted to go back to tell it five

I'm a baby it's my actual hangover maybe
like a six nice um but the the emotional
hangover is at an all time ten I'm just
thinking about all the bad decisions
that I make and I'm wondering what's
happening in my body and hey that
wouldn't that happen and I was thinking
over you don't want I hate it so much
cuz I'm just like oh man I should I
should you think you need to not drink
for a little maybe because I I don't
know why I get so angry I get like
really angry I think honestly don't be
mad at me for saying this I think if you
had oh God regular organisms
I'm not kidding when I turned sixteen
and I started well I when I was
fifteen
but when I turned 16 I started having
regular sex with my first boyfriend I
became a better person and my parents
will tell you that both of them will say
we were worried about you we wanted to
send you a therapy you're an angry
teenager and then when I start having
regular sex it was like chill do you oh
yeah and I don't mean that in like it
you need to have sex to be happy cuz
that's not true there's a lot of people
who have sex are very unhappy but I
think that's it I think I'm just I have
a lot of backup calm and it's making
nails right you're so here's the thing
I'm not good let's unpack it yeah what
surrounded by all these guys but then
I'm like oh my god you know who I am I'm
the female version of the shittiest guy
in the club oh this shittiest guy the
one who's a I'm a nice guy why would
anyone suck my dick damn I've put gel in
my hair and button my shirt up
i ironed my khakis where is the blowjobs
I've just I think maybe it could be it
okay I know why do I always feel bad how
do we feel about so here's a question a
bumble if someone is like forward I've
always been like oh I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna hook up with someone who's so
forward I lost my virginity to a guy
that didn't give a about me and I
didn't give a about him well that's
how and that like I just wanted to get
it over with I was like I just want to
do this and you know what people like
Emma wait for someone special and
sometimes I don't even maybe preach that
what like you should do it with someone
you care about but like I think sex is
 sex it's the reason why we do
literally anything and everything and I
think sometimes you just have to have it
I'm sorry sorry no sorry I think
sometimes you just got to do it okay and
this isn't the one of those moments
where I'm gonna be like you have to
learn how to love yourself Reagan loves
them off so they don't think that's true
but I think oh god you're gonna hate me
cuz I am me I think it's good to come on
your own to is a good thing
I'm telling you backed up come turns
into hate juice and I have eight juice
coursing through my veins hate juice and
rides IV they're sweet Ryan what
a guy he was very nice our IV nurse he
also works at the ICU and in Las Vegas
