youtube.com slash boldly you might be a
little confused because we are not in
our normal room we are in a room across
from our normal room just spicing things
up switching things up I've got it wait
why are we doing that Cal well listen I
didn't feel like recording a podcast
yesterday why thank you I was a little
tired what guilt he hears there I wasn't
hung over because no I was if that's 100
percent was I will go every hour Sunday
night I woke up every hour to go to the
bathroom and then finally at 5:30 in the
morning I finally had that beer poop Oh
buddy I mean sweet sweet beer poops
honest to god it felt like just it was
beautiful it was like I just out
every piece of poison that's ever been
inside of me
I played seven rounds of beer pong my
body's out of it who are you rooting for
uh gonna be honest greens my favorite
color and I know you're from Philly I'm
not gonna lie a hundred percent was
rooting for my girl Kate's hometown
Jesus Philadelphia I'm not vain iam
silly just go bird from Wow I'm not
gonna do right I feel like it takes a
certain amount of strength and know-how
when you wear a certain badge of honor
if you made it through Philadelphia and
I didn't lose it I went to college there
it is not the same it's like when
someone from Minnesota goes to NYU and
they're like I am part of the city now
it's like I'm not I don't get that
reference but you know I do like the
Eagles is my favorite because silver
linings playbook is my favorite movie
you see Bradley Cooper dig young
coupe was at the show we should watch
that I love that movie I literally
watched it like two weeks ago on the
plane if you guys haven't seen silver
linings playbook
my old teacher was in it she plays she
plays
Jennifer Lawrence's mom Cheryl oh she's
gonna know what she thinks she's in the
window I also wanted that Eagles to win
a because I do love Philadelphia even
though it's not my home to
and my god and then also luck the
Patriots yeah I don't even know much
about I just know that what's-his-face
is the big Trump dude yeah I forgot a
hair ties for you anyways point is is
that did you know 14 million people call
out of work the day after the Super Bowl
I heard I heard about that super sick
bull Monday what did they call it Super
Six Monday yeah sound like that I didn't
call a sick out of work I still worked I
just didn't want to do the podcast I
didn't have any energy I was like yeah I
mean we learned last week cut you guys
don't even know who we cut we cut like
40 minutes last week because we were
just the pocket we actually grew we
actually grew a lot of listeners from
last week's episode and it was a really
good wine with grace yeah love the way
we cut out all the dead air yeah
speaking of not coming to work yesterday
well I did I have to show you something
um this is a full-blown surprise this is
full of Oz rise and I'm gonna have to
cut some of it cuz my titties are gonna
show you got tattoo what if I did I
wanted to get one on the Super Bowl
night Nylund I got really drunk it I was
right there okay there's a terrible idea
young listeners do not go get tattoos
when you're drunk cuz it not I know it's
just a body oh yeah I can't see it if
you're only like me I have a smeared
touch here okay it's not a tattoo oh
okay I got your nipples pierced no I
wish you got just wait okay close your
eyes bring down your back Oh an allergy
Kay yeah oh my god
daddy my twit okay and so there's what
like I think your chair looks like an
old-fashioned keyboard like a light fish
panel yeah so I literally am everything
on my body is on fire right now like my
chin is itching my chest is red my back
is red like I don't know if I'm allergic
to anything they actually tested on me
or if it's the tape oh I think I might
be allergic to bee adhesive
yeah it's for a video here where they're
testing all their testing all my makeup
products less like 40 different allergy
found in like most makeup but I'm pretty
sure I'm allergic to all of them so
that's why I feel kind of not great
everything itches and my back feels like
there's a thousand fire ants on them you
handle pain so well yeah
you handle discomfort in a way if I stub
my toe everyone knows about it later
that day I see but I feel like
especially with someone with chronic
pain like I feel like I talk about it
all the time or that I complain about it
all the time I feel like it's the only
thought going through my brain I always
know oh good maybe that's how you feel
but that's not I don't feel that you
talk about it like that oh that's good
to know because yeah it feels like the
only thing on my mind always so sorry if
I keep scratching like you my titties um
also you did not come hang out with me
and my mom this weekend my mom was in
town you didn't come hang I face time do
you guys that was nice of me all the
time I know I know here's the thing
okay how bit of a breakthrough therapy
as Oprah would call it an aha moment and
why are you screaming the other
listeners so is in therapy and I was
like why don't I do any of this die
I want to do this stuff I want to do and
I want to clean this and I want to hang
up this and I want to redo that and she
was like that all seems like work and I
was like oh yeah I mean yeah and then
she was like what do you do just
strictly for fun and guess what not a
goddamn thing
another thing that I do just for fun so
on Saturday I was already hung over from
Friday
ah so after therapy I just went home and
had to go to sleep Oh cuz then Saturday
night I was going out again it was a
bender of a weekend but you know I had a
blast
yeah I think those need to happen like
it was our our friend slash alumni buzz
feeders young Veronica Chris Ryan occurs
30th birthday he had tacos and
micheladas it was great everyone was
really drunk I half smoked a cigarette
and then realized I don't split it and
then an asshole to me but I don't know
if I was drunk and I made them an
asshole to me or if they were doing
 hot too
you are killing the outfit game this guy
was like I guess he sought me out of the
show before and when I injured it like
he was like oh I saw you at this show
before I was like oh damn it I bombed it
like I was doing stand-up and I fully
bombed and I was like I bombed and I'm
pretty sure he said yeah and that was my
first impression of you and then I was
like what does someone give me a
bike before you this guy like I
just got real bad I didn't see it at all
what I saw was you flirting up a storm
did bopping around groups of people
I was trying and I mean I was like
throwing out the lands and no but it was
bite and well you were also really drunk
and I feel like guys are like I could
pursue this and then I end up looking
like a creep yeah that's so much you
know what I did you know I don't know
how to do or think I learned great thing
tell me ready to hear it Yeti oh you
ready - I'm tell me okay I lost my train
of thought so by myself it's okay I was
farting the entire time so I'm gonna cut
all of that it's bad wait is it I
destroyed your bathroom I like the smell
of farts last week I went over to
Kelsey's on my fire I had to poop but I
wasn't wasn't coming out and I fired it
in it oh my god it was it was like a
thick it was like three hours that it
was down there anyway I walked back into
the bathroom and it was still there
I leave a mark baby yeah I'm making my
gun history herstory cowboy by last
remaining male okay so what do you think
you are gonna do when we got food after
we were drinking we're like let's go get
like you know just shitty food right so
I got food and then guess what I got a
damn did I ordered breakfast for the
next morning Wow so I had that so I have
my food and then I had a nice in
retrospect or if you're gonna order a
bagel sandwich order it deconstructed so
that it's not soggy when you get it but
one lesson one quick little painless
lesson learned I'm not gonna lie to you
I gotta so bad
do we have to push my god I don't know
why feel myself get in there we could
wait and then just poop I make you okay
okay what's it cause fuzz kelsey doesn't
know this but I just started recording
again because she's a laser pooper and
she will be back in the time that would
take her
normal human being to be she'll cut this
but I did also fire while she was gone
I turned it all back on as I said I told
about your laser pooper I'm gonna tell
you what it is right now it's that blue
apron already one of our lovely sponsors
I'm so thankful that they respond to us
because I got the this is not an
ad it may be later I don't know but I
just wanted to say that I got the I made
the best meal last night it was
steak with mashed potatoes and carrots
very simple but it was so good
he had this soy ketchup glaze but boy
did it make me poop just now that's
fresh food baby
remember I said kills his mom once took
us out to a really nice restaurant had a
lot of cheese and a lot of fresh but
everything was like fresh fresh and like
pure food and my body is my craft single
slash like knock off Lunchables body
body - for hours I woke up like I've
told you I was laying the other night
shut up as well like I ran to a bathroom
and I mean for like maybe a solid hour
it was just again Rockets out of my butt
my least favorite kind of poop is the
kind that is like rabbit pellets which
is a clue
I never rabbit pellet but sometimes it's
it's looser than it should see girl
muscles are saying nuts again I don't
know on nuts like ah nuts
and then also only nuts because Peters
getting neutered oh wait big news big
news
I like the Perez here you hear ye we got
a man Mazel what happened Peter is
getting neutered right now yeah I take
them balls baby that's not a thing is
that I I said like yeah he's getting his
nuts cut off and Ike
the idea of cat nuts is so weird
that's hilarious I'm 99.9% sure that
Peter is gonna be a different cat after
these balls come out cause that sucker
was just he is hyper he's a kitten he's
a teenage boy he's a sweet baby kitten
who needs a lot of love and affection
and we he's a maniac he's a
maniac he's perfect now there's cat nuts
Oh God
when Leo got his cat nuts chopped off he
diarrhea everywhere and then he kept
running into everything with his cone it
was really sad that's okay well it's not
day I'm gonna have diarrhea all over my
house yeah you're gonna have to watch
out for that but well I'm taking
tomorrow and Wednesday off none of this
is interesting yeah why because or
Wednesday and Thursday because eh that's
tomorrow
I'm taking pleasurable time for my
celery gonna do a mess right
I might master it but you know what else
I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ride a bike in
Venice I know how to do it all the time
it's very cleansing yeah it's really no
I like that and then I might read ooh
you're a lot of vacation days I've so
many vacation days really I only go
home like and I don't ever go on
vacation so I only go home like twice a
year see I do the same tonight when I
take off mm-hmm then I feel guilty for
not being at work that's how I normally
feel but I'm trying to not do that
that's what I like when I told you I was
depressed I jokingly walked in was like
I'm depressed but I think I am because
right now it's like I'm in a very lazy
sleeping don't want to do anything like
after I record this I want to go home
and edit from home yeah it's but there's
it okay like I come from a family that's
like if you're not dying every day
pushing yourself and hustling to the
limit you're wrong in your piece of
trash and you don't deserve anything
you've gotten boy that is I empathize
with that so much I do also think though
that it's kind of like you know in at
the airplane when they're like if the
things fall down and you have to put the
mask on put your mask on first before
helping others if you're not taking care
of you you're not going to be able to do
the work you want to do right cuz the
work really is second to you I guess I
feels like it that it doesn't I don't
deserve an oxygen mask like what do I
have to be tired and depressed about
right now it's not because of any
certain thing it's just a chemical
imbalance
I'm also non-therapeutic their peers yes
you're on Prozac and in therapy nurse
arriving I am NOT threatening but I am
on my way like I smell like kitten
litter dude I told you like you're you
and you can't become one I wasn't you
guys is morph into each other but I
think that it's it's that idea of like
feeling like you don't deserve something
or because I have to earn this or
whatever like that's I I hate when
people say it's definitely its it hits
home the most for me with when people
say stuff about food and they're like
they like eat something they'll be like
oh we gotta go walk this off and it's
like can't you just have a
burger and shut up about it and you know
what I mean and I know the tired it's
really hard and I think that also I
think is really it it's rough to say ya
know I am I'm worthy of just taking a
day for myself and that's what like I
guess I keep seeing this quote on
Instagram about like self-care that's
like self-care isn't always like lush
bath bombs and face masks and paint your
nails it's like cutting a toxic friend
out of your life it's skipping work when
you need it and I guess there are levels
of self-care because I feel like I do a
good job of pampering myself like I'm
trying to always have like my hair day
my makeups did my you know get it yeah
it's it feels like it's for everyone
else yeah I worry for like the way they
see you yeah and then I don't know like
I just I don't know like I feel so
shitty that I want to go home and like
just be in bed because I know if I'm at
home and in bed I'm just gonna want to
be at work doing something and I don't
want to look back on this time in my
life especially when I have such an
incredible opportunity like working here
and like friends like you guys and like
creative expression and energy that I'm
wasting it being depressed you sound
exactly like how I sounded when I was
when I said I said all of this stuff in
therapy before and it's one of the most
like just heartening feeling so I
remember like walking in the bathroom
here well at like the other office and
walking in the bathroom just be like I
could just stop existing right now and
it would be fine like I could just it
would be a relief yeah it's hard and
then and so you think like that you just
do I don't know let me let me get my
thoughts together cuz I wanted there was
something that you know and I just I
feel bad creating dead air but what was
the thing oh okay
something that like kind it helped me it
took a very long time for it to help me
but
it kind of helped was when my therapist
was like so there's like you say should
a lot right and I do this truly all the
time like I'll be whether it comes down
to ordering something on a menu or like
what I should do that day you should or
what I want to do that day so like I'll
wake up and be like why should go on a
walk because if I don't go on a walk or
a run or something then I'm a lazy
asshole right or you could just listen
to your body and trust yourself and know
that you're a human being like everyone
else on this planet and you could just
be like what do I want what does my body
want if that means you want to stay in
bed and watch rom-coms all day or weird
sci-fi movies all day do it and then and
that's just listen to what you want
right now and sometimes and all of this
is way easier said than done you don't
think that I'm dealing oh here this
literally i hijack do you feeling like
your day off into like why I'm depressed
no I it's a that this is what are you
talking about there's why this we do
this do you deserve to talk about your
feelings fine you're right
 always are you son of a bitch I
know it hurts
oh good inspired but sometimes and this
like this is the worst feeling is it
really you just have to be sad sometimes
yeah sometimes it like I last week I was
having a real rough time I was like
messing PMSing and I was just like I'm I
can't do anything right now I just have
to and I went home on Tuesday I'm just
like laid down and I didn't like watch
anything or read anything I was just
like I have to like just feel this out
like feel it and write it out so feeling
bad is part of what we're able to feel
as humans I guess it just scares me when
it last longer than like a couple days
like you know yeah just PMS sadness or
when it's like work stress or like you
go to a friend fight or something like I
can understand when it's like something
on your brain but when it feels like
it's out of nowhere and for no reason
and it lasts a couple days that's when
it scares me because that's like reminds
me of the time when I was like the worst
of months in bed yes yeah and so I just
I get I get really scared and then I get
defensive and then I get hard on myself
for being like don't you ever dare go
back there that's like it's a choice
that was the disorder talking
mm 100% that just sorta because I'll do
that cue it'll just be like oh I'd like
to do that and the next thing that's
like um so let's say like Oh tomorrow I
could I could go like down to the beach
and ride a bike what a grip like in my
head what a great opportunity to have to
be like oh I could just I'm feeling blue
I'm gonna go do something pleasurable
for me so if I get sad or if I'm just
like oh I should be doing this or I
should be doing that and I'm wasting my
youth and you're doing this or whatever
and then I'll be like okay well I don't
deserve to go and then because you don't
have that time to like play or to enjoy
or to sort of refresh yourself you
cannot do the thing that you think you
should be doing because you're empty
yeah you don't have money yeah you need
like that a little bit of self
reflection and just being a kid like a
little gear kid just playing something
you said to like feeling like you waste
your youth because we see on like
Instagram and we see YouTube
celebrities living this like crazy life
where everyone's a millionaire
everyone's like gorgeous looking and if
they're not they have like the
personality to carry it and we feel like
why don't we have that why aren't I them
and I think something you said is like
I'm 27 so I what I know is irrelevant
but I believe truly and what I've seen
especially in this industry and I mean
this could this could be applicable to
across the country especially I think in
the u.s. is like I don't think you
really are happy and know your
until you hit 30 not trying to give it
like an age limit but the 30 year olds
that I know who have like kind of done
their time of like figuring it how and
like not getting lucky
but like truly living mm-hmm are
happiest past their 20s well yeah but
they I think that that comes from like
this is the work area 27 is like the
you're still like we're still young so
nobody who's older than us is gonna be
like oh yeah poor you you know what I
mean and then people younger or sort of
like I'm gonna be different when I'm
older I'm gonna have it figure it out
and it's like mmm see on the other side
but not every year in my 20s has been a
 shift like a big yeah a
monumental shift
and either my like personality or my
hormones or my friends group or
something and that's what was crazy is
that it was the same thing with my
therapist it's like what do you do for a
joy or like for her just pleasures for
fun and I was like nothing and then I
don't know like the correct vocabulary
that we used but I it sort of just came
to me that like oh really you know how
you would say like I just want to shake
you and they feel better I understood
like I heard people saying that when
people say stuff like a very general
phase phase but fries um like figure it
out its general unless you're on the
other side of it because I didn't
realize that I was like I started
laughing in therapy because it was like
oh I'm my own worst enemy and then I
started singing that pink song
I love people talking about I don't know
she just she's been doing this thing it
feels like she's had the same song out
for 15 years she's been relevant
personal opinion maybe not popular ha
and you but then it's just that idea of
like oh I there was like a comfort and
being like you did this and this is why
I'm like this and this is in your why
I'm like this and you're why I'm like
this and then I think that you have to
go through that and feel all that and be
sad about it you could acknowledge
everything and then you have to kind of
when you're ready get to a point where
you're like oh so because that person
maybe said something to me and my youth
or did something to me or whatever and
so now I see things in a certain way and
identifying the problem only gets you so
far and then you have to be like okay
you change now yeah you change your
perspective it's literally just your
perspective yeah so like no one if you
were to say look oh I added it from home
today or like I went home and like took
a nap and then edit it or even if I just
went home and that I edited tomorrow you
know what I mean like whatever you just
did what you had to do took a bath
people feel like that's are so nice and
fun I've just been really craving a bath
I don't have a bathtub I just have a
shower but if you went and did that
nobody on the outside is going to be
like you don't deserve where you are
deserve where you just took a bath
because you know what that's dangerous
cars need oil changes cars need my car
specifically needs you transmission
fluid but it's fluid damn it I'm falling
apart no you're actually these time to
get you watchin say you get you have to
reboot all of this stuff you have to
charge your computer like eat no one
says that's not a good computer or a
good phone because you have to charge it
god damn it Kate why are you so
smart I really don't know because it's
also like why am I so sad if I'm so
smart like you said it's way easier said
than done and I yeah it easier to also
filter it through you know it's a mirror
right like I see yourself and yet you're
saying what you would say to your friend
because I am her friend but it's also
you kind of wish you could hear it too
or say it to yourself we should go to
frigging Palm Springs or something what
how did that end up as what we should do
I've been trying to go too far I realize
I know but I mean like take some time
and just feel like what is it because
I'm doing the same thing it's really
hard because I'm so used to being like
is this right am i right doing this is
this right or wrong is this like this
person does this and so that's what I
should do when in reality ooh
you can earn yourself to other people
yeah yeah I think you could just take it
it's hard but I do think that there is a
way to learn how to just take a breath
and beYOU know it is my honest free yeah
that's been weird like I think what I
mean we've talked about this but the end
goal used to be I think for both of us
like happy you have to be happy why are
they happy am i yeah realizing that
that's not what if who said that that's
the end goal like you said that that's
what we have to strive to be all the
time because it's just denying yourself
the ability to feel anything else to
recognize what true happiness is it's so
dangerous to compare yourself to others
because then you go like you'll never be
that you'll never be happy enough and
you'll never have what they have you'll
never be them you'll never have their
life and you're also not looking at them
correctly and you're also not looking at
your cell correctly like icing so many
great things about yourself cuz I'm sure
there are people who you look up to or
thinking the same thing about other
people right and then you would just
never assume that they feel that that's
like it's very human you're not alone in
doing that it's like the one of the most
common things and people do it's scary
to realize that like what you think what
success looks like your whole life
changes so like career-wise I was so I
was like I'm not this or don't have this
by the time I'm this age like it was
always career career but you know what
the you were talking about that
yeah and it's scary because it's like
whoa maybe my whole life plan everything
I've always said since I was
what I could think about the future has
always been like career and then to now
be like oh like friends matter like love
is important and like family is the
number one thing and like traveling and
that's really scary because then it
makes me feel like well now I'm just
lazy because I'm not putting all my
 eggs in my career basket anymore
instead I'm like one for friend one for
having a fun time
one for traveling one for taking days
off instead of like my whole life all I
wanted to do was work why because that's
what I was taught okay and then what
about like what did you think would
happen when what is the goal what is
like what is the ultimate goal I like to
be a millionaire but then once you're a
millionaire you might want to be a
billionaire yeah and then before you
know you're gonna have all this money
and stuff and then you're gonna die
you're gonna know label it's a classic
tale of like money doesn't buy happiness
but it sure does buy well I just have to
make you happy for a little bit yeah
yeah and pills and sip I get it uh yeah
I definitely because I struggle with
that too because I sort of have this
thing in the back of my head where I'm
like well if you start to figure out how
to be happy right now
then that's the first step in to
settling for less than what you wanted
and your career or settling for less
than what you wanted but that is again I
just feel like when you when you're when
you have this like toxic voice inside of
you
it's almost like an abusive relationship
with yourself and everything that you've
been taught that your pure self your
true self is trying to be like no I know
and you know when it's right and but
then you have it's like oh you again and
I was like Lena you're like alright fine
Here I am I guess I'm just this shitty
and so and that happens to everyone I
like fall in and out of the you know
those moments with that voice but I do
think that part of this age is getting
better at recognizing which voice is the
good voice to truly listen to because I
thought that to look my therapist said
she was like until you learn how to be
more compassionate with yourself
and do you learn how to do all this
stuff for yourself you're never gonna
have a good relationship because you you
won't be able to let someone in tell
them what you want and it'll be it'll
just be a bad relationship and in my
head I was like you you don't know
what you're try and I said that
to her I didn't say it like like me
knows like this is how strong that
voices yeah because it's the it's the
one thing that's always been constant
yeah is it so it's ingrained in you from
its unlearning years yeah whether you
realize it or not it's like Stockholm
Syndrome for your own meanness you know
what I mean you know like insecurities
because you've had happiness before and
then it left so you're like well I feel
stupid now instead of just I feel sad
now I think it's really important that
if you don't like and not a lot of
people do this but I think it's
something it's like relearn when you're
older is to like stop and be like how do
you feel right now okay why do you feel
that way okay maybe we need to sit in
this feeling first again let's just sit
there let's reach out to a friend and be
like I'm feeling this way and maybe not
be like here I'm gonna cheer you up it's
like okay let's let's do this together
let me sit in this with you that does
not like shove it down way deep inside
of me and drink it away because I'm
Irish
exactly oh and I mean if you want to do
that fun but yeah I think that's like
another thing is to just to reach out
for people and be like cuz that's so
 hard yeah I feel like oh hey um
I'm sad and I'm not entirely sure why
but I would love some company if you're
around and what's to do it great yeah
and nine times out of ten I feel like
that's the hardest part about it it's
not like if someone was like oh I'm so
busy but like well because you know else
I just realized this whole time it has
been a perfect outline of like
I'm sorry children of the internet that
is human by terrible ask for help ask
your finds problem well should we wrap
up they're talking about maybe like an
intention is to like try every day to
like wake up and be like what do I want
right now well it made me feel good
right now or how do I feel right now
what if it's hit the snooze button go
back to sleep do it face the
consequences but do it but also you've
been in every every situation you've
ever been and you've lived through oh
that's a good quote you've lived through
your worst
you're still here yeah cuz like if you
okay say you hit the snooze button and
then say you're even late to a meeting
and you show up and you're like oh god
dang it I'm so sorry maybe there'll be
matters but it also doesn't matter like
you can't control how other people will
react you could only paint inside the
line so so much at some point you just
have to I used to be you I remember I
used to just be wild about things but I
would just be like a I'm not
gonna go I'll make something I don't
care yeah now yeah like happiness isn't
really my end goal I feel like now it
might my goal is to try to beat what I
felt oh yeah okay
it's more like just honest just to be
honest and loving when you said the wild
things you would make up I did something
so bad oh what'd you do I went to Auburn
University and I was in one of those
history classes where there's like a
hundred people and they they're like the
way they take attendance is by your seat
so literally like there's a TA that sits
to the side and their only job is to go
through and mark who's there and not
there based on like what when you're if
you're in your seat or not yeah so like
people did crazy like they would
send their friend in they were try and
like go sit in their seat and go sit in
someone else's seat they would put a
jacket so it looked like someone was
sitting there so many things but they
would but they were so strict about your
attendance yeah if you missed like three
classes you have to like take the class
over yeah saying I'm paying for the
education if I favor yes area education
then yeah let me have it
so what I did was I faked my grandma's
death and he was like I need proof of
the death oh my god oh I printed up you
wrote out an obituary no I I
photoshopped a like program okay so much
terrible is happening in that story hey
Kelsey
what the it was like their grandma
alive she did die eventually but all
grandma's die every well yeah everyone I
know dude I told you it was bad I just I
like I was out of reasons to be excused
from the class and I thought well the
only thing that you could
excuse from is a death in the family and
they the only proof he needs is proof of
that so I just but that is in itself
look I'm more mad like it's horrible
what you did no truly horrible but I'm
wearing mad that they were like we need
proof yeah why would you do that to
somebody guys people like me are
assholes and fake McGrail right but that
is that for the people who actually had
a death in the family than Oh what if I
went home like what if you lived a few
hours moments like oh I'm sorry do you
want my parents who are dealing with the
loss of their parent just send a
program let me write this guy a letter I
want to say his name was like mr.
Lawrence we don't have to I don't know
how he's still teaching at Auburn
University but hey I dropped out of that
college anyway who cares I used to miss
a lot of class a lot of school and then
I would just go in because I went to
school for theater so like I shouldn't
have even gone to college but I went in
and I was like I would go into classes
and just be like I need to talk to you
um I missed okay sorry I'm just really
embarrassed and I would just talk about
how I was depressed and why I had to
miss my good acting skills yeah and I
start crying and be like you know just
don't want you think it's cuz I don't
respect you respect the class just yeah
that's the shittier that's emotional
it's not and but so was I in a way yeah
but you know maybe that school didn't
that did that school did pay off cuz I
was some great acting I mean anything
cuz I didn't lose weight what no that's
not true but they didn't they were that
was like a talking that was a thing that
people said a lot it was like a that was
it no teacher Oh out rightly said that
but there definitely was like a bias
towards people who were thinner for sure
interesting yeah maybe you just sucked
maybe ya know I had someone say that to
me once
yeah I was like I don't know why I
didn't pick for this part like yeah my
voice is so much better than hers did it
it was like maybe you think your voice
is better than hers Billie
hers is actually pretty classical and
perfect for this part I was like
maybe I'm just bad at singing and then I
quit singing yeah I saw the people
action they were trash you're really
good we're great we're both great actors
you guys should watch our staff adult
 thank you
that's the answer I am quiet okay this
one I thought was cool enjoy it I know
it's a little long it's a little long
but stick with us because I'm interested
in knowing what you think okay hi Kelsey
loved the podcast never fail to catch
you every week you and Kate are boss ass
bitches get to the question and I feel
like I need advice from some bosses
bitches so I have a buddy and turns
out some feelings have been exchanged
this is odd for me cuz I don't consider
myself very emotional but I do know it
is out of fear of being hurt some of it
what should we call him I don't want to
call him is rolling blade blade is in
the Navy and lives in another state
warning flag I know but we visit each
other constantly I met blade 10 years
ago in high school because him and this
girl Kyla were my best friends they
dated for a year after high school and
broke up because he cheated on her so
safe to say I wasn't listening
they were her best okay okay so yeah she
was best friends with these two so safe
to say he wasn't part of the friend trio
anymore we did the best friend thing how
we talk about him any chance we
could
anyway he joined the Navy and was
deployed in Japan we haven't spoken in
seven years but I did miss him a lot
because he was like my brother then this
past October he hit me up saying that he
was being transferred to the States he
was gonna spend a month home before he
moved wanted to see me and catch up I
felt that there was no reason to stay
mad at him high school was years ago and
I figured why not he came to visit me in
my new city because I moved a few hours
from hometown and it was great we talked
crap out and it was amazing then he
would keep visiting me and one night we
hooked up it wasn't weird it just felt
right and we kept being friends
afterwards he moved to his new base with
any visits on weekends and I visit when
I'm not broke his because of law
school when we aren't with each other we
sex but the moon yeah right but then
we'll go back to talking about our our
sports or something the next day so we
have this friends-with-benefits
relationship but I haven't mentioned
anything to Kyla we are so close and I
never kept anything from her or lighter
that's my problem I feel so guilty in
like a horrible person she's in a
wonderful relationship with a guy they
lived together any plans on proposed
Durer this year she's completely over
blade but says it was just a high-school
thing but when I try to bring him up and
a Hey look who I talked to away she
always says something negative he's
changed a lot since high school
obviously and he showed me that he
really cares about me I've never had a
boyfriend before because the whole
unemotionally available thing and
because of low self-esteem but I feel
comfortable with him and great with him
then I feel wallow did guilt I just
don't know how to tell Kyla this and
should I wait and if I should wait until
things get more serious sorry this is so
long I tried to convince as much as
possible so long story short this girl
is now / maybe getting into a
relationship with her best friend's
ex-boyfriend from high school who
cheated on her mm-hmm Wow yeah
and it's been seven years since high
school so 10 years to 10 years 7 years
things you talked about yeah whoo my
initial thought I'm just going off gut
reaction if someone that I am best
friends with was keeping something like
that from me and then it turned out to
be someone that I had or still have or
whatever opinions and feelings about I
think I would be pretty pissed I think
the sooner you tell her the better
because the longer you wait the more
it's gonna hurt I think yeah yeah I
think there's also like when you
mentioned having low self-esteem and
that's why you and emotionally
unavailable and all stuff other things
like that that I can totally relate to
and I think that sometimes there's a
part of you that because you didn't
experience it what everyone else was
experiencing it there's a little I'm not
saying it is with you but I've
experienced this like a little bit of a
bitter part to me where I'm like well I
never had anyone so well so obviously
I'm going to just have the I'm gonna go
with this like god I never I never
 get anything and I'd get it but
I also think that that's your best
friend man you got it in and if you guys
love each other really like that yeah
she might feel weird about it
and like you can't control the way she
feels about it but also I mean if she's
like engaged in stuff like that I was
gonna say that's a bit I feel like a big
part of it if she was like single too
and you guys you know talk about dating
and it's very so much it's still very
much a big part of like your day-to-day
life of like trying to find dick or
whatever right but if she's really happy
and she's really okay with her life now
which it sounds like she is then I don't
think it's gonna be as big of a deal as
it it as it would be if she was single
and I'm happy yep and you also just you
you have to take the situation as it is
she dated him she has every right to be
upset she has more of a right to be
upset now because you didn't tell her
and you've been visiting him and hooking
up with him and lying to her I think
that's gonna be I think that's gonna be
what she sort of says is the most
upsetting thing because it is probably
the most upsetting thing but there is
also like a feeling of there are people
who like I mean just many of people who
rejected me years and years ago and I
never even had a thing with them that
I'd be pissed if I found out that
someone like one of my friends is doing
you're all she's also allowed to get mad
at it so I think maybe don't look for a
perfect situation like don't there there
might be a way where the nothing works
out really the way you want it to and
yeah I definitely think people could
change people could stop cheating or you
know whatever that's the other thing is
like if you got cheated on in your
formative years like that will shape you
as a person yeah I'm sure like
looking back on it now I look at the
dudes who made mistakes or like what
douche bags or whatever and I'm like
that's because they were kids right but
it didn't happen to me so like if I were
her and maybe that like that having
someone cheat on me at that age prop
could mean a lot to her mm-hm and if she
if it does and it affected her in a way
that like she can't look past the fact
that he's a changed person then maybe I
would say like you have to decide what's
more important to you like your best
friends like you know what I mean what
do you see wounds and yes yes and I
think that there is also you might be
able to see that he's changed and he's a
different person but she might not and
like I think she kind of has the right
to feel that because it happened to her
also I I really don't want to be
here and I hope that this doesn't come
off as mean but if it were me if I were
the girl who got cheated on and then I
found out that my friend was like
talking to this guy I would be like well
how long have you guys had this
connection did you like him back when I
was dating him did you talk to him more
while we were broken up like how long
have you been talked cuz I'm assuming
you don't you didn't tell her that you
would the extent of what you guys would
talk about you know because this didn't
just happen sort of like out of nowhere
so I would be a little like wary if I
were her about that you know what I mean
and I think hey you kind of maybe maybe
take a step back and I know that
everything's different like where'd she
say she was from
well I felt something something like
that right naval bases so I know that in
like a smaller town or whatever it's
like hard to meet new people and so the
idea of lugs there's so many fish in the
sea it's like no there's not there's
 500 people my dad you know what
I mean so I totally understand being
like I already know this person and for
someone who has a hard time getting into
relationships or like is nervous and
like emotionally unavailable being with
someone that you've met before and who
you like you've gotten to know from a
safe distance I totally understand that
appeal it's just a very complicated
situation now because your friend I mean
there had to have been like feelings or
something like that a while ago right
that there kind of had to be and to like
just and this is gonna be a shitty thing
that just whatever I'm just gonna say it
like there could also be some on sort of
some like subconscious idea that like
you have him now and not her cuz maybe I
think sometimes we do that as girls like
I remember in high school when a popular
guy would like my friend and then like
nothing happened with them yeah I said
well let me see if I can get it cuz then
like I'm yeah I think that there is a
weird there's like a weird and this
isn't like across them this really isn't
across the board I'm assuming we're
around the same age though cuz the time
feels like it matches up but who it just
it right now what you're saying it just
doesn't sound like that person is your
real friend I'm sorry yeah the girl I
get really it kind of like really really
feels like you're in a position where
you're just putting yourself first and
that's not really a that's a high school
friendship that's like that's a I'm
gonna be friends of you but I'm still a
little bit jealous of this stuff you
have and if it's not and she you know it
doesn't matter you could tell her and
she could be like I don't give a
that was 10 years ago
wait it doesn't matter at all like it
you gotta kind of be prepared for what's
what she's gonna say and I think it
sounds like the way you speak about her
it that should matter the most is her
reaction yeah and if it's not then maybe
you look at the friendship and go like
what does this matter to me more than
the guy I mean how long have you been
talking to this guy couple months couple
months and so for a couple months you've
been lying to your friend and also he's
in the Navy he's gonna get deployed so
you could just keep up and not
say anything and then just wait until he
goes away Jersey that's the unpopular
advice to give to someone in
communication is so key like I said like
you could talk to her and she could not
give one single yeah
communication you know you said you've
tried to bring it up and she's always
had negative things to say but I would
feel the same way about talking
about a dude that from my past but like
if I really were to get into it and I
think do you like if your friends your
friend like she might be concerned about
you being like oh are you sure like you
know yeah you sure you're sure about
this yeah I feel like there's a lot of I
don't mean to be so judgmental about it
but I do have like I don't know this
could be very outdated way of looking at
things but like I mean maybe you guys
have a genuine connection maybe you guys
are like really getting a lot unlike you
guys are supposed to be together he's
all mate for right now you know you know
if that's the case then talk to her
about it and fight for it you know what
I mean like stand by it do what you have
to do it sounds like there's a lot of
fear around it though and you even said
like warning flag yeah about him being
in a different state which means like
you don't really trust them it kind of
feels like you're going down the you're
setting yourself up for a lot of
heartache it kind of feels like and
I don't know him so I don't know how he
thinks but I can't imagine someone would
be like oh I'm gonna date my ex's best
friend and have a whole bunch of respect
for that person you know what I mean is
it worth it to to like what it might do
to your friendship with your best friend
like is that is that does he talk to you
about like is he like you gotta tell her
you know there's a thing because I think
that it's not that it matters but I do
want anything but but that is sort of
telling of like the relationship that
you're fighting for that you could risk
a friendship for you know what I mean
like if it's a true thing and then I
think he would be like you gotta tell
her like I want you to tell her I want
to be able to she means so much to you I
want you know yeah there are these
conversations that should be happening
you don't have to be in this by yourself
it just sort of sounds like you got it
you got to start talking yeah we kind of
went 10 different ways with how this
could have gone out and just wanted to
get all of our opinions out there but my
like final thing my final piece of
advice is you gotta be honest with your
best friend yeah
please write us back we want to know
yeah I'd love having it or like even if
does that it you said you condensed the
question a lot so maybe we do need more
details yeah you know I don't want to be
judgmental but I also don't want to like
coddle anyone's feelings when I think
they're doing some kind of shitty mmm
but we all do stuff that's Jenny I had a
friend in high school who guys used to
try to come through me to get to her so
I get like I'd get home and I'd look on
MySpace so it would be like from this
boy who I thought was really really cute
and he'd be like hey how you doing I'd
be like oh it's a lie so your friends
like oh and then I would be like
the little people pleaser I'd be like
I'm gonna make it work for you guys and
I'd set them up and then I would like
when they would break up I would be like
it's okay you know what I mean like
trying to still be like close with the
guy which is a sad sad person move so I
know we've all like you know we've all
been there it's not like you're not a
you're not a bad person or whatever it's
just it's a human thing yeah I know
thank you yeah I don't think it you
should also make yourself feel bad about
it because yeah this is just life and
it's already happened and it's already
happening and you can't take anything
back so don't there's no point in
feeling making yourself feel bad
yeah more than whatever whatever she's
gonna do to you okay we hope that helped
