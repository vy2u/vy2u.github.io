everyone in the group chat and was like
hey everyone touched me like a snack
they want and like Gatorade or whatever
and immediately Jasmine writes back
Doritos Fritos jalapeno cheddar cheese

Moscato we were gone for two days so
that was Jasmine's order mine was a
handle of GMO and Cheetos Freddy wanted
diet coke music all Davison jmo that's
what we called in the Dirty South
baby boy let's just say there there was
more alcohol than anything else in this
cabin and I'm still glad I
didn't go dude you would have actually
died yeah I was drunk for a week
straight we literally saw a man almost
died we were on this dance floor nowhere
on the dance floor in this guy
this little tiny guy he was like he
looked like a gymnast which we later
found out he was an Olympian gymnast and
pressure the pressure god yeah
kind ideas what killed my and he
like does that thing where he backs the
crowd up like makes a big circle we're
like oh and then he goes in the middle
and right as he goes to do a backflip
some dumb drunk bitch walks right into
his backflip and he lands on his
neck and everyone was like oh we
literally thought this guy died like he
wasn't moving on the ground and then
literally then he gonna go to the next
Olympics truly I have no idea fencing
about cards for him goes to a club and
Big Bear you guys are into all there is
to do there is
and twerk here's the thing I was on the
fence which is very funny I was on the
sense it was like I should go I'll bring
my computer I'll get a lot of words in
absolutely not we also ran into a
bachelorette party hey girl
okay with what we did
would you guys make out you guys
each other just gonna keep going down
the list until I tell you I'm at often
just that it exhausts the sexual thing
is what is dangerous about having like a
little bit of internet notoriety is that
people like to snapchat you when you do
things in public and there was a lot of
like you know it was me Freddie jazz
like when you see the three of us
together and by the way we were
ridiculous looking we were wearing
full-length fur coats it was a weird
like you has a uniform yeah we did we
look like one another hottest
rap group but like so it was hard not to
notice us because we were just being
ridiculous
uh-huh and so everywhere we went people
were like oh if I buy you a shot will
you be on my snapchat story and what am
I gonna say no yeah no I can't I don't
know how to do that so we met a couple
of nice young gentlemen you guys have we
I don't want to say too much I'm glad
you're feeling better though yeah I
slept all Saturday and then yesterday I
watched every Twilight movie why I loved
those stupid movie I know I went
right from one to the end and I was like
I had strict plans to like write and
stuff but I didn't because you can cut
this part out you I feel like you're
gonna be like why are you doing this but
all I want I can't wait to talk about
love like actually cut that out that's a
great thing to say but though we're
gonna talk about next week yeah oh
speaking of next week oh yeah what about
you have to go somewhere to review for
next week
Kelsie will be in Barcelona with her
 buddy and so we're gonna have to do
another Skype one remembered last week
when Kelsey said after this trip were
done so instead of going after the
engine yet after the trip she extended
it from a ski weekend to then a four-day
trip to Barcelona dude here's the thing
Kate you would do the exact goddamn
goddamn goddamn same thing because we're
twist
supposed to do dumb like this like
I'm supposed to willy-nilly book a trip
to Spain because why the
not
yeah for sure I would do it good I have
vacation you would judge you for what
what do you judge me for I'm not okay
I'm not sure I would be like God you
said you would say to me okay you said I
told you you you do it I don't
understand what the problem is here as
long as I'm dying yeah as long as you're
fine
do I not seem fine you see I haven't
talked to you i RL we're gonna have to
hang out and then all that's what this
podcast is for are you fine yeah okay I
you seemed wildly defensive because I
feel like I have to be like this is why
I'm doing it rather than just being like
why not take a stupid fun ridiculous
four day trip with someone that is also
a fun ridiculous person yeah for a short
I'm a hundred percent on board if the
only thing I want to say is that if all
right I don't want to project anything
dude I'm just saying that if it were me
I would have a hard time separating the
feelings um something like a trip like
that
I don't okay I'm really excited to just
go Bop around and eat pasta and for
four days then do it
hell yeah dude do it yo but it's not
like I'm not whatever let's go to
 your problems okay we had a
company send us they heard about your
who do we call it you don't come think
right now you don't have a psychological
issue yeah and they were so nice they
sent me a home they sent a
suitcase full of oh I got your toys they
sent this is from lovers package.com is
not an ad they were just out of the
kindness of our heart were like wow we
want to help Kate Kong and so they sent
us each let's see one two three or four
or five six seven
eight nine ten eleven different sex toys
in sex objects you got a couple
different things but just some fun stuff
on here that they did send us things
like cinnamon bun flavored lube they
didn't even know that cinnamon buns are
like my top five favorite foods
go on my Twitter you'll see me at
Cinnabon a Cinnabon thinness cinema
system Joe clitoral stimulant and
evolved pearly rabbit Jimmy Jane form to
which Jimmy J products are so amazing if
you guys are ever looking for sex toys
Jimmy Jane is great and the one I was
most excited to try the womanizer - oh I
have it yeah oh my god the womanizer is
we did a video about it at BuzzFeed I
have an actual womanizer sorry to
interrupt no it's fine
I have an actual womanizer but here's a
little womanizer to go it's lipstick it
looks like lipstick it's a giant it's
like the size of your hand right looks
like lipstick and you turn it on and it
just the tip of where like the lipstick
is just yeah that's what mine at
home does so I'm probably gonna give
this one so it doesn't it claim like
it's thing that its known for is like it
can make you in under three minutes
yeah so hmm no I didn't use it I didn't
use it yet but will you ever use
anything no I have the the pearly rabbit
and that clit stimulator those are a
dessert oh they're at home oh yeah those
are have been used I didn't bring them
Beckett okay what did we think I mean
they were they were great it was yeah I
felt really good but did you
come no oh
guys here's the thing I really
appreciate this and I think that is
really good too like I think this is a
good step in the right direction of like
talking about sexuality and exploring
different things that you might like I
do think that personally my not coming
could have to do with me being like
nervous about talking about sex but I
think most of it is psychological and
not so much fun oh yeah and not so much
like but you're not using the right tool
it's like the same thing as a guy saying
but you'll come if I do it it's like no
maybe not but like do you think that you
have an idea in your head about how it's
supposed to happen yeah what is that
well I would like I do a lot of things
oh dang it okay are you gonna sound sad
no you don't gonna say say do you know
how many people write to us literally
you guys how many you don't think about
Chuck I'm going into talking about how
glad they are that you're talking about
this because something okay I've never
felt comfortable really saying this out
loud because I always felt stupid saying
it but most of the things that I do in
my life I do alone like most things I'm
very much it always has been whether I'm
processing something or I'm bettering
myself in some way even like anything at
all intimate whatsoever I try to do
alone or I overcompensate in a
relationship with someone like a
friendship or something and I sort of
make it all about them you know what I
mean and I'm just and project a little
bit to try to help my own problems but
yeah but really what I'm sort of what I
think I really would like is I've never
been in love I've never I've never had
that type of intimacy of someone being
in my space and seeing all of like the
ugly things in my apartment and like all
of the clothes I don't wash immediately
and that's like on my floor and stuff
and it's just really it blows my mind
like I can't even wait to next until
next week to say it blows my mind that
people find each other and are genuinely
happy to see each other yeah and then
they're together and they're happy
you're like in that they both like each
other equally well isn't it called like
I think maybe what you might be in
listeners correct me if I'm wrong is
demisexual which is you need an
emotional connection to orgasm or have
sex and it sounds like maybe because
you've never been in love
and oh my god like let me tell you what
coming with a different like coming with
someone versus coming on your own are
like two totally different experience
yes and it is really scary and too
intimate as and dude love is the
worst and best thing in the
world do you think if you met someone
that like would you be comfortable being
like hey these are the things
I need and don't need and want and don't
want in order to come I don't know what
those things are
mm-hmm it's raining oh oh sorry if the
sound of specters just started raining
uh I don't know what the things are that
would make me like oh oh that's what I
was gonna say I'm all I don't know what
the things are that would make me want
to or would make me come I don't know
what they are I think it is it like
intimacy and I just can't imagine
someone seeing all of like the ugly
parts of you and still be like yeah no I
like it
cuz I do that with other people I'll be
like I like that part of you I like that
but I've just never felt it back
yeah and I'm I I think there's a part of
me that doesn't want to come on my own
just by myself right now because I'm
already seriously so good at
being alone like I'm so good at it I
could Hey I've moved my sorry yeah yes
dude in terms of the just survival yeah
yeah I moved myself into an out of every
apartment I've ever been I don't ask for
help with stuff I do most things just
fully on my own if I do this on my own
what do I need anyone else for I wasn't
to say that like I'm very independent -
yeah like different situations obviously
but like I lived alone for majority of
my life I do I like to be alone I like
doing things by myself
mm-hmm but it the sex and like orgasms
that's a huge part of like maybe it's
American life I don't want to say like a
light light cuz I don't think it is but
I don't know if maybe like maybe it just
doesn't matter as much to you I just
think that it was something that I
haven't experienced yet and I think that
it's weird too because I get a lot of a
lot of people I see your comments I see
all the the the messages about people
being like oh I'm this age or whatever
we are sort of like a date on when
you're supposed to think there isn't
there's not it there's not everyone's
doing stuff on their own timeline and
ending a bet that gets weird cues
because you're like oh I'm a certain age
so if I don't do this thing I'm broken
or I'm weird and I do feel like
that a lot of times thank you
don't of course I shouldn't but I think
that it's also I hadn't ever really said
oh I want a relationship yeah who was
banging but I never really said
like oh I want I want a relationship I
want that intimacy because in my head I
was always like oh this invisible
audience that I sort of have in my head
is gonna be like no you're too ugly and
fat and and you're just stupid
yeah it's constant like constantly not
even just like that type of intimacy
even just intimacy and doing what I want
to do like writing the stuff I want to
write doing stand-up all of these things
that I want to do I have this this
assumed perspective of my own worst
thoughts right like my the worst
possible thing people could say and then
I'm like oh that's what they're
definitely saying I talked myself out of
everything so I'm just recently and
after a really long time going to
therapy in a really long time of trying
to you know figure this stuff out I'm
trying to say more like this is what I
want you know I'm not perfect yet yeah I
I hate that you feel that way I know
like there's never a way to like make
your friend know how great they are and
how much they do deserve and like all
that so I'm not gonna bore you with
that because I tell you this all about
you but I do work I don't I see a little
bit of the thing I hate about myself and
what you're saying yeah that sometimes I
worry that I need another person and to
be or do something yeah it's a really
fine line right cuz I don't want that's
I talked about this a lot in therapy is
like I don't want someone's external
validation to make me feel better about
myself yeah I mean I do think that it
walks that line because sometimes
they'll get like a crush on someone yeah
yeah I do stuff like that all the time I
like them is meant to be and then I
obsess and I'm still figuring all of
that out but I think it's a way of
craving intimacy without actually
letting yourself have what you need
mm-hmm so still keeping it at an arm's
length like of course you're not going
to fall for someone who you haven't
actually met yeah that's just they're an
embodiment of what you want them to be
dude it's so very falling in love it's
so scary
cuz you're like oh my god if you think
it's bad now that you don't know if
someone likes you or not like truly even
when you know like I've been in
situations where both the person like
we've both said I love you like the same
time like with whether they said it or I
said at first when we both said it and
then after we'd be like I didn't know if
you were gonna say it back
yeah and it's like you but you have all
these feelings yeah and you you are you
were crazy you feel like well if I say
it and they don't say it back or what if
I say it I don't mean it or like what if
I said what I'm drunk or like how'd it
happen we're like we've said it after
sex before and then I look back on a
relationship and I'm like that was not
love and it's so scary and I think I'm
purposely like shut myself out from
having it ever since that one really bad
relationship I had I haven't been back
in love not bad relationship the one
that ended not great for me is super sad
mm-hmm and I haven't let myself be like
vulnerable and I think I've kind of
become hardened to it because I am so
afraid again of getting hurt
Revelator than that or like it's a lot
easier for me now to like hurt other
people rather than get hurt cuz it's so
scary and I am terrified for you kind of
the same thing into like opposite ends
of the spectrum like so you hurt other
people before they could hurt you I hurt
myself and reject myself before someone
else could reject me yeah shitty no
we're just human oh we're just fine and
we're selfie or silly and dumb we are
silly and dumb but I think that's what I
like I don't know I I think it's really
important to for me personally it's
everyone's on their own path or whatever
but I want I do want some sort of
relationship like I want and I want it
to be real a lot of this stuff is so in
my head like I'll have a crush on
someone and be like plan
whole life together that's all I do with
my free time and then I before I know
I'm daydreaming the whole day away that
I'm like Jesus Christ I didn't do
anything with this week and then if I
ever top them they'll be like what do
you do this we gonna be like I thought
of our kids what out of our kids then I
walked us through our first fight I'm
gonna like be what like you're on apps
you die did I do on D I delete it all
man what do you want like what do you
want to do to make this a reality that's
where I'm having a bit of a hard time
like I don't I don't know I don't know
if I if I could try the apps again I
think that's another thing was I was
very much closed off to the idea of
dating even though I wanted to I thought
I wanted to date someone so I was like
ah ginger snaps or bumble sucks or
whatever it does it's really hard I
think because I think it's just really
difficult to just see a picture of
someone and then their own bio and be
like yeah like I can't write a bio for
the life of me what did your bio say it
was just a hand waving for I was can't
you're a writer I know I know but it's
being self-aware sometimes crosses into
self-conscious like yeah it's extremely
what is it self-conscious you're just
extremely self-conscious so I didn't
know what to write yeah I'm just like I
don't know I guess I'm a writer all but
I'm not a good one you know what I mean
like wow boy there's a real Jewish do an
episode about this cuz I have got you
messages where people have written in
asking how they can like help their
friend be like my friends so great and
they're dealing with this or like how do
you deal with a friend who like doesn't
believe in themselves or something but I
I don't know what to do because I live
this every day with you yeah
there's a like I don't that helps
that'll help
yeah that's good well the do that pisses
me off because I I want so much for you
and I want you to have all these I want
to have all those things - it just
doesn't happen overnight this has been
28 years of habitual thoughts and you're
like I feel like you've grown so much
I hope so yeah I mean I have never
really said I want a relationship and I
always just say like I just want the one
affect me and I don't know we know that
that's not you know we know you are
diddle your doodle and lay around and
play with you and Pete if I could God
and get fried and I want someone who's a
little bit more active than me but it
also likes to lay around be like let's
go do something today uh-huh
yeah the best kind of days are the ones
where you wake up and you're like we
could go out and do all this or so
that's where that's where I'm at I don't
Oh Twilight brought this but I mean I
designed the kind that's that
obsessive movie not yeah yeah thanks you
think like you're missing out because
you don't have a guy that wants to
literally kill people for you they also
I don't I think that we're just sort of
skewed I'm very much I think they did if
I just show up that's enough yeah it is
nobody knows no it is not but you have
to you know find someone that you are in
doing enough by being I'm not okay yes
yes yes I don't think you understand
what I mean by showing us sure and not
showing up to life and do you Who I am
I mean like walking into a bar place or
a bar and then seeing someone you have
to give him something yeah remember the
kid I talked about on like one of the
podcast so what that guy that human man
nice recovery they talked about on the
podcast if you yeah I guess and then I
had to like say that I liked him or
whatever ever haven't I I used to
daydream about him I haven't really
thought about him unless I like see him
yeah and it doesn't feel bad anymore
that's like oh he didn't like that is it
sucks for like two days I was kind of
mad and then I was like I was mad
because I wanted him to like me now I'm
just like I do the same like weirdly I
do the same thing where it takes me like
two days of me like obsessively looking
at their Instagram or something and then
being like you know what here's like a
shitty thing about them that I didn't
notice before that I probably wouldn't
have liked yeah got it if that Ghost was
just like relationships to really like
how just we idealize the best parts
about relationships yeah
I'll look back on that one big love that
broke my heart and all the time whenever
I bring it up like if I'm with family
like friends and they'll something will
happen and it'll spark conversation
about him
they will always go Kelsey you were so
unhappy and in my head I wanted I know
wasn't I was so in love and that was the
best relationship of my adult life and
truly it was not yeah I was I didn't
 want that I did not want that
person I did not want the shitty things
about them the shitty things far
outweighed the good in the relationship
yet I stayed yes convincing myself that
it was wrong and true love and big love
and it wasn't I still don't think I've
had like my big movie love you know and
I said it I've said I love you to a guy
well we said it together after two weeks
of dating two weeks and now a
love like that was just pure lust and
like but in those times where you get
caught up in it and you're like feeling
and all your hormones and
endorphins and are pumping and you
just you can you learn when I think you
learn what true love is the more you I
guess just experience it because I
really do think I've only been in love
twice I think my first put my first high
school boyfriend the big one you know
that you learn about just how you can
even feel about another person that's a
complete stranger and then the big one
and even the big one even the big one
that I talk about I don't know if that
was like fully actually I never felt
that about anybody like I've loved
people but only on my own like I've
never felt it reciprocated I am in God
did Oh of the fact that it exists I feel
like I'm in The Truman Show and
everyone's just telling me this
and that's just it's like love doesn't
actually exist and I'm just gonna
realize one day that I've been in it
okay I kind of envy you though why cuz
dude like don't give me that about
oh it hurts it does yeah
okay but that's oh man that's it's that
thing is it better to have loved and
lost than never loved at all and nine
times out
and I would say I'd rather not have
loved at all see I want I want it though
I've literally only likes people what's
that word called unrequited my middle
name baby hey Elizabeth unrequited and
Peter dude it's gonna happen and when it
does it's gonna be so scary I don't want
the whole sick of people saying
it's Jana
what do you come what do you want me to
say that you know gonna happen you don't
know you think you're gonna go your
whole life without temple volley
mom what if I died today that's really
sad but also could totally happen yeah
well then Kate you better start telling
the people that you want to that
you want to or be in a relationship
with I love it I said love me like
they're telling mother because
you know what if that's how if you
really wanted it bad enough and maybe
this is a little bit of tough love but
you'd do something about it
yeah but that's another thing that once
I find someone who kind of is I know I
know yeah everyone's gonna be like Kate
you're setting yourself up for failure
no I don't think I go in the club I
as soon as like someone likes me back I
am when I say I cut and run when I say I
truly run where was I didn't have a
is you are you smooth as ever follow up
if you physically leave if you figure
that I'll let me do it like I take it
back to therapy Jesus Christ I don't
know it's just being terrified of
intimacy but also craving intimacy it's
like that's life though it's like
needing peanuts but being allergic I'm
I'm not allergic to peanuts I can't
speak on that that's a terrible idea
oh sure we will speaking of speaking of
experiences that we can't speak to sure
they just read this comment that we got
I thought this was a good comment
because it talks about speaking to
experiences that we can't speak to so at
Bella Hornby or norbi I don't know my
handwriting shitty said love the podcast
and just wanted to say that you often
associate vaginas exclusively with women
and women exclusively with China China's
vaginas not all women have vaginas and
not all people with vaginas are women I
know you wouldn't be trans exclusionary
but I know you wouldn't be trans
exclusionary
can't say that we get it I know you
wouldn't be trans exclusionary on
purpose I just think it's important to
be conscious of and for your trans and
just as easily influenced listeners
abso-fucking-lutely up a harm and it
happens just because I identify as a
woman and have a vagina and we're gonna
be better about that and just another
another example of us being privileged
and not realizing that we have to to be
more inclusive in the way we speak and I
know that you guys don't have to thank
you very much bring that to our
attention yeah and we like this podcast
was note we never pitched this to our
boss is like we want to do like a women
pocket as we wanted to be like no no no
I know it's weird to identify as well
you're a dumb yeah like we never said it
just we and obviously where we identify
as women and we speak to our experiences
and that's what those pockets
has turned into and so we're gonna try
and do better and hey if there are
people out there that were like nas
meeting to experience tell us what we
can do if you want to hear specific
guests sir if we can talk about specific
subjects and we will only be able to do
the best that we can buy with yeah we
have we do try it but we don't know
everything so if we up and offend
you please let us know and we won't do
it again a men speaking of
dope ass yes I want to bring in our next
birth next yes I want to bring it on
coming up on her next game she was a
part of the Big Bear / bad dance like
bad bitch experience
she's also has her debut book coming out
March March well and I just want to read
a couple of these quotes about you and
just like build you up cuz my him behind
you guys okay but it's Shawna Barbosa
in her strong debut Barbosa delves into
how the nuances of identity are formed
through intersecting struggles she
characterizes identity as mutual
flexible and a means to keep the
memories that shape a person her book is
called Cape Verdean blues writing of her
Cape Verdean upbringing in Boston
Barbosa investigated what it means to be
a woman of color and a cultural other in
barbosa's poems the act of remembering
kids first self-reflection as well as a
political epiphany that was from
Publishers Weekly and then she you've
also been published in Lennie letter and
then my favorites these words feel like
experiences some are personal most are
enlightening but all connect connect on
a higher level a spiritual level by
 pendulum are hell yeah
[Laughter]
coming I'm obsessed with you I'm
obsessed with your work but how the
does one get Kendrick Lamar a
grammy-winning artist to speak so highly
about your dope without just the
obvious things are being go like you
know people like that so your view
bukka's poems yeah it's a collection of
poetry but no I interviewed him maybe
like 2011 and or 12 and then maybe a
couple years after that mmm and then we
just kind of like state and touch and
like just have like this relationship a
lot like art mm-hmm it's called keep
Veridian blues which Cape Verdean is an
island off the coast of Africa that your
family's yes Cape Verde what do I keep
saying Viridian well Cape Verdean uh-huh
is kind of like how you would identify
like Cape Verde oh okay and so your
family's from there year from Boston I'm
from Boston yeah this weekend I found
out a lot about you this week yeah yeah
obviously want to like get to your work
because I want people to hear out dope
it
I have my book yes it's gorgeous by the
way
the photographer his name is Juan Kalin
and I actually found him on Instagram Oh
like I wanted I write a lot about
surveillance in a way so I feel like
these lines were designed because I have
like a bunch of astrology palm so where
can people buy it cuz right now it's
pre-order and we were talking about like
how crazy it is that you're like putting
out a book and like what that experience
is just so many like no one can
say that they've done what you've done
or a select few can and we were talking
about how important it is to have
pre-orders like that's win it yeah
matters because of getting on a
bestseller list
yeah all of that some people order where
can people get it no it's on Amazon so
you can pre-order on Amazon and I think
it's like Barnes &amp;amp; Noble yeah there are
a bunch of links I'm really interested
in did you know that you wanted to write
a book of poems like how did this
actually come about because it's pretty
cool that like the actual oh I wrote it
then I picked this cover that's all cool
but like how do you make it because it
seems like such a dense feel that you
guys have in write poems I wrote about
3000 haikus considered myself Emily
Dickinson and then through an Italian
nailed it that's it into reading poetry
like actually from Instagram like naira
we yeah yeah yeah she like stuff like
her turned me on to the bigger books and
then like I just started getting into it
from Instagram though because I never
thought I would be so when you think
someone's like into poetry you think
about it yeah beatniks Mona Judy
from doubling older sisters yeah yeah
poetry so like you were saying so dense
it and like specific yeah I've always
written poetry I don't think it's
something that I was always aware of
like when I went back my dad's attic and
I'm looking at all of this it's
like all these poems from when like six
years old like I was always writing
stories yeah and they were always dark
they were about monsters and like people
like getting killed and yeah the
song was about windows but they're
important but it is so you and I are on
the exact watching
oh do you think why do you think you
were so up as gay I mean we all
were but like what do you think were you
able to translate like your darker
into an art form
I just feel like it's enemy like there's
just the start no I mean I mean there it
like I'll kind of percent and everyone
has a dark side yeah I mean my
porch is not like super I mean I was
writing about monsters I feel like any
sort of art form is kind of like
harnessing and controlling and sort of
dealing with your demons how did you
like start to translate that and carry
it into like adult life right yeah a lot
of hobbies as kids but this is something
that obviously I stock yes so I have
this why I don't know I don't even know
like let's see I moved to New York from
Boston and I started working at a
magazine and then from this magazine I
started this website called let's Jesse
geez what let's just each easily was
called I don't have any more but I love
everyone know whoever read that but
I used to write like a lot of vignettes
and just flash fiction and stories
mainly about sex but I wrote about a lot
of and that's when I started like
interviewing people and you know the
Kendrick interviews were there it was
just always writing and then when I
moved back to Boston
I took a poetry workshop at Harvard and
like I didn't think that people would
 with my work because I was coming
from the music industry so I feel like
if it wasn't related to like hip-hop or
some cuz lesson let's just see
cheese was still like all about culture
and like that
so honestly I was like I don't think
white people would with my
they weren't into like music white
people love emotional
and they also about taking things from
people of color and like identifying
with it yes I made some please
because we we run out of poem a couple
of weeks ago and so many people were
like or I get that who

about this poem is it's called welcome

poem and it was the first poem I ever
like took this book and I read the poem
in the mirror and I just like I just

and I feel and I never like thought
about this until like right now like I
don't feel like this is about me Wow
