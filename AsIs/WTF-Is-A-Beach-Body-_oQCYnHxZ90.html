 is a Beachbody what's up y'all
summer is finally here and of course
with every approaching summer there's
always these horrible horrendous
magazine headlines that follow women
wherever they go talking about how to
achieve the perfect beach body last time
I checked if you had a body and it was
at the beach preferably under an
umbrella and with a margarita
that's a beach body but of course
according to our messed-up Society it
has to mean something more than that
hi I'm Nala and I don't think I have a
beach body even though I was always
taught in my household to love my body
the way media photoshop's women's bodies
has had an impact on the way that I look
at my body
I'm Kane and I don't think I have a
Beachbody especially in the gay
community like images of like fit men
with like abs and like torsos and like
shoulders and arms like and you look at
yourself and it's like very average and
it feels very unsexy if I had to rate my
view towards my body it would probably
it would be a five when I'm sitting down
like I can feel like a tummy and I'm
like well I have to be I have to have a
flat stomach and I'm probably never
gonna have that and I don't know how to
accept that when I was in my teens I
struggled a lot with my weight and
self-worth my sources of motivation to
lose weight were always in the wrong
places and usually stemmed from a desire
to look good for other people sort of
looking good for my damn self I remember
having a skinny list which was basically
a list of things I told myself I
couldn't do unless I lost weight looking
back on this time in my life it really
makes me sad that I couldn't be
comfortable with who I was and that I
felt mentally restricted from things due
to my size so I wanted to take a fellow
lady and a fellow man because let's be
real men also deal with their fair share
of body insecurities - and I wanted to
challenge them to believe in their
Beachbody I decided to bring in my
lovely fabulous fantastic photographer
friend Christophe a who helped me
through my boudoir photography shoot and
I wanted to set up some type of a photo
therapy session for them at the beach I
finally have a bathing suit
I'm super excited so nervous our photo
shoot is today and it's also our boss's
birthday so we went out for tacos and
birthday cake oh no I am challenging
myself to wear a two-piece that doesn't
have a high-waisted bottom because I
feel like that's a part of my comfort
zone and I'm really taking this
opportunity to not be in my comfort zone
last night I also looked up guys posing
on the beach wait really I did and
that's a bad idea because everyone is
ripped I was nervous at first because I
was shirtless for the first time at the
beach in a long time
and like the poses were like felt weird
at the time when Kane was going he was
just slaying and that kind of boosted my
confidence a little bit and then when it
was over I was like okay your turn and
that's when the nerve started to hit I'm
kind of nervous I'm fine with wearing
the bikini it's taking the pictures and
looking at them afterwards and getting
in my head and critiquing myself do you
like how you're looking ya just feel
like I look mean though like the whole
blanket thing like I gots when I started
to like get in my head a lot more
because it was a prop and I started to
feel like I was like covering myself up
and I wasn't really feeling challenged
and then eventually like I got in touch
with the element like the waves came and
the wind blew and like I like started
rolling in the sand people were saying
like go gnarley' like you got this like
you're slaying so that was like really
encouraging okay i'ma play yes I still
like more connected with my body I guess
and kind of how you feelin good good and
excited and nervous
Oh
even got the water drip with Daniel off
section you know it really I love the
way back the wave is hilarious but kind
of cool I like exude confidence like the
eyes the body I'm really insecure about
my stomach and I realized like how
beautiful my tummy is in this photo I'm
like confident and like I look like I'm
enjoying the beach oh yeah it's like I
don't care I got a beach body let me
show ya yeah yeah exactly
oh yeah do you feel like you have a
beach body now according to these photos
I definitely think I have a beach fun
yeah I went second that I go to the
beach and I'm in my body so yeah I have
a beach body so our six-pack abs and
really toned legs really awesome to look
at at the beach of course I'm not gonna
lie about that but just because someone
doesn't have them doesn't mean that they
should be restricted from being
comfortable and who they are if you're
feeling yourself that should always be
enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
