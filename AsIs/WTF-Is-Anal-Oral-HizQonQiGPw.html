talking about eating ass
technically dictionaries refer to this
is analingus a doctor I spoke to called
it anal oral and casually we can call it
rimming or even tossing salad but
regardless of the terminology the act is
definitely trending how did we get here
and where are we going
my name is Hillary and I have questions
I started with my colleague Mac we're
here with Matt stoop era author of dear
straight people we ate out first tell me
where that came from
it all started with kaya you know my
neck my back my my crack fine
kaya iconic iconic song then Nicki Minaj
she's singing about eating ass here
getting her a C in and I'm like fine cuz
it's on a great Nicki verse we love that
but then it happened on girls Allison
Williams Allison Williams you know Brian
Williams this goddamn daughter had her a
C and I'm girls and that's when I said
enough is enough
and I had to get my thoughts and I had
to write this manifesto the same
cultural moment that allowed match write
his manifesto also opened the door for
me to have many candid conversations
about eating ass so I started at the
beginning what is analingus analingus is
oral sex but for the but it's pleasuring
the anus with the tongue and the lips
the butthole is two inches away from all
the other stuff it's not like these
muscles are separate from these muscles
so pleasure here makes these contract
and pleasure here makes these contract
and our nervous system innervates
erogenous tissue all over it's not just
sex up here but stuff so no like it's
all good it's all good and it is all
connected is what you're saying
yes I kind of feel like any dude that
hasn't like investigated his own
butthole at this point 2015 is kind of
like missing the boat there are untapped
resources in the male butt hole like in
the
the nerve endings in the butt and also
the prostate why would anyone do it if
it didn't feel good
tell me about it um oh you've never been
I've never been I've never been rimmed
and since I'm a rim virgin there's a lot
to learn how do you prepare i sat down
with curly to find out first step
washing haha first step washing yeah
it's definitely you definitely have to
wash you got to make sure you're nice
and clean a lot of people don't know how
to wash their butts let's talk about the
proper way to often if you know that
rimming might be in the menu be thorough
make sure there's nothing that you're
missing soap up your hands get in
between your cheeks and rub your anus
I'd really rub it sotiently get in your
body but you can even get a little bit
just inside just so you make sure that
there's no residue for your partner oh
when they're looking you totally
washable and crack two up to your
tailbone everything this is important
yeah it's important to stuff my neck my
back my my crap hit it all yeah
you're so good at this aren't you I
don't know who's ready to go for it
without a shower that person's real bird
watch I uh I spoke to a gynecologist
earlier about this and she said that's
actually not a good idea medically
because fecal matter in the mouth can
lead to some pretty gross stuff like a
coli and Horace GI situations shower if
you're a hairier male but you identify
as a hairy male I identify as a hairy
male yeah definitely um yeah don't be
afraid to get in there with like a you
know be careful but get in there with it
but like add like a hair trimmer and you
know trim it up a little bit
don't use scissors what setting would
you recommend I in generally go with a
setting of four a four is good for
butthole trimming okay so you get your
ass ready then one even though you might
think of rimming as just tongue on
butthole this is my stunt butt hello
nice to meet you hi you want to think
about where the sensation can be it can
be right in the middle it can be around
the circle because there's a muscle
right under there if it gets really
tight sometimes just from being in
traffic stress at work and rimming can
be a way to relax it so we're licking
all the way around you know
start with hag go down to the shadow go
to the balls and then you know so it's a
part of a blowjob basically can do it
however you want some people don't like
getting kissed after so it may be more
of an ending activity but I've never
heard of somebody creating a rimming
date where it's just like hi hello kiss
kiss rim rim the end is it like vaginal
oral in that its tongue and fingers all
at once
mmm I don't think so no I don't think
that that's a technique that works too
well with the whole you kind of just
tongue what does it taste like um oh I
don't know that that one is better
before it tastes like nothing it smells
like Leena like a little like a body
part it smells like I got dick no no
yeah about a whole area is Lily balls
well that doesn't sound super appealing
so why are people doing this
it can give you a chill it can actually
make your entire body
Bassem it can tickle um it can wake up
your whole body it's it's something
that's something that hits the nervous
system in a way that is different than
anything else feels great feels
fantastic and it's fun like it's just
like a fun activity so would you
recommend yeah like if you're floating
around someone why not do all the things
give a rim job or two and after that
maybe it becomes part of your like
normal routine maybe not maybe not it's
a fun trick to have if you're sleeping
on some wild oh yeah and the buffet of
life it can be chosen so basically
people are eating ask because it feels
good and that's reason enough to dive in
bottoms up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
