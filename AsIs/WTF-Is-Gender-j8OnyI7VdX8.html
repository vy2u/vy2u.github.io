on the streets of LA to see what people
know about the world and genitals and
genitals what is your gender identity um
like what do you mean what do you mean
by that
like like how do you identify like
straight or gay or bisexual gender not
so bronze I'm obviously a male I'm a
girl a Brooke
I identify with female identifies male
how how do you know that you're man um
cuz I have a penis I got a big base
almost between my legs what do you think
makes you feel like a girl um I think I
just like femininity my reproductive
system is of a female I mean it feels
comfortable for me I've always felt like
a woman but like many people we talk to
on the street I've never questioned why
but some angelina's had a more
sophisticated understanding gender in my
mind I don't categorize my thoughts as
like are my thinking pattern as feminine
or masculine what your body and what
your mental mind is are two completely
different things
the best way I've been able to kind of
identify it as as a spectrum and you lie
somewhere on it so what exactly does
that mean I sat down with a few people
to hear about their own personal
experiences of gender I'm here with
Rocco founder of original plumbing a
trans men's magazine and health coach we
don't do a lot of people about what
gender means to them but we didn't
really arrive on an answer so what does
gender mean to you um well I think part
of the reason that we didn't arrive at
an answer is because gender is so
specific and individual gender to me is
what someone is uh just what they
self-identify as like what you feel like
in your head I feel like gender is this
sausage casing like our body is might be
in this gender but what's inside when it
comes out of this casing may not be
expressing the casing gender is kind of
a social construct sells a lot
of clothes and lets people have men's
and women's deodorant when it comes down
to it it's just marketing so let's say
that you guys um that you woke up
tomorrow and you didn't have the same
genitals that you have now like you
switched them
would you still feel like a man I'm
still the same but just with the vagina
instead I guess I would still be a male
I always still feel like a girl yeah I
still be a man yeah that's interesting
though yeah something to think about
right you never really think no one
questions it most people don't have to
question their gender you've been given
a second thought but if you're a person
who's trans or gender non-conforming ie
someone who doesn't feel like they're
male or female then you have to give it
more thought because your brain is
telling you this one thing and your body
is exhibiting something else so what is
transgender transgender is an umbrella
term that basically houses people who
feel that they're experienced gender is
different from the one that was assigned
at Birth and that's not dependent on
medical or hormonal transition gender is
constructed this pink is girl this blue
is boy they should put all these kids in
green and yellow because you don't know
no one knows until I don't know till it
comes out for me personally as a trans
person it was like I felt male and never
felt comfortable female I don't feel
like I'm a girl and I don't feel like
I'm a boy but I feel like I kind of have
everything inside of me you were born as
a male yes I was important if that like
I'm okay yeah it's totally an okay thing
for that to say just because it's
straight from the horse's mouth and yeah
I was born male I identify as female but
if people you know want to see me any
other way that's on them do you think
that you'd be able to tell if someone
was transgender um I think it depends I
can I cannot I think not all the time no
could you tell that I'm trans honestly
no your look Mehldau I am feel okay you
are male but I'm a transgender man are
you
I'm gonna go that what happened to
you although shots did that to you I did
a good job on you bro I think I did a
good job female to male
yeah no way yeah so you can't tell treat
a trans person as you would anyone else
it's not about special needs it's just
like a special set of circumstances
around their needs so I would say like
don't make any assumption
so I know that pronouns in the trans
world are big thing and if I look at
someone and they read a certain gender
like should I be asking every single
person what pronouns I should be using
how does this work what's a vessel
honestly you should go with whichever
one looks like they're trying to portray
vemos if you're unclear of like pronouns
like what pronoun to use either just use
they because it's a gender-neutral
option you can ask them in an intimate
setting if you're unsure like you don't
ask them the group please don't ask in a
group ask compassionately and kind of
ask like it's not that big of a deal
people are gonna up around people's
gender identities their pronouns that
they prefer all of that you're gonna
make mistakes everyone makes mistakes
the biggest thing that you can do is
don't make a big show of your mistake
clean it up quick and be like oops sorry
she and then go on your way it's up to
the non trans person to really be as
kind of polite and open and real as
possible without objectifying their
trans friend because even though you're
like oh this is so hard for me it is
hard for you and it's hard for that
person who's going through that and
they're having that same interaction
with everyone that they're coming across
respect whatever people want to be
called it's much simpler that way and no
one gets their feelings hurt and we're
all happier there are a lot of us who
have never been able to hide we'll
always look like this who are always
notice when they walk in the room they
are educating us and they are the
leaders and in fact it's almost the
spiritual thing I think they're holding
our hands and they're taking us to
another place
