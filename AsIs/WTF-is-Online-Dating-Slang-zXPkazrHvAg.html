attic and dust off a Macbook and say
this is where I met your mom I have
online dating apps I can honestly say
I've never asked anyone out in real life
I'm on online dating sites 24/7 because
I don't want to die alone when someone
says they want someone who's chill what
they basically mean is if you weren't
here right now I'd be playing video
games if you don't want a relationship
that's what you say do you want like a
normal girl who's not crazy
non-judgmental go with the flow they
want to date someone that doesn't give
it about things like I want to do what I
want to do and not get in trouble for it
so I need you to be a chill girl it kind
of sets up this thing where girls feel
that they need to act chill and not you
know getting upset for things that they
should rightfully might be able to be
upset about when I first meet a stranger
I don't want to be like toyed with
mentally where I think the person likes
me but they're just being sarcastic like
that's - I don't just be real if you
define yourself as someone who's
sarcastic you're probably kind of a dick
if I wanted to talk to someone that
would make fun of me and make me feel
lesser I would call my dad only the
people who are the most dramatic are the
ones that say no drama I don't want you
to make my life difficult in brackets as
anymore yeah yeah no drama
and she'll lunch a lot of times I'll
meet someone they'll get it I bet the
craziest ex-girlfriends and I like label
all the people that are drama and I'm
like are I think or are you drama
if someone's profile says no hookups I
probably will just move on to the next
profile I always think it's just kind of
sarcastic if you're on tinder you're
looking to hook up the word hookup what
does it mean exactly cuz it's like every
sex are kissing like are saying we're
never gonna kiss
be different because if you put that you
like coffee and you hike sometimes like
okay every white girl please put you a
sign in your Bible I'm one of those this
cut to the chase a man you try so hard
to seem like a chill cool cool dude that
doesn't want any drama and you just end
up not being interesting Netflix and
chill is a little overused you want a
Hulu and hang do you want a crackle and
cackle do you want a YouTube and lube do
you want a Vimeo and dilly-dally
we got HBO go that one's really popular
you want to HBO go and go go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
