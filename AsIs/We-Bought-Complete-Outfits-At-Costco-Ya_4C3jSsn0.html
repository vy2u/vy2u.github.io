Costco Costco is a wholesaler I'm not
technically work some reasons a Costco
Wholesale recently we bought some Amazon
suits today we're gonna buy some Costco
clothing pasta boiling like a very
Seattle thing and it's a lot of sweaters
it's a lot of fleece lots of camping
appropriate attire so we're gonna try to
buy as much of a complete outfit from
Costco as possible
I think I'm gonna walk out looking like
a lesbian ready for camera looks like
what I'm expecting
and I'm not mad about it I'm expecting
to look like a dad in her life could
even get glasses and pizza what is that
yeah ping pong $500 for a ping pong
table
we found the clothes I immediately
regret this you're like I'm just gonna
dress like Steven Seagal instead the way
to go here is gonna be to not dress like
you normally dress yeah I know
why are you telling me that you want our
that I don't know I don't know why this
is new information thank you
let me get science pants I want this why
is it only an extra-large okay how large
is extra-large Oh God thank you
drama goddamnit some ladies try just get
it I should probably get a real shirt
alright just go with it oh yeah
traditional fit tradition fit you want
Costco shoes these are Costco shoes
squish me they say it's like Jenga no
whoa we got Pocky it's a lot of talking
yeah that's Costco the hot dog is like
your reward for going to Costco you
survivors here's a hot dog here we go
Costco
we've had hot dogs and now we're ready
to try in our clubs all right yeah they
are really good at recycling in Costco
so our clothes came in a vodka box all
right so these are my Skechers classic
Costco mom shoes it feels
moisture-wicking Oh for like sweat yeah
I got this classic not Iike gray shirt
it's like a t-shirt on the outside and a
dress shirt only on the sleeve
versatility is really what we're after
yeah I got some classic adidas track
pants which are actually pretty cool and
then this vest that you helped me picked
out which is like a safari lesbian vest
utility there's lots of pockets inside
look at all labeled for this stuff how
much stuff we can fit the men's clothing
there are a lot fewer options so I kind
of went with what I thought would yield
a couple different combinations got this
shirt I got some Calvin Klein oh boy but
in case that doesn't work I got some
science pants we've got some cargo
action on these and some zip off shorts
you really have like three bottom
options here that's a secure belt right
there you're like impossible the
mannequin is it's just tubes it looks
like one of those the car lot where
there's a fan in the bottom and then
yeah so I actually went with a woman's
jogging sweater in the extra-large which
actually fits me pretty stupendously a
lady's full zip folds it mom oh that's
uh that's that
you look exceedingly normal actually
really well not normal very comfortable
you look like you work at Microsoft yeah
look at all these pockets one two
thirteen there's also a secret money one
walk back we're here fourteen try and
Rob me you look like you're gonna do
some gardening do I look like we're
about to go on Safari
these pants are pretty fly I think kids
wear stuff like this now don't the
adidas stripes from back so this is a
ladies yeah yeah I got thumb holes there
right there my wrist will never get cold
oh good god I love how baggy the sleeves
are you know this is shirts literally
than my dad wears yeah mine too
Oh God the pants are a true
disappointment I think I might have to
try my other pants look like I'm about
to give it TEDx talk everyone like that
that's why I like this I think I came to
work just like this no one would say
anything you look like you're in charge
of the farmers market but also I always
have snacks in my pocket I'm really
happy with myself I feel like I'm 12
years old right now wearing my dad's
shirt because I suddenly had to go to
something fancy this one pretty well I'm
very pleased with myself I'm gonna wear
this for the rest of the day I'm not
gonna wear this for the rest of the day
but I had fun definitely like designed
for ladies Costco you need clothes you
got it also a whole pizza a lot of
toilet paper and corn on the cob a TV
and engagement ring and a new iPad that
was your mostly your fault no now that
Nikki's gone I can try on the thing that
I was really excited for
science pants and I think that I sized
them generously enough that I'll just be
able to slip them on over my normal
everyday pants boom we're ready to do
some exploring you know outdoor
dinosaurs get some fossils and stuff but
then I'm wearing pants underneath which
doesn't really make sense though but you
can maybe use something like that yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
