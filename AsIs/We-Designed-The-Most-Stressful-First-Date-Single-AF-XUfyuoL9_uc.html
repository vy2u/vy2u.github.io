me sorry about that there was it trying
to find common ground all while trying
to appear naturally charming and cool as
you're saying oh I don't ever want to
feel this way on a first date again
which is why we've designed the most
stressful date ever attempted on camera
a blind date in an escape room with her
father I'm taking a weed edible without
telling anyone and being forced to
follow every word of advice from a
freewheeling movie star get hammered on
the first date you may have to question
your own sexuality money works too I can
survive this
I'll never have a reason to be stressed
out on the first date again this is the
world's most stressful day
to help me on my journey I've recruited
the help of a man who doesn't know the
meaning of stress ash Williams himself
mr. Bruce Campbell I get stressed out on
dates so what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying to design intentionally the most
stressful date of all time you know
about escape rooms that's a real thing
so what they do is they put you in you
have to solve a series of like puzzles
you're bad and I'm terrible at it
why would you pick something that was
obviously distressed because my hope is
that if I can get through something
stressful then I won't be stressed out
ever again can I give you a quick riddle
yeah
please you're in a room okay there's no
doors no windows just a mirror and a
skeleton how to get out and you I just
throw the the skeleton at the mirror you
look in the mirror you see what you saw
you take the saw you cut the skeleton in
half two halves make a whole you get out
through the hole I'm going to die in
this escape room okay we here in The
Alchemist at escape from LA this game is
designed for ten people I think it's
impossible
what about blind dates yeah those are
pretty awesome I to me the idea of it is
stressful I get stressed out about
everything that's because you're caring
too much I care - what is care in dating
were Cara's word is worry failure what
is failure no dates right time to meet
Heather so when you first meet someone I
never know what to do like I think you
do like a gunslinger approach hit it get
some impact in the knees up for the
little ice cream on top
hi going another
Heather Zach's nice too

hahaha that's stupid have you ever done
an escape room before yeah I've done a
couple oh really
you just hit it with one other person

of friends so have you done it no never
um I hate puzzles okay I guess we should
just do it right
you excited okay yes yes okay time start
now yes please after you
greetings adventurers listen to me you
must stop this madam just one chance
once I'm in the heat of the moment
solving the puzzle should be my primary
objective no no hooking up with that
woman as your primary object always okay
do not get distracted by the game even
though you need to focus on the game in
order to win and impress her oh it's
like a black lace I look for like semen
blood and feces a hand on the chin
always works and that's too much with
the eyebrows oh sorry okay yes sorry

validate okay
parking shouldn't I go to yeah yeah
don't be so much we should go go how do
you just knock away the stress and just
kind of be yourself and have fun on a
date by knowing that ultimately there's
someone for everybody out there even
idiots I mean even if you fail there's
still somebody on this planet who will
look at you and go
that guy's to me if you're stressed out
on the first date it's probably because
it's you're in your head people are
gonna like you they're not gonna like
you there's nothing you can do about
that
you know all said and done that was not
the worst date I've ever been on
I don't even know why I'm here this was
fun though I would do this again with
more people and without a dad and not on
a date I am so hungry guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
