what came up I'm not trying to go around
the office looking like Stephen King's
it my parents are pretty traditional
like I'd have my leg sprawled out on the
couch and my mom would be like sit
properly you're a girl the politeness is
a strong gene in my family
be modest and also for overly
conservative dressers but that is kind
of our style and my mom cared about
manners my sister and I both took
cotillion if I got a grade in that class
I would have gotten enough politeness
and being thoughtful and kindness
timeless I actually heard about this
complete book of etiquette from the
1950s and I decided to order it read it
and see what wisdom I could soak up Wow
things like that and pop your manuals
and the other things will make it feel
more popular there's a lot of really
weird stuff in here there are pages on
how to sit in a chair please tell me I
don't have to wear Rouge all over my
face because you're gonna have to I
actually did my makeup really well today
kind of excited to see what's in store
so we're going to be following
nineteen-fifties etiquette rules for the
day these grooming habits form the basis
of a good appearance willing to pay big
into each and every one of them it will
make you more confident and at ease in
any situation after the girdle portion
Kurtis and then you hook these things it
squeezing into this thing and it didn't
fit at all like this is the size of my
thigh it just wouldn't go through this
is a freaking death trap Here I am at
work in the girdle it was taco day so
this is a struggle I feel like it's
squishy and my organs it looks like
there's a spine on my stomach
especially with like the thin materials
everyone wears these days you would see
all the metal in the front of the dress
so far so good it's not that tight I can
still breathe I feel like this is just
gonna moderate my meeting the girdles
really riding up my ass as well when
after I took it off I still felt like my
stomach was hurting that I couldn't
catch my breath for a little while in
fact we wear Spanx all the time or fact
that we wear heels like all those things
kind of hurt you do them so I'm glad
nothing baby with nothing rude that go
okay time to use the Rouge which is just
your basic blush Amy Vanderbilt books
basically is like Kim Kardashian let's
go for it
you're just applied to her eyelid
towards the temples on the vertical
planes of the nose bridge chin and
earlobes seriously
contouring with Rouge everyone looks
lovely they're just it's so pink it's
pretty pink and they going overboard
already I'm not gonna third I followed
what she said but this is bad the
pinkest my face will ever be but I'm
kind of digging it like it's it's
adorable
I definitely felt with Bruce maybe I do
like it I would have never put right up
here only looks bad walking like a lady
we're doing all the cloud from top to
toe they feel better and look best
I get to wear tights all day wear these
always have in the winter
and then I say fifties they have to wear
these at all times
in the 1950s women's legs had to be
perfect all the time and I think they
solve that by wearing stock my legs do
look better but I've never put on a pair
of stockings are paying us that I
haven't immediately ruined so we'll see
how long they last at work in the tights
it's pretty standard I think that's one
of the things on this list that's most
relevant to today that I wasn't wearing
stockings was because I was already
wearing leggings on a daily basis
because I mean I also wonder if in the
1950s if you wear sock because you don't
have to shave your legs I can see that I
get that but what I'm only wrong razor
put him down that I couldn't begin to
tell you all of them so a lady never
crosses her legs I never knew what
crossing legs was masculine prefer God
I'm not suppose for sitting crisscross
so unladylike the back of your leg
should actually come in contact with the
chair gently into the chair maintain me
be careful exhausted it's kind of like
parallel parking but for your button the
couch is a tricky Beast not because
there's a dog on it but because it's
very comfortable so when you sit on it
can be bad don't relax I'm the kind of
person who prefers to lean back and I
have my figure two here which I know is
kind of gross this might be a good thing
to remember in company with other people
elbows on the table are permissible
between courses but not when one while
one is eating so I need to get these
elbows off the minister town and eat my
food and as possible and simply edge
my mom was saying elbows were absolutely
never allowed on the table for that but
you can put them back on the table in
middle pocket when everyone's not in D
which i think is interesting I always
eat with my elbows off the table anyway
so it wasn't that big a deal in the
orange and the way that you would be the
crepe fruit was interesting it was kind
of hard also a little bit time-consuming
to cut it all up in the morning oh yeah
and I never eat chicken or anything
messy so that was all good corn on the
cob did they have these in the 1950s
because these are great and you never
butter the whole year at once which is
something I definitely do and I think
everyone in this world does that but
very whiny zama lady
was that really ladylike was that really
something that you imagined in 1950s
proper etiquette women do you know she
would just wouldn't eat porn but I got
any porno
I'll call that poise or charm if you
will if it make you more attractive to
the people around you experiencing 1950
Connecticut really just shows me how far
women have come I feel like all these
etiquette rules should really just be
suggestions they wanted women to portray
themselves in a very elegant manner like
look beautiful but at the same time
don't seem too eager to talk to men but
nowadays it's kind of the exact opposite
women are trying to be more expressive
and be themselves I asked my mom about
my ticket things that her mother
attended to do and she said that she
wore lipstick all the time even in
pajamas all the kids had to be at the
door waiting for my grandfather to come
home from work closing your legs that at
the edge of your seat just so you don't
seem like I don't know promiscuous or
like a little too out there
whereas politeness is universal and
everyone should try to be polite and
that's something that should be passed
down throughout the generations I think
I'll be happy in 50 years when more
formality things have disappeared when
it comes to treating others we still
treat them with the same respect and
kindness in fact more respect to express
themselves now than they did back in
that time rouging your face and wearing
panty hose 24/7 or eating an orange the
way you would eat a grapefruit not the
world if you don't hang on to it for the
next 50 years being conscious of how you
make other people feel is probably the
most important etiquette manners that I
hope to hold on to if there was one rule
from the 1950s that we should still
follow today it's to always moisturize
there's nobody like fashion hands
especially the boys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
