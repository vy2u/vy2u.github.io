I've already read magazines anymore
unless I'm on an aeroplane I used to
read Seventeen magazine and I do
remember taking a lot of advice for that
like learning has to kiss your hand
I do like reading the advice parts not
like this is change my life and then I
never do the things that it tells me to
do I really don't trust health magazines
I know they have to fill an issue every
couple weeks Oh every month so yeah
they're gonna bend the truth a little
bit on the outside it looks super
healthy but I really don't exercise so
I'm really trying to be all-around more
healthy and more body conscious I'm
hoping that these workouts are gonna be
the kind that you can do in your bedroom
because honestly I just need a hook
quick workout afterwards what I'd ID
like together this is a meal that I am
NOT terrified to cook so I'm doing this
challenge with my sister thank God
because we can motivate each other
hopefully
so I guess I'm going to drink mushroom
so it's to not get cold
I am really curious to see if it works
so I'll give it my best try all right so
this is how we're gonna drink all
mushrooms every day you can put it in
hot water or in a smoothie I'm medical
fee cuz I'm always tired just bill can
you live in my hand before I'm getting
in the cup thank you put this into some
 it's okay it doesn't appear to
be mixing in very well maybe I should
have put the powder in first the first
time I'm trying it with just water I
really enjoy my morning coffee I don't
want it to taste disgusting just tastes
like water
I'm pretty sure this is better off in a
suit oh that's good I mean it doesn't
taste amazing ya know even though it
looks disgusting it smells like soup
there's a slight hint of mushrooms
phrasing drinking soul and broth it
smelled them looked a lot scarier than
it actually was
we're gonna make cloud eggs our own and
we're gonna make pizza beer together
tonight the recipe calls for chard but
what the is this
so I need a bag is like what yeah
honey's look very well little that
they've been in a fire this is the best
you're gonna do okay
now we think if you tell you that green
peppers
the red peppers they be been blessed you
haven't explained with us father
presentation we did it out of all the
recipes I think the one that's seen the
hardest to make was the oat porn with
dragon fruit I went to the grocery store
and I couldn't find half of the things
that they were talking about
where'd the grocery store do you find
dragon fruit I'm gonna try to make my
own version of it I got some granola for
the oats and some unsweetened vanilla so
I think I really just made a glorified
cereal I just tried to make it look
really pretty I think I'm supposed to
add a cinnamon to it so that's the final
touch
okay now that made it look ugly we're
cookin
we're also drinking wine we can't cook
and we need something to make it better
I'm adding probably way too much cheese
it's just a core fine sandwich right and
we have to fold it in half but right now
look how many ingredients there are just
gonna put it on the tortilla on top
double dinner this is just a quesadilla
I could make it in five seconds but
because it was like something that we
had to follow directions on it just felt
harder than actually was you know God
blip-it the fire alarms gonna go I know
from less cheese honey nothing quite
gets run with it actually not bad Oh
Zillman an upset to go to ironically
after 1t is she feel quite unwell this
boiling it could be allergies to the
immigrant vegan doesn't mix in the
minister to the health I mean you don't
know
alright so we're gonna try to work out
what I think is each exercise with 50
minute rest between 52nd rest fifty
really at rest
it's really easy to have one and I just
an elephant growing up okay
well that was actually quite hot yeah
after doing the whole thing I just say I
live upstairs though so I'm just I can't
do it at home yeah find the gym yeah
that's true at the park I don't think
it's something I would do like as my
only workout I won't say I half-assed it
because I did do a workout but there
were just certain things that I didn't
understand how to do some of them felt
like stretches it was weird
I also me and Becky did the workout I've
actually gained some kind of willpower
to work out actually for a run at
lunchtime today they can work out I
liked it the first time so I'm danced it
again she's jumping really high so let's
see okay yep in general I really do like
this workout it's like a quick semi easy
way to get a workout in I also like that
it's a real personal trainer who is
being interviewed I feel like I've seen
a lot of workouts and magazines and they
don't really say who made them up is
definitely no like pictures of them so
I'm going to try to make the cloud eggs
grate some parmesan got my little mini
oven going separate two eggs I don't
know what that means
I think you just kind of posted along
until your house is white I broke four
yolk but at least it's not in here but
them is born the yoga ready broke I
don't have any perfect paper mr. Whitman
for five minutes
person lookin a long time I'm just gonna
whisk the egg whites but it's hard to
whisk them with the yolk there this
person has a real kitchen with things do
piece even if it's taste amazing it's
not worth all the whipping so I'm gonna
take the yolk out of the bowl somehow I
did it there's a little bit of yolk left
in this unfortunately fine it's just a
bit oh no drip down lon anyway sorted
it's telling me that I'm just gonna put
the egg white on this thing
Wow look at this i overcooked them oh
look it's gonna be lies so what if my
cloud eggs just kind of looks like death
anymore saddens me oh good it's dripping
everywhere I would say there's not much
seasoning in this this I want myself so
I got blue yolk on this freaking egg
thing trying to keep it from sliding up
I bought the child I made a cloud egg
I'm really proud of myself
this I don't know what that is me okay
guys don't worry the chives are coming
cool honestly I would rather just eat
greens and boil an egg I wish it tasted
like more gourmet it feels like it could
be a scramble or just fried egg it
tastes better than it looks place it so
much it's just a bit bland even with the
parmesan is a little bland okay the more
I have of this actually really liked it
so I'm gonna have the mushroom tea with
just hot water this time I have even got
two cups one with the hot water not a
microwave to put this in first so that
the water goes on top is definitely
mixed in better it's like a mixture of
black coffee somehow and soup I don't
love it so just coming from a full day
of work and now I'm going to exercise in
my room and that feels unusual but I
actually quite appreciate that I'd have
to leave my house also I warned my
downstairs neighbor that would be out
so today was my third day working out
there's still things that I just don't
feel comfortable with and it's just kind
of hard to let go from a picture
sometimes you need to see the person
actually getting into position and doing
things so at this point I'm just having
fun with this mushroom thing I mix it
with my wine today it's kind of mixing
really weirdly well the week is up I
survived it actually wasn't as bad as I
thought it would be the first day I was
really not feeling it I didn't really
understand a lot of the workouts going
on I just kind of tried to make things
my own I did like to work out I just
find it really hard to work out my own
terms I have to have an instructor
yelling at me I'm definitely gonna do
the workout again that's actually a
great easy quick thing to do like
straight out of work some of the food
was just crazy I didn't know how to make
the egg thing recipes were the worst
part of the whole thing
and not just cuz I can't cook like I'm
well-aware I'm terrible at cooking I
just feel like there are better recipes
that look prettier and that easier to
make it seems kind of warm and
comforting in a weird way I quite liked
it I feel like I was getting sick at one
point I didn't get worse but I don't
know if that was the team in general
just pick wisely your health magazine
tips so as you may have noticed boldly
is now as its but don't worry you'll
still get all the awesome continues to
but just even more new great stuff click
