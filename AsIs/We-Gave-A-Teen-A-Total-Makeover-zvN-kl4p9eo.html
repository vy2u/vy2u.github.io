and transitioning from a teen to an
adult can be awkward as hell I mean just
look at me oh my god I hate myself I was
missing a tooth
so I've assembled a team of life experts
on a mission to help T's discover that
extra bit of confidence if they blossom
into adults we sent out a casting call
for teens looking to improve some
aspects of their lives that's how we
found Roman I really do see a lot of
room for improvement on myself I obsess
over my hobbies I fish and I hike and
that's pretty much all that I can relate
to oh my God he's so cute and he's so
eloquent walking around campus I get a
bunch of weird looks maybe it's the way
I smell maybe it's the way that I dress
maybe it's just me lacking confidence
it'd be nice to have long lasting
relationships where people aren't
getting bored he's really self-aware the
fact that he's looking for help and
knows what he wants out with like that's
so awesome especially at this point in
my life where I'm transitioning from
being someone living in my parents home
to living on my own very soon here and I
need to be able to function and be my
own individual person well Ryan wasn't
built in a day
and normal Romans confidence be but
without further ado let's meet Roman hi
I'm Chloe
all right so I'm Slade glad you're here
I just have a couple questions for you
firstly why did you reach out to us my
mom tagged me in a post and just letting
me know about this well I'm one of eight
all my older siblings they've already
kind of got their life together you know
they just kind of have this confidence I
don't really see in myself and so it's
you know I can felt this was important
so when did you first start for these
health conscious about these things so
for me it was like my sophomore in high
school I kind of found myself
identifying with like a much smaller
group of people people who like really
appreciate the outdoors there are a much
larger group of people that I don't
identify with at all if I can't really
socialize with specifically what do you
want to improve for the most part just
being able to feel like I have the
confidence myself to get up every
morning to go to school not feel like
I'm constantly being judged part of
having like that that bigger family I
you know like a lot of the hand-me-down
clothes I never really cared about what
I was wearing before
but I mean now it's like okay well now
it's starting to like affect me
personally so I definitely need to
change that well I think I have the
perfect TV so what you're ready to get
started oh yeah all right let's go so to
me it seems like Roman could use help in
three main areas physical self care such
as hygiene and skin care fashion and
self-confidence
so let's meet the team Lindsay works on
as is and loves all things skincare
she's going to create a hygiene and
skincare regime the Roman can easily
incorporate into his day to day Jazmin
also works on noses and is our resident
style icon she can dress literally
anyone so I'm confident she can overhaul
Romans hand-me-down style Matt Dempsey
is a psychotherapist he's gonna give
Roman an intro to therapy and some
confidence-building tips to take away
with him
first up skincare nice to meet you I'm
Lindsay explain to me what you do for
your skincare routine I'll shower when I
get up that's about it I mean if I plan
on being out in the Sun no lot no I
might put sunscreen on yes sunscreen is
key there's some other things that you
probably should be doing so what's your
skin type it will get dry sometimes on
my face would be like kind of oily when
I get it all morning that we call my
friends combination skin what do you use
for moisturizer now I don't use you
don't use moisturizer Wow you're gonna
start why do I need to use moisturizer
moisturizer is very important because
when you wash your face you're stripping
it of all your natural oils a lot of the
times when your face is really dry your
skin will over produce oils and that's
what usually causes acne and breakouts I
just want to talk you through some
things that I think are gonna be awesome
and very easy for you so since you
already have a really fast skincare
routine right I don't want to add too
much to your plate I got this cool
three-in-one so you use it for day/night
and it can be a face mask have you ever
used a face mask no no our wonderful
time spent the thing that this does not
have is SPF so if you do use it in the
morning you need to add in SPF
this SPF is specifically for your face
so it doesn't clog pores then if you
don't want to like carry this around you
know when you go camping hiking all you
really need is a moisturizer that has
sunscreen alright so for face wash for
cleanser what do you use typically when
I take a shower let's kind of use some
body wash your face is much more
sensitive this face wash is an oil free
fragrance free so it's just super gentle
so what kind of body wash you use in the
shower yeah I don't remember I know
whatever whatever my mom left you did
say that your skin runs more dry and
your Sun a lot this will definitely help
but retain moisture more than a normal
body wash I honestly think that once you
get into this routine you're gonna love
it alright that's about it you have any
questions know how they think oh there
you go good yeah blending things oh yeah
hey wait for what's next let's do it
Eileen thank you next up fashion
hi I'm jasmine nice to meet you too
so today we're at the Beverly Center and
we're going to be shopping for you talk
to me about your style already and the
clothes that you wear okay a lot of the
clothes I wear them they're all like
hand-me-downs for my my older brothers
okay I think the big point of today as I
want to make sure that we try to figure
out what your personal style is and get
some pieces that you're super
comfortable with and confident in and
also that you can just wear whenever
like in everyday look I'm ready are you
ready oh yeah okay let's go chefs do
okay I want to try you with skinny jeans
are you cool with that
yeah let's do it there was slight
hesitation that's okay hold on to those
okay how do you feel about this I don't
feel that how do you feel about the red
really why it's kind of vibrant the red
it looks good on you got a lot of stuff
how are you feeling so far I mean it's
it all new to me I'm looking forward to
seeing what this is gonna end up looking
like we're gonna randomly try these
pants I just want to see you take this
leap okay
okay you tried on a lot and I picked out
a lot but I think we have the outfit I'm
excited hey how'd it go really well yeah
fantastic
yes arepa was nice take your white do it
this way time for the final piece of the
puzzle self-confidence man Roman hey
Roman nice you too Toby what you think
about when you think about therapy I
think it's really somewhere I don't like
to go and kind of talk about your
feelings or emotions being a guy like
it's kind of just natural to not want to
have to share those things we can have a
chance to just kind of like ease into it
a little bit and it can be beneficial
because we just get more comfortable
with it and then it lets us lead our
lives a little bit more the way that we
want to it's just tell me a little bit
about some of the things that we're
hoping to get from therapy well I mean
maybe like focusing like on being
comfortable or confident myself
specially like with you know like social
interaction what's the first thing you
do when you go into a party I guess
looking for other people I would know
like I'll try to go and talk to other
people we're at a party I'm like just
like hanging out there okay maybe that's
our conversation guys I don't even know
what to do anyway so there is something
oh man hey man how's it going hey what's
fun I just right now just start with the
most basic stuff small talk can kind of
be lame but at least it just gives you
something to start with hey what's going
on who do you know here right okay it's
like terrible conversations but it just
gives you in 10 if things are really
kind of suck you can say like a small
talk and just kind of make a joke of it
do you tend to be the kind of person
that just likes to interact with just
kind of a few people yeah exactly you
know what don't beat yourself up over
that it's okay to be a little bit more
introverted too okay and have those kind
of meaningful connections dad said it's
also cool to experiment a little bit
kind of push beyond some of your comfort
zones and as long as you're just kind of
giving it a shot then cool so obviously
this is just kind of like a little bit
of a taster you know of what therapy can
be like in order for it to actually be
able to have kind of more of an impact
you have to make it a practice what did
you think therapy was gonna be like I
thought was me more of like it let me
just explain to you how my life sucks
and kind of walk away from it feeling
worse what was it like just to have this
this little bit yeah I mean I think it
helped out a lot I mean just being able
to realize I'm okay with who I am
I should be taking pride in that all
right well it's really great meeting you
and I look forward to how everything
goes thank you awesome you got it all
right so you've been through all the
stages now you've talked to jazz up out
of fashion you've put some Lindsay about
skincare and you've talked to Matt about
self-confidence and that's a lot but are
you ready to put it all together I don't
think so yeah let's get you ready for
your reveal game off all right Roman is
behind this curtain he is ready to go
are you excited to see him I'm so
excited
get ready Roman and I love it because
it's like trendy but it's still casual
also yeah we got em all in there a
little bit a little bit fashionable camo
yes all right I'm not you want to see
yourself I do damn I look good I can't
believe how confident you sound it's
miles apart from where you were thank
you it's great yeah I definitely feel it
have you ever worn a form-fitting shirt
before no I've never this is something
totally new to me I mean it feels
incredible and I look great in it thank
you so much for helping me out
throughout this whole process I mean
it's been a really big help in your new
shoes your new perspective so today I
get to go and show some my friends new
look they're looking forward to it kind
of nervous about what they're gonna
think of it because it's so different
but I like those shoes
so does this new look make me look more
confident yeah you don't look like a
beach bum anymore you know I feel really
good about how this whole thing turned
out being able to present myself
properly knowing how to feel about
certain situations a huge part of this
has just been being able to interact
with the people that I have been a lot
of them have a lot of very empowering
things to share with me I definitely see
this as being a new life
myself it's not just gonna be some quick
little thing but from this point on you
know continuing to be myself I feel good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
