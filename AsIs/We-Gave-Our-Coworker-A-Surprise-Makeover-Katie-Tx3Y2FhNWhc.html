thoughts about life I like my hair the
way it is my face is face and I put
makeup on it it's fine enough I hope I
haven't gotten myself in over my head
ready yeah let's go my god hey guys I'm
jasmine and my name is curly and we're
known for being a little overdressed
when we come to work every day but
really we just love fashion we weren't
always on trend but we were really good
at expressing ourselves so we sent out
an email asking our co-workers who would
be interested in enhancing their look
and after an overwhelming response we
decided on our co-worker Katy the blonde
Katy is a powerhouse woman who has been
involved in some of the most successful
BuzzFeed projects like the try guys
basically she's about that bitch Katy
describes her style as casual
professional and she isn't really sure
how to work with what her mama gave her
baby style right now I feel like is
slightly erratic she dresses this
totally business casual there's some
times he dresses like it's a Saturday
yeah Florida mom no she's far for I know
she's from Florida I feel like she could
be at a country club I feel like he's
still figuring out how she wants to be
in her late 20s
yeah so the thing is Katy has no idea
that we've picked her to get a
head-to-toe transformation so we're
gonna go find her and surprise her come
on distractions at work really so we
turn to you oh no I'm lunch in my teeth
no mixing how are you Oh like this curly
and jazz are awesome they're like my
heroes let's go come okay oh it's just a
backpack like I'm the middle toddler
okay we'll take you well go get your
purse Katie we are so excited you are
here hey how are you feeling about
everything very nervous but excited we
think you are such a powerful person and
you're such a boss and you like work
your ass off you already are a really
beautiful girl and we were just like
yeah let's just enhance it like we have
all the ingredients in the kitchen let's
just get to cook in Kenny how would you
describe your personal style as your
professional because I really it means a
lot to me to be able to be at work and
be taken seriously because I have to be
on set you know often with people I
don't know often with a lot of dudes and
I need to have people be able to take me
seriously right away generally my off
hour is a pretty enthusiastic and fun
person yeah
so it balanced that with being able to
be taken seriously so through this
experience what do you want to work on I
want to work on walking out the door and
being 100% confident when I was in
middle school I had scoliosis which
meant that I had to endure bracing both
at night and during the daytime and that
was difficult in middle school because I
didn't want to stand out because of my
experience when I was younger I gave up
on trying to command attention through
the
way I looked so the big thing we want
you to remember in this whole entire
process is that we are just trying to
uplift you the true essence of you
we are not wanting you to become anybody
else we just want you to be the most
confident the most enhanced version of
yourself and then we will just run from
there okay thank you so much guys thank
you work that is I'm so excited okay so
we're on our way to Katie's house and
I'm driving don't judge me for my messy
car don't judge you you've been judging
me all day are you excited I'm so
excited
welcome to my bedroom so cute it's gonna
be great
let's go over and talk about some of
your clothes that you feel the most
confident in this is one well I like
that thank you
I I feel great in this because it's same
color as my eyes but really it brings
them out yeah and also it's a little
shapeless down here so I'm also worried
too much by like eat a heavy meal or
something hides it and I like that it
adds some life to you - yeah you still
look like very tall thank you this is
another one I want to see it this is
comfortable for me okay I feel like I
look really long normally I have boots
on and like maybe like a necklace piece
to kind of like dress it up but like
this is comfortable can I can we see
what it looks like typing oh god this
took you from like one to the next
really yes this like elongated you so
much because we were just like white
yeah black I'm seeing it I'm starting to
see I a mine that's good I can see like
all your suggestions I'm like oh yeah
that probably would improve this let's
try on one more outfit okay
so I might wear this to get like lunch
on the weekend or like around the house
the first thing that I notice relative
the shirt is kind of you like drowning
yeah that wonderful it got a handful of
fabric right here and will say I don't
feel like sexy in this okay I just feel
comfortable in it alright so I think we
have a good little sample of what you
like we know you like shorts we know you
buy your shirts a little too big we also
know that you wouldn't mind feeling just
a little bit more sexy in general I've
had things drilled in my head about what
looks good and looks bad and I they've
aged with me so I don't know whether
they're true or not but I've lived with
them for 28 years and so it kind of
doesn't matter in my head whether
they're true or not because they are
here I think we have a lot here and I
think we need to go shopping
yep let's do it thank you guys so
excited okay get out of my nose right
yeah so we're at the mall looking for
clothes we're excited to get this going
for Katy it's early in the morning we're
doing our thing
that's not even petite we just finished
up your tired
curly and I picked up stuff that we were
like oh my gosh this is what we would
wear but like Kati would not wear them
and that's not the point of this is to
placate iam are close were they anyways
we really wanted to highlight that Katie
is 28 years old and young but we didn't
want to get too young to where it looked
like she was like trying to be a team
yeah so we kept on going back and forth
and back and forth so hopefully we
landed on something she actually likes
tomorrow's the day yeah so it's the
night for my big day I'm gonna starting
to have thoughts about like you know I
kind of like my hair the way it is even
though I don't really know what to do
with it and I kind of like my clothes
you know they're comfortable and me and
I hope I haven't gotten myself in over
my head I know doesn't clearly gonna
take care of me they're so amazing and
positive and great and I just hope I can
live up to it are you feeling I'm
feeling excited feeling ready yes we're
excited for you we can have some really
good looks David's here to do your hair
I'm at least here to do your makeup
we're gonna build you up we're gonna
enhance you so let's go get your hair
done let's do it come on hey okay
awesome
come on your hair we're doing come on
come on my name is David dang I my
celebrity hairstylist so Katie and I
have known each other for probably two
years she had nothing done to her hair
ever so there's my little project I
think what we're gonna do is we're gonna
give you some weight off your shoulders
we're gonna lighten things up a little
bit for you both inward and outward so
that you take a look at yourself in a
different filter Katie LeBlanc
you're about to be Katie let's chic
as long as I have known Katie we've had
intimate talks about outward beauty
inward beauty a lot of the things that
we talked about were lacking
self-confidence usually someone like
that is yearning for transformation
today what we're gonna be doing is we're
gonna blonde the out of her we're
gonna give her a lot more dimension and
it's gonna elevate her entire overall
experience as a woman how are you
feeling I'm feeling great
this feels awesome I'm super excited I
haven't seen it but I trust you it seems
like you're a little bit more relaxed
cresting the process I think we need to
find out what's next in your
transformation me too okay okay that's
right okay my name is Emily and I'm a
beauty class facilitator for Sephora
University what I really love to do is
teach women and men how to get perfect
applications but very simply and easily
just enhancing their own beauty and
that's what I really want to teach Katy
about today how are you feeling excited
very excited yes especially for this
part I feel like I know nothing about
makeup well I am here to teach you all
the things and maybe play around in some
stuff that you're not used to today what
we're gonna do with Katy ad glam it up a
little bit she's very comfortable doing
her eyeliner and her mascara and she has
a very minimalistic approach to makeup
which I actually find really beautiful
and I love that but I really want her to
understand her face shape and her eye
shape so that she can really play around
with colors and kind of just branch out
of the norm of what she's used to
right girl one last little finishing
touch is a little lipstick right now
again I'm obsessed with your eyes so I
am keeping it the main focal point so
I'm doing a very nude very like dusty
rose type color and now that we've got
this face all done let's go on and put
the finishing touches on the rest of
your look I can't wait alright this go
okay
so Katie's done yep
are you ready to see her I'm kind of
scared I'm excited and nervous but I'm
she's beautiful she's gonna be great
yeah for this year I'm nervous for what
she thinks but I'm excited for what I
think yeah thin all right Katie are you
ready I'm ready
come out
oh my god no it's okay I look about good
oh my god how do you feel I'm not used
to seeing myself like that I'm not used
to feeling like I deserve this kind of
attention or command this kind of
attention I'm not used to it I know we
talked about before how you were worried
because you have a short torso and
because you were worried about
high-waisted things but the thing that
we really wanted to celebrate here where
you're extremely long beautiful legs
this makes your legs look like they're
18 feet long yeah
Kip please like I feel like I'm pulling
them off you know I never thought I
could or would this was kind of your
opportunity to try something that you
wouldn't necessarily pick up as well I
just can't believe that like I basically
just started with giving you guys a list
of my insecurities and then this is
where we ended up you look like you but
just so enhanced I guess that's what's
making me emotional is because I didn't
think there was an easy solution I'm
honored to have been your passion
project yay I am Here I am dressed and
I'm ready to see what my co-workers
thing jaw-dropping amazing like I feel
like I'm looking at a celebrity oh my
