day oh my god are you ready to see her
hi I'm Madison and I'm here at BuzzFeed
to give my mom a badass makeover I've
enlisted the help of their in-house
fashionista and Queen Jasmine all right
okay so tell me about your mom my mom is
a professional caregiver very busy very
on-the-go very giving up ourselves a
very caring yes yeah how does that
affect her style she doesn't wear makeup
she doesn't die her hair she wears like
plain Jane liquor-store t-shirts okay
and you care so much about other people
you don't necessarily take care of
yourself you know to me I think
something that I could relate to between
you and your mom is that you don't look
like your mom I was that growing up as
well it was definitely challenging
growing up we would be out and about and
people wouldn't realize I was my
mother's daughter this skin tone for
people makes it so that they're blinded
to all the other things we have in
common like our face so your mom's
coming and what does she think is about
to happen
she thinks that BuzzFeed is doing like
one of those moms and daughters talking
about Mother's Day and their
relationship and stuff she has no idea
I'm excited for her to transform and I
think she's gonna like be completely
blown away
so mom I know you thought that today we
were gonna do like a little mom thought
our interview we're not doing that we're
actually gonna give you a makeover are
you feeling are you excited scared how
do you describe your style
absolutely utilitarian everything we're
gonna do today is going to be within
your comfort it's only going to enhance
the person that you are we're bringing
in your makeup and hair Emily and David
which means you have to show why are you
so scared I had a couple of really bad
hair caster fees I like to call it then
I discovered I got these silver streaks
coming in there so I joined the grey
movement I'm gonna make you even more
silver we're gonna process your hair a
little bit I'm gonna gently process it
and then we're gonna put some toner on
it and just kind of like gloss you out
right
your eyes and your bone structure some
of my favorite features on your face so
I really want to play up the eyes we're
gonna play around with some smokiness I
hear it all the time that women are
afraid of shimmer or they're afraid of
adding darkness but if you place it in
the appropriate spots still accentuates
your beauty just in a different way that
maybe you didn't think about before are
you ready to see
how do you feel I feel like myself and I
have not felt like myself in about 10
years I used to be more glamorous mm-hmm
and I just the last few years I've kind
of not cared about myself enough Osos I
just need to go to work it doesn't
matter what I look like but I think I
need to do it for me it's true that's
what I got from this you know it's
interesting when you have a close
relationship with somebody and you see
them sort of lose themselves and it's
like so nice to like see my mom be
herself you don't have to change
anything about you we'll just make
little enhancements here and there and
this is how it is like this is you some
of my favorite times are literally going
to the grocery store and like my fur
coat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
