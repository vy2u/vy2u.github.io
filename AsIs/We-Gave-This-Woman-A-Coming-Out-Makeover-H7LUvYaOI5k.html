non-religious family in suburbia
Australia I grew up in a very Christian
family in San Diego California and we're
both gay we're trying to help people
navigate all of the questions that come
after you come out a lot of people think
that once you come out you're good and
that's not the case at all it's so hard
to know how to feel comfortable in your
own skin so today we're going to talk
relationships and style and style I
think this whole experience isn't about
completely transforming yourself it's
just doing the things that you've wanted
to do and that fit within your
wheelhouse but you haven't done for some
reason and you know relationships hair
and style ever-evolving they change so
this isn't gonna be like the solution to
all of Jessa's life's problems but it's
a start
we're gonna meet Jess now for the first
time get to know her a little bit go
shopping and then finale is here well
you're gonna be hanging out with this
all day okay get in here get in here
sandwich who's your gay role model kind
of hard I didn't have any other friends
who were like me and she had a religious
parent too
what did you want to focus on today like
a big problem I have is with like
confidence I've just been like rejected
and a few too many times all my friends
are in relationships it's like how come
they can be in relationships and I can't
all of my best friends were always in
relationships and I cannot tell you how
many journals I have of like what is
wrong with me I just want to love
someone I don't understand why someone
doesn't love me I don't say like it'll
happen when it's gonna happen I think
part of that is true part of is you have
to learn to love yourself first but the
second part is that the people that love
you and will love you one day they're
gonna love you for who you are
I'm just intimidated because I don't
know necessarily how to be a lesbian yes
what was your experience with the queer
community tan I got my hair cut that was
the first thing I did and I walked into
a gay bar that night I was 16 and I was
like everyone is so beautiful and
confident and
was smiling from ear to ear but also
like crying inside because I was like
how am I ever going to be like these
women what about style I'm doing like
kind of hard like movie rose stuff ah
yeah very dapper I like that bow okay
you want to talk about nice thick and
you can do a lot with that the last time
I did anything really big to my hair was
when I like put it all off it was not
like a big deal for your friends and
family my friends will tell you now like
I never felt like you were the most to
you than you are right now you have good
friends yeah thank you
Jess's friends so we're going to a queer
own hair salon we're gonna pay you up
with a hairdresser there who will be
able to like look at your inspiration
and also give you their professional
opinion or not which way to hell about
it got a big day ahead of let's get our
studio i feels clammy let's go out
confidence oh yeah confidence say you're
at a bar yeah and you see this cutie and
you're like she's so cool yeah what do
you normally do my thought process just
goes crazy will I even be her tight am i
worthy to talk to this lesbian unicorn
yes yes you are you're basically
rejecting yourself before that person
even has a chance to make an opinion app
about you it's a numbers game like the
rejection you just have to go through
that so even if she's not interested
it's not like I've lost someone in my
life and so she's not even in it you
know that you know that it's not the
be-all and end-all but you're gonna give
it everything you've got in that moment
because what do you have to lose so if
you are just 24/7 right just truly Jess
you're gonna eliminate so much
rather than these like fake friendships
where you're like may be flirting maybe
not is she flirting back just be you man
you can also just treat this as an
experiment and just be like you know
what I'm gonna try this for one night
and just just try being myself and see
what happens nothing to lose yeah maybe
everything to gain I think that one of
the biggest things to take from this
conversation for now is that you are
worth it you can talk to her you are
worthy of talking to her
just have to find the place in which to
do that now that we've dealt with the
underneath stuff we're going to deal
with the fun superficial stuff
go into the dudes section Rita thanks
game on number two
Oh like an oversized type feel let's try
this I think a jacket is usually what
makes a they get complimented a lot more
and it elevates an outfit that you
weren't gonna find try and find you a
good fitting shirt but also want to find
you something that's kind of like a WoW
piece that you feel really doping she's
getting changed how are you this is cool
on you oh yeah this is great look at
this outfit so these are things that are
gonna stand out in your wardrobe yeah oh
yeah excited especially they had a hard
jacket yeah but they almost really dope
on you like everything you put on it
like fit well and looks great you guys
are a good stylist that's why thank you
I really do like dressing people
she's gonna be sliced up she's gonna
freak out I mean she literally was
saying that she would like her style
icon person who out there come out is
Hannah and Hannah is the nicest person
in the world we're gonna just casually
be hanging and then one-handed cause I
see when she and then we'll just be like
oh that what a coincident weird pie she
knows everything about yes
we got a we got a jacket very similar to
yours like the jean jacket with the
light Sherpa on the hey thanks Anna
thanks for talking to us see you later
we just Hey oh my god you're the best
game ever
I never thought I'd hear that oh that's
amazing you alright let's go get your
hair since I can't wait are you like I
never really do anything very like crazy
with my hair so when I moved to LA I
started coming to this seller and it's
like they just get that they can be
playful with me that I don't really
conform to anything and so my hair is a
reflection of that
hi welcome to folklore
Thank You my first time these are my
inspirations fade on the sides I'm going
up yeah what we're gonna do with just
today that is around the saw once this
gets papered up closer to the head the
illusion is that this will be much
longer excited yeah alright let's do it
I feel like I've had a couple of gender
queers that come or they're starting to
transition and they want to express
themselves by starting with their hair
and the first thing they'll say is I
want something not too feminine not too
barbershop masculine I want to look very
and really good I have no idea what it
looks like I'm excited I really do feel
like she's my baby girl
probably from at a
are you ready yeah I've never had a
haircut this good before
well thank you oh I wasn't lying I think
this is like the best haircut I've ever
had it looks so good take all the
subtleties of it is what really makes a
big difference just like that slight
fade your profile looks so clean we've
just been through so much together in a
short amount of time
yeah what do you like excited about or
nervous about when you get home because
it's up to you now I hope that I can get
me incorporate all the tips so you guys
see me are the best moms in the world
oh crap for this now it's our time as
moms to send you out into the world I'm
cleaning the mess you are for you have a
dope new wardrobe an amazing new haircut
thanks a choice in folklore and we're
just gonna see how you do a light out in
the world and we're here we believe in
you all right now get out of here okay
bye bye Wow we had a kid oh you forgot
your phone I am fam bout we did it what
do you think of that I think I think
that was really cool it was cool to be
able to give back from our lived
experiences and we were very much like
yin yang about it be related to her so
much but in completely different ways
yeah not really ever at the same moment
which is really interesting I never ever
thought that I would be anyone giving
advice on how to be yourself and how to
be happy and be gay and that makes me
really happy
we did good Ashley we did we are the yin
and yang of gays
bye we're going separate well bye right
that's a good day good day game Shanta
have some time to think about all the
things
Ashley and tan told me yesterday and it
really did help like I think the main
thing I got out of it was confidence is
about loving yourself and feeling the
most you that you could possibly be I'm
just gonna do a bunch of things that
will try to just boost my confidence for
myself and not to please others and I
think I'll be challenged but also really
satisfied I used to create boards I was
in the middle of finishing this this
hover board I love sports and one of the
sports I really love playing is
badminton and I haven't ever really got
in the play here and I'm kind of
intimidated like what if I go in and
they're just a bunch of like experts I
need to get rid of this mindset right so
I'm just gonna I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
I'm going in today and I'm just gonna
play with whoever is playing badminton
because why the not
I did it
they were so much better than me but it
was so fun I really got I did it
I need know a lot of things before I
talk to Joyce so one of the techniques
she was telling me was to use the brush
to pull back and give it that volume
yeah I think I look really good I am
ready for a move away with the last hour
to spare I talked to two girls that was
really one big step out of my comfort
zone and I've never been so happy to be
gay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
