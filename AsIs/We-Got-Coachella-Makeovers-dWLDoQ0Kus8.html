and but I know my inner thighs are
gonna be like my style I like to wear a
lot of crop tops as you can see show
some of that mini Tramp wears some
patterns I really like patterns and
bright colors I look I just like to look
really cool know a cute little two-piece
going on little thing on the top little
thing on the bottom but yeah I just want
to like feel fun and free I think I'm I
look I want to look kind of like cool
downtown rock star that kind of thing my
day-to-day is like I've been described
as like a trendy team which I'm not a
teenager which I'm like oh I don't know
how to take that I wear a lot of bright
colors I want to pick to you that in the
Coachella because I feel like girls have
so much style that they can do the guys
is typically t-shirts jeans joggers I
really want to try to do something cool
with my hair I feel like they wear down
a lot clean it up you know maybe make it
until I also be very hot so you'll want
your hair I just like you know just like
put it in make it do something you know
I don't know if this is what you mean
all the really cool looks like
gravitated toward are like glitter
highlighter big intense like eyes I want
my face to look like rainbow fish like
not the entire but like maybe the
highlight I'm excited to try a look
before actual Coachella because that way
I can see like how people react and
adjust accordingly this down yeah all
right guys let's do this
yes let's go let's go
I'm Lisa Cameron and I'm a celebrity
wardrobe stylist patellas coming up and
I love working with clients to really be
creative when we think of their outfit
so they're gonna wear Coachella hey my
name is Brie I have been doing hair and
makeup for 17 years and really into all
the glitter stuff lately the glitter
tears just stars chunky glitter under
the eyes around the hairline and hair
this little bit of sparkle I look really
freaking cool right now I feel like it's
like fun and like loud enough to be cool
for a Coachella but it's also like chill
enough to like you know the okay to like
relax it you know like if I just want to
like sit down somewhere and just like
enjoy the music I can do that this
outfit isn't like crazy uncomfortable I
feel like Beyonce Xenon girl of the 21st
century and rainbowfish
all-in-one all-in-one
I am obsessed with my look I feel like
you know Lisa and Brianna really got
what I was going for it was the perfect
mix of kind of doing what I want to do
but also making me stuff a little bit
out of my box I'm like super comfortable
which is the most important thing in a
really cool t-shirt I'm a nice comfy
jean jacket and like shorts that don't
cause my inner thighs to change I just
think it's really neat it's like when
Sheridan ventures from uptown to go
downtown out with her like wrong side of
the track friends I feel super cool this
has given me very like Pharrell vibes
like not just a hat but just in general
cause it's like different enough to
where it's like that quirky cool style
like very Pharrell very chance to rapper
ish like the combination of those two
and it's it's dope it's a the other
thing is that it's like convertible I'm
gonna like a little demonstration little
like ah something more subtle something
like which chilly I needed a bundle up I
love the glitter like I'm nervous about
where it's gonna end up I feel like it's
gonna be all over anyone I touch I love
how it extends into the hairline and
kind of like goes into the Hat and I
think when I'm at Coachella I'm gonna
extend it and bring it all the way
across my beard and just go all out
because why not you look like you're
just like this is how you live life
we're ready for Coachella you're ready
for brunch you could the look does feel
very much like I can wear this anywhere
and the makeup takes it festival and so
like that's one thing where it's like
the makeup I would definitely do it a
festival but it is gonna be it's weird
to walk around the office with like
glitter especially cuz I think we have a
really warm okay I'm gonna run we just
want to find this super bright Wow oh
but I love this I think you look good
thank you especially outside it looks
dope I look like I'm what's that movie
with Oprah right now a wrinkle in time
oh god your baby Oprah wrinkle in time
to be loved do we hate to eat what do we
think oh yeah it's yeah it's a wonder
you think around food uh-huh you should
go without the shirt underneath oh you
think it's leg let it all hang out just
because I'm black you know but I mean
really
you look like jewel writers or writers
you have a good cartoon where do you
think I'm going a festival of some sort
okay there we go
okay okay okay yeah this is just I'm so
not used to say you look like this you
look interests Ellis I think you a
Coachella ready as a Coachella veteran
I'd say you're the Envoy what are you
Coachella
well romper 20 it's actually very
comfortable like I can really stretchy
that's a glitter oh I might actually
also be sweaty this is an A+ outfit so
tell me like if I saw you there the look
is it's actually really comfortable to
walk around in I don't know how a
Coachella it looks and feels but the
thing is this wristband it like keeps
falling down so this is one thing I
definitely won't be wearing cuz it just
won't stay up I'm really happy with it
I will actually wear this to Coachella
it might not be the exact same thing
maybe I'll tone it down a little bit
with the jewelry and the makeup but I'm
definitely down to wear this outfit I'm
really glad I did this
