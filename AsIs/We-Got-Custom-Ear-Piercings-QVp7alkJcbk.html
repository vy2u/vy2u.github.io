to head to Brooklyn and go get curated
piercings
they call them consolation piercing this
means that they are going to like look
at her here and like figure out specific
piercings for like what fits our ear
it makes me a little bit more nervous
just not knowing what he's gonna hear is
kind of like walking into a tattoo store
and being like go crazy what is your
official title I'm a body piercer
I've been piercing for a little over ten
years now mostly known for like curating
ears and people's bodies yeah but mostly
known for like a more delicate approach
to piercing we kind of map out people's
ears would go with people's Anatomy as
far as like if that's aesthetically and
even like lifestyle-wise
the whole phrase that was coined
constellation piercings or curated ear
yeah I think it got called that because
people are putting diamonds and like so
they look kinda like stones we call it
like more of a curated here just cuz
like when we look at people's like
Anatomy you want something that fits
nicely that looks natural yes it's a
more personal experience it's more of an
of an art form you know what's the way
we do it and the joy is changing too
like you know before you and you were
stuck with like the bulky Eastern hoops
I'm ready let's do it
you had this this is in my ear for 10
years right Pete what side you sleep on
I think okay cool what side do you looks
like your underside is your make sure on
this side okay I think going with what
you got here is a better move so I'll
mark you in a few spots
okay so you can be like a classic second
mostly going for this guy which is
skipping the second going to a high-low
the third and I'm gonna say college
would definitely Center everything off
for sure especially cuz we we're here
buds and stuff like that so what I'm
gonna do I'm just going to line
everything up okay just focus okay all
right he'll be fine
take a nice breath and that's it how was
it it's okay
you like that one it's so big I love it
it's cute arrests nicely are you ready
yeah I don't know why I'm more nervous
for Loeb that's it
just lining everything up and that is it
I promise I just think of the Parent
Trap when I think of this
it's going to put this stud in okay you
need to close the pressure here you
can't go into a piercing thinking it
won't hurt though it's true
hey I love that biggest time wow it
looks really like just like a dome so
that's what I call it an orbital I did
that because you kind of got this guy
you know so yeah yeah yeah looking just
like really cool right so I
don't like Hera we can do the conch we
can also do what we call a faux rook
which is kind of like floating rook you
wear your butt's
oh yeah okay you can do what we call a
flat piercing
I like the faux - all right Kendall
Jenner's just lining everything up that
is it ticking mr. president that's it
you did it
amazing it's Austin it okay that really
 hurt
it's so cute right just floating this
snap that's like a really cool spot
it looks like a square I was like I
don't even know it's like really cool
cool oh my god it's so much nicer you
like took like five pounds off this air
awesome
we're done so we just got pierced
personally I am feeling heat in my ear
right now but I feel good it looks so
good I just like lovely experience like
really all in all like he just made my
ears just like looks a lot more simple
and like put together I feel like before
it looks like I had a collection and
he's kind of and now it looks like I
have like everything's seamless and I
feel like I look to my piercings and I
was like I I have two ones up there now
I like love my ear and he just like made
some of the jewelry like you know any
like he just like cut like some of the
jewelry and just made it into something
for me the best experience I ever had I
just know so many people who've been
like I shouldn't have got in a college
grace or I shouldn't have gotten a
piercer it's my fear it just didn't work
like he'll probably help like prevent
that and he really does I think choose a
place that will not only look good but
it'll feel well and like and it won't
get engulfed or whatever it's called
melt that's the problem with like
cheaper jewelry is it'll essentially
melt and get stuck too yeah he had to
like snap them off of me I recommend to
anybody and I had the best experience
