from federal like me Maya
julie-san Claudia are all gonna get
styled by none other than the wonderful
Camila Camila we are basing our outfits
on a song from Camilla's album we're
gonna follow her tips and her advice
she's evolved in the musician now and
her style definitely matches that we're
gonna just try to rock it and try to be
awesome and the night ready and I better
look like Camila Kibeho the enemy how
come you look good a you're helping us
get away we're basing the outfits on
songs that she had written on her new
album and my song is Havana how would
you describe your Havana night look I
would say it looks a lot like the red
flamenco laundry if you have like a red
top or like a red dress by the way best
hair I love anything that has them you
know like like this cut with the
shoulders down for my look I got a red
crop top and a nice flowy skirt for my
challenge I wanted to have an actual
Havana night having up in van tonight
wouldn't be the same without having some
friends with me I have my sister who's
in town
and we're going to go dancing and what
else are we gonna do tonight tequila
we went salsa dancing and we moved like
Camila in the Havana video and really
just tried to get the moves down and
just have fun
I wanted it to feel like Miami in the
middle of Los Angeles and I think we
succeeded I love the outfit I feel like
I love the way it hugs my curves I felt
free I got a lot of looks and it kind of
made me a bit bashful you know I really
try to embrace Camila Cabello because I
think she's fierce and fabulous
I'm Camilla's new album she has this
song called all these years and I based
my look off of that because I love the
song it's about reminiscing about
childhood what is that one style trend
that you always go back to well I love
just like a simple t-shirt and
high-waisted jeans Camila suggested that
we wear high-waisted jeans and a shirt
Zumaya let's go meet us Mina
felt like showing my midriff was like
ooh scandal oh I think I just clicked
into that like badassery that Camilla
has going on I feel like I rocked it I
took an Instagram picture and I felt
really good about it I wanted to show
off this outfit in my body my style
challenge was to throw back trends
people have been wearing high-waisted
pants since at least the 1940s and it's
still popular today so I had to use
different phrases and lingo and
incorporate them into conversations hey
curly
do you dig it I dig it can you dig it I
dig it keep a little chicken I would
just ask it appraises done I really
commend Camilla for inspiring young
Latinas and Latinos in general to follow
their dreams follow their heart another
one of the songs on your album is real
friends which I feel like it's you're
just so real and honest and I really
feel you in that song because you know
what is that one outfit that you feel
the most real in I definitely feel like
it's important to have a pair of jeans
that fits you well so to start the day
in my new Camilla inspired outfit I
chose classic dark blue jeans they go
with a lot of different styles
I think they complemented with this sort
of red Camilla inspired top that I chose
I don't often wake up being like today
I'm gonna dress like this it's an
interesting challenge I spent about 10
minutes trying to get into the pants I'm
used to pants that just sort of hug me
like they gave up these pants have me
like they're holding on for dear life
but I liked it because it felt like it
allowed me to step outside my comfort
zone a little more because it was a very
clear objective it wasn't just like
Claudia being wild it was like you're
gonna just like this awesome beautiful
stylish person for the day my challenge
was to be a good friend and I like to
think that I'm always like I have
something
I've read for y'all this is me being a
real friend oh you did a nice thing and
she got me a sign of avocado cuz I
forgot to get out picado I think people
did notice like that it was not an
everyday outfit for me but mostly
positive reactions I got hey you should
wear red more and blue Claudia
anytime I get it Claudia about myself
and then another song on your album is
into it who do you think is like one of
your style influences like who are you
really into I saw this thing on tumblr
that was like it's ugly til Rihanna
decides it's time right she could wear a
trash bag and look amazing
so my style challenge was the channel
Rihanna
my outfit was a smaller top which showed
a little bit of my midriff and a
loose-fitting pants and then I paired it
with a beret and some glasses and a red
lip always a remnant cuz I feel like
Rihanna's always just bored
there's always something about her that
has to be like pop I definitely can
agree with coming out she loves Rihanna
and Rihanna style because Rihanna's just
can make like anything look good today
feels like a like a box day and I feel
like I took that into like consideration
as I wore my outfit I do not wear like
things like this to work I'm Charlie
walking away from this day and
completing the challenge I felt like no
matter what I wear moving forward I need
to own it and always like even if I'm
like if you're about it like is this too
much cuz I always feel like it's too
much I don't need to ever think about
that like as long as you are like this
is me and I love it
like you exude that people love it too
when I think of she loves control and an
outfit I think of like you know those
t-shirts that they sell that usually
have something very like inspiring like
you know treat boys and girls the same
way support your local girl gang
all again because she was control is
kind of just the state of mind but I do
feel like trying to look cute on on a
day where you you know have had a streak
of just a feeling not great it does make
you feel really good so curly introduced
me to a Latina owned fashion label
called La Bella Dona we were the same
outfit that was actually designed by a
Latina so it was cool to have a bunch of
Latinas together you are a true my woman
power plus the power move we even had
one of our color workers get a little
emotional about it what do you think of
all of us in these shirts I mean I know
Sammy's gonna cry
it's just really beautiful to see people
there is definitely a sense of
solidarity when you wear anything alike
Lee you're gonna feel like you're on the
same team but when you're on the same
team of being like Latina and women it
is sort of a special they go in curly
overall I really enjoyed this because it
was stepping out of like my comfort zone
but also watching other women step out
of their comfort zones I'm so happy to
see a Latina woman like Camilla in the
spotlight really just honing into her
culture and really just sharing the
music and in such a positive influence
shout out to all the Latinas and Latinos
out there love you guys
finance it so as you may have noticed
boldly is now as its new but don't worry
you'll still get all the awesome
continues to but just even more new
