we're doing this in a public let me know
that many brands honestly I probably
know more than your average person but
less than like your influencer honestly
don't know any of the colors of these
that I own now that I think about it
we're gonna go down the list and see if
I know if these are real or fake real or
fake
deep throat it has to be fake good name
their product deeper isn't this a blush
with ours I wouldn't buy anything called
deep throat so I'm gonna guess if this
is fake blush I know with NARS yeah I
think this was the blush that I used to
use from NARS I gotta start putting
myself in the mind of someone who
creates beauty products real afect humid
I think that could be a name I hope this
is fake because the midwestern in
business I like to really fake pumping
gas I hope to god this is fake from a
marketing standpoint I think
real or face better than the sex I know
this one it is real part of the sex I
know that's real from Too Faced mascara
good mascara to two things
yes that's such an iconic one which is
why you know it for your fake size
matter what kind of color right not
really not a color what I think size
matters is face let's go Sam oh yeah
it's the size of your nails that matter
to some people it's not matter to me
though I don't care what size your nails
are sexy mother pucker that sounds like
a great name that one has to be real I
know that this is about one British
brand so they wore it yeah it's of
course that's a real fake me I hope to
god for the sake of me I'm just saying
this is fake I hope right what would it
be them like a blush for your butt
I'm just going to say fake yeah yeah of
course it is okay we all think the drive
me you I'm gonna guess that's real
probably real probably get a good mood
whoopee
yep lipstick virginity real or fake
I mean that's something
feel like I heard some controversy about
this I think it's yes yeah of course it
is
Kylie's literally has of the wash named
virginity if no one thought she was a
little suss
she suspect as hell hear things dine
night this would disappear name I've
never heard of in my entire life I feel
like it makes sense why they're so far
one season I'm surprised
so these aren't bottles tell me that's
pink by the end of just like they're
it's real it's real nothing makes sense
in this world anymore maybe there are so
many names taken in the industry that
you got to do the crazy ones because no
one else has found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
