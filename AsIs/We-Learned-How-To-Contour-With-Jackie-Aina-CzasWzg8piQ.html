gonna do this who feels guys they're
people I'm Jackie aina and I'm a beauty
vlogger I'm pretty much like the contour
Queen today I'm hoping that everyone
walks away feeling like I can do this
like it's it's not as intimidating as a
lot of people I think may assume it is
welcome to contour bootcamp are you
ready yes I promise something to me I
don't want to go overboard like it's too
much my face is like doughy I would like
some definition I don't really know what
I'm doing I think I'm just covering my
face and more foundation well there's a
couple ways we can approach this okay
you can either concert with cream
products or you can contour with powder
and you already have great cheekbones by
the way so you already have a good
canvas okay so I usually like to go for
a cream when I want more of us stand out
look how there's a little bit softer
what I want you to do I'm gonna do it
for you on one side okay and to make
this super easy I'm gonna draw it so it
fits that way I'm going to follow just
below where your cheekbone earlier and
right there right at the tip of your ear
that's how you that's where what you're
gonna do is very softly little traini
like dots cuz something feel like to do
the line but honestly I feel like that's
harder to blend out so my technique my
little trick is I do like kind of tiny
tiny dots now notice how I'm following
your cheekbones and notice how I also
pulled back the closer I got to the
center of your face that's how you
prevent that muddiness
it's not just one go no you want to pull
back a little bit I'm noticing that this
one's a little bit too close to your
skin tone so we're gonna have to use
powder
g-good darker you always want to go
darker okay
because contouring is creating shot
okay so look how little process
yeah that's not that's gonna be super
easy to cheat whenever you're adding or
like taking away a product start back
here because then it's gonna look not as
blotchy and then you can it blend
outward just by tapping mhm
when you tap you're building a product
okay and you're swiping you're taking it
off oh yeah you are red carpet-ready
girls
there's a cheapo oh my god there is a
cheekbone point I like never seen this
before
but even that is like as good it's not a
ton of product but that's a good start
whoa I mean already
remember the little dots remember the
principles your surgery now our
cheekbone has temporarily dislocated
back in place so this is gonna give us
more sculpt more taking serious more cut
you with my jawline okay so I'm gonna
put dots around there to literally like
right where your neck and where your jaw
me here in there you're doing it it
looks good and then go along like your
your forehead area and same thing you
want to do the same thing except in
smaller strokes so don't do that it
forehead oh you're always working like
that's where I've seen my mom's I didn't
even have to watch she went in I have a
little bit of confidence in myself even
initiative you can blend a teensy bit
just a little bit right here yeah
you don't want to see no harsh lines in
this house and should I one thing the
edges are just blending right in the
middle blending all of it with facial
definition
who knew start at the corner of your ear
not the bottom of your face
did you overestimate how hard I think
yeah oh I see it I see it in your face I
see you you're like yeah simple
something I could do like every day like
I feel like I came in here and I was
like I'm not gonna cook up anything
extra like I'll learn but like I'm not
gonna implement this yeah I was totally
wrong I'm gonna go to the grocery store
tomorrow and I'm gonna wear card to her
you better you better go wake up some
linguine it's gonna be it's gonna be
party in the pasta I'll wait the good
news is you didn't look bad you're just
learning
