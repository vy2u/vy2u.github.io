Sheree in Brooklyn and today we're gonna
make some desert soaps that we can't eat
hi my name is Gina and I work out so
tree where all of our products are not
true on handmade here in Brooklyn
we're actually famous by our bakery line
here at soap Street the bakery line
includes things such as strawberry
cupcake strawberry cake slices we also
have chocolate salt that has real
chocolate in it today our founder
jennifer is gonna teach Lindsey how to
create a mini unicorn cupcake what makes
this so different than other soap these
soaps are made from 100% oils it's a
cold process soap so it doesn't have any
parabens sulfates or additives in it
it's the most natural soap you can use
what is the first thing but we needed
you to make something we're gonna mix
our oils in our life solution and what
this does is it bonds the oils so you
got a solid bar soap cool I'm gonna pour
shea butter okay what does that do
shea butter is just really really
moisturizing him has a lot of
conditioning benefits for your skin
coconut oil is gonna give you a really
good lather mango butter okay I've never
heard of mango butter and it's really
good for sensitive skin olive oil
everyone loves a little oil yep love it
oh my pasta I love it on my skin we have
our live solution here and it has
coconut milk in it hmm another thing I
like to eat so this is like the base
yeah it's like a nice pancake batter you
ever like just are making soap and you
want to eat it yeah all the time
all right so what are you doing now now
we're gonna divide our mixture into
these containers and then we're gonna
mix the colors it's like the perfect
unicorn pink now we're gonna create our
unicorn bases nice we're gonna start
pouring how many of these do you have to
make like daily you make like 200 oh my
god
so you have arms of like steel then our
arms kill us at the end of the day
now we're gonna prepare our piping bags
so we can frost our unicorn cupcakes
okay I'm assuming this is gonna be
making like a swirly pattern yes one day
Frost you'll see a nice swirly unicorn
so we're gonna start from the back okay
and we're gonna go around and we're not
gonna press too much slowly just go
around four times I can't get over how
satisfying this looks yes I'll just do a
couple and then when we get closer to
the front I'll give it to ye Oh
a little bit more okay
you're doing it keep going okay it's not
cute from the back another wanted babies
they're like my children
now we're gonna dress up the unicorn
cupcakes with horns and ears and then
we'll sprinkle blocks of glitter some
words on okay how did you make these we
made these with melts and poor so we
poured it into our mold and once they're
dry you have words so cute do you want
to try putting it in yeah yeah put it
just try to stop right in the middle in
the center just like that cute wait this
is so satisfying getting to like yeah go
into it
little creatures I cannot get over how
cute they are
now it's glitter time you can put as
much as you want don't worry that is a
ball here oh my god I feel like a fairy
this is so good
this just brings them to life yeah we're
all done oh my god
yes now that they're all done they look
so so good what do we do now now we're
just gonna set them aside and we're
gonna let them cure they have to care
for four weeks before we use them
