love looks like today and today we're
your host Patrick and Paolo welcome to
our home
are we live here's our living room or
family room so here's our kitchen dining
room cause they're dining place that's
our kitchen yeah you know you're a real
Oprah fan if you have a vision board
especially we have to vision boards then
you're like hardcore Oprah fan one of
these was supposed to be mine and one of
these was supposed to be his but his
visions are much grander so he's saying
he has no vision yet when is your vision
you have no vision take turns describing
how you first met only one sentence at a
time
Patrick massage me I hope is a massage
therapist and I went to get a 25 minute
massage on my back so I went into the
quiet room and I said Paulo and then he
came I wasn't sure Patrick was straight
or gay when I first met him so I had to
go back for a second massage and then he
came back for a third massage and after
that third massage I knew he was gay
okay sounds really good oh no just I
just knew the rest is history
we're soul mates
I kind of knew for a couple months that
I want get Patrick ring I finally had
surprised them when we took a trip to
San Francisco that's where it all
started
we were like playing around making
videos he takes his book bag off and
puts it down and he's like dancing on
the train cuz we were the only ones in
there oh my god it is so cool and I'm
just go I'm so happy uh what can go
wrong to get on the bar we're like
halfway to the city and then all of a
sudden POW was like yeah my book bag is
like I took it's okay to get like no
it's not okay like oh my god we finally
find out that it's at the police station
in the airport they thought they had to
close the airport because they thought I
had some kind of bomb and I even told
security because he said what's in your
book bag and I said oh the only guy in
my book bag is a Oprah Magazine and then
a watch Mel's like we'll get you a new
Oprah Magazine it's okay I didn't wanna
tell anyone about the Rings because I
don't want to like this is like the one
thing I worked so hard to surprise him
he was straight up lying to them so that
I wouldn't know I had one of our close
friends i text her I said hey can you
call Patrick I need him distracted I
talked with their security when I get on
the phone with her and she's like oh my
god like did you hear the new Britney
album like I love track why did you
listen to Track 3:8 I'm like panicking
cuz I'm like they're arresting Paolo I'm
gonna hang up on her and then the door
closes and I'm like stuck outside by
myself they apologized to me and said
that they found a book bag and that it
was okay but it was one of the scariest
days of my life because I did not want
to lose the Rings like how could I do
that on March 13 of 2011 when we went to
the restaurant when we walk in they're
like oh we have your table ready we had
a beautiful view we have our dinner we
have like wine it's so beautiful and
lovely I'm not really listening to him I
just kept nodding my head because I kept
thinking about the Rings and if this is
all gonna work out and then they come
out with dessert the waitress comes and
brings the box of rings on each dish one
for me and one for Patrick I knew that
this this is a moment that I've been
waiting for we unwrap the box and then I
just said that I want him when we can in
the state of California I want him to be
my husband I feel like I kind of maybe
didn't give the reaction he wanted I
thought he'd be like
oh my beautiful just kept saying what
are you doing what are you doing what
are you doing he was just like oh my god
what's happening right now my parents
got divorced when I was in college so I
was kind of like marriage is stupid
whatever after I declare my love for him
and and why he means the world to me our
conversation kind of shifted and I just
kind of told him exactly like how I what
I was feeling like the anxiety about the
idea of marriage once we started talking
about it that kind of like he just came
back to like us and the relationship and
what it means it's not about being
perfect it's just about you know being
hopeful and giving it a shot and you
know seeing what happens
our good friend Jameson mom gave us
these pillows because for our wedding
for our wedding you got it mr. and mr.
if I sit on the end of this bed put my
shoe on he yells in that's not okay
well it's just because it's so much work
fixes his damn bed I am so organized in
our home we're so very neat I swept to
the floor every day I Windex I pledge I
clean knowing him now when he first came
to my apartment that I lived in when we
met I'm like how did you not break up
with me because I had like stacks of
mail like all over the place
oh my god his room was so dirty piles of
dirty clothes his bathroom had junk is
he can you hear me safe it the fact that
he stayed with me through that that's
pretty good if you can change one thing
about me you would change I would just
make you a little more confident because
you should be confident you have nothing
to be insecure about your favorite thing
about me is blank that's unique
your smile your favorite thing about me
is how much make me laugh hmm I don't
ever want to know that my worst habit is
oh um like the way you eat it's really
sexy
your break my teeth of that and that's
how we eat I spent a lot of time in the
kitchen I do not spend any time in the
kitchen and he's telling you the truth
the kitchen scares me I go in there and
I get water and I get out immediately
we've been together for eight years and
I've never helped him bake once ever
that's really scary so I'm basically in
a cage and I can't see anything
and where are you Patrick I'm here in
the kitchen I'm going to be telling
Patrick how to make these cookies so
this is my recipe and it's pretty easy
to make for me and for Patrick it's
gonna be pretty difficult I think oh my
god
first thing you have to do is preheat
the oven to 350 I mean where it says
bake yes I'll just press three five zero
enter okay okay yeah so now what we're
gonna do is we're gonna do our dry
ingredients first
okay so measure 3/4 of a cup of the
flour now when you open it be careful
cuz it's make a lot of mess cuz it's a
new bag so open it very carefully okay
what are you doing love it
open the baking soda okay there's like
four spoons get the one that says 1/2
1/2 1/2 a teaspoon you're gonna do 1/4
of a teaspoon of the salt
that's so weird mix the dry ingredients
together like with my hands no with your
hands that's disgusting go just what the
spoon is a bitch turn it wait a whiz cuz
I'm yeah you know it yeah I know it was
good yeah mix it tonight put that on the
side do you see the butter yeah to half
a cup of butter that whole stick like
Paula Deen now that you see the peanut
butter uh yeah okay so we need 1/2 a cup
of that that you're gonna mix with the
butter is so disgusting
I don't know what you're doing but it
doesn't sound right you see the brown
sugar and the white sugar yeah use 1/2 a
cup of what the sugar the white sugar
yes the white sugar or anything where
does that go it goes into the bowl with
the butter and the peanut butter okay
now you're gonna do the light brown
sugar you're gonna put a half a cup of
that just try to clean as I go a little
the bottle that like beautiful like
looks like a woman's body the vanilla
yes you can add one teaspoon of that and
now you're gonna mix the ingredients so
she liquid in there something don't ask
questions you keep going
get whatever you have in front of you
that's clean and put a cup of the oats
where do I put them the floor where you
gonna put them did you put on the floor
I'm just following your directions were
you gonna roll the dough on the floor
why would you put on the floor Oh
beautiful okay one cup in the bowl you
said yes in the bowl with the orange
spatula mix it I'm not cleaning this
kitchen after that's all I know
softly fill up that teaspoon you're
gonna do like three lines of four so now
while that's baking for ten minutes in
the timer's on you're gonna make the
filling so let's try to be a filling
yeah flip three tablespoons
yes butter they're gonna do 1 cup of
powdered sugar you're gonna get half a
cup of that peanut butter okay so the
last ingredient hallelujah is the heavy
cream I kind of think it's good that's
hot yeah be careful
am I making like an Oreo yeah like an
Oreo smash it
yep oh my god that looks really good I
go see now it's cookie time three two
one oh I am gonna be supportive let me
hire sac hmm Boston is good it's kind of
hard I think he was a little mean he was
a little unclear he would tell me to
throw things on the floor when he didn't
want me to really throw it on the floor
but in spite of all that I think I
followed directions well and I think
that this was a success I would like to
do one more time and I would maybe not
leave them in the oven as well um
there's not gonna be another time thank
you all for coming here I'm gonna ask
you to leave because there never can do
this dirty
but here's the Jesus like I was like
looking at this gay wedding like I never
noticed that before it's free me out a
lot okay whatever
okay and those are my parents and that
is his family and those are wedding
gifts from our good friend I don't like
to name dr. Robin Roberts my mom is
blank yeah mrs. Home Depot for real you
could go into Home Depot with her and be
like where's whatever and she knows
exactly what aisle is sixty aisles at
Home Depot and she would tell you what
aisle is the hammer what I was two
screws what aisle is the washer
miss Dorie knows everything the last
time he caught me lying was playing my
birthday cuz he always says he gets me
something but then it's not what it is I
sleep in the house and sleep in the
closets and everywhere and it's not what
he says it is and so I give up this is
our closet and this is how fair we are
in this really guess these are Palos
shoes and he gets all of these and then
these are my shoes right here these are
actually Pablo's favorite shoes I didn't

loves them and I don't and we fight
about that sorry
so I'm doing this for Patrick he helped
me by baking and now I'm going to help
him by giving him a tour of the craft
and Folk Art Museum yeah
Wow hi graphical that means aha we have
three exhibitions right now so maybe go
ahead and give you a preview before Pat
ray the tide of the work is paperwork's
oh I got it people work that's why cuz
everything I never okay I think I
remember you can bring Patrick up here
one thing about this is that the base
material still paper it's so like a
two-dimensional plane but it's also a
sculpture because you can walk through
it
you could walk around at a you can
experience because I love that exactly
okay so Patrick's in the car I'm about
to go get him to surprise him where we
are
he's gonna love this he's really good
love it
Patrick hello Chicago that was so quick
he loved it okay I'm so sorry this is
gonna be such a dream for both of us
close your eyes don't open them yet okay
I'll tell you when okay open your eyes
welcome to the craft oh all right damn
you're gonna have the time of your life
and I'm gonna give you a tour oh yeah
that looks blended wait are you sure you
want to go VIN I want to go there so bad
I'm changing today is a new day
listen if you have any questions just
you know you don't ask we get on to this
now tell me what you're feeling are you
excited
no works what are we going to okay so
don't ask questions right now I don't
know about that one yet let's go to this
quick thing about this one this is
beautiful let me tell you why the artist
his name is Lorenzo I don't remember his
last name but if you look closely look
at the cuts and look how it's been
painted over it now with the cool thing
about this is that it's like a 360 that
if you go from the inside you can this
is the only time you can relook at an
artwork you go all the way around
there's no good don't touch when you get
amusing we never touch anything below
that you know that yes you know that I
was yelled at earlier I think just the
details in here
just remarkable now we're gonna go by
Frank with the P don't to read that I'm
telling you what about that's this when
I'm gonna be age
oh yeah pH yes I said poppy the
fascinating about Frank is that she just
is just great at what she does we have
cheese life vest and shorts what's the
only thing I live in common for the
paper yes Frank uses paper you could
actually use it no way yeah that's the
special thing about it god this is not
my cup of tea but I'm learning something
usually I have to read all the little
things on the wall so they know what's
going on and he's like pulling me away
because he's so he wants to
leave but I can't believe actually how
much information he knows about these
people I hope it's all true
now I'm gonna leave me alone for a year
we say we're gonna go to another one
next week
mmm what's I what the Lakers I didn't
know where we were going but I kind of
didn't think it was somewhere for me I'm
thinking it was somewhere for him like
an ice-cream shop it touches my heart
that it was actually something for me
that I would want to do usually we'll
just do the things we can agree on but
maybe sometimes like it's cool to like
go to something that you really want to
do or for you to like go see something
like a documentary or something that I
really want to go see is just broaden in
a relationship yeah we did it
we did it there is just no one like him
anywhere
some people say that about their
significant other and like do you really
mean that but I mean everything I say
about I just think he's like a magic
person like if he dreams of anything he
can make it happen and he's done it so
many times it's like really amazing to
watch our love is special it really is
like he's my best friend
don't tell us that's the end of our show
thanks for watching something cute to
end the show let's do yeah you let me do
this oh this is so good Wow
that's all right I can't wait to watch
