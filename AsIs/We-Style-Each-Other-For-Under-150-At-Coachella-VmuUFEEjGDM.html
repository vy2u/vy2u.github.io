saying we can't all be great at picking
out outfits so Laura and I are going to
Coachella this weekend and we are going
to be competing in a style challenge
we're gonna pick our day three outfit
for Coachella we have a couple of rules
one stick together and try not to drive
each other crazy to dress each other
only using one hundred and fifty dollars
three we have to vlog everything on our
phone and four hopefully have some fun
and be crazy and not kill each other
we're on our way to Coachella right now
we're in a car yes we are guys are
happening this is my first Coachella and
this is your second in a second I'm a
veteran
the cello bears cleared that's kind of
thing I'm excited I feel like I have
some advice to give you
we're gonna have so much energy is gonna
be just amazing I also hope that you are
ready to be the quiet person at
Coachella because I'm styling you yes
well let's see about at least one of
your looks movie I don't know what your
cute looking for Ryan's clothes right
now and this is a lot harder than I
thought I feel like I'm just gonna end
up buying him a tank but I don't know if
he wears tanks this is confusing oh
there's a shirt with pineapples on that
I like that should get Ryan a hat I feel
like he might I don't know if he's all
of that sunglasses right enough shorts
but what kind of shorts it's just like
everybody looks so basic so I'm freaking
out about buying salams outfits so I had
to pour myself a little glass of wine
hope I don't screw it up likes no no
boss I'm gonna be great at this between
me and so Lauren I'm gonna dress her
better than she will dress me I'm gonna
do this and it's gonna be great
Ryan was really rude to me the first
thing he said was I'm not to worry about
your outfit implying that he was worried
about his outfit implying that I can't
style him well Ryan I'm gonna show you
you're gonna be the hottest little
sausage up in Coachella
good morning it's day one of Coachella
and I'm here to pick ups alarm she's not
here she's late already
you're not wearing this whatever this is
right now to Coachella
I go weird I knew that dango wait how
many offices you bring I've got a
suitcase yeah I wrote two bad eggs for
three piggies what was your last
Coachella like life-changing feels
dramatic to say but it really what the
energy that you feel when you're at
Coachella is just crazy like you see so
many different looks so many different
people so much stuff is going on and
it's just like incredible tell me a
little bit about your style what you
like I like bright colors and I like to
wear things that like far a little off I
like things that like most guys don't
wear like a lot of guys don't take risks
in fashion you can't tell from this out
there right now this is just my
traveling outfit it is very basic I know
I'm sorry I like to wear like things
they have a lot of prints a lot of pops
of color like something that is just
flying out there that people are gonna
stop like oh that's a look I also look
at you love hats do love also a little
nervous about you styling me okay you
know what Ryan I'm really done with this
honestly he's saying it because I'm
nervous about me stuff I am nervous that
you were gonna be like this is not me
it's very cool those very sheep I like
to wear like sometimes a lot of crop top
oh okay you're gonna love this I would
leave your Instagram I've noticed you
have a lot of print did solid colors I
could have gotten you so many things but
I had to like minimize what I got you
know but I understand unaffectionate I
tried really hard I put some color in
there you're not gonna look like every
other do they're good that's okay
perfect
that's that is like my main things that
I don't wanna look good that's the thing
we're both really like me to style and
we both want to stand out if we're
wearing something at Coachella that we
don't like we're just being like oh
we're gonna feel so uncomfortable I see
you pants I like and I assume that you
I'm supposed to pick that things for you
you're not supposed to pick your eye but
I said this is a style highlight and
these are the patterns oh you gonna
collapse and drive at the same time
we're in traffic so why don't you say I
don't want a 1 is done so now that we
have a full day you don't want to go to
the festival too early unless they're
artists you really want to see most
people go to the festival around 5 so
you always want to like plan your day to
either relax just get some sleep or like
go to some parties I really am excited
to see what you've got
oh my god I'm a little scared because I
want to look nice I don't know oh you
look nice I want to look nice but I also
want to feel like comfortable because
like oh then I think you're gonna love
what I got you yeah yeah yeah but I want
to look nice it's very like fashion so
you're gonna look real cute I think I'll
I say yeah yep we just went to our hotel
we got the clothes we picked for each
other mail to our hotel only Ryan's
packing by I do much I did my job to it
paws on the wood July this let me look
now I have to go find a store in La
Quinta Ella Quinta I don't know
and get him a new outfit and it might
not even be cute I don't want to lose I
already have a few clothes no Ryan I
have to wear what I pick you out you
should have done your job and got a year
I did can you I'm gonna at a store you
need to sit down and no not look ugly
you're no job one time I did my job I
had it mailed and you're being mean
you're making me upset but I ordered
your clothes and iPod a lot of boots one
let's put more work in let's go Ryan
you're not coming anywhere near me go
find a seat okay girlfriend I have to
figure out what to get Ryan ASAP I don't
even have time to like a look through
everything
shopping for men is really hard all that
is kind of basic I'm gonna go for
colorful shirts first and then just try
to find pants that match it okay I'm
really dying out here I remember I got
Ryan some jewelry and a hat last time
but it's not easy to find jewelry and
hats for men here because there's so
much female clothing I've narrowed down
like three outfits with this kind of
floral top and these red shirts together
this checkered shirt with these black
pants this outfit together
I don't know and
works as hard as I can so I already win
this style challenge I have my package
here in time and I have to sit here wait
for some warm to even pick my outfit I
warrant I said please make sure you're
gonna do the shipping I asked her she
had it she said yeah I got it it's done
and now we're here shopping and I'm on
lunch duty the fact that she's under
pressure and that it's a little bit more
or less a minute than before it makes me
super nervous I might just have to
switch out for my own outfit so pro tip
always pack extra clothes because
sometimes it's like this happened and
you're gonna have to have something
aware I brought six outfits so I was to
go up side the side we just survived a
to the ark they destroyed my life during
the best way possible
sure I know so it's the morning after
the second day I'm still reliving I'm
currently watching the second live
stream of Beyonce's performance
she's so good the dust is real it wasn't
that bad last year but I feel like a
bandana is so necessary because I'm
currently dying people pick their noses
and when you pick your nose
it is gonna be some black dirt attached
to your freaking boogers and it's gonna
be disgusting you're gonna have a good
Coachella long after this I'm gonna
cough up this for like a week that was a
real tough can we have backs and backs
okay let's do it
unfortunately I had an outfit for you
it's not here
I did it I love this so yes this is like
a nice like colorful top because I know
you like colors I do
yeah because I swear I saw like five
other people or there's gonna be crap oh
my god yes I love you who comes to
Christmas Day and says mom thank you for
your gift I put like Kelly and Jessica
have the same shirt so I don't want this
mom thank you but no thank you
do you love it this is gonna be a good
flight it's breezy yeah yeah I know I
used to even like shorts but I think you
look hot these are some Navy shorts I
thought you could put these together I
got you some glasses I love you they're
clear they're not so nice and it's fine
cool it makes you look it makes you look
cool
you're welcome okay going on here oh my
god I'm scared
I've never wondered I never wear these
colors okay there's sunglasses for you
and then some cute little earrings you
know I never actually wear hands but
they're cute
I was in color and I knew there and then
you bought me this which is really cute
I think I can play around with all these
things to make something cool alright
we're gonna try it on
so it's the last day future last thing
I've done everything I think I went to
sound too um I don't know um I did know
you look great I look great but
you also look great lollipop wow you
know what
let's audience assessment is very basic
coach everything but um how do you feel
about showing this off at the festival I
hope you're proud I feel like I will
blend into the ground so I'm not upset I
think I look cute I look good fine I
just you know I think you'll stand out
I'll blend in
oh you're just gonna turn the camera
away what it's saying you're man how mad
are you big mad at a little mad
we talked about how many compliments you
got our outfit that I didn't okay you
know I I got compliments but Ryan also
got some compliments I was very proud of
what I did
the original outfit was great you'd have
liked it and you would have looked fly
unfortunately this is a step down from
that but you know what you still look
good some photographers stops him and
they were like yo I need a picture of
you I styled Ryan and now a photographer
wants to photo shoot him because he
looks so fresh things to me I think that
they wanted to picture me because of me
I think that I am naturally just a good
model and therefore they were like
please we need a picture of you you see
this Eric the thing is is that when you
were good model any garment is fashion
and we literally just got back from
Coachella last night 3:00 in the morning
to consider taking the Monday off after
coaching yeah we're at work right now
that's a bad idea no we're very tired it
was so fun um yours Coachella yeah whoa
really it was great honestly like I
loved all the musical acts I loved just
being out in a desert like crazy-looking
hippie City wait pause
didn't pop would ever come yes it did
like I said I had to go through his
store in like 10 and 15 minutes Ryan
kind of felt basic and you know I felt
bad because we weren't there I found
quite a few people wearing this shirt
I liked it I really did was not a bad
outfit you're looking good I blend it
into the crowd you made me cry a little
bit
it's okay you know that's what
friendships are for he looks good and I
think a lot of our that was with me you
know and I think a large part of that
was because of me too
either you're gonna no no what am I
gonna do that
well yeah Coachella so it's confirmed
next year I'm broke so I need to go
actually meant to work okay
