we've literally found out last night
that our company was sending us to Las
Vegas 24 hours 24 hours just casually
the challenge is that we have less than
24 hours to style each other in the
ultimate going out
the challenge here
we were only allowed to bring one bag I
have nothing I just have this sweatshirt
it's kind of liberating it is
we made to Vegas whoa and we are on our
way to the mall one of the many makers
yes but one of the best things we've
already got a club promoter we see some
hot DJ's I'm not used to this nightlife
stock put her we literally have nothing
and I mean nothing nothing nothing to
wear tonight so we have to find
something yes we literally have to both
me choose yeah which like good luck
finding shoes what size are you 12
yep club promoter specifically said
dressed to impress
we're literally going out at like 6
hours and we have to have our outfits by
that yes oh cool cool I hope we can find
some
this forever21 is a lid this is like a
classic clap cuz it's Vegas chandelier
shopping took so long we walked into
forever 21 and we were like Oh
everything is Beach where for some
reason everything here is so beachy like
it's not Club what would you like to win
I want that edgy appeal to it I don't
want like just a body con dress right I
think we both don't want to look like we
have any dress but like sequins sparkles
because every single girl has that we
both want to stand out we don't want
something like this this is typical
Vegas we want to go different we want to
be different
I own the first to look for Jasmine's
clothes I struggled man nothing in this
plus light section at forever is Jasmine
style and jasmine has a lot of different
things that are closeted this is not it
I think a lot of different things they
weren't Vegas looking but I was like
Jasmine with her hair and like with some
heels and her pulled lip color in a word
it was really difficult but I ended up
finding jasmine a lot of stuff hopefully
you like it we got a lot of reds and
blacks we got to see if they fit fashion
show go
I would wear this if I had like a
turtleneck on underneath it at 90 you
did so oh it's you but I'm not very
about it's like not the style I'm going
for yeah it's not Vegas yeah but your
butt looks oh this is cute
holy I'm gonna buy that it not for a
club baby for like it was frustrating in
the sense of like bringing me back to
like Irama of people picking out clothes
for me and wondering like is it gonna
fit is it gonna work out these pants
don't slip at the crotch it would have
been heated wouldn't you and then I have
such like a complex weird style on top
of it but I think you did really good
like a lot of the stuff you picked out
ended up fitting no funny dance in it
can you dance in it I love that it's out
I never show your back I don't like it
like I mean I have a great one the best
I think it'll look better with black
feels yeah
my black sunglasses black yeah yeah yeah
great I would love ideally did not wear
a dress and maybe like a cool jumpsuit
or pants okay
but that is difficult to find yes so
it's also like 90s early 2000 yeah yeah
I think we can lean into that for
Lindsay's outfit I wanted to go into a
very like sporty but like that hot
sporty that's in right now where you can
wear it with heels so I gave Lindsay a
schlub stuff I am going to be trying to
show a little of her body off so I got
some shorts it's like dressing up a
Barbie I love it there is a vibe power
colors in it you're gonna be showing
some skin okay I'm not mad
No I was gonna say I wish it didn't have
the ruffle
yeah I agree yeah I just want
yeah yeah I think it needs a different
top or something yeah no no no so it's
like I'll be right back I found a black
sports bra and some right options but
she came and showed me at a black sports
bra and it was perfect we basically just
went to forever 21 for everything
because we did not have time no we
didn't have time mess around you're like
we gotta get all of our outfits in this
one store oh you know jazz do you like
the gang love that bag it is such a 90s
bag I thought you're welcome any issues
we ended up finding an Aldo they had a
really cute pair of like glitter heels
yeah and I was like I don't be a little
bit of a pop for jasmine shoes we had to
go to another mall which was like 10 and
15 minutes away just to go to the toward
the only Tori none of the shoes were
jasmine style which the girl bless her
heart she is so sweet bringing out all
these sizes 12 shoes but they were just
not what I wanted she brought out
actually a lot of different shoes that
weren't in the store and one of them was
great but it had a bow got these shoes
but I don't like the bow yeah baby
this shoes look great yeah they look
great and then she has a look cooler to
match those and then I want you to wear
a red lip and I think maybe your
sunglasses as an accessory but not on
what if I lose them don't all right all
right do it
all right wrap the omnia we're here
we're here ready to go out under the
stress
it has but now we can finally let them
see us and not worry about our shoes
I just got back from our night out and
those shoes my husband felt pretty
comfortable yeah Vegas is its own vibe
yeah totally and it was hard feeling
like we fit different places around the
world like dressing up to go clubbing
usually fits into one certain style and
when we go out we actually dress really
really different and like when we're in
West Hollywood we were like tennis shoes
and boots and me are you wear heels if
you want to well yeah there's no like
you should wear these shoes it was for
sure an experience yeah I think it was
so fun shopping for you and I learned a
lot I'm glad I really was excited to put
you in an outfit that you would wear
jazz would like has the outfit I wore
but you look so good in it I loved it
when I sat down no the slit on this side
went all the way up my waist all the way
good see Vegas you've been good to us
I guess always do always be in Vegas
we're gonna sleep now we have a flight
really early okay my bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
