back with another makeover ready to hit
refresh on someone else's look last time
we made over our co-worker katie leblanc
and helped her gain confidence through
enhancing the beauty she already had
this time we take Elena Elena is a video
research associate here at BuzzFeed
which basically means she's responsible
for making sure all the we say
is accurate
Elena is one of the sweetest women that
we work with and always puts work ahead
of herself the main reason we chose
Elena is because she's living two
different lives like a lot of people
Elena saves her great outfits for the
weekend but we want to show her that she
can rock that on the daily she's kind of
just more like comfy t-shirt jeans like
it's very like I'm coming to work and
I'm dressing to like work like there's
no fussing with anything I feel like
yeah on the weekends she like turns
about you can just feel her kindness of
her energy like she's so nice she has so
much potential to just like enhance that
on the outside
Elena actually has no idea that she's
been picked we set up a fake meeting
where we're gonna go and surprise her
come along to the fake meeting
so really nervous
what is she's like no thing some really
cool
I'm so excited right now like not only
because you guys are maybe the most
fabulous version of myself yes because
also getting young Elena so welcome
thank you for having me yeah so glad to
be here I feel like this is gonna be the
beginning of the rest of my life growing
up I I think I've struggled with my body
in some ways at the times when I was
thinner
I definitely received a lot of positive
reinforcement for looking a certain way
and then in the times when I would gain
weight people were not necessarily
supportive I think as I became more
comfortable with myself as a person it
was based more upon the things that were
not physical about myself my style is
very eclectic I like to consider myself
slightly more bohemian yeah slightly
more bohemian but it doesn't always
translate I have like two states of
being it's like either fully done or
like minimal nothing something that I
noticed in your style is that I think
like you're not afraid to do certain
things like you can do that every day
and like I want to see that from you I
want everybody to know that like you're
a star and that's how you're
gonna lock I'm a schmee on to the world
I'm ready we're going to your house
my messy-ass cars but don't worry long
as you don't look messy we're doing our
job so we are here to check out some of
the clothes that you would wear on your
normal days just so we can get like a
gist of you and your style and what you
like so first outfit this is basically
like what I would wear to work on a
normal day okay I wear way too many yoga
pants or leggings to be like considered
a functional human just like a basic
shirt
obviously Comfort is a huge part of your
life
I do like gravitate towards just like
being comfortable so much and I know
there's a way to make it look cool I
think it's really acceptable to be
comfortable and to even look sporty but
still be really fashionable well I want
to see your next outfit okay I feel like
this would be like a low-key day time
but like weekend outfit for me I like
wearing skirts more than I like wearing
pants
the topic honestly like lingerie I'm
actually not mad if any of these pieces
I wouldn't necessarily put them together
I like to let one item be the star of my
outfit so I feel like this would be
really dope over just one solid color or
something that allows this jacket to
really pop through okay um let's see
your next outfit the last outfit I
wouldn't not wear this to work it's like
incredibly comfortable
loose and flowy pockets I could get to
this level in the workplace okay I just
don't all the time so this to me it's
very like you said it's very feminine
but I feel like to get you to the place
just to commit a little bit more you
could literally just put on like a
darker lip than this then it's a look
we've seen your outfits I love that
you're not afraid of color that you're
not afraid of friends but you're so much
fun and I just feel like I'm ready for
everybody to see that you know we don't
want to change any bit of you we love
you we literally just want people to
like notice like that's Elena look at
her she's the bomb you know so
the next step we'll be taking is we will
be going shopping together that sounds
perfect
I'm ready okay today is shopping day I
was telling like my friends about this
no we're like well like this little
world gets it we got it out for you yeah
so we're in the middle of shopping for
Elena and we've decided that even though
we split or in some crazy outfits will
also notice in the guac night is
flattering what it's not would be the
best you know that's kind of what you
wanted
to get just according to your quick
it has been a 4-hour shopping spree I
never thought I'd be tired I think what
we landed on is new and different for
you definitely like oh look makeover to
k17 so tomorrow's new transformation
very early I'm like fully not prepared
to wear an outfit that is as tight and
like form-fitting I'm supposed to have
like my sandy from Greece moment instead
I'm gonna be like Bucky five pizza
slices deep I just like want to make
them feel proud because like they see
something in me like want to bring that
out basically I'm gonna be a babe
tomorrow
and I'm ready
are you excited yes I'm so excited I
definitely had this moment and like a
realization I had basically gave you
guys like free reign so this will be new
me we've been working with you all week
and you know we absolutely adore you
know we're just trying to give you so
much confidence and just enhance the
Elena that is now so for today I'm
David's gonna be here doing your hair
and Katherine will be doing your makeup
I'm ready let's go come on hi my name is
David day and I'm a celebrity
hairstylist my passion is for hair and I
love transforming people in the chair
did that was Ryan so I think what we're
gonna do today is we're gonna shape your
hair and then we're gonna add some color
into it I'm not gonna tell you what
color and the reason why I'm not gonna
tell you what color is because I've
already felt this color from you the
moment I saw your picture and I think
that you're gonna feel it too okay I'm
ready you're about to change
so when I first met Elena by a picture I
saw that she was really slouchy a little
bit not so much staring into the camera
as much she needs that boost of
confidence so what we're gonna be doing
on Elena today is we're gonna be giving
her a bob and she was to color her hair
up
she needs that color in her life teal is
the appeal so what are you feeling right
now
I'm excited I have no idea what's going
on but I know it's gonna look like
amazing again trust fall trust the walk
trust the process
all right let's go get you off the top
and come on
hi I'm Catherine and I'm today's makeup
artist I've been a licensed aesthetician
and skincare therapist for over eleven
years and today I'm super excited to
share my talent with Elena so what I
understand is that you either like to go
on a churro
or you like to go full glam girl today
we're going to focus on giving you a
happy medium as far as the colors we
won't know until we reveal it's good we
are gonna be focusing on a super flirty
fun and sultry eye with a nice pop of
color on the lips
I absolutely love being able to take
whatever confidence and empowerment a
woman is kind of hiding underneath and
really push it forward and I think Elena
is going to feel amazing alright Lina
I'm Kaila biased I think you're already
looking at fabulous but how are you
feeling without knowing what's really
going on I feel good I feel very
confident in the fact that I'm gonna
look really cool I cannot wait to see
the finished product and now you're off
to the next step are you ready I'm ready
let's go so it's finally here we're here
she's ready and she's done yes I'm
excited to see her she's like completely
transformed and we are ready to see oh
girl let's see your little baby come on
Elena
come on out
this is a lot to take in I like it I
feel like a little it doesn't even look
like me we decided to put you in
high-waisted pants then we put you in
this leotard which is super simple very
easy to wear and then we just gave you
these little pops so silver because your
hair and your makeup is like the
statement here and this outfit is just
tying it all together at first I was
like oh my god there's my face now it's
like oh well my face looks really nice
looks like some kind of this hair and
like all the other things are processing
you already have such great taste in
clothing just have a little bit more fun
I would say I hope this has shown you
that like you can be a badass
bitch I'm gonna carry it yeah you're the
best I can
some of our coworkers are waiting for
you I'm ready okay let's go let's go so
right now
I'm excited I'm nervous to see there a
lot of drama I'm all the drama right now
it looks like you but ng you look so
good like I always look amazing but like
this is you like I'm just obsessed with
it and like I'm just so happy that this
happened this may prefer has allowed me
to reimagine myself in a way that I
guess I didn't know I could see myself
and I think more than that I think I
mean with jazz and curly is just
something that is so empowering because
they believe that you could be like the
best version of yourself and that in and
of itself pushes you to do better
so I just came from my first touch-up on
the ruler and David Slade it again this
is my new lifestyle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
