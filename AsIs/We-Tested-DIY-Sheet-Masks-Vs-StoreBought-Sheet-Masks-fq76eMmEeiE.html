I'm like pretty allergic to a lot of
soaps and stuff might have become
important while volunteering on a face
mask video today we're gonna test a DIY
sheet mask against two store-bought
versions I've got a really high-end
expensive one and then we have our
middle-of-the-road sheet mask it is a
Sephora sheet mask it cost about six
dollars and finally we've got our DIY
version which uses apple cider vinegar
green tea and a few other things so
we're gonna try and make our own and
then put it to the test I have ordered
some like blank sheet masks I thought I
was gonna get like four of them I think
I have 400 of them that's a lie
there's 100 of them 1/4 cup of green tea
2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and
3 to 4 drops of tea tree essential oil
looking good now I'm gonna drop my
little alka-seltzer tablet looking sheet
mask into the bowl
what the head I'm glad this bag came
with a hundred face masks because I'm
gonna want to do this 100 times so this
is looking properly terrifying but it
actually smells really good so I am
going to carefully put this in a ziplock
baggie I have to be sure to like fold it
really precisely so that people can't
tell the difference between the store
bought version and mine or maybe I
should just unfold the store bought
version that sounds like a better idea
let's do that there we go okay my
initial thoughts is that the coloring
looks pretty clear and it looks pretty
juicy compared to the other ones and
smelled pretty rancid see if many will
have a sniff except that it just smells
funny quite soothing oh it's very cold
my skin looks great my skin feels super
moisturize I think this all is
definitely bought judging this by the
shape of it I have to guess I'd say this
might actually be the new one I can't
tell the difference anymore
I'll recommend this one if you can get
past the smell so face mask be face must
be has been kind of weird this one
smells better still looks like toilet
paper definitely looks like toilet paper
the smell is really good the taster is
good but it is making my face so dead
I've got a feeling this is the expensive
one because the smell the taste was it
was cool and refreshing but like 10
minutes later just have to say my face
feels really soft and really smooth last
one um we are gonna try see see how this
goes
oh my god oh it's so cold and kind of
let's just have a smell the thickness
has been really good it's like stuck to
my face it's not tingly it doesn't smell
bad and my dog is terrified with me in
this mask there's tables between his
legs he doesn't want to hang out with me
my face is a lot sliding here then the
other two face masks a definitely the
DIY version but I actually liked it I
used my favorite I had like a
homeopathic vibe to it I'm for like pH
balance see the skin divides so he was
good if you could possibly smell but I
feel like you can get there have a shawl
the next day you good so I am very happy
to report that the DIY face mask was the
crowd favorite I doubted it for a little
while but it really pulled through if
there is a product whether it's a beauty
product or any other type of product it
doesn't have to be a beauty product that
you want to see me test definitely let
me know in the comments also if you have
a really good sheet mask recipe let me
know that in the comments too because
I've got a pack of 96 treat mash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
