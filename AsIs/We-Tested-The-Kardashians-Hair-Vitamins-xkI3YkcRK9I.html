so you want to know what else I found
out about what's in him yeah what else
is in this yes what Amy is going off of
me right now because he assumes what I
gave him I did did about a poison and
delivered back to him to consume I swear
I swear laughs I am going to but I just
want to tell him what I found out about
these sugar bear hair vitamins the same
vitamins of the Kardashians push on
their social media platforms and they're
following massive which means sugar bear
hair following is massive and as much as
we don't want to admit it
Kardashian news is huge news I heard
more people talking about who kim k was
endorsing for president than the new
york times everything the Kardashians
touch turns to gold
but no one seems to question runner in
the back of that so me and Leticia
decided to investigate and ask the big
question do these supplements actually
make people's hair longer and that
sounds scary
I heard Kern Ashley and hair are you one
of those people that like love to love
them or like love to hate them I love to
hate them don't like the Kardashians but
I'm obsessed with the Kardashian never -
you Kardashian survive anything that
they endorse like immediately becomes
popular well just like ill Hills is he's
good
it's probably another thing that I'm
gonna totally buy into I'm assuming it's
gonna make my hair beautiful how many
have you eaten is your mouth full of
gummies right now it's going to increase
my cool factor I'm about to I respect
her up you have to like do the whole
like I feel like sexy
yeah and how to do that they look all
really attractive peoples I'm sure they
liked conscious of what they put in
their body why don't we like break down
supplement facts yeah
no one knows hair better than a sugar
bear the serving size is two dummies two
dummies only have you been eating two a
day is that why the bottle so low biotin
is a big one that's like yeah jackal
hair no
supplement yeah vitamin A vitamin c
vitamin d vitamin e vitamin b6 and folic
acid yeah
what is that there is this warning here
that says these statements have not been
evaluated by the Food and Drug
Administration this product is not
intended to diagnose treat cure or
prevent any disease there you go we're
gonna test it hi is what you do what we
do here is go out and purchase
supplements and then what we do is we
get these products into the lab for
testing
once we get the data back from the lab
we apply our grading algorithm to score
based on five key metrics efficacy
safety nutrition purity and legal
accuracy was there a surgery that was
involved yeah there's work on I think
what we found was that sugar bear hair
exceeded its label claims so that sounds
like there's a pretty big discrepancy
between its label claims and what you
actually found is that right for a fair
to say sugar very rare contain around
8,500 micrograms of biotin
so one actually really interesting thing
here is the level of leg if you stick to
the two bare serving size recommendation
you're going to be fine but if you are
tempted like many people are I suppose
to take one more then you're going to go
over the California prop 65 limit for
length in a single day and that sounds
scary does it count you know all the
other led that you might ingest in one
day okay with all these supplements and
all your testings would it work yeah in
general would it work if you have
deficiencies your hair skin and nails
will likely be affected in terms of
label accuracy this actually ranks
second second most inaccurate or second
most accurate second most accurate Wow
okay despite all its discrepancies
sugarbear hair still earned an A grade
from the lab okay do you think hair
supplements work I think they do be easy
well in drinking with your ginger
Brazil's so the intention of the video
was not a throw shade or attack the way
the Kardashians make their money but for
you as a consumer to not just buy into
fad but understand what you're putting
in your body you should have the right
to ask those questions and seek those
answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
