stars we have a makeup team of music
video photo shoot all this is gonna be
done in one day let's see if we can make
it out alive my alter ego would be
sneaky pepper because I put pepper on
everything and I wear sneakers a lot
Maya alter-egos name is Gemini but I'm a
Pisces you didn't see that coming
I'd like to be called sriracha ChaCha
I'm kind of like the bag of hot cheetos
of the girl group I'm spicy and I got a
lot of fire in me I'm divalicious I'm
not really a diva but I do command
presence when I enter some of the best
girl groups came from the nineties the
Spice Girls Destiny's Child TLC I feel
like the 90s girl groups were all about
female empowerment it was all about
friendship they could sing they could
act make a dance the girls have less
than 24 hours to get a lot of down
which includes getting their looks down
and getting a dance routine down getting
a song down and also getting into their
characters a lot of pro bands actually
don't stay together so hopefully this
one does because I'm managing that based
on our dynamic I think that we should be
called glitter girls
you need only sparklers
I'm really excited about this because
we're gonna have some extra help with
Ashley Everett who's Beyonce's backup
dancer so she can't help us I don't know
who can how are we feeling y'all oh my
god
I think so I'm gonna say I'm gonna be
the motivating one and say that we're
gonna be fine Laura needs to work on her
steps a little more but she looks for an
chola I looked like a baby giraffe that
was learning how to walk you have to
believe I agree because if you're doing
it wrong if you believe the audience
will believe I'm the stylist brought on
to help these poor ladies find their
signature looks for the video shoot in
the photo shoot we have a sexy sleek
look we have a fun cutesy look we've got
sporty and athletic and crazy skin I'm
so excited to see these ladies all
dressed up pretty much anything that I
touch toward stuff top stars
it was very baby spice I felt I feel
good about that I feel like I stood my
ground it's a true 90s pop star the
props seem like all fun and games and
the photos but I I was hit a few times
fake oh my god everyone's gonna look
similar this and she will walk out in a
black sexy dress and I was just like is
it the bachelor what Nickelodeon show am
I on during my photo shoot I really
tried to channel posh spice I felt like
she's very fierce sexy but super like
serious I really got into character and
had fun with it the photographer was
taking the pictures and I slammed on the
ground and like did this pose I was like
I don't know where that came from
my prop was the basketball which was so
fun I dribbled it I put it over my head
I pretend to throw it I really felt like
I channeled my sporty spice well I got
to sit on this like black leather couch
and wear like Prince all these different
prints channeled my inner Scary Spice
music was pumping people were watching
balls were getting thrown a lot of
different energies on this one set but
it was all fun excited fierce empowering
women energy
go into a music video mode had no time
to really collect my thoughts that we
just had to jump into it interesting to
like dance in choreographer feels like
world for now focus on your characters
and be in the zone and just perform
there's a beautiful so really sell it to
the camera I think we have a fan and he
keeps on coming charts that every minute
I'm number one fans I'm sorry
I listen to all your records what's your
favorite one tell me what you don't want
what you really do not want i was
definitely that girl that was constantly
practicing throughout the set
you should practice one more time before
we have to go on when you have three
other girls behind you you want to make
sure that everyone's on point because if
one of them fuck's up then you all look
bad Sheila put me in the barrack for the
diamond formation nobody puts Baby in
the corner
okay lip-syncing I usually like sing in
the car anyways it just felt like I was
in my car jamming out I did not know the
words as well as I thought I knew them
it's not what I do in a day to day I
don't know if I'm cut out with a little
sassy you guys please get it down what
would you say we need to work on
everything he was like on top of us and
make you sore like not wrong babe don't
do it again for the time we have left we
need a really puppet so get those minds
make sure you're making eye contact make
those words get your positions together
over here stop blocking people she as a
true dancer and a true girl group you
got to do it a million times you have to
keep doing it over until everyone get it
right we did a day being a 90s pop girl
group how do we all feel I'm so tired
kinda bad 24 hours I'm thinking a
 pop group is real it's
really
just to be with all the girls and to
relive my childhood I've have crimped
hair again today made me realize how
much you can get done in 24 hours and
what you can do if you set your mind to
it and you manage to learn a dance to
lip-sync have a song out and shoot a
freaking music video the 90s were all
about girl power and being with your
friends and singing about having a good
time and I think that's always it
come on girl
I'm a girl I'm a girl so we pull of him
me
tell me I'm so
sure
like
we've
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
