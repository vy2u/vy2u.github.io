cried because of meatloaf wasn't grade
today we are trying 1950s beauty tips
hell I don't know anything about the
first I know diners
I know milkshakes I know grease I know
it was an age of conformity
I think I have some fifties beauty icons
that like whenever I see images of the
1950's it's always like women looking
very put together their hair is quaff
like it doesn't look like something that
was like an extremely quick process I
think you were expected to be a
housewife whose job was to tend to their
husband and have children and like
that's it
mom cold cream my mama had this she
still uses this uh that was very
nineteen fifties of me wow this is
really working lipstick go off in just
one way cuz I hate those things that you
have to like wash your face like over
and over again like I'm so easy I can't
do that see my problem anytime I use
this growing up was like it really
smeared all I feel like a beard all over
your face tomorrow I'm gonna have a
pimple I am a little worried about what
this is gonna do to my overall skin like
I have combination skin so it's a little
dry and a little oily and in all the dry
places I feel like
and we go under we too so hot I like it
that's like a spa mad Portugal scared
this is so comforting I feel like we
should have a room like this that we can
just go into yes Wow I feel like a new
person I do feel like nice and sighs I
feel like it opened up my sinuses I feel
like that combined at the ponds cold
cream it feels like I just did like a
moisturizing face mask was that supposed
to like open our pores yeah so then I
guess we've clean after
it's kind of like harming like it's
trying to like abusive I'm already
worried cuz I feel like this to me just
feels like it's like a tantamount to
bleach like it feels like a very raw
soap and I feel like my skin is gonna be
in shock when I get facials the first
thing I tell master not wash your face
with the soap you use for your body so
this can't be good
how my skin on my face gets hot it would
be like exfoliating I love exfoliating I
love it
it's like nice and rough going into this
I expected this to feel like sandpaper
and I wanted to hate it but I actually
kind of love it it seems like to me like
a good zero waste exfoliant
so this is like the cucumber of the
1950's we're about to get teabags
you guys known as the smells get so now
I want some tea this whole routine just
makes me feel like I've been rocked by
my mother's sleep oh my I just want to
go to bed now
it feels really nice I feel like this is
what they would do after they cried
because of meatloaf listen great love
felt so good I honestly think it did
help with the bags into my eyes
if you could eat this then I would buy
into it cuz then it's like you can do
everything with it so I'm gonna do my
arm what are you gonna I'm going to
shave my little pubescent mustache I do
appreciate that about them they use like
one products for everything which is my
brand
I feel the cream getting caught in the
razor I feel this is great for a
probably like sensitive skin so this is
supposed to prevent you from frowning I
guess it works is you have like
something on your forehead so you're
like more conscious of like what's
happening I'm really happy that we're
getting to a place where women are
allowed to have feelings on their faces
I'm like getting extra tape because it's
like my five head do you like bays
yourself in ponds cream just throw - and
tape all that it's like Botox okay I
would absolutely not try this this makes
me want to frown
it's fun it was rigorous when you think
about all the things that we do to like
feel pretty and feel I don't know like
that we're taking care of our skin like
I get it you know but that is so much
work it was way too much I think some I
get like exfoliating and washing your
face or whatever like I got those and I
think I do those though I think what
troubles me the most is the reason why
they did it because you're using so few
products it's super cheap like I'm like
it's been a mall good for the
environment and good for your wallet I'm
sure like so many of the you know
skincare steps and beauty routines from
the 50s and earlier eras definitely led
to like our routines you know cuz you
keep evolving things and you make them
better so thanks ladies thanks for
Mother's
if the apocalypse comes I can't get to a
lush like just bust until Walgreens
