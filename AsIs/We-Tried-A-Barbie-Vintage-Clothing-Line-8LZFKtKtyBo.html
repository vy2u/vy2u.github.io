you can have in this dress and it's like
this one or this one extra credit for
but so I had a lot of Barbies growing up
when I was younger I would go around
bragging told my friends telling them
that I had hundreds of Barbies when
honestly I had probably like 10 I would
bring my Barbies over to my best
friend's house and then we would like
construct our own party club for them to
go to out of cassette tapes the only
thing I wanted was a Barbie Genie game a
Barbie Dream House I wanted the Barbie
car never got that still waiting there's
many more Christmases to go
I am very into vintage style you're like
I wear fit-and-flare clothes every day
I'm kind of excited to try vintage
Barbie clothes it's like sexy with the
curves I think it's dope as hell that
humans can actually wear like replicated
Barbies into something I hope that we're
able to bring a bit of our style into
this and make it our own obviously you
can see like the curves which is really
cool
that'll work in my favor hopefully I'm
really worried I feel like I should have
worn more supportive undergarments today
what to do what to do what to do what to
do what to do what to do what to do what
to do hi I'm Courtney from unique
vintage unique vintage specializes in
vintage inspired clothing and bringing
vintage styles into a modern world for
modern women and an inclusive size range
from extra small to Forex barbie is a
style icon and what we wanted to do with
the Barbie unique vintage collection is
take some of her most iconic looks and
bring them to life or actual grill
people to wear so today four ladies from
BuzzFeed will be trying on some of the
pieces from the line we hope that they
feel just beautiful and empowered just
like Barbie and everything that she
represents
oh my goodness I'm like a lounge singing
mermaid what it really does look exactly
like the way the Barbie look what a
little sailor this is Christmas tree I
love this little pencil skirt come on
Barbie father was out here feels really
high-quality it definitely feels like
this is something that I would only pull
out for special occasions that pound
nice it feels it's like a classic look
that I would actually want to wear in a
modern day time this is like life-size -
Tyra Banks bless me
I like how body hugging it is I'm kind
of into this pin-up look I've never
really done it before we can all see
ourselves as Barbie which was like my
dream growing up and that I'm also in a
horror movie where I'm now small enough
to fit into a Barbies dress basic
Barbies are really expensive these days
but I think that if you have the option
to just get an actual Barbie look that
you can wear yourself that could be even
better Barbie was such a big part of
like art growing up in our lives this is
like kind of like a great way to just be
like I'm doing it but I'm doing it my
way I don't look like Barbie in any way
shape or form but I feel like Barbie and
I love it
