I thought it would be pretty fun to make
my co-workers do the chopped makeup
challenge are you ready for today's
chopped makeup challenge
I'm essence and I'm you nice chopped is
a show on the Food Network where they
give each contestant different
ingredients it could be good it could be
bad so today we're going to be expecting
to get a few normal beauty products and
then some random things that we have no
idea about so the rules are we have
create a cool look we only have 15
minutes to do it we gonna see who's
gonna win today this is the first item
that we get so that's all it is
Lola number two is an eyeshadow brush
item number three is our very trusty
eyeliner what the hell okay you supposed
to do with it
well a lot of youtubers have actually
worked with this especially not a
youtuber lungs we have five I got this
fire yes I'm pretty sure that's a
BuzzFeed headquarters violation bonus
item fire and coconut oil I'm excited to
melt some things laughs I know where's
the meat honey three two I'm gonna just
put a little on here and then I'm gonna
try to fill it in
don't do this hot news wow yeah quick oh
no use the brush she's super oh yeah the
branch isn't fresh I don't want to burn
myself I'm so nervous
oh my god please allow me by myself yeah
this is a hot oil this is the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life
I'm so nervous oh my god I need more
skittle I thought this is gonna be a
real bad yeah okay
we got a bus without I'm just rubbing
chocolate into my skin I meet eyelashes
this hairline is not showing up it's
giving me a little glossy something dewy
trying to make for it where are you
right blue eyeliner situation my
strategy at this point is just like
throw things on my face not pigmented
enough okay I think very well all I
wanted the lipstick that's literally all
I'm asking for
I'm trying to get the pigment out of
these skittles
I'm trying to blend without getting
bread crumbs on my face oh my god oh my
god big man yes this pigment is crusty
what what is going on oh my god I need
just after this little looks so good you
look good too
thank you the hardest part was trying to
get this lip through a skittle literally
it was eyebrows were hard for me yeah I
use Nutella and the way my natural
eyebrows are set up is a hot mess we're
about to go ask me office our judges
what they think yeah let's see what they
think
hey guys you look like pink and cute and
he's definitely going with your outfits
like I wouldn't think maybe I'm feeling
for me it's a tie
I like I would have to go with yours
okay
there's no weird tantor tone to it the
trick is we didn't use any makeup you
skittle crayons that's safe right I'm
gonna win to be honest actually I'm
lying I'm kind of shot because this
looks a hot mess don't try this at home
but do have fun with your makeup and I'm
gonna go to the doctor because I'm
pretty sure I have an eye infection
