bra we're going to prove I'm a pro puck
is with the most blackest beautifulest
festival on the planet freaking earth
I've stocked the festival for many years
but I've never gone it's amazing to see
that many beautiful black faces in one
place has like a no haters manifesto and
no homophobia no transphobia and it's
good music the main thing I know about
Africa life is that there is so much
passion my dream outfit for afropunk
would definitely be like a lacy slip
with some sort of thrift cool jacket
best the highest laughs ones I can
 find and as always like a choker
of some sort I kind of want to get out
of my normal sea of big sweaters than
any t-shirt I kind of want to go towards
the punk side one thing that I don't
really get to express very often through
my clothing is my african heritage if I
could make an outfit that's like a
combination of African prints that I
like and my modern style and that would
be so sick so we're about to head to
some stores trying to find something to
wear then we have like one day I'm just
excited to see what we all end up
wearing out here
so she wants to what so be really cool
to see her wearing something that's a
little bit extra CC what about what
about the see-through shirt and pasties
we shopped around and CeCe found a great
outfit it was a struggle with you she
was about to butter this brown they said
no we still have to find outfits so we
are opted to store number two we're
going to Soho she's gonna pick one of
these sides of shirt Katie for me is
like a style icon something that would
seem like regular fitting on anyone else
and she makes it her own whether that's
cutting it up or just the way she
presents herself it'd be cool to see
what Gothic look on her almost like
doing some sort of a pro futuristic kind
of style would be so sick on her oh my
gosh
of course Katie wanted to come here this
is like the bra and lingerie session
today is like a daily basis let's show
you Katie out of this outfit she's
killing herself
alright are you done you don't you're
trying to like pick tops that are like
cool and edgy or something we inform did
go to FYF fest together so I know what
she dresses like at a festival this
bitch don't play I like showing a little
bit of belly but like not my belly
button because sometimes that's weird
feel like I look like a hot down on
vacation
I love this if I don't find something of
service that I can mix and match
something that have my closet so this
could work see Sierra shopping day is
coming to end how do you feel
we had a successful day everybody got
something nice II got a really cool
holographic but early on Katie looks
like this sexy ass Gothic princess yep
Gothic oh my god guys I predicted this I
can't wait to see what everybody looks
like tomorrow I'll see you tomorrow
Apple bum buh buh I wore the pants today
they're awesome I knew I wanted to wear
African fringe so I threw this in and I
actually match everything kind of fell
together and I'm really happy about that
I think I succeeded I think I look good
I feel confident Cece looks amazing I
love my outfits under there with me but
I made it me I was able to constrain my
nipples so they're not showing 80000 his
mom this morning I pulled out my dress
but as though Jimmy the larger size down
my butt is literally Ric's
in a half
wearing the messers and I tried to keep
me another guy and said eggheads or
Mustang earlier and you know I I think I
killed it
