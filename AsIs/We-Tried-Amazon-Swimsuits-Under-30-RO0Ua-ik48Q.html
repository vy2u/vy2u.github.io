wrong with the bathing suit.
Either like the bottom is too small,
or the top doesn't fit,
and it takes me like, literally forever
to find something that looks okay.
(upbeat tropical music)
- I have more of a thicker
like bottom half of my body.
- So, it's really hard to find ones
that contain my actual boobs
without them looking like
I'm trying to shoot a porn.
- I find like being
inside the changing room
is like I'm not comfortable.
- If one part fits, the other
part is usually too big.
- And usually I try on like a million
and still come up empty-handed.
- My expectations of a bathing
suit from Amazon is lingerie.
- I'm a little nervous.
- I feel like it would be a big process
of sending it back and trying another one,
and that sounds like a hassle.
- I actually have high hopes.
- Um, it's not gonna fit.
- I normally don't typically
go for one pieces, honestly.
But, I actually loved it.
I loved how
kind of tight it was,
and like it held everything in and
that really took the cake,
I thought it was really nice.
I thought it was really cute.
Slaying bathing suit
slaying my life. (laughs)
- I was very pleasantly
surprised with all of the suits.
The material was super soft
and the cuts were great
and actually flattering.
I would 100% recommend buying
bathing suits on Amazon.
- The suits were surprisingly good.
I might size up one size,
just so it's a little
less scandalous looking.
But I liked them.
The material was good,
it seemed like it would last a few years.
My favorite was the black one.
I really like a good plunge.
I like a lot of cleavage,
but I also like some
coverage with the cleavage.
- I was happily surprised.
I thought there were some
pretty good ones in there,
and I was truly surprised
at how well they fit.
The material was good.
It was definitely a much higher quality
than I expected, to be honest.
The design on all of
them was really great.
I thought they were so cute.
Still, a little tweaking could be used.
But, they were great.
- I would 100% recommend
people going on Amazon
maybe for a cheaper price.
- I'm surprised that they
were all under 30 dollars.
- Yeah, I think I would be more likely
to shop for a suit on Amazon.
But having said that,
I'm still a little nervous about it.
- I think the most surprising thing
was definitely the quality.
It seemed like you could really like
go swimming and lay on the beach
and have the sand really get in there
and it's not gonna fall apart.
