$100 oh and we're gonna see how many
outfits we can get hopefully they fit we
have literally early 11 days to get
these clothes try them on and get to
Columbia bathing suits could be an
option dresses and we don't and those
anything you want it just has to be on
there under 100 at least three outfits
I'm excited
we're stressed out about this traveling
all right well let's get to shopping
why don't we do on the budget I did good
I did a hundred dollars and 25 cents I
did a hundred even
I went over by 12 dollars but I think
you guys will see this hat was yeah I
don't really have time to make mistakes
here so what we got is well we're
wearing and you can judge us and write
the comments about our body all right
let's do it
day one
we have a really good color gasps oh
yeah right now I was nervous about these
because like I'm gonna this is something
I would never wear Oh like the Asian
beachy vibe yeah it was a bad choice for
an intern my but I don't hate it it's
really comfortable I feel like I I
belong on a boat for sure right and then
I have a surprise for you guys
oh it was only $15 and I feel like it's
really cute my ass is out so I will save
you guys the trouble of seeing that full
day but I feel great it's a little yeah
this is a look can't we just talk about
yeah yeah I'm trying to be more daring
guys the fabrics not bad it's like oh
yeah it's like you know yeah I decided
to not wear a bra this is a little scary
it's free it feels great it's just
I she approved you needed to go out and
beat three girl you're gonna get all the
boys to the yard so beautiful right now
she's reading okay let's see what's next
today let's talk about this gorgeous
colors think about like the pops color
yes on my Instagram and your pockets
yeah that is yeah I like this bag right
it's nice it feels like good for the
beach because it's waterproof in a way
yeah guys cat this cat Explorer at $11
my biggest thing is I am pale and
they've got so I don't have to go with
like full-length light sort of things
and I have another surprise for you guys
it's high-waisted so it's like I think
trendy right this is what the can wear
and once again he's assholey up and
let's talk about this yeah Beauty super
cute I like it cuz it's like very loose
but like oddly flattering and it's very
soft which I was honestly very worried
whoa that I had a nice blanket to hit on
the text
and you have another way a second one
that was like sexy lingerie like you're
getting the late on this trip yeah I
feel like this is almost for lingerie
than beach cover-up but hi yeah yeah I
love that I kind of feel like it's less
of a beach cover-up and more of a pool
cover Oh tile not like so I definitely
debated whether or not I wanted to keep
it but I do want to try it out there
this is outfit 3 for when red our
leisure time go to the beach Jos for the
city of Cartagena what did what do you
think of here so the only reason why I'm
pissed about this is in the picture it's
totally mad and when I got it it's fully
see-through so like I have to wear
something under it and also can we talk
about this slit well yeah it's a
cover-up and I thought it was more of
like a dress look at that
it's perfect for how hot it is I live in
New York yeah I like it a lot I would
wear this to work yeah uh-huh I like I
do get metrics yeah I like the pattern
yeah I like the left
the ground yeah our grants have been
and this honey yeah yeah this is I love
maxi dresses but you never know if it's
just gonna kind of like bitch yeah you
feel like God you know and his halter
neck is like ski yeah I feel like it's
always dangerous getting something
that's like accentuating the neckline
but that totally works
it's yes and the length is perfect yeah
so humid so this will not stick too much
yeah every bathing suit under it yeah
you you would have one done this just
totally was one of those showed up
looking nothing like the actual model if
the material is really cheap it's like
feedings to my nipples are just here so
don't want to get to monetize I'm gonna
say that for you guys but this was
supposed to be my fancy cocktail dress
and it's just not gonna work can we talk
about this yeah vintage I am sure the
wheat hearts I love this yes is so
perfect one thing I will say is that
this it's not like the nicest material
it's not the zipper is really cheap
every time I have a height I'm getting
it oh it is too tiny
I'm gonna have to be the hell my fingers
are like yeah me doing to people plus
the person in the dress look at this
back to me with a bow yes so cute looks
like for the twenty-something dollars it
was and so were thought oh yeah yes
I didn't realize Kate Moss's gyros
perfect Lumia risky risky King ten out
of ten I just love it out of that I took
a huge risk getting something so crazy
from Amazon he did but I was like you
know what it's just so fun you can't
upstage the bride oh I don't want to do
that I just want to look cute my
Instagram you do and it's like surprise
you're short yes it fits really well
yeah it fits your but like it's it might
have to get one of these we're gonna get
on a plane we're gonna take these babies
for a ride this is going through like
fun probably very humid rd8 we're taking
some party buses but going on folks I
think some of these are gonna come back
ripped I'm just gonna forget well
sannomiya and then we'll insert all the
grams we take montage here
when I feed it I wish the Grove and
bought it

this dress originally cost $5 and I went
and won their half off days so I bought
it for a whole lobby
