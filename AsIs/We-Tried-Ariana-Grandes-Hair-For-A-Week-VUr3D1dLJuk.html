you know human kiss right now I just
want to emphasize how much I have a girl
crush on ariana grande my challenges
might be a little different than the
other girls because I'm a mom I feel
like it's gonna be a lot to have on your
head 24/7 the reason why this just
became an iconic look was because her
hair was apparently so damaged from
dyeing it so much from her Nickelodeon
show the only hairstyle that could work
with the high ponytail sometimes what
you think is a fault ends up becoming
one of your biggest assets Caesar who is
Ariana Grande's hairstylist is actually
coming in to give us our looks
he custom-made our weaves I'm a
celebrity hairstylist I work with
celebrities like ariana grande Demi
Lovato Ciara so the inspiration behind
this look was superstar really hi I'm
Daniel chinchilla and I'm a celebrity
beauty artist when Cesar and I are done
these girls aren't gonna recognize
themselves what inspired the hair
jewelry really was just to change it up
you know every girl if they wear the
same hairstyle every day they're gonna
get bored or tired or want something
different it's just natural and so after
a while we just started playing with
different things I introduced some hair
jewelry into it we had some really cool
pearl beads that we created some really
great braiding going up the sides and up
the front of the head the front was gone
I had the ponytail line I turned around
in the chair and I was shocked to see
myself because I haven't seen myself
with straight hair and let alone a full
new hairstyle in less years definitely
different than any type of pup - I've
ever experienced and I first saw the
pony after Caesar
I could not believe that was actually on
my head and that it looked so great
Caesar comes out with these Bunji hair
ties to wrap my hair because I just have
a lot of hair no joke it was that tight
that I felt like I got a facelift
he used a toothbrush to slicked back my
hair and give it that nice sleek finish
it really took three people in 45
minutes to get that pony on there and
having your hair done and having the
glam squad come into your makeup I felt
like a celebrity
the girls are done that was fun three
ponytails three different versions all
inspired by the looks that we did on
Ariana on her tour it definitely got
some looks that were like what is this
girl doing with the 32 inch long
ponytail what do you think I'm on it man
I'm getting like ariana grande Demi
Lovato vibes right now and I'm so here
for her pony was the center of attention
people didn't see me they saw the pony
like where's my Sheila baby who's like
every cool kid on Instagram that I'm
okay are we on the scene okay all right
yeah yeah I'm walking down Hollywood
Boulevard with my knight in shining
armor security guard
protect me and I want to make sure no
one attacks her thinks that she is
Ariana right now so at night I'm gonna
recommend that they wrap their hair and
a scarf so that it keeps everything
really tight and compacted for the
actual length of the ponytail I'm gonna
suggest that they roll it up into a high
bun honestly I think this might work
that wrap totally fell out last night
can I got our rat's nest thing going on
I'm gonna try to just like back brush it
can you figure out how to do this then
I'm gonna need more than one cup of
coffee we're on the Disney tram my hair
is acting cray my hair was getting
leaked into a frizzy proof ball on the
table and then Lou the other hair was
getting like so slick and the curl was
falling out I could not keep those girls
in that ponytail who saved my life so I
just got done shooting with ladylike and
they tried the Ariana Grande's dual
challenge and I'm gonna try and do it
one woman one stool one weave
I got on that's the first part maybe I
just ran two miles and no lie ahead hold
my ponytail like this through some of it
because it was so heavy it's like so
sweaty on me I'm gonna try to like
shampoo the ends and maybe like up here
I can't wait to take a shower
so yesterday I struggled with wrapping
my hair I used my pillowcase but I was
like all right day two I'm gonna come
prepared I went to the drugstore and I
bought a hair wrap I washed the pony and
it feels so much better this smells good
but I couldn't really get all of the
shampoo else so it might just make me
itchy which it's not a good thing but
we'll see at least it smells good and
it's good the hair looks intact my edges
are all right right no but I definitely
gotta go get some edge cream is very
secure velcro contraption Caesar would
be super proud I got my hair at that guy
the bun and I feel ready for bed so all
the cool people are going out for
Halloween but me I'm to a country
concert at the Hollywood Bowl I just had
to put some cat ears a black dress and
one
Ariana Grande going for the look that
she had in her music video so way
because my roommate is also going to be
dressed up as Mac Miller this is
literally Mac Miller sweatshirt like Mac
Miller might have sweat in this
sweatshirt still brushing gotta get that
pony oh do I look like Ari I think
you're getting there I'm almost there
what am I missing
I just remembered we're back from the
concert
you think the pony keeps you on public
anymore more than a red SoulCycle we're
about to recreate the Ariana Grande and
Nicki Minaj
video of anniversary ladies I felt like
this Pony is gonna add a little more
workout I was definitely nervous wearing
the tiny loli it's hard in the beginning
your legs are attached in that thing and
mine just kept like going and so I could
not stop and I was so out of breath it
was not even funny and where's the
McDonald's y'all I feel strong so my
head hurts a little bit by a little bit
I mean a lot my legs are sore from
SoulCycle who would have thought it's
great for massaging the hair cuticles
like honestly I could just do this all
day this is just my therapy because of
how tight it is so at the end of the
night and I'm kind of over this pony and
there's been over 10 bobby pins that
I've taken out so far I think this is
literally implanted in my brain Oh
clearly this should be done by a
professional we're gonna go on a
scavenger hunt by the rest of these
bobby pins so I bought some rubbing
alcohol and I guess I'm just gonna douse
my head in it I don't know they're like
really stuck good so update we're almost
there a little more vodka the way I okay
good I got one out um a little tape
thing here that wasn't too bad
got it out in ten minutes bye bye ponies
is everything that was in my hair today
there's the aftermath of everything I
walked away learning a lot about myself
and also having mad respect for Ariana
she is a queen and if her ponytails
hurtin or if she's exhausted it does not
show at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
