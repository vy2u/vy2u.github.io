eyebrows did this festival season you
can put your flower crowns aside get rid
of those metallic tattoos because guess
what people L&amp;amp;L eyebrows we're gonna
cover for new looks perfect for
Coachella eyebrows so we started with
the most mild look this is called the
sunset brow we took the copper 3d brown
tones and brushed it through the entire
brow and then we took that rich magenta
color and just dipped it along the end
of the brow to give it this almost like
vaycay ombre effect if you really want
that color to pay off you can dip in
with a small hard angled brush and apply
color directly to the hair and the skin
this is what I like to call the
headliner if you want to make a
statement this festival season this is
your brow this one I used a deep blue
and I brush the brows upward and then we
added gold flakes just to the end to
give it that almost bougie brow effect
this is perfect for after the festival
is over and you're going to one of those
late night parties and you really want
people to look you in the eyes nothing
frames it better than the galaxy brow so
what we did is we blended four different
colors the rich purple the magenta the
blue and even the copper to kind of
marry those and like a Milky Way effect
but then to kick it up a notch we ate a
tiny Swarovski crystals through the
brows now just to give it a little
glimmer
my personal favorite gets stoned in the
desert we took that earthier color and
we brushed that copper all the way
through the brow and then took that
turquoise gems and place them just above
the brow so it's basically frames for
your frames
it was Coachella a BuzzFeed today and my
eyebrows were getting all the attention
I love yes I'm rocking with it I
actually do like them and I don't think
that like out of the ordinary you know
you've made it when the global brow
expert comes and with your brows I
want to see a thing to get my brows to
Sparkle I can't
are they sparkly and I can't see are
they glittering does it look like an
Instagram filter I felt confident with
them on even though it's an odd look for
the daytime I didn't have time to wash
off my eyebrows stuff before going to
work so I'm about to go tutor like this
little butterfly this look definitely
looked more natural compared to the
other girls I mean their looks for bold
and awesome but this is something I feel
like I could rock every day I feel like
it's a perfect summer look too just like
when going to brunch with friends like
you know we gotta elevate elevator level
casual I love this look but where does
the girl fight gold flakes I know
probably Amazon Amazon has everything
but I don't know if I would actually
replicate that with the gold flakes
unless I'm like truly trying to fall out
for Coachella look how cool my brows
look Christy you reviewable beautiful
faces sunshiny hair
and like you could do this to mountains
like the Sun so like wow so weird series
a compliment but I'm saying that like it
works
they give me a very extraterrestrial
feel what do you think about my eyebrows
I think it's exotic it is it's not it
it's it's you know it's a look I feel
like this is your vibe too because I
feel like you wouldn't do anything crazy
yeah so I feel like it's like it's
they're done it's just enough you're
going somewhere but it's not like overly
like wow I love all these new trends in
the beauty world that are like so
empowering and like push you to be a
little bit wild and creative when your
expression festivals are kind of
naturally a really accepting place and
there's like a camaraderie behind it
when you're all there to just like have
good vibes good times I would go out
dancing in these live it up a little
this year it's all about the Browse
let's see what next year has in store
for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
