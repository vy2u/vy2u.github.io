clowns
I haven't really found like a single
mass product that will take care of all
of those things at the same time I want
to look like Lady Gaga's applause cover
listen let's just have a great time face
paint party face paint party this looks
just like a painting like set yeah for
kids this is like a bob ross for your
face bob ross skin care what what look
are you going for non clown I'm gonna go
with some black here how many pores
oh it's cooling it's very cold
this feels just like rubbing paint on
your face but soothing usually if
there's like a tingling sensation but
it's literally just it feels like cold
paint on the face I get low like crow's
feet in the corner of my eyes you know
and so I'm gonna use this for like that
I guess I'm gonna provide nutrition on
tired and dull skin with a yellow I feel
a little bit like no long painting your
face like one side of my face is like
this you know when she like Simba
can you put it on me and I'll put on you
yes so Lady Gaga has read like outside
like kinda like Sumerian yeah oh man wow
you really layered it on there so I have
put more on I wanted it to work let's go
do it all of your lives you're looking
like a terrifying clown you're looking
like a kind of you feel like a clown
okay
sorry after doing a brush this doesn't
feel right
I actually prefer using painters because
I feel like you get that like
skin-to-skin contact come off as like a
finger girl for sure Vicky just for
dinner
look I blended it where are the lines
snatched face okay I'm just going for
clown that's the only thing left to do
don't get me wrong I like multi-masking
I do it all the time at home but I feel
everything working nothing feels like
it's work am i beautiful now Hugh aren't
gorgeous
when I was washing my face mask off they
accidentally ate some of it it was kind
of sweet my face was kind of tight but I
think that's cuz I just have really
sensitive skin and I just need some
moisturizer like ASAP it's a fun
activity but I'm not seeing results not
immediate results at least maybe
tomorrow I'll like come to work and my
skit will be flawless all I have to say
is does this look like my face yeah this
is maybe when it's like you have a
sleepover with your gal pals and y'all
get a little bit drunk and you paint
each other's faces and then you make out
a bit like that's probably what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
