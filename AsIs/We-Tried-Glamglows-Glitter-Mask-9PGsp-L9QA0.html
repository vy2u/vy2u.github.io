beards and now it's my time it's my time
for a glitter beard
today we are trying glam glows glitter
mask that's a mouthful glam glow is the
 best they're not around
with that name they make you glam and
they make you glow basically I
use face masks whenever I like happen to
impulse buy one like buying chocolate
and like yeah and a face mask is gonna
be my night I have pretty oily skin I
love using mud masks I feel like my skin
is pretty sensitive so I don't really do
them all the time I don't know what the
glitter will actually do like cleaning
up glitter is not fun I'm scared to
willingly put a bunch of glitter all
over my face that may never come off ooh
a meet in Hollywood because it's glam
how they would so I guess I'm gonna be a
Hollywood star now so by serious
skincare now in glitter oh my god we got
a little pot we got a little dipstick
that's not right
it's a brush whoo so it's sparkly I
copied a star glitter smells really good
too it's like fruity you could almost
drink it if you wanted to apply a
generous even layer to clean skin with
brush avoiding eyebrows and surely once
completely dry gently peel off from
edges they want a good peel - I stirred
it a Gupta dipped it alright I guess
we're gonna get right into it
whoa holy I love it I look like I
fell into a Michaels store or something
I feel like I'm turning my face into a
galaxy
I'm the universe no I'm not feeling like
any of the texture of the glitter what
is this smell why do I feel like I'm
drinking a pina colada right now yet
have black goo on my face I'm very
confused I feel like a little galaxy
everyone gravitate around me but math
seems super boring now that I have
glitter don't know if I'm ever gonna go
back to them now that I covered my face
in black goo I'm gonna sit here for 20
minutes
I'm ready to peel this off I'm so much
hair on my face this is gonna hurt look
oh yeah it seems to be coming off pretty
easy oh here we go
oh I got some hairs in it oh no no no no
oh that hurt that hurt tada
ah oh yeah mama ooh I love it
it looks like I still have some residue
so I shouldn't wash that off with a warm
cloth the hashtag glitter mask is off my
face and I feel rash my skin
feels nice
it wasn't messy at all it didn't leave
any glitter behind honestly it's not as
tight as other masks and that's a good
thing like whenever ever take off a mask
and it's too tight afterward I feel like
a new oyster Iser this is not to drying
and I have really dry skin I think I
would try this again I felt very
beautiful and glittery it's definitely a
fun thing to indulge in it makes your
skin feel nice and gives it a very
interesting sensation glam glow he
 did it
who's even doing this no one no one can
master the glitter masks and they
 did it
another good thing is you get to walk
away with this you can't hang it on your
wall you put it on your dog on your cat
you can just lay it wherever you want
and people will have to see the contour
of your face
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
