 shot this is insane okay hello
all I'm jasmine and as you may or may
not know I am obsessed with lipsticks
every color every finish every brand I'm
here for it recently the company ciate
London sent us their new lipstick line
called the glitter flip and I was like
what the is glitter flip apparently
it's a matte lipstick that you put on
wait for two minutes then rub your lips
together and there will be glitter
glitter will just appear I'm a skeptic
at heart so I'm not sure if this is
actually gonna work but I figured I'm
gonna try it out okay my lipstick is off
and now I shall try glitter flip and
iconic
all right now we wait two minutes all
right so it's been two minutes
my lips are feeling good like I noticed
there's a little bit of like a low-key
shimmer to them after you wait about two
minutes you're supposed to rub your lips
together and then glitter should appear
do you see this what the hell my lips
look like a galaxy oh wow
okay honestly do you see this do you see
this what this is legit all right so I
am completely shocked by this I can't
believe that these literally flip and
turn from that to glitter but I need to
show some people and I'm gonna walk
around the office and show some of my
friends Oh sissy okay I got some
lipsticks and they're really cool and
I'm looking for people to try them would
you try them okay cool nope just put
them on just put on the nice little
stroke oh okay now we're supposed to let
it dry for two minutes all right so see
it's been two minutes rub your lips
together hello what hold on I know where
all the more I press it
glittery again it hasn't moved it hasn't
liked bunch since I like passed my lips
together so that's why they look like a
glitter lipstick Wow let's go see if we
can find someone else to do this Oh
Devin what's up I got some new lipsticks
and I wanted to see if you'd try them
out okay oh I'm gonna use this pink one
this pink baby because it's nice you're
supposed to just apply like one even
stroke and then we'll let your lips sit
for two minutes and then the magic will
happen all right now keep your lips
apart and we're gonna have to sit for
two minutes all right all right Devin
it's been two minutes it's just so hard
rub those lips together are you sure
positive this makes my Claire's dreams
come true because pretty good it's very
pigmented
if the smooth finish I was able to put
it on in one swipe I'm into it I'm like
really into it awesome thanks Justin yes
all right
need to find people need the fun Oh
Freddie I tried these really cool
lipsticks and I want people to try them
yes I'm down okay yes I'm drawn to this
one I mean I know it's matchy-matchy
with what I have on but like no it's
cute oh and I just got my lip waxed
feeling it yeah and then let it dry a
little bit and then we can rub your lips
together okay since you minute
all right now look into the mirror and
I'm gonna have you rub your lips
together all right go ahead
what wow it actually this lipstick is
like matte but with glitter how how I
feel like people try to achieve this
look but have to use two different
lipsticks as opposed to just being able
to use one
I'm into it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
