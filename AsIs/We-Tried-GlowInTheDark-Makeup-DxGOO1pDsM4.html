sleigh fell into nuclear reactor ringers
today we're gonna try some
glow-in-the-dark makeup I feel like
we're about to be like in a cash a music
video or something like it would have
really come in handy for like rain or
high school dances pride festival day of
but then carry over into night time like
when it gets dark you're just still
glowing even though the rest of you is a
mess I feel like I'm gonna try to do
something artsy and I also know that I'm
going to fail because I'm not very artsy
when you're working with
glow-in-the-dark makeup it's not really
about like precision and a natural look
gonna look like somebody
glow-in-the-dark paint ball gun real
effects everything looks good in the
dark
let's get glowing I'm gonna try the pink
mascara and hope that that looks cool I
have a feeling that you're gonna do
embarrassingly better than me like
you're just gonna absolutely put me to
shame which probably I guess is uh we
can do this I feel like we're to rain I
wait this looks of words in mid dark you
said this lipstick that I'm trying right
now it doesn't go on very like thick or
solid beard beard no beard glow beer
look at it this looks radioactive I feel
like I'm gonna get Spidey powers this is
a true blow up
where were you when that boy wouldn't
dance with me in the sixth grade the
eyes are the next to this someone of the
face I love the face it's also it's a
little bit like a crime lab and they
look for comes in the wood a blend I do
the black light should I give myself a
unibrow well girl if you don't I'm going
to what is it happen when we turn the
lights on that is always on at the end
of the night um doesn't it oh it does
it's uh it's a choice my frigging high
relegates Amaury sunrise oh she is a
bitch as I said boom calendar no there's
no blending your mistakes I'll see if
they'll live with what you did
oh my a concept I feel like this look is
only really meant for like the dark I
look my best in the dark
oh come through I'll I feel like xenon
that's disappeared I'm sure now they
will really only focus on that cuz
nothing else is drawing attention I'm
talking about this is subtly it's
probably a good idea to leave like
simple honest ancestor if I want the
lights to come up I know what I look
like in this room and that's what I will
keep in my heart there's a beauty mark
too much we look so good right now and
you can want to life come on we will
still have done a very good job that
doesn't go away my lights come on oh
well not as tragic as oh it's tame ok
but we both look better with the lights
off just the truth we look better with
the lights off I actually like love my
eyes like yes right it looks better in
the light don't you're an action walk I
want this for the next like event that I
go to honestly I really think that
boldness is like all of these colors
really forces you to push the boundary
makeup is all about expressing yourself
if you feel like this is what expresses
you honey
 do it go hard or go home and I
choose to go hard neither of us will be
going home
glow-in-the-dark makeup party I don't
know what the end goal is oh honey I
think we know what the end goal you bold
that's what I call me I'm boldly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
