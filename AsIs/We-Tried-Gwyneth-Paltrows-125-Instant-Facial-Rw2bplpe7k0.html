really does it smells like I mean but
not a bad way cuz I like crab I'm not
quite sure how I feel about her skin
care regimen / line goop it doesn't
sound like a beauty product it sounds
like a bathroom product coupe I feel
like she's done like a lot of crazy
stuff with Beauty like was she putting
placenta on her face I never understand
any of the things that are in her
products
oh that's Anna different language
infused into high-tech formulas that
deliver immediate and ongoing results I
don't know what that means
oh it's daffodil and sweet iris leaving
your skin smooth even and luminous
luminous that's a great word it sounds
like it knows what it's doing
I don't know much about poets daffodil
or sweet iris but I do want my skin to
be luminous so circular motion so baby
circle oh it helps to even skin tone yay
tingly is like a nice way to say it
there's something there's something
going on I can feel it this seems to be
tingling Oh like a lot more than other
parts of my face especially like on my
nose it feels like millions of tiny
needles in my face I don't know I like I
wonder if I'm like psyching myself out
and be like that what tingling feels
like this is my choice to keep it on
because I just don't want to I want that
glow I want the glow and now we wait
time to take it off guys we're not
wasting time we're not playing with Gwen
what if like the light was it was just
like oh I look fresh and renewed like I
just got back from much rip it
definitely feels smooth much smoother
than my face felt before did she go to
the Barbados no she didn't she just used
some goop I guess I do kind of have a
little bit of a glow going on like look
at the way that light is hitting this
skin I definitely feel refreshed I'm red
here this maybe is my fault maybe I left
it on too long bow cut cut my skin feels
a little tighter oh my gosh I had no it
kind of feels
weird okay I think I would need to like
wait a few hours and see what it looks
like if that makes sense so maybe it
cleaned all my pores out maybe that was
the name needle stabbing feeling was the
cleaning of the pores and they still
smell like crabs so that's nice my skin
doesn't burn anymore and I think it
looks less red they did something good I
look cute I'm hoping that this lasts as
long as this tingling on my face it's
not like glowing enough that I wouldn't
want to put makeup on but it is glowing
not even being dramatic I am a huge fan
of this like my skin feels really smooth
and I think it looks like I did
something and it's not like shiny glow
where it's like it's just like I'm
naturally radiating $125.00 little thing
you won't catch me getting this it
doesn't have like crazy results that I
kind of expect out of something that's
this expensive don't be afraid of the
burn and the red because it will go away
and you will have glow you will have
glow do you want this stuff or don't you
want that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
