could be this is euro if missus me hi
I'm Emily I'm Farrah I'm Nina and today
we're going to be using Hot Topic
products to recreate old email looks in
high school I was what the kids called a
scene kid I used a lot of really bright
eye shadows I loved combining rainbow
shadows and liner here are all of the
colors that my hair has been pink blue
black orange when I was like going
through my emo phase I would like do
eyeliner on the waterline like with the
pencil I really wanted to do was just
use like black black black I was such a
huge fan of Hot Topic
I specifically liked going in there and
looking at all the band shirts lots of
hair dye lots of colored eyeliner those
gloves that like had the figures cut out
I think my freshman year I would wear
those all the time with 2018 Hot Topic I
don't know what to expect
honestly I haven't been into a hot topic
in so long this is interesting a little
bit of familiar and a little bit of new
these have little skulls on them which
seems very on-brand for Hot Topic oh my
god I would have died for this when I
was a kid alright here we go we got some
bright colors to work with here metallic
glitter body crayons intergalactic I
think the colors are really pretty
neutral so the makeup look that I am
going to be creating from the past
emo Farah is a very colorful look so the
photo that I'm gonna be recreating is a
mishmash of purple and aqua blue eyes
I know all over my eyes because I don't
have any photos of myself decked out
fully Teemo I'm going to be recreating a
look of Ryan Watts used to be like these
crazy bold eye looks that were like dark
it weird and artsy oh yeah baby so
bright you really want to get it like
touching your eyebrow that's the look I
am actually really loving this glitter
and I wish that was an option
Oh awful like I can't ever believe that
I got used to this feeling of just like
stabbing myself in the lower eye now you
get to do the bottom in green if I was a
teen nowadays this would be really good
like starter makeup a part of why I feel
like this isn't working is that in this
period of my life my hair was all black
with like blue bags so I'm blonde today
with like brown brows and it's like
throwing off the whole vibe that was
missing from all of this stuff where is
the red red is a very emo color it's
like black and red I feel like the
colors of the emo flag oh my god this is
really taking me back to how I looked
frizzy that I think I could do a good
job with this with like makeup that I
actually have and not Hot Topic makeup
which seems counterintuitive like Hot
Topic should be making the makeup that
will make me look like Ryan Ross this
feels pretty light in terms of
consistency of the mascara come on blend
baby blend it's like a fine line between
having like a black eye and looking like
a clown kind of interesting too because
we have all this makeup as though it's
so similar did I ended up only using a
few products I thought I was gonna go
ahead with the product the final piece
of this disaster look everybody needs
their Monroe they're fake monroe
piercing and give myself a butyl err
look by
partying that heavy side part you know
so basically you just find like you know
the farthest place on your head and then
you just bring it all over I think that
I'm done I think I've done the best that
I can do with the tools I was given
there weren't quite the right colors
that I needed for this recreation so in
that sense it was a little frustrating
because it made it harder it was I had
to focus on like blending two different
colors at once to kind of create the
look and they were two different
textures makeup so that made it really
hard to like make the look exactly what
I wanted it to be I think the Hot Topic
makeup was decent but it just didn't
give me that vibrant eye that I was
looking for with what I had right here I
just don't think it was possible to make
that in 2008 look Tommy diamond this
look was inspired by soon your old email
face you know wasn't shy and really
didn't care about putting bright colors
on her face even when people were
looking at her well I guess I'm gonna go
show people this look and hope that they
accept me are you sad are you crying
oh is it you know cuz myspace is
bouncing like okay and I get the
disconcert like livin it up kind of
warped but like you know the sorority
girls who are into war it's not like the
full-on oh cool oh you look so singing
so seen oh my god I look like I have two
black eyes oh my god but that was the
look right it was it's cool because it's
like rainbow um you're trying to be emo
yeah I think this is like not as like
crazy as like you know just black all
over my face but this is like you know
it's pretty I feel like you could just
wear this just because where do you
think of my makeup you look like you
have candy stripers on your eyelid so
remind you of anything in particular I
feel like
is it emo or yes yes where I got the hot
topic yeah you're right
Wow people are gonna guess me know I
know I lived that life oh my god you
look like a 2016 kid from MySpace you
like had so many myspace followers thank
you this was wow
wait no you need to do it from this
angle there it is there it is work they
were decent in terms of quality I would
definitely use them again for like my
day to day look maybe like the high
leaders were cute and I didn't make it
to touch them because they weren't what
I was going for it it's a thing there
weren't a ton of dark colors in them so
I would use them just like to use them
but I wouldn't to recreate a true email
look none of my co-workers could guess
what this look was supposed to represent
today and when I told them that this was
about 16 year-old Farah war as a scene
kid on a daily basis they were shocked
the only person who wasn't surprised was
one of my best friends I texted from
high school and I just sent her a
picture of my face and asked what they
reminded her of and she immediately knew
that it was something we rocked like
back in oh six or an O seven I think
that in 2008 this would have been a very
edgy look and I stand by my original
photo but I think in 2018 it's a little
too crazy for everybody so even though I
am still
I'm gonna put this look back in the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
