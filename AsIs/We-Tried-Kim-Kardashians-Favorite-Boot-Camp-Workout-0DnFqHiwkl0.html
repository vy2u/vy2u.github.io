worried I was in Ireland drinking
Guinness beers
hi my name is Alex saffet i'm a senior
instructor at Barry's boot camp so

combination of the treadmill in the
resistance training on the floor
it is a fat-burning machine then the
Navy I went through actual camp in this
was a lot like get half the class to
spend on the treadmills half the classes
spend on the floor Monday is gonna be
arms and abs it's raining outside I
think this is symbolize my fat that's
crying I feel like Chrissy Teigen Jif of
her just going like Tuesday I'll be
button legs Wednesday chest back in a
little bit of ABS soo so I can't even
breathe Thursday's our core day and
Friday Saturday and Sunday is full body
so you're gonna get a little bit of
everything just got home and I could
really open the front door editor how
I'm gonna type on my keyboard today Oh
doing the five times a week for 30
classes at first one I agree to the
video I was like oh yeah I could do that
I used to work out a lot I think I kind
of shot myself in the foot can't get any
sleep I'm too worried I'm gonna miss the
class and also I can't socialize and
have a couple drinks because I know I
have to get up at 6 a.m. to do this
insane workout thanks Barry I'm not
gonna let my thyroid problems that made
from achieving the goal I got more
frustrated and I let myself go this much
all I'm doing is using this to
kick-start a healthier lifestyle for me
and if it can help condition my body to
not hate cardio so much because I hate
running like right now the only place I
run to is like the restroom I'm over
this I'm so done after the class
everyone's like hey gang yeah how's your
day house out Michael yourself I'm not
the type of person that complain
Eli seems to be having a really hard
time every morning context in the group
chat eating life up Jesus I hope you can
make it through the rest of the time I'm
sore guys
why we gotta be in shape people I
thought I gotta motivate the rest of the
guy I'm just gonna walk in there and do
it I'm gonna do it we have these red
lights that are super dim and if we call
it sexy lighting and you're working out
you feel pretty vulnerable times the
lights make you just totally forget
about everything today we did it with
the Ingrid she played the whole be off
the eliminate album I was like in
Child's Pose are not to cry oh it's just
channeling Beyonce and just imagine her
singing and like running I like that the
mirror is like right in for the
treadmill so you're just staring
yourself down with like this cool red
lighting it's like you're onstage at a
concert right the way this way yeah yeah
I started to drink protein every morning
cuz I used to have asthma in middle
school my lungs just like can't reach a
certain intensity level
tastes super good and it helps rebuild
your muscles stamp run for the first
three minutes and the mumfie started
hurting James our knees hurting - I'm
too old for this
so I just will go from her now and I had
a dream that I was on a treadmill and I
see how gay I'll freeze I don't know
what this is I'm getting everything I'm
not paying around I could just save this
money and quit in those 30 days you're
gonna get tired that happens she got to
take rest days it's important those two
off days
use them relax it is Sunday the day of
rests and I am at Carl's jr. treat
yo'self
going to the movie theaters right now
Barry's boot camp has been a pain in the
ass I'm gonna order some
popcorn cuz I earned that they got
free popcorn over here and sodas so the
only thing that tastes better than
skinny is free that's right first
emotional obstacle I had two weeks and I
took a picture and acc2 results
definitely brought me down deep down
I've always had insecurities about how
my body looks I've always been the tiny
guy in class have been the tiny guy and
a group of friends so I started
listening to Kane and Bryan from week
two I started taking two shakes after
workout I actually was really overweight
up until I was about 16 I weighed 267 at
the most I remember you know being made
fun of I remember it not being easy at
all
I'm sticking to this I'm gonna make sure
that my after picture is like right you
know I've been struggling with my weight
for the past few years recently I lost
about 30 pounds now I'm really curious
how much further I can push my body for
the first time I ran up to 9 which is
the fastest I've ever run on a treadmill
I also saw one app this morning right
here if I laugh the right way you'll see
ABS kind of right definitely there's no
my arms much bigger
I'm very impressed I can't wait to see
what's gonna happen after no when you
feel like shorts are oh these are fine
and then you sit and your thighs are
like but I put them on and not only did
they fit there was extra room this is
great guys this is really really great
I'm glad that you lied and gotta yell
haven't been going every day they are
killing it I've always been in shape
I've always had ABS somewhere in
adulthood I lost at all I'll admit I am
very self-conscious of
and want to kind of have the confidence
again where that I felt like I lost
there's gonna be days we don't want to
be here but that's what the instructors
for and that's what the community's
about it's pushing through those fatigue
points this was the first workout where
I totally didn't hate my life and I have
to be honest pain and the guys texting
me in the morning he's definitely help
like I'm already awake but I'm just
staring at the ceiling like regretting
everything but there's this Brotherhood
that I didn't expect doing this I used
to dance I like to dance salsa and
bachata and the reason why I stopped is
I'm so conscious about myself I don't
feel sexy I know like once I lose it
i'ma feel confident again I'm gonna feel
sexy and I feel good about myself if
you're not used to doing something like
that is gonna be tough until it
progressively becomes an easy oh I'm
extremely devastated I have more defiant
abs that muscles in my arms and my back
but for some reason once you take the
picture it's just a coal gun I've kind
of hit a slump all of a sudden I've been
craving really bad food I stopped seeing
progress in my waist and torso area
every day I kind of just justified to
myself I worked out really hard at burn
so many calories yeah that's normal to
eat like a giant pizza I hope I'm not
alone in this having to make some
changes because I think my body's
starting to plateau we need to keep
going at
one of our instructor Ingrid she says
abs don't come free and it should I miss
the class at berry so I went to my
24-hour fitness gym and just looking at
myself in the mirror and doing weights
I am massive it's nuts dude
life-changing because I did not look
like this beforehand everyone was pretty
on top of it today I was sweating this
whole shirt was just drifting away it's
good that gotta yell is sticking to the
workout even though he can't run he
decided to do floor work the whole time
and just focus on his abs so I just
found out I was having shin splints and
strepek told me my little under arm
sneakers are not really running sneakers
so what I'm gonna do this weekend is go
to the Nike store buy me some frickin
running shoes I actually woke up sick
this morning with a sore throat still
not feeling 100% but I'm gonna go any
weight if someone like me who hates the
treadmill hardest I was like 17 yet any
time that you tell me put a number I'm
like this is crazy but I'd do it anyways
LA traffic I went up to Ted I am so
proud of myself
ever had this kind of definition could
see my chest I could see my arms see my
abs mostly today was my last day and I
can honestly say I do feel different
when I put on my shirts I like the way
it looks on me I have lost 11 pounds
since I have thyroid problems that
highly doubted it in the beginning I had
to shoot which I had to take off my
shirt I'm gonna take off my shirt I'll
take off my shirt at the end of the day
I'm happy with the results I see I'm
super happy with the progress that I've
made actually my birthday today and I
was at Barry's this morning a year ago I
wouldn't have thought that I'd shoe
working out on my birthday I didn't even
reach all of my goals but this is more
ABS than I've ever had in my whole life
I remember in the beginning of this I
felt like I lost the person that I was
kind of put me in a depression I was
scared of what the results were gonna be
but you just keep going every single day
well I got it showed I love myself again
that confident guy never left I was a
smoker I had short breath this is insane
but I am impressed with the waste that I
can carry just excited to get to the
body I wanna see for those of you that
feel like you struggle with your weight
and it's up and down you're not alone
now where I want to be body wise yet but
I'm also not where I used to be and
that's important thing well this
occurred just some of you all out there
to get on it and you can see results if
you do the time it will show that was
probably the most beautiful thing
because I thought I was never gonna be
happy with myself again we're all just
trying to take control of our own lives
in our own bodies truly a moving
experience and I'm just proud of
everybody
sometimes you mean your mind puts its
own limits on what can you accomplish
next up is a six-pack a big</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
