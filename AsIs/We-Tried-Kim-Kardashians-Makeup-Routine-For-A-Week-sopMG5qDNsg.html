feel like working on the railroad
drawings it's like I've been working on
the makeup on all the live long day
10k snapchatted these are all of the
items she's is on a daily basis one day
while she was in a bathroom on the ice
so I already started to do my makeup
I'll just do it fast and I'll try to
explain it as I go and we're gonna try
and replicate her entirely my makeup
routine in three words had I leaks and
mediums efficient evolving and minimal
quick basic and repetitive it maybe
takes me half an hour from bare face to
face done that's because I'm also like
answering messages and emails my current
make every teen can be done in between
stoplights of a car lipstick eyeliner
concealer 15 minutes I call a lift car
while I'm waiting for it to come I do my
makeup I've been doing the same makeup
routine since seventh grade it's exactly
seven minutes from moisturizer through
lip gloss I think she is someone who was
really good at marketing someone that a
lot of people like to emulate she's
impacted our culture in a way that you
have to be really impressed by I like to
read about him that being said I do
think that there are some things where
it's fair to criticize Kim I just
imagine the pressure that I might have
felt if I was a teenager right now I
can't even understand what it would be
like to try to take a Kardashian like
picture and have that be factored into
my self-worth their emphasis on beauty
as your currency as a woman it does
concern me but maybe I'm wrong I could
be totally wrong
maybe this will show me some new side of
myself that is really important and very
real and very authentic but I do have my
doubts I don't think I've ever seen this
many products just for one person most
of these products I've never seen before
it's not like your average drugstore
makeup I would guess that on this table
is about $800 $800 $600
okay I'm not mad I'm excited to use $50
please cream I'm hoping to look less
tired I want it to be transformative I'm
hoping to maybe take a little piece of
this cheapest piece add that to how I do
my own makeup I want to try on a
different persona on my face see if I
feel different I'm already exhausted
just looking at her makeup we're about
to start this I'm a little apprehensive
just because all of these shades don't
really seem like they remain at all for
my eyebrows or my skin tone
we met at 9:30 to do our makeup and then
by 10:30 we'd only gotten up to the
foundation and I had to run to this
meeting somehow at 12:17 p.m. I am so
only wearing half of my makeup I have
nothing on my eyes no lipstick just a
million layers of highlighter and I feel
like I look crazy what do you think of
my makeup today
it looks cakey a little bit I will say
it doesn't even look like you have any
pores at all your photo ready
it's like lighter but like in a smooth
way and I can see a glow it's just so
subtle it's for other people to see I'm
not necessarily for me to witness it
it's 1257 p.m. and I am finally done
with my makeup for the day today has
been really stressful so far trying to
fit in all the makeup application and
also not doing it very well
the winged eyeliner is horrible I
probably did at least half the steps
wrong
I mention it earlier but I thought I'd
do it but yeah really people seem to
like it but I'm not super inspired to do
this everyday yet my skin is a little
itchy
I guess just cuz I'm using so many new
products so I just got home and I
already have a zit on my cheek I'm
having an adverse reaction I use
something my skin is used to being this
covered and things things on things on
things only to look like I'm not wearing
anything
so usually anyone makeup remover to take
off my makeup today I needed to this was
all on my face that feels a little
upsetting then as soon as I took the
makeup off I noticed that there were
like all these new issues on my skin so
I'm really hoping that's because I did
everything wrong and layered everything
too much and not that my sensitive skin
is just gonna have a problem with all
these products also he's really
uncomfortable today meeting new people I
almost felt continued to explain I
usually don't walk around wearing this
much makeup look like one of those girls
last round about my walls oh my god what
a girl I invest my time lot of things
like putting on makeup is better than
one of them
I just didn't necessarily like sending a
false message about myself last night I
got really drunk and I fell asleep
without washing my face so this morning
dirty is fine the overachiever me is
coming out and I want to do it right
today I have 20 minutes to do this I
don't know if that's possible I feel
like I've been some sort of weird crazy
supermarket sweep
there's
so many steps up without being married
to the video of Kim doing it like I
don't know how she remembers all the
steps you look good I won't kid it looks
really natural do you think there are
better things I should do
yeah you can do a lot 25 minutes but
does anybody in the world do that no so
we're at Disneyland
and it feels really funny to have a full
face to make a bob I just feel really
shimmery not gonna lie on video it looks
really good I feel like that's something
I'll definitely incorporate Matt
Disneyland I went on the Pirates of the
Caribbean ride and a little wet and in
my first worried with oh my god my
makeup it's definitely different for me
being at something just fun and silly
like Disneyland at all thinking about
what I look like or how my face is doing
or whether my makeup is keeping out five
hours into Kim K's makeup it's holding
up pretty good I am starting to get like
a little bit of like that oil this is
very glamorous what I'm realizing is
it's nice to have a second look I had
one look with makeup and not have like a
glam look though I will say I feel like
the rest of me is underdressed compared
to hot glam my makeup in I'm in this
packed bathroom with two other women so
this is gonna be really funny about 20
minutes to do it takes an hour let's do
this today I'm going to be doing it more
extreme than the other day of no
subtlety in New Orleans today and I just
couldn't go through a process of getting
Kim K's makeup on I'm here for a
friend's bachelorette the last thing I
want to do is spend 45 minutes to an
hour putting on makeup so that you can
pay makeup it is looks good honestly I
think this is the best it's ever left
the real trick is to just throw it all
on your face and it'll end up in the
right place can you just two kinds of
mascara which is ridiculous
so clumpy they feel like they're
sticking together I'm realizing for
myself that I just don't like anything
that takes my autonomy away there are
definitely pieces that I'm like ooh I'll
take that with me but there are a lot of
things that I'm like I'm gonna leave
that in the dust the day this video ends
this is all the eyeliner that just came
off my face and it's all in weird
crevices
and this winged eyeliner thing is just
really making me feel fed up and
incompetent I also have a huge bronzer
stain on my new dress that I was so
excited to wear for the first time and I
just want to go to work I don't want to
think about this anymore and guess what
I'm getting forgot a few lemare cream I
did it make apply primer and then I went
straight to the under foundation
highlighter so now I'm gonna redo the
lemare on the places where I didn't do
the highlighter and I hope that it works
out I just figured out the ultimate
downside to this makeup as you sweat
your face literally melts off or some
things to happen here because this is
not the move look at where I am in the
process I forgot to put foundation on
what are you I guess I just start over
it's the end of the day and I just sort
of feel like a shine ball I think it's
fine if this is your makeup routine
because you invented it her makeup
routine is the way that it is because
it's catered to her skin so this doesn't
look good on me I think all this makeup
and all the time is just making me more
stressed than usual and more annoyed
than usual I am all done it definitely
looked different
it comes good in photos but I feel like
when I look at myself and my like mirror
I look questionable and like cakey you
look very glowy you're like JLo the
brows are fierce foundation looks bomb
this is all natural beauty right here I
just want to thank all of the kind
people who have been trying to help me I
got so many good tip on winged
I'm pretty sure I did it wrong but I
appreciate the female camaraderie so
Lindsey here found me in the girls
bathroom trying to be going like that
but center opening and then she taught
me that I should be using every people I
know I would say the best part of this
video it's all the beautiful friendships
I made in the women's bathroom but it
looks beautiful
your skin looks very nice and glowy you
tell you the Kincaid's right what she
wipes her face with a makeup wipe
initiatives on some primer then puts on
a liquid highlighter then foundation
that witch like genius though your pores
are like nice and tight this is a good
look I think Kim K is doing wonders for
me
she ate rich for nothing I have multiple
revelations today I don't mind spending
30 minutes or less looking nice but the
problem that I have is donating
excessive amounts of time to myself that
takes away from doing things that I
actually love to do as women who work
it's like either I guess you are gonna
wake up much earlier or you're late to
work every day so many people have
commented on my face day and my makeup
in general today was honestly the first
day that I felt good about this whole
look so it's my last day of putting all
this on and I'm pretty excited about it
I am a little peeved because yesterday
the girls didn't come get the makeup for
me which makes me think they're not
doing the challenge anymore I'm gonna go
find Justin Nena and see what's up hey
Mina you missing something
I just took two days off because my
parents are here I had this face on for
them this will get put on a lot later
okay since this is the last day I'm
definitely gonna put my own Flair on it
we're going back to back baby thank God
Macy's sent this under pallet for me
because without it my contour would not
have looked as good as it does today
Janice your face is looking pretty bare
right now it's 247 p.m. I'm gonna do my
makeup at 4:00 when I have my first
break of the day clearly this Kim King
technique does not work on your
advantage I try I start every day and
I'm like waiting in the Sun in 20
minutes and then I walk out like this
the under brow highlight is so
good look like yourself just like you
enhanced it with a little bit hotter
always hot my favorite day because it
was the day that we got to use her tips
and tricks and kind of infuse our own
personal style
my face looks perfect but it's also
still something that I would actually do
and honestly why scam it has just never
looked better I think that why Kim K's
fans are so avid and so obsessive it's
because she spent an entire decade
cultivating her brand correct Emily was
very clear when I think that's a lesson
that everyone can take spending your
life being so fully yourself that when
someone looks at something they can be
like oh today Kim Cathy and I think
that's all so I've had such our time in
the last few days is because being
myself and finding out and figuring out
exactly what that is and exactly what
that means is so important to me so
surrendering it so holy
has been such a struggle but it's also
what I realized it's something that I
want to devote even more of my time to
my power to do I've just been thinking
about why I feel a level of frustration
and anxiety that isn't necessarily equal
to what's happening and I feel like part
of it is I did go through four years of
having adult acne where I was spending
enormous amounts of my day just trying
to look what I thought was presentable
all I've been getting is compliments all
week so I have to acknowledge that this
does work but to make this year everyday
look or to have to uphold this just
seems really exhausting to each their
own of course everyone should do
whatever makes them feel confident and
beautiful I just want to look the way I
look but like a little bit glossy ER
with a little bit longer eyelashes and
slightly Pinker lips I think that's my
go-to look still
you taught me well but I couldn't go
through with this whole routine for
another day so damn tedious I'm the
other thing was that they didn't think
that I look nice but a lot of them were
like oh I think your makeup look good in
photos now I'm not getting photographed
that much I'm trying to look good in
real life up close near people you think
I have an $800 face I think you have a
priceless vase babe do you think my face
looks $700 more expensive than it
normally does absolutely not great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
