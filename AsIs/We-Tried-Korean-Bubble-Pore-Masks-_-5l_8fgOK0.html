today we're trying a poor bubble poor
pack by Tony moly I've been breaking out
a lot recently so I'm really hoping that
this bubble poor math will just strip
away all the dirt from my pores I have
combination skin so I get really oily
and like my t-zone a pretty dry skin
face masks can either really help that
or hinder it depending on the brand so
I've seen this trend like all over my
Instagram and all my friends from back
home like they snapchat me with their
bubble masks on all the time they I'm
interested to see if it's just like
cutely packaged or if it actually does
something I really hope that my face
becomes a bubble bath it reminds me of
that little octopus from Nemo you know
the one that like accidentally squirts
all the time I don't know my face but
I'm very excited effectively cleanses
aways seven pores what does anything
smells like regular lotion but it smells
extra fragrant feels like a mud mask
going on but it's like way smoother than
a mud mask this is really satisfying oh
I like this it's like clay slash paint
it's really easy to put on goes on
really smooth I'm loving the way it
feels on my skin it's really refreshing
Oh God
it's like he'd go over it with your
finger and it's already bubbling girls
follow me now so I think it's like
starting to foam in some areas I like to
take my time this is not relaxing
totally bubbling up
I don't want to eat it I can hear it can
you hear it when it's one that you're
waiting for it to dry you have to wait
like 15 to 20 minutes so it's like a
long time like this is nice that it's so
quick it's only bubbling up on my cheeks
the end of my nose in the middle of my
forehead I wonder if that's like my
problem areas or something it's like
fluffy gray clouds
it's like England overcast always it has
been five minutes it was time to go over
there and wash this stuff off taking it
off was honestly a journey I think I
might have made the mask a little too
thick and I felt like I was like
scrubbing it off and like making my face
red
so it was tingling as it was doing its
thing which was a weird sensation the
areas that were like bubbling didn't
feel different but they look different
and they were like spongy always bubbles
out put more when it's dirtier so I'm
like maybe the left side had like more
going on so the thing had to like bubble
up more to fix it overall is already
cute product and I think it'd be fun to
try with your friends sleepover but it
hasn't really made my face feel very
great I think it's because I have dry
skin I think even had oily skin it would
be for you even though it actually was
more than just a cute little face mask
like my pores feel a lot cleaner and
tighter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
