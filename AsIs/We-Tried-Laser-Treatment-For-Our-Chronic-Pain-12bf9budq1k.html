told me that I should try and write a
letter to the doctor who did this to me
I don't want to say it I'm scared to
jinx it but I think the lasers work I
cannot believe we have been here for two
weeks I mean we have gotten so close
with Leslie and her entire family
she doesn't even really feel like a
doctor she just feels like a friend to
us at this point do you know how many
people think your daughter has saved
their lives and changed she's told me
about some of them yes yeah absolutely
how has your emotional life changed
since since since laser yeah well I mean
pre-imposed I didn't have a life I just
didn't I was in a constant state of fear
I was constantly worried the next thing
was gonna trigger it was like walking on
eggshells for your whole life my
migraines and all that started when I
was in my early teens and I'd say around
1819 is when I started to become like
almost bedridden and I would I would go
to college and I would go back to my
apartment and I wouldn't leave and I had
no life whatsoever the first five years
it was one headache and night at one
o'clock in the morning it was like
clockwork so
I spent three months a year sitting up
in a chair to sleep and if I moved just
a certain way bingo another headache
would start so nobody understands the
pain I'm gonna cry right now but you
know how it feels right nope you
freaking knows unless you've done it I
can't imagine doing this for three years
why does everyone cry when we talk about
your mom
her daughter had TN and she was able to
help her daughter and so for her it's
like this is a mission since I was
diagnosed she was on the computer every
single website I could just see her
sometimes I'd see her crying sometimes
I'd see her throwing paper the more
research the more my heart was just
aching but I'm I was determined and
thankfully we got something we found
something
I mean I've watched her go on a Sunday
you're gonna be going to Miami and
helping people and not taking any money
she said mom they've suffered enough
I have to help them and that's just how
she feels and I'm proud of her for that
I really am some people have said do you
really think you can help me and I say I
believe it in my heart
and if we don't have the belief anymore
what do we have when nobody was able to
help Lee I was able to help her my
grandfather he wanted us to open up a
clinic and we hope we opened one up and
we were just treating people and people
were getting better like with backs
elbows knees everything like they were
just getting better and we're like holy
cow this is crazy I wasn't expecting to
find so many people that I could relate
to and honestly know what they're going
through and they know what I'm going
through and talking to these people that
have had success stories is what's kept
me here
how are you feeling today everything was
feel like a little like hot ropes hot
snakes slithering up and down my
that's his girl messaged me last night
so that she had had laser therapy before
that I helped her a lot and she's like
by the way I felt like complete
before I felt better and my back hurts
my jaw feels like it's locked
can you tell her I'm in a bad mood
you're in a way a better mood I'm in
such a better way I was so skeptical
going in like I just feel like a weight
has been lifted off my chest what the
 is going on I shook right now
yesterday I felt like complete but
today I'm feeling better and I actually
have some energy it's kind of weird
never even feel good right boob what is
happening got appreciate the little
moments right maybe it's working bitch
she's on the phone telling her friend
about the treatment and how excited she
is really happy
I was worried we leave tomorrow and I
still haven't written this
letter to the doctor I am getting ready
to write a letter to all of the doctors
who didn't believe me because
unfortunately I cannot pin it down to
one I've got some comfort food macaroons
I'm gonna put on some good good jams and
do this they're doctors this is hard to
write I came to you for the first time
when I was just 20 years old I was
scared and in pain when I finally got up
the courage to see you you downplayed my
symptoms and feelings it took me over
five years to be told what was going on
with my body and I will never get those
years of my life back dear doctor let's
just get the nasty stuff out of the way
you ruined my life I wish I could say
you've given me the confidence to know
that I can have the worst pain in the
world and still live despite it that I
have met people and heard stories about
other people living with chronic illness
and learning that there is hope that may
be my purpose in life is now to connect
with other people who have chronic pain
like me you never gave me that know I
learned that on my own I no longer need
your validation I don't even really want
your remorse I just want you and all
doctors to be better and I want to let
this go
I forgive you with all of my heart and I
thank you for forcing me to find out how
strong I really am Laura as much as I
don't want to and as long as it's taken
me I forgive you wholeheartedly with
love and pain Kelsey I hope that they
show this at like doctor schools med
schools and about like just have
beat and think being careful what you
say around people with chronic pain
because it can really have an effect on
like how you view
your ability to get better and if you
live every day with zero hope that
you're gonna get better you never will
there are strength and numbers and once
we start talking about the issues that a
lusts and demand answers like we will
get them
I believe you other people will believe
you and your pain is very real and the
more we talk about it the less there
will be pain last night and we got our
laser and so now we get to use these
when we go back to LA and on the plane
and it's affordable in the car you can
literally use this thing anywhere it's
like the size of a cell phone get a
family photo I'm leaving with a renewed
sense of faith in people with people
like Leslie who are trying and not
giving up and dedicating their entire
life her family everything she's had to
do she's helping so many people she's
great like she's like you're nothing
else like just having someone validate
you and be like your oh that's
irreplaceable you can't pay them nothing
they'll go team all for one one for all
or some okay yeah
[Laughter]
coming into this I thought I was gonna
be here and in two weeks I would be
leaving pain free that's what I told
myself was best-case scenario worst-case
scenario I prepped myself to come here
and get the treatment and actually have
it like stir up the pain more and have
some attacks the worst case - in heaven
the best case didn't happen but I've
it's worked for so many people like it
has to work right
you
I honestly cannot believe but I am out
of bag right now three hours I'm just
starting my period
it is officially day two of my period
and I'm getting ready to go on a hike a
hike I woke up with little to no
bloating this probably hasn't happened
to me in 10 years I'm hoping that this
is the new normal
oh my god okay our lasers just given the
mail and they're like the big legit one
big laser got here laser and I think
it's gonna take up much longer time for
me to see any results I can't help but
obviously be like sad and a little
jealous but it didn't work
super noticeably different for me I
think laser it definitely can do
something and it's showing you guys I'm
having one of the best days that I've
had in months you are much more willing
to you know do other things while you're
on your period and feeling like you
can't do anything and that's pretty
great I'm thinking about cooking dinner
and then taking my dog to the pet store
to get a new leash like I actually want
to go out and do things on one hand it
feels totally normal to have this much
energy and be this happy right now but
on the other hand I'm like who the
are you cuz this isn't Laura but it is
now guess what guys I've started dating
so much and he's really great
and I care about him a lot I never
thought it would be possible to be in a
relationship at this stage in my pain
the point is is that instead of burning
the letter which I have printed out
right here and I actually mail
it to this talk this guy that I'm dating
has really given me the confidence to
mail this to him like what do I have to
lose
I'm scared don't need to be scared that
mailbox is coming up and I'm gonna
myself
Bora said to me once what if this doctor
is still out there doing this to people
and I feel like if this letter can make
him rethink every cut and stitch
and movement in consultation and
suggestion and prescription to someone
else it's worth it to me yep
I feel better than now it's not like
it's not on my control anymore I put it
out there and now it's not mine anymore
so I made an appointment with a new
doctor who is a bite specialist who
works with neuromuscular dentistry I
felt like making a new appointment with
a new doctor trying a new technique
would just mean that I was giving up on
the lasers and I'm not I'm still using
it so because I think the detox is
actually doing something for my life I
just both another trip to go back and
get detox to get in this summer I just
feel like it's something that I believe
in now even if this isn't a cure and
even if it's not gonna work for every
person's body because everyone is
different I feel hopeful again and
having that hope in my heart again is
worth so much more to me than what I
thought going into this not giving up my
goal really is to just try and help
other people find way so if I have to
keep on trying to show people that
there are other options out there then
I'm gonna keep doing it at the end of
the day what I want people to know is
that there are always more options even
when it seems like there's not and they
may not always be accessible but the
more we work and the more we fight and
the more we speak up there will be more
options and we will all get our hope
back I hope
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
