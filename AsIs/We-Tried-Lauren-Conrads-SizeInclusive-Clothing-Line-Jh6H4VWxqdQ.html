is I want to forgive you and I want to
forget you
today we're in this beautiful Hollywood
law and we're gonna try Lauren Conrad's
size inclusive clothing line feel like
me and LC started back in Laguna Beach
day I was like my prime reality
television she was the queen of prep I
would say her cells are the same at all
because she's definitely more like hot
California woman and I'm like sad
Midwestern person even with her clothing
line I liked a lot of her dresses and
they were cute but they were never
offered in plus sizes Lindsey and I are
both wearing the same outfit but in
different sizes never happened in the
history of our friendship we've never
worn the same outfit Wow jazzing are
both very different but we're best
friends no one will recognize who's who
after this year like I'm Mary Kate Nash
it's a tradition cheers Lindsey and our
outfit very soft
everything is so soft and velvety here
we have Jasmine Oh didn't see you there
oh my god you look like a really rich
woman right yes that's why I feel he's
so comfortable feeling completely
different vibe yeah best friend
Christmas card yes it was really
interesting because obviously me and
Lindsey are two different sizes we're
two different skin tones different
aesthetics different hair different
everything but we both rock each outfit
like completely you think it's so fun to
like dress like your best friend yeah I
think it's rare that your best friend is
the same size as you ever you know so
it's like it's so awesome to be able to
have that option so today we're trying
the same dress it's a long floral maxi
which I'm wearing a size zero a glitch I
think is the equivalent of the next
and I'm wearing a small we have our
dresses yeah I tried to go for a more
rocker boho I've never been to Coachella
but maybe this is Little People we're
boob stitch is out of control
I knew this what happened not quite my
vibe but I'm not a post like I can kind
of you know make it feel sexy so I'm
taking it
the thing with these maxi dresses the
bottom half of them is really flowy and
nice so I think that no matter what your
body type is for this particular piece
you're probably in pretty good shape
what I do like about it is that two
people with completely different styles
were able to make it I think this is a
true testament to affordability in size
and passivity are probably the two most
important things to be in a clothing
line
Lauren Conrad nailed both of those where
actually to be tried on the same dress
in the same size I'm a size 14 and I'm
usually around a size 18 I feel like
it's either going to fit perfectly on
both of us or it's just gonna be a
disaster on both of us there will be no
in-between okay
I just think it's like one size too big
but like you can barely notice it only
around the waist I can't believe we're
in the same I know I dress right now but
it's truly Sisterhood of the Traveling
dress it's weird because I'm not really
a dress girl but I like this dress it's
like if you're gonna be modeling and
something I'm glad it's like something
flowy a little glam debating whether I
should put on Spanx but like it's the
way it flows it doesn't like don't you
like Hills or valleys and crevices
we have very different body types a long
dress and me being fine but sometimes
long dresses tend to drive using the
fabric is sheer so it doesn't cut me off
exactly where it is
it's very flowy if it fits really nicely
it's crazy cause it's long on me and
it's long on you it is a dress it as a
necessarily like hug my curves but I
don't feel like I'm getting eaten alive
by fabric I feel like a lot of lines
that do size inclusive it really doesn't
translate to everybody and I think we
just proved that this one does they
really deflected beautiful features of
our bodies I fear it cut of this dress
really works with different body types
and that's something that I look for in
a size inclusive line because I wanted
to look at me if my friends want to
borrow it I want to make sure it looks
going them I definitely see myself
looking into more this line just to try
out the options I'm glad LC jumped on
this and I'm hoping that other places
can start doing this to me no one should
have to worry about binding clothes in
their sights
you Lorraine on your gift no one else
can feel it for you only you can let it
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
