cheek full of acne and that is the
pimple that we will be targeting so I
guess I'm trying this light fair the
acne spot treatment by Neutrogena which
is a company that I generally trust I'm
pretty excited about it I'm a person who
does have problematic skin all of my
acne appears right on this cheek I
recently like Sargent ecologist and they
set me up on a whole regimen I was on
antibiotics for like months past
treatments that I've tried everything
you can imagine facials oral pills
topicals light therapy is clinically
proven and dermatologists use it and the
energy from the red and blue lights
target acne causing bacteria to reduce
the appearance of breakouts we're gonna
see what she can do
press and hold the power button until it
beeps once to begin your treatment I've
got a little guy coming on my chin so
let's start with this it definitely
makes me feel like things are happening
little party on my face he's already
really fun I'm easily entertained this
wasn't a big pimple there's a little
small but definitely red definitely a
thing that could get worse overnight
it'll beep twice to let me know when
it's over
that was 2 beeps oh it's done now the
redness is going away a little bit
that was only one treatment underneath
three to do the job they decided to try
to figure out how to multitask my two
minutes
I will say it's a little annoying that
the stick doesn't come with a lid
because anywhere I throw it then it's
just gonna kind of gather like bacteria
and dirt you know almost like I'm like
oh I can feel it it doesn't hurt or
anything she's done I've just washed my
face and my skin looks pretty good
actually well we have one more treatment
in the day we'll see if it's any
different by then it's time for my third
treatment so let's do it
um and so I'm gonna use this on a bunch
of different parts of my face tonight
I've got like something's going on there
something going on there I don't know if
I'm feeling something because I'm
pressing something against it because
the lights are activating things deep in
my skin it's not the most efficient use
of time but if you are a person who only
gets like one pimple at a time like good
for you and you should definitely try
this if you have acne that is more like
all over it like it could definitely get
frustrating now I have a solid border
around the giant pimple on my cheek on a
scale of like one to ten honestly I
thought it was pretty good like I give
it like maybe a seven maybe this pen is
just to distract from the pimple and
bring attention to the border it creates
around the pimple that would be special
so yeah definitely no change as of now
it was subtle and I still thought that
it worked
