Nicki Minaj
so basically we're getting some longest
we gonna be rocking you know body length
basically wigs this is a dream come true
for me if you know me because you know
I'm about that with life I've never worn
a wig in my life
I love wigs I'm a big fan I love wearing
color and I've done red I've done a
turquoise I've done blonde I've worn
wheat so in but never wig I've
definitely wanted to try out like a Hank
or a silver but this is the one that I
actually specifically would like a wig
because how am I gonna take a shower
with all that it's not gonna finish our
chests and I don't get them that often
because the kind that I like are the
kind that Beyonce also likes and me and
Beyonce and two different tax bracket
you guys all over the women I would have
to be one eye open the boots much might
snatch away literally
whatever vice would you give like
inspiring hairstylist be open the open
we wouldn't to learn be able to take a
backseat sometime how the saying goes it
takes ten years to be overnight success
so you starting now respect the process
around 30 I was in the bathroom so long
I forgot I had a boiled egg on this
stove so y'all like hop out after the
egg egg burn but guess what my wig is
pasta I am on my way to where one train
runs like every hour with scarf over it
because the way this hair line is set up
that's something we're not about to do
I'm just a little bit concerned about
like getting on and off the train making
sure nobody steps it to me and once
you're we could be snatched but not that
kind of
some gay men or black women second
straight then right now I'm under
someone's armpit I know I don't even
blame you sir
Nicki Minaj does not have to deal with
this so I made it to work on time that's
still a little light beat once at his
face
no the wig is not hiding under this
scarf it was gonna be too much too
home about this morning and try to be a
work attitude some time but I do have it
with me it's in this bag along with my
lunch probably shouldn't be storing it
in there but I don't have like a
personal way colder or weak case like
Nicki Minaj probably does that way okay
I'm just rocking my cornrows I don't
feel like putting on that way so I guess
I'm kind of cheating
Don't Tell Patrice is building it
they're probably cheating to talk about
I don't go there back so I'm on my way
to a shoot and I had to take a break
from the way because I didn't have time
to comb it out or even make it look cute
but I wanted to look you know
presentable I'm actually wearing another
wig I'm not like nervous when I walk out
of the house anymore
I get the most Reggie looks from the
older black women who are like girl
these kids today are doing it too much
the week of wearing a wig that just so
happened to be 40 inches of hair was
actually a lot of work I have enough
time to you know do my makeup put on
clothes make sure I had everything my
bag while making sure my wig wasn't
gonna slide off
I cut half of it off and it's still
longer tail you know that's wig for
divas because that wig is a diva her
hair was everywhere
weave was at every floor every corner
every cranny I loved it I love the look
it's definitely like I still have my wig
at home and I will be pulling her out it
was a moment like it was nice for a
moment a weekend situation it'll be like
a cute Hamptons away this was my gateway
way I'm definitely gonna be like playing
with length and color more from now on
but there is something very powerful I
will say this about wig life about being
able to take your hair off it's like and
this can escape all that was happening
for you and then put it back on and it's
like boom it is right back to it that's
crazy
