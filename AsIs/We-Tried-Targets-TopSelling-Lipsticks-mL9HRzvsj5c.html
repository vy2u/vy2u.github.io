me that give me that
uh today we're trying to RJ's selling
lipstick it's rare that I go to Target
for beauty specifically doesn't sit
right there on the left and I'm late but
what if I just beer through the elf
aisle today like one of those fish at
the bottom of the sea I see like the
brightest light in the store I'm just
like oh high school used to hang out in
the target parking lot because it was
there's nowhere else yeah when I finally
did go inside
I loved the beauty section it's filled
with so many choices maybe too many
choices I feel like the quality it's
gonna be decent but not luxurious to be
equivalent to like a pumpkin spice latte
so basic yeah smother our lips and
affordable Oh Oh eyes lips and face is
that what it stands for
yeah eyes lips in faith I'm Chuck whoa
why did you take that off extra what you
never read that mosquito article on hex
no it's nice it's very moisturizing what
do you think so far
oh no being a mad girl yeah she doesn't
like moist things she likes dry ass lips
I feel like for the price you can't beat
this this is a really good quality
and it's inexpensive and it's a good
color payoff
bring me the lippy really Oh take its
top off baby with consent oh this is
cute
Wow
colors I kind of like it on ya I look
sweet which I'm not I like your color a
lot it's yellow balloon it is pigmented
it's bright here
the colors are very pigmented and lovely
but it's too oily and it moves around
too much it looks like that you like
accidentally touch your face and then it
gets is it worth the sacrifice of having
to buy all day gel no yes bitch rev up
Revlon it's like cute what is it
I'm sorry did I just see race car this
just looks like chapstick disguises in
different packaging what's HD about this
I like it hey if you were to like look
at my lips and look at your lips
you wouldn't think they're the same
brand right Milania have heard of before
actually use their nail polishes a lot
it's a matte lip cream so I hope it's
not like crusty crusty lips sissy oh wow
that was like butterbeer it does exactly
I'm like here for it oh no it's getting
inside me it's like a disease no I
really like this list that are called
gorgeous isn't that true
 BAM
maybe it's different formulations for
different colors so just be sure that
you pick the right color maybe it's
mabeline maybe it's secured for 24-year
olds
it should so apparently there's color on
one side and then a little locks locks
it all in when you look at this than
though - this is like not a ton of
product not a time my color is constant
Koko because what else would we call
something broad whoa come on Barbie
let's go party oh these are like some
mill fibrin whores and I support that
now I'm put the top layer on the lock
and load my the Lock and Load Blair
please there we go Oh evil day never
have to worry about my work knock
everyone else out of the water because
it wasn't too dry or that stayed in
place like impeccably that shit's not a
move this is another one that's going on
the Brock
the people of target know what the
they're picking I was pleasantly
surprised by our results there's a
reason that they're the top sellers
because people know what's up iris is
that it's already dance move shove it

nude lip which you're used to you used
