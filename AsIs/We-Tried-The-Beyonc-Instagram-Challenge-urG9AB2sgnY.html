Beyonce Shh I have lived for this moment
I don't think I'm gonna live up to the
high because we're watching a lot of
celebrities completely rebrand their
Instagram so yeah they are making their
instagrams represent what they're
thinking without having to say anything
when I think about Beyonce's Instagram
it is like one of the coolest things
I've ever seen in my life this new
aesthetic she's been doing lately she's
just like bad Photoshop but it's so bad
it's good like it's like intentionally
bad it looks like a lot of work I feel
like Beyonce just gets her pictures
taken and then she's like alright send
me the edits I'm not wealthy enough to
have it procs
see the thing is is that we ain't got
Beyonce followers if my number goes down
at least one code for y'all this
aesthetic like this is them thanksgiving
PO she did and it was her I also kind of
what I used to picture somebody walking
out the first day I thought they were
super yeah how's it oh yes take his
pictures I'm being extra do this destiny
is doing whatever this is details
details
she's taking forever isn't here editing
this picture for Instagram I've
literally spent the past 20 minutes
trying to make one piece of one photo
that will have to be repeated four times
and that's what I need to much know what
the answer this is what she does she's
like this outfit looks good let's
Instagram if she does this she's
superhuman how does she do this raise
three children be a wife and do all this
I don't understand she goes blue play
with this Photoshop and blue was like
mom got it done I have it I have a
concept you guys Ryan just came out of
the gate with the most epic Instagram
I've seen in quite some time and I feel
like he's really upping the bar of the
three of us Ryan seems to think he's
Beyonce we need to humble him uh-huh and
this is wire the process so I'm gonna be
helping destiny look we can tell Ryan
somebody can send him his luggage
I felt like I was too into it I was
going deep into my Photoshop I mean
zoomed into like 700 we haven't seen
as equalities but all we have so far I
am clearly Beyonce is the problem
because Michelle here so it's in the
middle of her workday and I'm having to
stop everything that I'm doing to go
take pictures to post on
Instagram I've been on an aesthetic of
like a very like mm weird myspace
pictures so now that I actually had to
put time in I struggled and then you
need to like bring someone with you
because you can't post for selfies
I feel like Beyonce has to take like a
full day cuz her pictures are bombed -
yeah I use my Instagram like so freely
and I love it so much and it's just like
something that's fun for me to go and do
like this became my job on top of the
job that I already have we're a couple
of days in and I'm just gonna say - the
best so far I didn't post because MLK
Day was coming up and I wanted to be
able to rap for our main guy okay I'm
out here riding for the culture my
favorite part was how collaborative it
was like I was really pulling in like my
other co-workers my friends and it was
sort of like doing a very collaborative
art piece so at the health of the
incredibly talented Claudia just
finished the last one on this wall I'm
really excited about this now I just
have to edit all of them this has taught
me two things one it's really awesome
till I create your own aesthetic fear
Instagram - it's a lot easier to create
your own aesthetic if you have an army
of interns and/or our famous so if you
want to be my intern or you guys want to
help me get famous let me know like it
was cool like utilizing different parts
of Photoshop and really like playing
with my aesthetic there was no captions
I couldn't explain it so I really had to
make sure that every piece that was a
part of the project like spoke to me as
a person me and destiny are doing a
little bit of a night photo shoot we
decided you know like an aesthetic is
like the parking garage like after dark
with the flash on destiny how are you
feeling my thing is this is like the
third shoot by now and I'm
honestly I'm gonna god I feel you and
has been so much time on this single
post just post with the music that I
attached to it it took me at least two
and a half hours and I had me like do
this beehive like filter on it it was so
hard to put it to the music me but worse
than that so I don't know who's doing
this for Beyonce but this is a job all
itself I'm finally about to sin this
product to myself mind you I started at
two o'clock it's now six o'clock this is
ridiculous
Beyonce my god I think the easiest /
most rewarding part is really finding
beauty and everything and everywhere
because it was like every place I
stepped into could have easily become a
part of this project it's cool to like
lean into other ways of talking story
your pictures
I felt like could be hung up like in a
room like pieces of art we saw a
security guard and we were like whose
car is this that has the top down and he
was like it's mine and we're like can I
sit in it so that I just sat in this
wave of security put the picture by the
unit is like I'm gonna be a Photoshop
expert I've been getting to get really a
detail with nothing with the patterns of
my clothing the level of detail that
goes into the actual rim post is cool I
think if I continue this I think I'm
definitely going to extend the amount of
time in between the post just because
it's so much at once this was a lot
harder than I thought it was all being 1
million that I really get was just as
stressful as like finals week there was
a lot of preps and then you did it and
it was over with him you're like why did
I just spend so much time on this but
there were times I was just uninspired
before your date - I was taking your
pictures here like I don't know I knew I
was gonna lose followers instead of just
like prolonging the process I just put
them all out at once my photos have been
up for about an hour and a half and I've
lost like 200 followers and I'm like bye
I don't I could see myself doing it yeah
I kind of like how clean it looks on
Instagram I don't think I would do this
again just because it really isn't me
and the posting three times look they
want either one photo or none I'm
definitely gonna continue their like
conceptual like thinking I'm coming to
this project thinking I would find out
more about my voice but I definitely
think that that's something that
happened especially seeing how all of
ours deferred so much like we're all
such unique art
so it was cool to see what we all did I
think this has opened me up to having a
little bit more creative fun with my
Instagram I liked it overall me too you
wanna say if you ever want to give me
tips on my Instagram please if you want
to hire me to do your Instagram I won't
do it for like super cheap I mean I'm
talking like 50 cents an hour as long as
I need to like just breathe around you
that's what I want her to do and now my
current aesthetic on Instagram right now
is like 2000s trash my nose would kind
of have to be like a witch in the woods
you did not just come up with every my
would have to be I don't know which in
the wood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
