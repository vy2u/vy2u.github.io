spa today we're gonna try the cutest
skincare product super excited for all
the cuteness were about to see waiting
on you oh my god it looks just like the
emoji you literally looks just like look
at it if I was closing my eyes and
someone just put that from my nose I
would think as an actor I'm already
convinced this is going to cure every
single skin ailment I have just because
it is cute smells so good that I want to
eat it I want to eat it so bad it feels
more like a moisturizer than a cleanser
yeah but it already feels great putting
it on feels like I took my chopstick and
just rubbed it all over my back I like
but you don't have to dunk your face and
water for to come off
yeah you can just literally put it on a
paper towel and just treat it like a
makeup wipe I feel like we look really
ridiculous right now
okay speak for yourself oh great I am a
fan it took off most of my makeup off
and less than what like two minutes yeah
you're you're fresh clean baby you want
a cuteness skill I'm gonna give it an
eight just because I have high hopes for
the next step I would rate it maybe like
a sake next on our skincare routine it
is the pandas dream white magic rule
this is very cute I would actually think
it's a little bit cuter than last one
sorry peach appiah I didn't think it
could get cuter but I just did what does
it smell good
see has a little medicinal smell to it
oh my god it smells good it's not so
fresh
you just need this much light put on
your face this otherwise you're gonna
look like sunscreen yeah you're like the
scene from ljubljana where like the lady
her face is like white they're scared
that it's one of those things where you
put it on your skin and like it kind of
blends in but then when someone takes a
bit a flash of you a photo flash of you
would just go it shines through I
created a four and a half so now the
last step in our skincare cuteness
routine is a face woman feels like
Easter this is my new friend the
pocket-money sleek miss tony moly this
is long it's travel friendly are you
ready okay I like it how do you feel I
feel boy oh my god it does smell like
baby powder you smell like a baby feels
very like light I'm like like you were
just kissed by money do I know if it
works
no do I care no I think you yes I'll
give it a seven okay cuz it does the job
you know it makes me feel refreshed yeah
the only downfall is a smell overall I
think that this was a well needed dose
of cuteness in my morning routine it
kind of like uplifts your day to a
little bit seeing the packaging it just
makes you like feel like okay I'm about
to start my day it's gonna be fun I
think cuteness overall helps with health
helps with happiness helps with overall
quality of life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
