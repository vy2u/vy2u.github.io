shiny T zone Rudolph the red-nosed
reindeer so I'm all day makeup that
stays fresh that's long-lasting and just
like doesn't budge in order to transmit
eat fruits went through setting spray I
came to the city of New York well I'll
be trying five different setting price
and think how they last at the beginning
of the day at the end of day and kind of
just like how they bear against all the
humidity obviously in New York
this is day one of the sweat proof
humidity proof setting spray test and
one of the most highly ranked setting
spray is that I actually mr. price was
on there was the elf makeup mist and
spray so I'm gonna do my entire face so
you can see the results of going through
a full day with just setting spray on my
face to set my entire look
I'm just gonna use just ten of the
makeup spray and we'll see how this
looks at the end of the day so it is the
end of day one and we're pretty much
spending a list of stay inside your face
is shiny and I see on your nose is
shinier like around here it's not bad I
think your natural lovely oiliness is
c-synch true it's not a bad thing you
just look very glowy it doesn't look bad
but I just know that that's not for my
okay
so I'm gonna head outside and see what
it's like against actual sweat
like I look really cute and dewy but
don't let that fool you it's oil so it's
literally night and I had a full day
today and I feel like I'm just filthy
so before I take off all my makeup we're
gonna see how much oil I can take off
and how many blotting papers I need to
use oh that's oily my brow transferred
my makeup transferred and all of that
sweat transferred so it really didn't do
much guys I'm sad to say that for EOD s
for end of day shine this is raining
like unlike a - at the end of the day
you're really getting what you paid for
which is three dollars worth of makeup
mist and set spray the humidity in New
York is about 74% which is 1% higher
than yesterday so so much to look
forward to so I've already finished my
makeup for today so I'm just gonna set
my face with ten sprays and hopefully
this does the trick
set everything down for the rest of the
day you look very much like this same
really you have a little bit of shine
here you do not look as greasy as you
were yesterday
and we want different work it's like a
few blocks and I like
like my entire foundation that was all
over my mouth is currently on my nap and
I'm gonna lime my face is holding up way
better than it did yesterday which I'm
super surprised about in comparison to
the elf the elf strips look I don't know
they look kind of dirtier but for end of
day shine I want to say I was glowy I
can honestly say that NYX outperformed
elf with its mattifying factor it
definitely kept me glowy but not oily
for the price point what you pay how
much I use and like the all day aware it
did really well in comparison to elf
it's gonna be a 71% humidity and I get
my hands on the Tarte marine boosting
setting spray today so I'm so excited to
be using this today because it's
supposed to hydrate set refresh your
skin along with prime your skin so it's
like a 4 in 1 and I'm just gonna get
right into it because I want to smell
this
oh my goodness it's like lemon citrus on
their tongues of like eucalyptus that
smells so good and it just feels so
refreshing so it's the end of day three
the morning of night
four it's been a long long night it's
not bad considering the sweat and the
humidity there wasn't honestly a lot of
oil coming off of my face and
surprisingly not as much transfer of my
actual makeup these are a lot cleaner
than the last few days I'm actually
streaming the impressed and then I
wasn't that oily at the end of the day
of course it didn't matter funny but it
actually did set me which was great and
I gave it up to tart it's gonna be 67
percent of humidity today which is not
even that bad today we are trying the
Urban Decay all nighter long-lasting
setting spray it's oil free paraben free
and temperature control technology which
differentiates it from all the other
setting sprays that we've used so far
which is really sick let's get straight
into it
okay that's pretty pretty warm I feel my
makeup is still here but it's sat really
well it's my skin today I just feel very
put together
I don't feel fresh but I feel like my
face is still there let's put it to the
blotting paper test to see how much use
is up I'm not even half as oily as I
have been over the last few days
Wow I only produce two blotting papers
worth of oil still look very fresh face
which is awesome my makeup doesn't look
old my foundation doesn't look tired
it didn't get clumpy anywhere and it
didn't have any runoff Urban Decay a
golfclap to your fitnah k it's day five
we are actually doing the Jason roof or
cover e caudally a I may have put trick
that Kajal a beauty elixir
this is retailed at $49 so it's about to
get fancy a today guys
can't even imagine paying $49 from one
setting spray my face feels so dewy feel
so refreshed definitely feels hydrated
this is nice I could get used to this
really quick shoot and I'm just walking
outside and I'm like slowly seeing my
reflection in the camera and like damn
$9.00 so
so we just got out Korean barbecue and
literally I thought the humidity outside
of New York was be worse no the inside
of the Korean barbecue place inside of
York is by far the worst do you see this
there's like a trickle of river of oil
that's just like Oh
FEMA waiting in my teeth like I'm
wearing NYX and I am shiniest neither
did mine and mine was $49 as the day
progressed my face just slowly collected
more and more shine like I was
glistening I'm like a sparkling pool of
oil right now I even took a nap and I
woke up to an entire face of makeup on
my pillow let's see how much oil I can
collect with the blotting paper a lot
guys this one completely dropped the
ball it's like I'm wearing a completely
different things because like none of
this was a problem with any of the other
settings phrase how frustrating is this
so I'm back in the LA office looking
over all the footage and all the photos
from my week in New York and it's easy
to see that the settings made you really
do differentiate themselves when it
comes to formula what comes to price and
so infinity was the elf mist and set
setting spray I think the main reason
why this came last
was that it really didn't have any
effects on the long way of my makeup it
really didn't last all day in fourth
place it was the common beauty of wit
sir I know it had really good reviews
online that's just being a really good
way to give your skin that extra touch
of glow but it really didn't do much for
setting your actual makeup the third
place was actually a tarp for in one
mist and set while it really did smell
extremely nice and it did have the
properties of priming and like misting
and just prepping your skin for makeup
it did all that just like the beauty
elixir did but it lasted a little bit
longer throughout the day the second
runner-up was actually the NYX matte
finish not only was the blotting test
one of the best ranked one out of all
the setting space throughout the week
but it really did have results beginning
at end of day setting my makeup keeping
it in place and having that long wear
option that I was really was looking for
that leads personally which actually
ended up being Urban Decay all nighter
spray which was hands-down the one that
modified me the bethe really gave me the
most out of my makeup all day coming out
for this week I really just learned that
price and brands and ingredients really
make the most out
settings raising the manuals and you
don't have to invest all of your money
in the most high-end setting sprays to
really get the worth I'm aware of such a
spray and let me know what your favorite
settings were in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
