got dipped in holy water at their
christening to literal 24-year old man
hi guys I'm chimera a unique I'm a
makeup artist
today I'm gonna be helping professionals
with a young face look their age with
makeup my name is Annie I'm 27 and I'm a
senior learning specialist at BuzzFeed
I'm Kyle I'm 24 and I'm a creative here
at BuzzFeed my name is Chantel Waters
Rogers I'm 30 years old and I am an
attorney for as long as I can remember
people have been telling me that I look
incredibly young it's really useful when
trying to get child meals or like child
tickets but it also sucks when you're
trying to get into a bar or you're
trying to get people who are more senior
than you to take you seriously I've been
to r-rated movies as recently as like a
23 year old adult and have been ID'd
last month I went to court and I ran
into an older lady in the elevator she
asked me what I did and I told me I was
attorney and she's like what you look
like a baby I usually get the word cute
oh she's so cute
you-you'd if I need to look older for a
meeting I'll put a makeup out worth or
an outfit when I have nothing on my face
I look especially younger I just like
when people know that I'm an attorney
because people tend to also mistake me
for support staff a secretary or an
intern I'm skeptical I guess honestly
but but I would love to you absolutely
try and see what happens I want you to
look like a 30-something you're all
professional that is killing the game
doing what you do and I respect you for
Annie I'm gonna teach her every day look
that's gonna give her a little more
authority with what she does I'm gonna
show Kyle had a lightly contour so that
he looks like he just won't go up like
this for Chantelle since she's a lawyer
I'm gonna find a five-minute quick
makeup look for her but tell me about
you everyday lives my everyday look is
on the hat roll because it's basically
nothing I'm big on moisturization a
quarter of my paycheck is going to
moisturizer this should be the part you
take your time with because you want it
to blend in so nicely that you could
feel like you could just go with that
even if you have great skin it's great
to use a little foundation just to
brighten your skin and to give you a
glow so for men
we're doing the concealer we don't want
to go as close to the lash line as
possible and then I'm gonna buff the
contour into her skin cuz I wanted to
look as natural as possible I'm really
obsessed with each blushes for all women
you know when you get those creases
under the eyes and you're like how did I
get that so the trick is to look up and
continue to look up while you're
applying it this look is like I'm 24
you have your adorable glasses and
you're looking like you're ready to go
into work and I like to fill the entire
lip in women with full lips should not
be afraid to apply color I was like a
different person the only thing I'm
looking at right now are my brows
there's that do enos to my skin but it
slightly more matte which is like
awesome and like super helpful wow it
looks really good looks very natural
I could definitely go to court in this
I'm excited to recreate this its 7:35
a.m. watch as I transform from baby who
just got dipped in holy water at their
christening to literal 24-year old man I
actually have a networking event tonight
I've got my concealer looks like this
spongy thing done my foundation I'm
gonna go in with the no filter concealer
from colour-pop one of the tips that
Kamara gave me was you know when you're
blending your concealer to not to go
below the cheekbone and to just one drop
so this is the completed look I'm really
into this look right now it's natural
lighting I feel a little bit Goga s' I
think I did a pretty good job love the
lip I'm also not showing you my brows on
purpose because I did a terrible job
what I really liked about the look that
Kamara gave me is it looked like very
soft very natural pretty much done so he
just got out of my brainstorm
I think it went pretty well they did
feel pretty heard it's an internal thing
you know if you feel more confident then
you exude confidence in addition to
getting my eyebrows that work I also got
my hair done this so this is definitely
a brand new me what do you guys think of
my new food it actually makes you look a
lot older oh it's really nice it's much
darker than I thought it was gonna be
home from the networking event and I
thought it went extremely well
I went in feeling really confident and
you know no fear being mistaken for
someone who was too young to be an
attorney I felt really confident and
sophisticated with my makeup look I just
had my first meeting after my new face
it was a video chat and I actually
couldn't stop staring at myself I was a
little more confident and I was sharing
my ideas and telling people I felt about
certain things and hopefully they came
across I think that we often see makeup
as purely for vanity but at least for me
today I saw the way that makeup helps
you sort of bring out these internal
properties within yourself you know if
makeup is the thing that makes you feel
good and makes you exude that confidence
then so be it that's amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
