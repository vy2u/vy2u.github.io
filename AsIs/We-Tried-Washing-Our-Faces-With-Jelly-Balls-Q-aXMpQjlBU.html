I think already yeah I'm not me neither
today we are trying the jelly ball
cleanser so I don't know what a ball of
cleanser looks like is that just a bar
of soap I have never heard of a jelly
cleanser but I'm assuming it's just like
a cleanser in the form of jelly
when I first like saw it online thought
it was like like a condom full of like
cleanser I'm sure I don't know I have a
tendency to break things a break guy I'm
really interactive with my balls I just
hope I'm like what all right so let's
rub some balls on her face oh it's
boscia boosha boosha boosha preservative
free for sensitive skin this is a magic
8-ball
creak the latex but isn't gonna break in
the same time okay one dab it smells
squeeze what is this still at you lower
and not on the ground it's so cool you
know there's makeup all over it okay
it's definitely moving some of my eye
makeup around this is very cool I'm not
gonna lie oh it feels so good fast mode
oh my god this is me in the morning
getting ready for work it's got oh wow
they took off my mascara as far as I can
tell I mean I'm mostly clean so it
actually took off like everything I just
think it would be better for like all
morning cleanse before you put your
makeup on my biggest worry when I use
cleansers is taking off my eye makeup
and my mascara does get the job done
just in a very slimy way it is really
fun it smells good yeah
it gets all your makeup off and like a
little jelly friend oh there's water law
football there's water across the ball
is water everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
