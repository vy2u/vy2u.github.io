probably give myself a nine out of ten
when it comes to doing here I'm probably
a six or seven I'm a solid two minds
about a five this way you have very
mediocre expectations oh that doesn't
look too bad oh okay this wonder how she
does that tie thing it looks like it's
just floating on her head don't we do
the bow tie in the back I do okay the
front would fine and then the back is a
disaster
what's fun I'm just gonna grab hair if
then I'm just gonna tie it like a shoe
okay now it's a little knotted just call
it does it look like hers when it's like
tied and then it's flowing like when in
doubt put it in a bun yeah it's in a
button it feels like if I go dancing
it's not gonna fly out that's the most
important thing
all right Kelsey are you ready for
hairstyle number two no I'm ready for
challenge number two because it means I
can take this out of my head what that
is very ornate I don't know if I can do
that oh my god after trying this myself
I respect hair stylist is so much more
now like this is an art form they're
defying gravity with hair you know what
maybe we'll help I don't know why
whispering it's like I don't want the
hair to hear do you like it I'm gonna
add hairspray so it stays oh my god I
just sprayed myself I'm almost done I'm
feeling good about this hurry
it's so good I'm ready for I do it looks
like I like it like a site like a check
this last challenge was a little
challenging I feel like we both rose to
it I'm afraid the flowers might fall out
because they might not be properly
secured it's not your fault
what is it all the butterflies that
match my hat and I'm just gonna be the
monarch I want to incorporate some
healthy stuff I think this work will
100% stop me but it's for fashion do I
get extra points if I do it the whole
time with the cheese on my head yeah I'm
a blushing bride
I think that if you were wearing this a
wedding I've been very very intrigued
why not put a banana up there is your
bird facing the way you like it - yes I
wanna see the birds
you look adorable like I would fight
anyone that would tell you that you
don't look adorable about hot
I feel like this hat is extremely
English if I had like two more minutes I
would probably cut off the wires those
15 minutes of fun right there I'm ready
to get married so I just need to find a
husband</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
