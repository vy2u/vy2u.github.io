today we're getting our foundations
custom-made I am app the idea that's
foundation being made by in half that's
the thing that I'm most worried about is
exciting the correct like to be is to
get like the most perfect match
technology is crazy based recognition is
like so advanced I feel like I could
believe that this could work you don't
trust technology that much so to have it
completely customized my foundation it's
just like sketching for me I don't get
how this works at all but I'm open to
new things I've definitely always
struggled finding like the correct shade
it would be kind of cool to see if this
app buy something that's better than the
foundation is already easy well Charlie
bareMinerals m2f made to fit
individually made just for us there's a
quick how-to video they can scan you and
everything the scan you need a fresh
face makeup free indoor lighting no
direct time
[Laughter]
two inches away from the position
alright so we're gonna wait a week if
that foundation shipped dipped in on our
cheeks alright so it's been a week we've
been waiting for our foundation and it's
here with your match amazing foundation
that I like that it has my name on it
judging by the outside do you think it's
gonna match no ready to match I'm ready
to match wait this looks great yeah good
oh gee it looks a bit like oh I don't
know about this this is like the
consistency of moisturizer it looks like
I'm wearing lotion I feel like this is
even too light to be like concealer it's
just so weird seeing like something
going on that's actually the exact color
of my skin I love like you know I'm
worrying about going out in the world
we're going to wear this foundation the
rest of the day we're gonna call the
rest for makeup and then we'll check in
and see how it fares throughout the day
go let's go any pretty looks really nice
it looks does it look like my like
natural fake no you're better off like
with your own and because your own skin
is perfect I just put on my normal
contour and highlight that I normally do
very very light foundation like I feel
like looking at myself
bachchi honestly I don't see anything
wrong with it's very natural it looks
very like like it would be like a BB
cream or CC cream but really wanted to
show the foundation outside you can kind
of see a little bit of the grayness it's
just not my preferred cup of tea
honestly I saw you before you put on
your bronzer and stuff and it looked a
she really did it looks lighter than
what you normally wear if it's claiming
to be a light fresh foundation and
that's what this is but as far as the
color matching I've been to altar with
you your no color on your own you don't
need enough to do it I'm gonna go ask
truce Queen sharing but you pull it off
I'd say a little she we have darker skin
it's hard for us to like so I'm leaving
work and it's more of I would call it
more of a tinted moisturizer than a
foundation being a foundation that I've
made with an app I think it did a decent
job like the technology is not 100%
there but it's definitely almost there I
think once they figure out a way to
incorporate people's undertones and
people's skin types then it's gonna be
perfect at the beginning it looked super
dewy and now it just looks like kind of
like I put a mask on me it looks so
transparent now I mean we're just gonna
have to continue this quest for the
perfect foundation we must the way we go
