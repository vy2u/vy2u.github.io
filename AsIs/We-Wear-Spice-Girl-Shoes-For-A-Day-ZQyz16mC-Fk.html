I was reminiscing about my childhood and
how obsessed I was with the Spice Girls
I had a Spice Girls birthday party the
dolls candy I was obsessed so it's
looking at some old pictures of the
Spice Girls and notice their shoes are
 huge so I did my research found
a company that makes these hugest
platform sneakers and I bought some for
me of my two best friends Cissy and
Lindsey to try out oh wise what up
bitches okay I got presents
I got us each a pair of shoes holy
those are so dumb
you might bring oh my god
do you you cannot take them off put them
on in the morning you put on a little
outfit your drive to work in your Libya
damn light I'm gonna need us to figure
out if the Spice Girls really could live
their day with these shoes on can you
see all of us they're so big had a very
hard time figuring out what to wear this
morning Tex a jazz a lot what color do
you match with when you have six
different accent colors I tried to
coordinate an outfit let's try these on
for the first time here they are
I have a feeling these are not gonna be
bad because they are completely flat
here it's just the height that's crazy
okay they're on oh my god not mad about
them nope not trying that anymore oh
this is gonna be a thing around
you can just toss up audacious
lightweight out oh my god those are
intense not as a look are you committed
to it head to toe so good read about to
hit my first few steps this is like the
scary experience oh this is why I don't
hold handrails my hand is so dirty you
guys look so confident in these
Jasmine's like well I've never seen you
in platforms I have it also doesn't seem
that far off it really weirdly adds
another level you personally you went
from an 11 to like 15 are they
comfortable they're not terrible how is
life six inches taller weird standing
next to people I realize in there like
down here I'm shooting I'm running
around the office all day God willing
not turning to sprain my ankle
run Jasmine run I've been like
monitoring the camera but like you three
hours now is on my feet and I'm just
like they were cute to begin with and
now they're slowly becoming
uncomfortable I love it they're very
spicy yeah this very baby feeding place
serving Emma buttons on that
just don't hang out please right walked
all the way a lunch which was like four
blocks yeah they're starting to hurt
I guess it's mixed with the anxiety of
being up so high that I'm like just more
aware
I can't wait to set so my legs are
finding it very hard to say
they're just heavy my ankle is just like
sore this place was performed by Olynyk
women I understand just wearing them for
a bashing right the like life wow I have
so much more respect than the Spice
Girls now I didn't like to think about
that as possible it's been a day I feel
like an old person I feel like I need
insoles all right so it's been a full
day of our Spice Girls shoes how do you
guys feel feel like there was a
performance that was made all day I
always say I love Baby Spice but now I
finally have shoes to match we chose
three really dynamic look this site
actually has like just normal tennis
shoe platforms that just amp up your
look to the next level that's the thing
I see other people wear them and I'm
like holy like that is fashion and
now we're where the fashion is someone
who is meta spice girl before oh I think
she would be very proud of us I think
she would
and since for you Emma when it comes to
these shoes they can be really
intimidating and people might want to
try something like that but they're too
scared to I honestly think you should
just go for it it's really just about
confidence and I feel like anyone can
wear platform shoes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
