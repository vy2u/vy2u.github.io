wear so I feel like that's gonna beat
those this huge pool party happening in
Palm Springs and we're gonna drive down
there this week
and put ourselves through a little
challenge we have the five bathing suits
for each other we each have one hundred
and seventy-five dollars which is a
pretty good amount but it is a Turkic
swim store we have to go to I don't
really wear one pieces and I normally
wear a bikini so we're gonna try to
switch and hopefully push our comfort
zones a little bit we have 24 hours
complete all this let's hope you get it
done and we have to shoot everything no
/ babies
we got waxed earlier today I sense
laughs true I broke up with my
girlfriend I was like everything I agree
with oh good thing we're not too
acquainted
oh I did swimming so I've been really
comfortable in bathing suits but the
thing that yeah that's fun is that you
guys have boobs up way more than me that
was fun an amazing suit I think no like
hmm I want something that's like
supportive yes that's actually hard to
find very weird little triangle top oh I
mean you can do that you do have the
power to do that this weekend if you
really like under big city
a good swimsuit price I have the time
over probably $40 on so really I mean
you don't want to know how much about my
love yeah I do my last
vilasa I just bought was to six
like lesbians just a inside all here and
then this is Dinah Shore which is the
biggest lesbian bull party at least in
the US but if you have to work
regardless of it being like like
lesbians or whatever but being in a
place where it's all women yeah that's
that's actually good it feels good and
empowering I think it will be very
liberating I already had one of my exes
text me and be like she's going to be
there no way that's like some drama I
know we're cold but I still like
I'm so tired they opened it real fast
I'm ready to are you really
don't know why I just got tired about
this and making people try it but just
got my yeah that's true well my game
plan is generally because you don't
usually wear bikinis to start with that
okay what is your game plan I'm just
gonna in the brows okay let's browse
I feel like you need something cheeky
how do you feel about your butt
for that here's I love returning it's
none of our business
let's do the stuff I got fair did what
did you think if you look good enough
yeah I'm interested I hope so I think
I'm ready
like your red hair
that's why every take there
yep that was smart
by doing just because some is like other
means to be in a thong for a second we
want but we can't have for others
oh yeah
yeah
here I love
I love it
it's a
yeah that's really cute yeah yeah
it's very like girl-next-door and I
thought you guys well keep going
I feel like this is good but I feel like
it I feel like you could be pushed more
good yeah I love it this is more than
bye that was looking yeah yeah I love
the color ice clattering yeah yeah it's
not even like a lot of food no how do
you feel in it are you self-conscious
yeah I love it oh my god who knew this
bod was hiding obviously that's what I'm
saying
let's keep going
yeah I think it's a little too
conservative it's not bad but it's not
it's not for us yeah but pattern yeah it
is so cute that's that beautiful it
feels very adult winner
let me buy them and get out there
hello friends I would like to not to
like try to be natural but it looks
natural we do photos
like favorite thing to do I love editing
photos I need to show one with your
leggings
don't need ever I just never thought I
did
lately though
my grandmother has a few
you could stand to lose some weight
like just a late
like I said that she wants and I hadn't
seen her at like eight years I was like
well where have you been like surprise
my aunt always say you're getting bigger
I'm like I can't even find myself and
photos my getting bigger she was born in
the 50s and back in time China or like
people are skinny so that's the image
stuck in her head to me it's just like
there's so much stuff going on in the
world right now
that if you want to come and talk to me
about my politics go talk about like the
terrible things going on like don't talk
about me if I there's nothing to say it
was a big the only thing I could grasp
on two bites like controlling my feet
everyone complimented me I wish I didn't
think so much about what I eat I want to
just eat Chinese chicken salad every day
honestly of all the things you only
think the industry's got a lot better
like the fashion it's been cool to see
yeah I know we know it can be done so
like do you know like oh we we go up to
size 22 now like first of all that's not
even the biggest size you could go Joe
and second of all like thank you bye
yeah you should have considered these
people before
yay
what good day I'm so high did you have
fun I did and I was like initially a
little nervous like almost as soon as I
got there I found the pool it was like
yeah it was very crowded which is
usually not my thing but it was such a
positive vibe you see like all different
types of bodies and I was just like not
being self-conscious it makes me that be
self-conscious because you're like
there's really nothing that that's a
good word that's full trip take your job
good job
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
