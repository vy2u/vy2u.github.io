whopping 70 pounds of clothing each year
this week we're gonna find out if we
really need as many clothes as we think
we do this week I guess I'm trying a
capsule wardrobe
what are capsule wardrobes a capsule
wardrobe is any wardrobe and it can be
any size that edited down by the wearer
to be the perfect number of pieces to
fit all of your needs for your daily
life I'm having jazmine narrowed down
her wardrobe to eight pieces and one
pair of shoes for the week and Branson
is gonna be wearing the zero-waste
Daniel capsule wardrobe for the week
you're gonna be wearing eight pieces of
clothing and one pair of shoes that's
all you get only one pair of shoes yes
only one pair of shoes this week you're
gonna be wearing the zero-waste Daniel
capsule wardrobe which is eight pieces
plus a pair of shoes and it's three tops
for bottoms and one hoodie I have so
many clothes
I literally have two closets worth of
clothes I really don't know why I signed
up for this I'm feeling pretty good
about this capsule wardrobe challenge
because my closet and wardrobe is
already pretty simple so some of these
are like spandex and these are denim yep
everything is a mix and we take cutting
room scraps and designer scraps that
would otherwise go to landfill are all
of your clothes made here in the shop
everything is made right here on the
other side of the shop by me and my team
numbers seven eight nine
I'm hoping that this experiment will
make me realize and let go of some
clothes that I can live without today is
the first day of wearing my capsule
clothing I'm looking forward to not
having to like stress about what I'm
gonna wear the next day this outfit I
think it's cute it's fine it's whatever
I don't know if I would have worn
something different anyway so I don't
feel limited which is great Oh Bingley
I already stained my shirt
anything in this pile is something that
I would want to wear
so I'm actually feeling pretty good
because I can still be myself
I think Ari said that hats counted as
articles of clothing but I don't agree
it is time to get dressed
it's pretty nice outside so I think I'm
gonna wear some shorts and a t-shirt I
see a beret there was not it just kick
think it's better I don't know these
were the rules
I'm Viking and my zero waste clothing
look at this someone has been wearing
the capsule wardrobe it was one of those
days where I'm like I'll I'll make this
up later because right now just tired
well you saw you're tired is fabulous
hahaha look do you even like all black
is a little weird to me like I'm used to
you giving off like that summer camp
vibes you're like from the future it's a
very Steve Jobs look do you
yeah they're organic I'm not overly
excited about wearing this outfit today
but also like my body feels because of
my period so I might as well wear it I
think we're supposed to do this seven
days I'm hoping Ari will stop us by day
five please all I have left is a sweater
and the tank top and I don't want to
wear the tank top because it's too
flashy you know I am at work right now
and as you can tell I'm not wearing my
capsule wardrobe so Ari is gonna be very
mad at me but you know what I just
didn't feel like doing it I feel like
I'm getting just tired of only having a
certain amount of clothes but it's
honestly not that bad for the last week
well like five days - uh-huh I've been
rotating and wearing the same nine
pieces of clothing
have you noticed no not at all
not even remotely at all I couldn't not
cleared it out have you noticed that
I've been circulating the same clothes
no no I'm wearing the tank top and you
know still feeling uncomfortable the
upside is that I'll probably remain
pretty cool I'll be able to you know
flash my hairy armpits to people on the
street so it's the last day of this
capsule wardrobe and I realize things
that I still haven't even worn two of
the items like what was i complaining
about I haven't worn the dress or the
jeans I think it's just because it's not
what I wanted to wear in general I guess
maybe I didn't mean 9 items maybe I only
needed 7 house actually admiring your
pants oh yeah yes they're made from
scraps seriously scraps that other
company's customers zero is wearing this
dress as a shirt is just another way to
wear things I feel like it shows like
you can use things in different ways
they don't have to be exactly what
they're intended for I think it kind of
made me realize that I don't need
probably two closets worth of clothes
that's crazy I think that this
experience has definitely confirmed my
minimalist lifestyle and definitely made
me try new fashions and being open to
new styles clothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
