tell I'm British
not all trillion as a lot of Brits do I
grew up wearing school uniform
I personally hated wearing it because I
got so bored wearing the same thing
every single day and the uniforms were
never ever cute I was always so jealous
watching American movies and TV shows
the kids never seem to have to wear a
uniform because many students around the
world wear a uniform but relatively few
American students do I decided to do an
experiment
luckily three of my very stylish
co-workers were down to help and they're
probably gonna want to kill me so we're
styling be producers on boldly so we all
really take pride in what we wear every
day I personally have never worn school
uniforms and I was always so thankful
that I didn't have to senior high in
high school you know how you have
superlatives I was best dressed in all
of my superlatives and I feel like that
wouldn't have been a category for you if
you wore uniforms all the time I did
have friends that went to charter school
and there did come a time where I was
like how I wish I had uniforms
what this is probably works that I
thought it was going to be I just had
really big HOF so I look like we're in
Gryffindor's looks like we're going to a
primary school yeah that would be sexy
this vest is supposed to go here which
is like where's my shape this is a lot
of clothing good morning ladies
I am your headmistress for the week got
some rules for you here do not remove
your vests without permission do not
under your top button without permission
we already have a problem do not wear
sunglasses indoors yeah it's a personal
jail do not roll up your skirts no
earrings other than studs you're like
you don't make you take your face the
hell a minimal make-up is allowed but no
bright and bold colors both of you can
host rain how bright bold this is my
nude all right off to class with you
attend to see the rule for word just
paint a fruit skirt okay
we haven't even been out here for 10
minutes oh my god it's not supposed to
pick up her skirt like such a
quake like I'm getting like PTSD through
middle school I feel like I'm gonna end
up at someone's perfect so I
sissy has hiked iske up and also tied up
the sweatshirt so you were the rule
follower this is still wearing her lip
and judges IVA was wearing her glasses
inside she also still got black lipstick
on I'm disappointed in you home
day one of school is done today was not
bad and I think for all things having a
really fun time wearing these school
uniforms man they're really comfortable
it got hot a lot of times today but I
was trying to like do my best to like
stay in my outfit all day and I did but
really one check out the bag so far it's
been alright
I can already tell this is gonna be a
week this does not take a couple seconds
to put on it is layers on layers you
gotta do the tie I think you guys look
like a cute group I'm waiting for your
single to drop you in the room maybe we
do it about what first time going out in
the world with our uniforms on it's
really hot but I'm not mad about this
skirt it's so easy breezy you guys look
cute and I used to go to a uniform
school and I hated it but then now it's
kind of look at them I'm like oh they're
kind of cute so I just got my first
meeting wearing this to be honest felt
kind of insecure just because I feel
younger in this I feel like you can't
really be taken seriously when you're
wearing something like this tomorrow I'm
gonna wear fishless I'm not wearing this
I'm wearing a lacy bra you know what
this school isn't the right fit for me
you only bring all these tools and here
I am the girl my mom told me to stay
away from hopefully Chloe doesn't notice
she's gonna notice I put on every some
of my clothing this morning
so did I and I took the time to make
sure I did go there Alliance in I have
my skirt the skirt rolled up one is
because it's it's big I come in clearly
showing that I don't give a about
ya angles thanks get in the Lindsay and
Cissy will roll their skirts and then
cover it so no one can notice that you
are bringing people so you guys can
break one rule but I can't break more
them yeah you and I'm creative it was
heated man so see I took it a lot more
offensively than I thought
Cissy and Lindsay were so mad at me I
don't know I get their point and
everything like that but they were also
really really really quick to rat me out
to Chloe when they were rolling their
skirts and I didn't say this is me
now I'm a cartoon character I just wear
the same thing every day I'm trying to
be good for them because Lindsay and
Sissy are like I will say one thing
though about my outfit today I am
wearing shoes though I'm probably not
supposed to wear so it's time for
uniform check these ladies have not been
good at doing this definitely need to
give them a bit of a shock oh hello
all right so it's Friday and all I want
to do is look cute on a Friday it's the
last day when you have you know dirty
clothes during the week normally it's
like okay like I'll just wear something
else this is the only thing i have to
wear i miss these I also miss patterns
and mr. denham Chrissy you've sat next
to us this entire week what happened
your thoughts
I feel like more drama has ensued while
you guys have one nice something that I
didn't really think about is like the
fact I guess of me being insecure in
this outfit so I've had kind of a rough
time with being in public alone I
enjoyed it for the first couple days and
then the last few days I was like no in
meetings I didn't feel as confident
that's up there great for the people
that are cool with them but I don't know
I feel for those people that clearly
like want to be themselves and feel
restricted I totally understand why
school uniforms are in place there was a
sense of like unity when it came with it
I felt like a lot of school pride also I
just felt like we look like a squad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
