hi guys I'm de Lisa and when it comes to
fashion and beauty
I'm laziest but I'm really interested to
see how women back in the day used to
dress honestly how did they live how did
they eat how do they breathe so I
enlisted my friends Delaney and Jess to
wear a vintage style corset for a day hi
I'm Delaney and I'm very excited to try
a corset but I'm also terrified hi I'm
Jeff and I'm really nervous how about
wearing a corset for a day I'm most
nervous about sittings I feel like I'm
gonna have to do like the little
pregnancy thing where you like hold on
to something and then go up Lattin so in
our culture corsets and things that like
keep you tight and give you that
hourglass figure I'm very very popular I
think they look cool but I'm also like
why would you do that to your body
I'm a very boxy woman in general I don't
have any curves whatsoever I think of
course it's I think of the vintage pinup
girls and anytime we see that imagery
it's always a woman that has curves like
I do and so I'm hoping that by wearing
this corset I can kind of channel that
positivity we're gonna take our
measurement to make sure that we're
getting the perfect corset for our body
types we're gonna send those out and as
soon as our corsets come in we're gonna
throw it back let's do it bring on the
corset I'm ready
it's corset day yeah
look at how little it is this thing is
pretty terrifying how will this even fit
anyone alright y'all I've had the most
extra past 24 hours and we need to talk
about it um I can say with all my heart
that I hated it the first thing in the
morning was that I was already running
late for work and then I'm like oh this
is gonna be easy it's just gonna be a
matter of me like snapping it around my
waist which was not the case at all I
basically have to ask my boyfriend to
help me get into a stupid corset oh my
baby I liked the way it looked I put it
on and I was like oh she's cute okay I
think something that really shocked me
was the fact that I had weights oh wow
I was sweaty a lot and I said on the
15th floor and going off these damn
stairs 20 times that's harder is it it
usually is I just ran up the subway
stairs and I'm really out of breath
I don't know if it's because of this
thing or because I'm out of shape might
be a little bit about here's the thing
about how I work I have three cups at my
desk at any given point in time I have a
cup for coffee a cup for water and a cup
for Cherry Coke which means I have to
pee constantly and every time I had to
pee I had to take this corset off pee
and then put it back on which meant I
spent like most of my time at work in
the bathroom honestly I was expecting to
kind of hate this because I have
horrible posture as you can see right
now I was so aware of my posture my back
was straight the entire day eating I'm
trying to eat but it's really really
difficult because I feel like my stomach
is already super packed I don't know
it's just this is really uncomfortable
so one of my co-workers had to literally
help me unhook my corset so I could
finally eat I'm always up and down I'm
running around I'm moving things and
moving cameras and with tripods there
was no bending at all at one point I
even had to call Regina to come in and
get me out of my corset because I was
dying candy on top it had basically two
different types of reactions from people
throughout the day I had people who were
legs yes way love it own it kill it work
it or top your outfit looks great and
then there were people who were like hey
are you okay but also looks like you
can't breathe shanise what do you think
of my corset
it makes me nervous you always look
fierce but like that looks so
uncomfortable I don't know how we were
sitting down right is it hurt this feels
like an HR violation
honestly mad respect to the people that
are able to wear this for a long period
of time but it's definitely not for me
god bless women because I don't know how
you did it do I think we need these body
standards anymore not really you know it
was really cool to see my body with like
an hourglass figure I still love my
rectangle that I got going on I wanted
to see if it would make me feel
empowered or if it would make me want to
feel like a classy lady of society or
something but that wasn't the case and
that's fine too honestly I have no idea
women were able to achieve that kind of
look every single days I'm glad that
were in a place now where like any body
shape is the correct body shape because
it's your body so live your best life
whether that means wearing the corset or
not wearing a corset wearing Spanx
wearing sweat pants whatever you want
live your best life just loving yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
