I am Kelsey and today we have on my
favorite comedians ladies John Barbie
Cho thank you so much for joining guys
yeah you have a ton of fans here at
BuzzFeed so we're gonna be like kicking
people off every one of them oh hi Oreo
my co-host Kate hello Alec you're a
makeup thank you really go I'll be back
okay fine thank you again for coming you
find a way to make a lot of like not
funny really funny you know how do
you do I don't know I mean I think
comedy really is about coping so
whatever your kind of coping with is is
what humor comes from I identify more
people who are just like not afraid to
say what they feel yeah that's important
to just speak your mind and speak your
truth especially for women in comedy
especially it's really a good it's a big
deal because there's not a lot of women
in comedy food but the ones that are are
really famous yeah absolutely good job
yeah I really get their eye makeup is
dope exactly so American myth venture
it's my album it's like a music album in
music there's a different way of
storytelling totally I think always like
comedians want to be musicians and
musicians always better be median as
weird trade up I think I'm more like
Bruce Willis opening up a Planet
Hollywood yes ever he was really good
losing yes has Hollywood changed at all
since all-american girl
oh yeah Hollywood has changed a lot
because now we have much more diversity
oh yeah that's great it's inspiring it's
really important because there's a lot
of different kinds of people lots of
different cultures that we're seeing as
entertainments grown the world has
become more open and accepting and and
so that I think that's really positive I
feel like especially with Asian
Americans a lot of us have some so much
of a feeling of invisible
show business sir and you can see
somebody that's doing it or it's been
doing it a long time it's inspiring so I
feel really grateful that I have
inspired a lot of people yeah you go
dude yep
okay so now we're gonna play a game
called which white person would play you
in a movie so which white person would
play you in a movie hmm I would say
Jennifer Tilly but then she's I think
she's half asian she seems to be very
Asian adjacent to me okay so let's let
the script which white person do you
want to play in a movie a Hillary
Clinton in her lifetime biopic oh that's
a bit with Bisbee Jennifer Lawrence in
The Hunger Games yes or see all of the
men in monument's Ben I think all of the
men in ma use but I like on I liked
playing that I think that's fun who are
you voting for oh I am voting for Bernie
if well I wish if I wish it would work I
wish it would work out for him I was a
you know a fan of the Clinton
administration I've already witnessed
her be president for eight years I think
people underestimate her as a politician
yeah I also think Bernie's great to see
such an idealist you want to vote for
your sort of what you really dream for
you know people say Oh Hillary can't be
president cause she'll just when she
gets on her period she'll just nuke
everything and I'm like what do you
think Donald Trump's giving one thing
pisses mommies like a third-grader you
she's gonna hit the big red button you
know I I still think for any screen I
still am but I think he'll educate too
yeah everyone's great except for all
so your 420 friendly yes so how does we
affect your company because what kind of
 but you can't really perform well
hi know really hard and then also with
marijuana
it does make you stupid I suggest people
not start till their 30s yes at least is
it sex the best idea
yeah that figure out like how dumb you
are and then just try to see if you can
afford to be dumber it's true I'll have
an idea for something and then I legit
my mind will just spin out of control
and I'll just lay down yeah I don't
forget what would it show mode you look
like um if I had more soos oh I would
have heaviness Marco you you like what
the bowl is do bondage as yes watching a
Food Network sharing like a lot not like
a small bowl but like a big like I'm
like a big like a ramen yeah I just got
back in Japan today what went with her
to eat ramen and I was so delicious
goals you guys be there goals you need
to have it's a really weird kind of
cheese even they had like five
mozzarella sticks on one and I'm waiting
surprised that's not a hangover sherry
there's somebody who was really hungover
get back down to more serious questions
as a woman I feel this weird like push
and pull but getting external validation
at one point did you learn did you say
each and I and what advice did you give
to those of us who would like to do that
well you guys have to appreciate that
you're young and you're beautiful and
you're doing what you want to do now or
years I didn't appreciate it now I look
back and I'm like I was so hot and I
don't even know like I was so like
caught up in not feeling like it was not
friend and
really your youth gets away from you
quicker than you realize
especially a comedy because it was like
always when like women were pretty it
was very hard to get people to laugh
people just don't expect it from pretty
girls that's like a thing that's not
there anymore because now we have a lot
of beautiful comedian right whereas
before it was like people would really
not trust you yeah so it's so
intimidating it's intimidating so it was
like they would be like what is this
bitch yeah what'd you bring yeah
but now that's not there anymore I mean
it has moved on help does so should be
glad yeah I would advise would you give
to kids or specifically like females or
Asian Americans that are being bullied
right now oh just to know that they have
the strength to rise above it just try
to just not pay attention to know that
it's because they're afraid of you or
that they're threatened by you somehow
and it's just really like a strength
that you have that that is intimidating
so the people believe it the the kind of
people that intimidate and scare them
and so to turn it and flip it if they
can't you'll become their boss one day
or they try to you one day because
you're always allowed to know how high
you are always last okay so the way we
end this is we take a selfie with this
Polaroid a lot then we put it on our
wall okay oh you came in here okay
ready 1 2 3 oh that's that's it you guys
want to go get some ramen or something
ok I'm sorry ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
