comes down to type of night do you want
to have okay I know it seems like
alcohol would be the go-to yeah we're at
a party oh you just want a drink cuz you
want to be like cheddar well I get it
he's a type of drunk we all wish we
could be the happy drunk drinking makes
him social give some flip Cup role and
say what's on his mind and people are
spies that global warming is real or
like more of a hose I'll make you feel
like you're part of the greater I
respect purity and even when he gets too
drunk he's still saying the right things
your love your love did exactly what I
want
chairs awesome but not everyone can be
him plenty of people try to but then
you're left with the transformation
drunk like that girl she wasn't always
smash wasted she started small but she
just keeps going
some people are drunk monsters oh you
look good enough she's impulsive
entitled and that honesty turns into
self-center Arden he said he's for sure
that you think I'm like that girl no
well once or twice you go through phases
you're like a giddy drunk but then you
generally turn into a Kyle T what type
of trend cuz that looks like he's having
a fine time yeah sure he does but one
more beer in and then he's gonna turn
into the contemplative drunk he's gonna
go home and think about the past to the
future far too much he's gonna cause
ex-girlfriend he's gonna make the plan
to delete his facebook so he can go off
the grid he's gonna think about that one
time his dad won't let him try out for
rent and he may cry while holding a
soccer trophy he never felt like you
I would have made a great Roger or angel
I know okay well if we get high do you
really want to do it at a party you do
if you want to be like Alison it's just
a hard time don't take anything personal
she makes people feel comfortable
getting on a deeper level what a
vibration could very well lead to us
having a wonderful time in a darker back
room singing along to someone playing a
hander for everyone Alison Eric ten
perverts when you're like herb you're
fun so somebody asked if you want to
smoke more and you agree before you know
you wind up in a darker quieter back
room where someone's sending you a bunch
of information about marijuana you never
want to know in the first place okay
well there's nothing wrong with being
antisocial never mind
okay well I'm quiet when I get stoned
it's like a calming energy to everyone
around me yeah but also you can be like
Rosie the overly philosophical sound I
know it's a chair because I've been
taught we've been taught that it's a
chair she will clear an entire room
trying to break down universal nominal
we pointed something and they were like
spoon everyone's like yeah
she becomes a walking philosophy 101
lecture class you always ditched how am
i me I see your point
okay so which is it
look Brittany if we get high we're just
nothing weird thoughts if we get drunk
will actually do those weird things if
we get high we can have a chill dance
party if we get drunk we can have a
dance party where we think we're way
better than we actually are or you just
do everything in excess
