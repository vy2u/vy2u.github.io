heaven can I give you some advice can we
give you some advice can we give you
some advice
can I give you some advice sure how old
is she now your sleep training right oh
yeah you got a sleep trainer don't sleep
train them just put a little bourbon in
their bottle knock him right out the
best way to get her to sleep is to give
her a lettuce bath a lettuce bath like
with real lettuce whatever you do do not
let her sleep with a white noise machine
she'll become addicted and become an
insomniac like me I'm so tired
oh definitely no TV before the age of
three she won't be able to tell what's
real and what's not if she bumps her
head put some butter on it and I'll stop
the bruising it's not really a thing oh
definitely thing oh if she has colic you
have to blow cigarette smoke in her face
we don't smoke so well then you just
have to start Oh
don't let her sleep on her stomach or so
suffocate and don't let her sleep on her
back because she'll get flat head you
should let her eat dirt I let all my
kids eat dirt builds up their immune
systems you let your kids eat dirt yep
and not one sniffle or you could try
co-sleeping our still sleeps between us
yeah it's super great please don't tell
me your Co sleeping she'll get all weird
and clingy like my cousin he got
arrested for stalking among other things
sleep when the baby sleeps eat when the
baby eats but don't poop when the baby
poops cuz babies poop too much if she
has to watch something cartoons in a
foreign language that's a good idea
that's actually how I learned French and
I still remember some Coco Coco go out
wow I only I only remember the animal
noises oh dear
you really should eat more steak every
night it helps with the milk production
mmm how many is that when she's ready
for solid foods you should Babybird her
what's that what's when you like chew up
the food and then you spit it in there
nope nope mm-hmm what about candy crush
she was watching me no no no that's like
the worst one oh yeah you can only have
candies of the same color go together
come on Oh exactly you just blew my mind
drink while you're breastfeeding so it
has time to metabolize before the next
feeding I already know that 100
sweetheart don't stand her up that way
her legs will get deformed okay you're
cut off
oh you get her vaccinated oh yeah
I don't know why everyone feels the need
to give us parenting advice you know
right it's like they think we're not
capable enough of screwing up our kid on
our own I'm being serious it's rude plus
it makes me feel like they don't think
I'm a good mom you're a great mom it's
they're not judging it's just misplaced
good intentions now there should be some
sort of unwritten rule that no one is
allowed to give anyone else parenting
advice mm-hmm God that kid is even so
much dirt I'm like his mom look at the
way she has a stroller packed it's gonna
tip he should probably go say something
yeah I know right it's gonna be good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
