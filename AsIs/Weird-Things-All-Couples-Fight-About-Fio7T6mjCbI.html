doesn't matter how you fold a towel it
doesn't matter how you fold the towel if
you want to fit in the closet you have
to roll it oh my god could you chew any
louder this goes on here it takes two
seconds well then the next person who
comes in will do it that's not the point
hey did you throw away my leftovers no I
could have ha ha you bitch
what did you call me nothing the toilet
paper goes over it's printed that way so
you can see it No the toilet paper goes
under so that the cats don't get out of
it that makes no sense what do you want
to get for dinner mad or really care
then just pick something you choose told
you shut up I don't see why I have to
put the utensils face down because when
they're sticking up like that if someone
trips and falls they're gonna impale
themselves and die that's literally the
stupidest thing I've ever heard
I'm not playing this game where I list
every single thing and you shoot it all
down not doing this again well then I
don't know what to tell you oh my gosh
watch this this is the best line
did you watch this without me you
weren't home seriously 6 more inches and
it's in the sink I get it anything will
be fine
fine fine all right we're gonna get
pizza anything but pizza what do you
want to eat that is Pro patched him if
it's Bill Pullman bill paxton wasn't
aliens that is Bill Paxton that is him
game over man that is that man right
there why am I gonna put him away I'm
wearing them tomorrow morning I don't
care if you're wearing them tomorrow
morning I don't want them just sitting
by my side of the bed all night why do
you do this you squeeze from the bottom
the next person doesn't have to squeeze
then it's toothpaste it's not like it's
hard to squeeze it from a new area on
the tube why are we fighting about this
why are we fighting about this I
why are we fighting about this I'm sorry
I shouldn't have made you make the
decision that being said I think your
original call of Pizza is fine just no
pepperoni what do you want on it then
anything other than pepperoni you're
going to murder you and when the pizza
guy gets here he is gonna help me bury
your body and then we are gonna get
married
