- Aww, I hope your tummy feels better!
- [Girl in Plaid] Thank you.
- Aww.
- Guys, thank you so much.
- Have a great night.
- Oh, so glad you came.
- Thanks for having us.
- Bye, see ya.
- Thanks for comin!
- Can I just say something?
- Can I just say something?
- Can I just say something?
(car engine starts)
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love them,
and I had a great time,
but those two do not know
how to throw a party.
- I was just thinkin' the same thing.
(girl laughs)
I mean, who puts out a single
cheese plate for 20 people?
- Right?
- Cheese plate went over real big.
- I know!
Everyone loved it!
- Yeah.
- Good idea.
- Mm hmm.
- Hey, did you think that James
was kinda flirting with me tonight?
- I wasn't flirting.
- (scoffs) Yes you were.
- No, I wasn't, I swear.
I was, I was just being nice.
- James seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.
I really liked him.
Him and Jamie make a really cute couple.
- Mm hmm.
- Did you notice her outfit, though?
- It was so cute.
- Yeah, it was.
- Hey, watch it, mister.
- You better watch it, mister.
- Are you really mad at me?
- [Girl in Plaid] Are we
lame for leaving early?
- What? No.
- I mean, you wanna leave the party
like, right at, right at the right spot.
Like, where it's still goin' on, but like,
you've been there a decent amount of time.
- Why would I flirt with
somebody in front of you?
That makes no sense.
- So you'd do it, if I wasn't there?
- No, that's not what I'm saying at all,
but what I'm saying is--
- I'm sorry, you thought
I was reciprocating what -
Yeah.
- Do I have zombie mouth?
'Cause I wanted to switch to white wine.
- It's okay.
- I feel like we hit the sweet spot.
- Oh my god, look at the kitty!
- Oh, so cute.
- Hi.
- Such a cute kitty.
- Hi, kitty.
- But, I don't know.
I mean, maybe, like maybe it
seemed like we left too early.
I mean, do you think
they bought our excuse?
- Did you notice how they left
right after the good wine ran out?
- Well, they brought two bottles.
- Yeah, of the crappy stuff.
- (scoffs) That's true.
- Is this worth saving?
- Is this even worth saving?
- Yes, of course it is!
(sighs)
All I'm saying is just
don't do it again, okay?
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- We need to get toilet paper.
- Do you think our friends talk about us
the way we talk about them?
- No, no we're awesome.
Oh, hi lady.
- Oh, hi lady walking across the street.
- Oh no, just take your time.
- Oh did you go to the market?
- Take your time, lady.
- Did you buy toilet paper?
- Ooh.
What's in your bag, ooh.
- It looks like you bought
a pineapple.
- Ooh, she got a pineapple.
- I wanna pineapple.
- I want a pineapple!
I'm going to cook a pineapple,
(girl sings)
'cause I'm an old lady!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
