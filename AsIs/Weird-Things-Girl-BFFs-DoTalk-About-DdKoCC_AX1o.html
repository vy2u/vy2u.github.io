the pool but she had a period and she
was like I don't know how to wear a
tampon so I have to wear a tampon girls
have to talk we have to discuss
everything when I was younger we were
talking about like really you know
random stuff it's quite different now I
think women have really evolved I have
this image of oh my god girls are doing
makeovers on each other and that does
not it's a competition to be a bum as
unproductive as you can I've taken off
on my clothes and danced for my friend
who's getting married
we just like spag each others but on the
way we like a fox is really soft man I
have kissed you know one of my friends
and it was really nice it doesn't you
know it wasn't like okay now I'm gay and
you know I want to hook up with you we
just kissed to check it out because we
were drunk and we were like let's see
what this is all about we were once at a
restaurant bar and a friend of mine was
talking to this guy she finds cute so
then she was thought of like you know
when I'm talking to him please take a
picture for me she would know each and
every intimate detail as if she was
there but we do say if it's good sex or
bad sex and great quantity of sex and if
it's quality sex did he know what he was
doing was he flailing I have not met any
women who discussed size and this the
size was really bad
I've had this problem where if somebody
gets to India with me somebody else is
sulking for days to come maybe I'd make
a statement like a char huh both hang
out Korea's casada huh but I but it
wouldn't bother me I will distance
myself I won't
I'll start ignoring the person I'll get
her back I can be with another friend in
the bathroom because if there's just one
blue and three of us after work we can
be a complete douchebag selves in front
of one another being able to say
whatever the hell it is without judgment
your close friends never question
anything they do this like the song
ahead like that you know like what the
 was that for that's because you did
this I have a set of friends that know
everything about me and God forbid that
we become enemies someday I'm totally
screwed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
