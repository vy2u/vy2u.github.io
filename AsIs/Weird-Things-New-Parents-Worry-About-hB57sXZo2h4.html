Cherie bells and grows up and becomes a
stripper she is not going to be a
stripper but if she does I hope we've
instilled in her the kind of work ethic
that will make her the best stripper she
can be
I respect her work ethic just saying
what if she has bad taste you know what
if she doesn't like labyrinth or
Princess Bride or Star Wars why was it
