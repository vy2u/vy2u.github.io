my phone out it was a scientific
calculator in sixth grade I cleared my
throat during a new talking session on
math class my teacher thought I was
growling at a girl and I got a detention
the guy who sat in front of me in
history class stole my hairbrush from my
bag and started combing his leg hair
with it I whispered what are you doing
at him and my teacher sent me the
in-school suspension for being
distracting I got sent to the office for
a dress code violation because my khaki
pants were too khaki I once got in
trouble for blinking too much I was
about five or six and I was trying to
see how many times I could blink in a
minute my teacher didn't like that I
once came to school dressed like Cyndi
Lauper and was sent home because it
sounds symbolized being in a gang my
friend was suspended for gesturing too
much while talking because it was a
safety hazard and he could hit someone a
kid at my middle school got a detention
for putting a salami in a CD player
blasted
