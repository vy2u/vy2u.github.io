Hemet for when the baby comes
is that a thing yes it's a thing cats
can be very sensitive they can smother a
baby or still its breath okay you have
got to stop listening to an shit well
either way the ASPCA has some
recommendations that we can do to help
prepare them and from when the baby
comes the ASPCA has actual
recommendations yes these are not just
things that you were making at no these
are actual recommendations from the
ASPCA all right great
this is going to be fun start to
gradually shift your cat schedule so
that he's already used to it when the
baby comes
okay my wake-up there's a crying baby
wake up okay see you in two hours
resist the temptation to give your cat
extra attention in the weeks before the
baby's due date this will only set him
up for a bigger letdown when the baby
comes
hey what are you doing I'm just gonna
give him one little pet oh you can't do
that what he's presenting his belly he
never doesn't act that's his plan
balance a few empty soda cans filled
with pennies on the rim of the crib if
her cat tries to jump in the noisy
result will discourage future visits ah
ah
well okay you get it I got it
place me baby out in several feet from
your cats food bowl and leave them there
for a few days not the breast pump the
babies milk goes in here it's for Emmet
to get used to when is I meant ever
gonna use the breast pump I don't know
don't put my breast pump or anything
that goes near the baby's mouth or my
boobs between the cat food and the trash
can new rule you can also start to use a
little bit of your baby's lotions
shampoos and creams on yourself so your
cat associates them with a familiar
person uh you know thats typer cream
right no no okay buy a CD of baby sounds
and play it during your cat's meals well
this is just kind of creepy
oh my god thank you ah start getting
your cat used to the babies prodding
fingers now by playing poke the kitty
ah come on I was just kidding stop it
stop it hope to help your cat get used
to childlike movements spend some time
each day crawling around in line on the
floor running through the house and
playing with baby toys okay I think this
is a bit much babe hmm what if Emmet
doesn't like the baby horse what if the
baby doesn't like Emmet
are you being serious we've had Emmett's
ins college he's been through a lot with
us and if he doesn't like the baby then
we'll have to choose between them and
obviously we would choose the baby we
choose the babies look I know you love
Emmett I love him too but we've followed
all of the a SPCA's recommendation the
actual recommendations from the ASPCA
know the actual recommendation so I
don't see any other outcome than Emma
and the baby are gonna get along just
fine
get some sleep diaper cream me my face
table I'm sorry I kind of like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
