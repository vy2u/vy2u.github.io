life can be annoying but there are
certain things that can be kind of
exciting it's not that I want bad or
annoying things to happen in my love
life but when there is some romantic
drama going on in my dating life there's
just part of me that's like I guess is a
little exciting it's all about a sexual
tension the best is when two best
friends they've known each other a long
time you and your guy best friends
secretly falling in love you fight they
bicker they call each other out I used
to not want to go on dates too soon
because I wanted the whole oh we're just
like best friends to drag on longer a
lot of times but guys just moved on so
they were like what are you doing all of
her friends are just constantly asking
you when are you guys gonna get together
you guys are perfect for each other but
you just can never see it because he's
your best guy friend but like you
secretly can see it and at parties
there's like these slightly inebriated
glances grazes your hip with his hand
and then you go home and tell your email
best rent all about it and then all of a
sudden one day they realize they just
cannot live without each other
they end up together and it's just kind
of the dream
so I know fundamentally that you can't
change someone but I get really turned
on by the idea of a guy who's that bad
boys like this tortured bad guys like a
ladies man player but when he's with you
he's good
then he needs the girl and then he
realizes that he needs to change his way
and he talks to you like he talks to
nobody else he learns to love ah love it
there's also that hidden romance you
secretly have a crush on someone who
you're not supposed to like your best
friend's brother or dating a co-worker
my current boyfriend now I remember
wanting to hide it longer and we were at
work she asks I think I liked the fact
that I had to hide it quickly he was
like this is horrific what are we doing
and I was like this is true yeah and
every time his name is brought in up you
get just like a chill of excitement
because you know you secretly have a
connection but you can never vocalize it
I don't want anyone to find out he
doesn't want anyone to find out so how
do we show our affection while being
secretive and that just makes it more
fun
I love that good attention senarios I
remember actually wanting to create
fights with people that I like I wanted
to get to that point where it was like
being fought we fought we fought but
like siblings cuz I'd be one of each
other something ridiculous that I would
honestly try to do and they ended up me
creating fights with people you two are
like known for being those two
co-workers that are just constantly at
battle with one another and everyone
look up there at it again there we go
they all get a thrill out of it but so
do you sneakily and they get put on this
deal together and they ignite each
other's fire inside we have to put our
rivalry aside then you go home at the
end of the night and you're like so are
we gonna do it or what now granted I
know these situations can take ten years
to manifest but that sexual tension
thank you attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
