very long time this isn't even mine I

some on the gavel think this is a
receipt for the this pad why do they
even give you receipt this just becomes
trash am I gonna throw it away no I'm
gonna put it back in my receipt pocket
boxer is my target I carry a planner for
being on my phone so much I don't really
use it as an organizational tool it's
like a badass planner I never use these
I never keep up with them but I like to
have it because X is not an adult we've
got 5 CDs because I still live in 1997
speaking of the 1990s
I have a tamagotchi on the keys I also
have a gameboy color which I play
sometimes when I'm just like bored
I got Kashi bar and over this games room
I tend to throw a granola bars in my bag
a lot like just in case and then I
forgot there they're not even gonna eat
it it's too crunchy more granola bar I'm
not kidding you there are three more in
here this is unnecessary I don't know
why I even bother with a wallet because
I apparently just throw my money
haphazardly in my purse anyways we gonna
break into the wall I just have like
alright those type of cars myself of
cards I just have to search through to
find my ID nope nope nope nope nope yes
oh my god a free Johnny Rockets meal

it because you can get discontent I'm
still a student in case anyone asks at
Baker ah

broken and is obviously not doing a good
job I have all these little chap sticks
I also have all these batteries I'm
always looking for chapstick and I'm
always finding batteries I have a
JetBlue
I just decided I would take this from
the plane and add it to my collection
probably should not keep this but what
if I want to take a nap in a well-lit
place this is a bottle of liqueur
cinnamon whiskey just in case
this is Sydney whiskey it should be
served chilled it is not chilled to it
in my purse just chilling out oh and the
other purse this is the purse within a
purse I gotta get to the inception
I don't have as much garbage as I
normally do trash more trash more things
more trash boss that's gross
everything that's in here is in here for
over reason like I'm not gonna take
anything out why am i a hoarder what
went wrong that I didn't thought it was
cool to keep trash with me this is a
mess I'm now more embarrassed it was fun
to go through it one by one but now I'm
just horribly embarrassed a lot of likes
