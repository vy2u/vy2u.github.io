and this time I knew I should have
brushed my teeth this morning oh man how
many times did I forget to brush my
teeth before bed cuz I just fell asleep
watching Netflix on the couch why is
this guy asking me so many questions he
knows I can't speak to him if the tables
were turned I don't think he'd be so
happy make him suffer a little bit whoa
that's a big needle you got this one too
ah
okay this time one two this isn't gonna
hurt this isn't gonna hurt this isn't
going to hurt this isn't gonna hurt this
isn't gonna hurt whoa my tongue feels
like it's sand why don't people just put
novocaine all over their bodies they
wouldn't be able to feel any pain I can
be super strong like Steven Seagal what
if I just took my shoes off just relax
is that weird everybody ever taken the
shoes off of the dentist before why does
the dentist make me feel so guilty it
it's like I'm going to confession or
something
I wonder if dentists believe in the
tooth fairy or is that just a Dwayne the
rock Johnson movie to them what if the
needle head falls in and then it just
falls down my esophagus and slices open
my trachea and then I just burst blood
no I would never have done I will never
eat sugar again Oh a lollipop wait isn't
this just more sugar
you're just incentivizing me to get more
cavities well whenever it's still pretty
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
