completely honest blonde kind of chris
hemsworth oh are you trying to tell me I
look like Chris Hemsworth you look Aloha
I think she's asking me out
unfortunately a lot of things I know
about Australia are not good things
your country is terrifying I mean I
don't know I think I heard about some
racist that happened a few months
ago you guys got the whole Iggy Azalea
thing that's a rough one for Australia
in America right now we're really
embarrassed about that I think it's
pretty shitty that most of the things
can kill you there stay to the coast and
don't go in the middle because you will
die and I think want to kill you also
and actually even if you are on the
coast you're probably still gonna die of
kangaroos for you are like deer for us
right or they just like they get in the
way and they crash into your car it's
great you're always friendly great
people good people I get the impression
that there are really happy people they
seem like lovely people love them yeah
they're chill I think they're sexy
they're heavy drinkers they like
drinking whenever I go to another
country there's always Australians in
the hostel I think it must be nice to
live down there I think that's why
they're happy
geysers down for everything keg stands
chilling out and you know people meeting
people they like to be outside they
don't wear a lot of clothes I like the
accent it's fun I feel like every single
country loves Australian accents and
they open their mouths and have that
accent I'm in you guys travel a lot I
think it's like probably more beautiful
seems pretty y'all aren't afraid of
things you guys are like Jumanji kind of
people you get to win the game we'd
survive the apocalypse that's true big I
think we could get along I think mean
Australians to get along we get along
I love you guys we love being
we can take a pic just don't like
Australians at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
