article clothing but every Sikh girl
cannot stand to mess with it is gene we
all know that the greatest asset to
thick dro kind has been and will forever
be legging but there are a lot of
leggings out there and not all of those
leggings are thick girl friendly so I
wanted to try leggings at three
different price points to see which
leggings get our thick girl stamp of
approval over the course of a few days I
did a series of tests based on very
important qualities that I look for in
my leggings
so for day one I started out with my
forever 21 legging they're super
comfortable the material is really thick
can't see my undies but you could see my
panty line can you see my underwear our
hands here in the room what you can yeah
wait can you see the panty liner can you
see my underwear not in the bad way
yeah not a lot so it hides your
underwear you can't seem a polka dot but
you at least you know I guess that I'm
wearing underwear I'm thing that I love
in my leggings is their ability to
enhance my curves and I say these aren't
really doing anything for my curve so it
did have a thick material but the
stretch was kind of weak so I didn't
really feel like it was hugging or
accentuate my curves in any way and it
kind of made looking at my butt really
uneventful I look in the mirror just
kind of like meh I don't think anyone
wants to feel that way about a part of
their body then because I feel like
forever 21 makes their leggings for
taller plus-sized women I had this kind
of like low drop crotch thing going on
which was really great for me not having
camel toe but like then you just have
this bulge of fabric like next to your
vagina in terms of accessibility
I gave it a 1.5 not all forever 21
stores carry forever 21 plus so the
forever 21 leggings overall score is 15
point 5 out of 24
so not bad for day two I ventured out
into the middle price leggings which
were from torrid like if you said
they're pair of leggings on this table
that are fifty dollars and a pair of
leggings on this table that are hundred
dollars I would have thought that the
torrid leggings were the hundred dollar
one they're really great for activity I
didn't feel constricted in any way it
really held me in so you know I wasn't
worried about my pants like rolling down
off my stomach or anything like that it
definitely molds to your body but here's
the thing sometimes that feeling is like
this these leggings are too small for
you but then you want to get that size
where it's just right where it's a
little bit of a struggle to get into
them because then you know that it's
gonna hug every ounce of your body price
I also gave them a three $50 is not
something that you can just be throwing
around now but like as someone who loves
leggings and would be looking for an
investment pair I would definitely
consider these an investment booty test
the hats give it a three oh my god my
butt looks fantastic of me it felt like
it was like lifting it with these you
could see my panty line a little bit but
that being said these were totally
crafted with the female shape and body
in mind it have again that high
waistband which I really love
but with this band it had this like
cinching effect so it almost kind of
like sucked it in to kind of promote
more of like an hourglass figure
so torrid came at the end with a final
score of 20 out of 24 so for day three I
had something with that boogy life was
like and I tried out Spanx leggings
you couldn't see my panty line or like
you would have to really be staring at
my butt to find my panty line so the
interesting thing about the Spanx
leggings was that they have this really
thick band but as someone that has thick
thighs like these I don't know how I'm
supposed to get them through this band
it may not look like it's really strong
but it pretty much has no Gimmes I was
also afraid the band was gonna be really
uncomfortable but actually it didn't
really make that much of a difference
and if anything these are probably your
most ideal Brunch leggings the band kind
of helps flatten you out I'm really full
I just had dinner the band is doing
wonderful things for me so one thing
though is that I did get a little butt
cabbage and every thick girl despises
the butt gap however I have to say out
of all of the leggings my butt probably
looked the most fantastic in these fangs
so for accessibility I gave it a two
they're easily available online but that
being said for thick girls they didn't
really have a ton of sizes I mean thick
girls come in a wide variety of sizes
and shapes and an extra-large is not
gonna cover all of us like come on your
Spanx you're like the number one thick
girl acid I would say like Spanx and
leggings are like you know head to head
in terms of like what every thick girl
has in her closet so for the Spanx final
score it is nineteen point two five out
of twenty four sorry forever 21 is Spanx
but it looks like a tour it is taking
home the golden peach so here you have
it ladies I definitely feel like as much
as I love forever21 they have ways to go
in terms of accessibility horde is doing
a thing girl you keep on doing it tour
in you should always feel like a boss
lady and everything that you're wearing
so whether or not it's leggings or jeans
or whatever it is for you you should
always feel like a boss at the end of it
all and if you feel anything less than
that you better ditch it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
