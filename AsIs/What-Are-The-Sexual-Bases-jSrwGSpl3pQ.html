talking about can right yeah I believe
so yeah I'm pretty sure that's what this
is what counts is first base for you you
know holding hands maybe a little bit of
cupcake him hmm I would say that's
kissing kissing best kissing kissing
kissing okay second base is under the
shirt touching in certain areas that's
breasteses is this all the nipples and
just just heavy petting in general hands
Oh ro hands or oral probably making out
a little bit but you're not quite doing
that much more but you know meeting the
parents you could say bathing suit area
it's fine okay yeah bathing suit area
okay our clothes on at this point or oh
yeah I mean you touched it put your
clothes on
see third base probably depends on who
you're talking to what is it they used
to call it heavy petting or something
like that
hands in the pants hands in the pants
okay things that you don't think your
mother knows about oh that's all right
there see you can't what like talking
like whispering oh no sex that's like uh
yeah you so you're going straight from
hands in the pants to a home run yes
third base would I would suggest uh
actual nudity into play now you know
like actual taking off clothes okay I
like that you would suggest it you're
not demanding but what about the full go
home run home run your foot that's what
it is I mean that's pretty simple in
penetration wise right I assume home run
home run that's that's everything now
shortstop on the other hand a saint what
would you say a pop fly is maybe that's
just an immediate hookup blue balls
usually just sexist happens for me so a
pop fly let's think I get half of that
if your car pull up in the driveway and
almost said you're trying to hike up
your pants and jump out
back window that's a popular all right
no I that American uh well yeah it's
baseball so get a little bit yeah
what about the dugout Oh kind of what I
was expecting I like that you're a team
player oh yeah I'm not selfish yeah no
that's nice
why would I be it's not whether you win
or lose it's how you play the game and I
like to play with everybody remember
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
