immediately think of bad ass thugs think
they might sound like the scariest race
of men in the world in my head he's huge
but he could be like the tiniest little
man in the world like they've just
walked off the set of The Departed they
sound like trouble like they sound like
the bad boy yeah they sound scary like
but kind of Australian which is weird
yes they sound a bit like a stray Lien's
with the car I want Boston men to fix my
car they all sound very sick I admire
the hell out of Boston accents men who
speak in a Midwest accent I always feel
like they're apologizing for something
they're always mumbling a little bit and
being hushed tones it's that Fargo thing
yet the Midwest is like George knew like
almost like the Canadian I confuse them
for Canadians and they get very very
offended don't know what the mid where
accent is not sure what that is
Chicago's in the Midwest right I do
recognize that Midwest accent because
the boys that I have dated have all
happened to be from the Midwest or
clearly I like kidding it's like a
wholesome accent where's guys just sound
nice and cuddly and I want them to chop
trees for me York the New York accent on
guys to be very I kind of classic you
know way men are all in full three-piece
suits are a long table it's always
buying and selling it sails New York men
are gonna buy me a pizza then take me to
the Opera in a really nice limo I'm a
little bit scared of the New York accent
actually automatically think of like a
used car salesman they were in a cap
they're eating pizza sounds like they're
a little bit mobster type thing like
totally roll bar and all of that a
little bit angry at the world and a
little bit rude but that's okay sell an
accent on guys they are all Cowboys as
far as I'm concerned
southern accent McMahon is like my
weakness it's so hot I really like the
southern accent southern men all wear
flannel and drive trucks let's have a
mental sex all those southern gentlemen
you know quite dapper
I just seemed like such chivalrous
gentleman wouldn't mind ending up with a
southern gent
oh you all sounds so cute and hot like I
don't know I love it a general male
American accent was part of my education
we grew up with so much American content
on Australian television American accent
I love it on man
hello the general American accent most
Ozzy chicks would find pretty hot
American accent is definitely a plus
card if you're traveling to Australia
boys yeah we've had a lot of American
guys come out to Australia and the girls
drop their panties or the boys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
