than the Boston men the Boston women
really mean it but some women are ballsy
frightening least wrong the Boston woman
screams alia do something yes ma'am I
will do it a Boston guy it's like you're
just putting on some bravado a little
scary it's a little terrifying like I
don't want to I don't want to mess with
you
women with New York accents who makes me
tingle I love it think it's sexy it
makes them sound like they're gonna take
charge
I think women in New York are like
powerful sound like they have money and
very aggressive with men you sound like
really wise like you know everything
that's going on when I think of New York
I think of the nanny that's what we got
in Australia I'll probably fall in love
with a woman that has a New York accent
a Midwest accent on women they come off
really well they're not like too
masculine not too girly it's they're
nice church-going ladies you know I'll
protect you they're very protective
mothering types I was in the Midwest and
the guy's mom beat me in a turkey trot
it was weird
that's Midwest women Australians enjoy
the southern female accent just because
it's different from what you usually
hear you think of a little midriff top
anything may be a bit of a lesser girls
oh my god southern accent girls oh I
could like bathe myself in that voice uh
I like it in small doses I find it to be
really really really cute so cute like I
just imagine like a girl with like
Shirley Temple ringlets walking around
in a big petticoat right thing I think
on on women it can just stand so it's so
lovely and elegant like super friendly
the southern accent on girls it's like I
want them to be my friend just like the
fountain hoop it depends on the
environment actually if I'm traveling
American accent is so bloody loud like
who brought the Americans that like in
general it's a nice accent of like
neutral because we grew up listening to
it female just standard American accent
has a lot of authority sexy a lot of
conviction damn American accent girls is
is sexy I'm gonna love it forever
