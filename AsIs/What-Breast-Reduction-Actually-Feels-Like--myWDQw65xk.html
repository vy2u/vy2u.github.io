were amazing perfect orbs no one told me
they were like puppies and they only
stay cute for a little while or I would
have taken more pictures of them it's
been all downhill since then I sometimes
found ketchup stains on my boobs from
other people's hamburgers
that's how intrusive they were all up in
your conversation all over your lap even
when you were across the room
my boobs arrived at parties several
minutes before the rest of me they were
a lot of fun I liked them other people
liked them I could hide things under
them I could rest them on a bar and get
free drinks I can't even tell you what
bra size I wore they had to be made
special or ordered off the internet I
was halfway down the alphabet maybe an H
maybe a J who knows they never fit once
I did the wheelbarrow pose in yoga class
and I almost died I was completely
suffocated under my own boobs and they
were so heavy I couldn't roll myself
back down again that's when I called my
insurance company to see if they would
cover the surgery they told me what
hoops I had to jump through and I
complied I also discovered that it
doesn't really matter that people don't
like you more or less because your boobs
are one size or another no one really
cares and that's pretty shocking I had
to have almost 12 pounds of boob removed
to be certain that it doesn't matter how
big my boobs are would I do it all again
I love that I can run better and see
better and sleep better I'm still a big
woman but I can buy a big bra off the
rack and I can even buy a pretty one
what'd I miss I miss asking random
friends and strangers to stand behind me
and hold my boobs up just for a second
just to give my back a break man that
was a great icebreaker and the most
amazing things
you have no idea how great it is to read
a book for the first time after a breast
reduction you can stick your nose right
in there I've drawn the conclusion that
a breast reduction is every bit as
psychological in nature as it is
physical it deals with sexuality and
attractiveness emotional stability and
social standards in a way that a knee or
hip surgery doesn't the opportunity to
date with weird boobs is a wonderful
blessing because you can quickly weed
out the unsavory boob fetishists from
people who genuinely care so I would say
if you're getting a breast reduction to
please another person don't do that if
your back hurts and then your shoulders
are coming apart and your fingers are
numb and you can't move the way you want
then think carefully and research
exhaustively plan well for your recovery
I'm glad I had it done I like that it's
a part of me I like the story my scars
smell and I like not having to worry
about them anymore now I have room to
worry about so many other things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
