would just stop responding for like a
while they wouldn't hear from her for
the next hour or so I'm like what's
going on oh yeah I do that leave the
lights on in every room is insane

passionate about it okay so I'm
Dominican she's Mexican Dominican people

jalapenos stuffed into plantains no it's
flavorful the word is flavor well that's
the one you're looking for like we have
this traditional food called calico and

but it has a lot of fish inside my
mother loves to make it and I would like
to please her and you should eat it too

usually I call her and then say Oh Moe
Denzel which it means out we leave at
5:00 and as you always get ready at 5:00

hate it I just can't watch a movie after
it starts but she's okay with it I'm
like no I can't do it yeah so true okay

towels that we got when it comes to
paper towels I'm a man of efficiency you
applied to the mess and you take one
more sheet until it is necessary amount

and just start dabbing it aimlessly can
always know where meeska has been is you
can follow the pile of clothes pile of
paper yeah because I'm so loose and
creative every night you get up to this
corner takes office underwear and socks
and he goes to bed and it passed up
whenever I'm trying to walk through that
door it's their underwears at corners

pat and I explode I'm like no no no no
