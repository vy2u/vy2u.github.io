day periods right there well it's yes
the average period I have no idea what
I'm going to be tested on at the moment
I don't know what this is about and no
one told me you are here today because
we are going to quiz you on your
knowledge of menstrual periods huh
I'm sorry what topic I don't know that
much about I have a choice
No oh I'm gonna show the internet how
stupid I am alright so the first
question what is actually shed during a
menstrual period
ovarian lining and do metrium vaginal
tissue its corpus cavernosum vaginal
tissue the vaginal tissue is not shed
are you sharing a period inside of the
ovaries I believe the answer is a
ovarian life inner walls of the vagina
get like loft off B if that's the
correct name for that the right answer
is the under nutrient I've handed me
dream is the innermost lining of the
uterus okay you ready for the next one
the hole which of the following things
is not a symptom associated with periods
a sleep disturbances he changes in
appetite see decrease in arousal and D
bowel movement changes and I use a
lifeline you know
these all sound legitimate oh this is
difficult I want to go with a oh my
sister would be yelling at me for that
sweep hey that is incorrect Babel
changes that is a wrong answer period
mess up your coups definitely so there's
a lot of literature on that I need to
read more books I'm gonna say decrease
in a route so you're right mhm which of
the following things is not a minstrel
hygiene item a cervical plug fee period
underwear
see see sponges and D see back up the
sea sponge just sounds like a like a
natural approach to menstruation maybe
like a wholefoods esque item because you
probably don't want to be plugging
things up I think there should be flow D
see what is your name you just said
that's right I'm going to get a cervical
plug because I think that's actually a
part of the anatomy
okay you're right ah okay so our last
question for you is can you get pregnant
from sucks during your period no I feel
like that's that's one that I think I've
got no the answer is yes you can oh yeah
okay yeah that is okay yeah can get
pregnant however it's very rare I feel
like a dummy I should know this stuff
that's definitely good to know knowledge
but just because something isn't
happening to you doesn't mean you should
be ignorant about it it's clearly going
to be happening to people you know it's
also just useful information to know so
that you can be more sympathetic to
women going forward to do it educate
yourself every gay man should know
everything there is about periods that's
useful life scale yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
