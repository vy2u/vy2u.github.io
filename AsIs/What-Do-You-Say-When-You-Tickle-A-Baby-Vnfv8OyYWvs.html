goochie goochie goo or
coochie-coochie-coo so this is probably
the cold vacant stare that I deserve for
asking a slang historian about tickling
babies but I sought the answer to this
question after a conversation with
Quinta about the slang word Gucci so
Gucci do you know what that means it's a
brand true oh it's expensive to say
what's good she means what's up what's
good or Gucci means it's like good also
that's what you say when you're trying
to tickle a baby
Gucci good you do to you to you it's
funny that's what you say that's that's
the origin it's coochie coochie coo when
you tickle is it coochie coochie coo
yeah cooch is a totally different word I
know I want her first and we said that's
a baby I thought I was good she do
because it's like an alliteration
goochie goo coochie coo was also
alliteration but yeah is it coochie
coochie coo cool that was pretty good
continue to do the interviewed evolved
after this point so I decided to hit the
streets just to see what others thought
when you tickle a baby when you see a
baby on the table maybe you tickle it do
you say goochie goochie goo or coochie
coochie-coo
um I don't know if that I've tickled any
babies you never took all the baby I
don't know I feel really nervous
chuckling a baby but if you were I
probably say Gucci good you good yeah
right yeah goochie goochie goo goochie
goochie goo definitively you're very
sure about your initial babies yes
probably coochie coochie coochie coochie
coochie coochie go I guess yeah don't
you could you get a second one doesn't
apply now coochie coochie coo sounds
like a vagina vagina vagina and why
wouldn't you say coochie coochie coo cuz
it sounds like yeah yeah that's right
see Quinta it sounds like vagina can be
in trouble of Quinta Oh she'll be fine
now at this point I have way more people
on my side because I'm awesome and I'm
clearly right but then I figured fuck it
why don't I ask some professional
linguist and really drill at home when
you tickle a baby what do you say I
guess I mean I say coochie coochie coo
if I'm trying to coochie coochie coo and
others say goochie goochie goochie
goochie goo I'm not gonna answer that
question there's some there's some
implications my answer is really not I I
wish there was something I better about
this but it really is that's a bitch
Akoo you say coochie coochie coo yes I
say Gujju Gujju where'd you grow up
you grew up in Tennessee right so
there's probably what we call an icy
gloss of line that distinguishes cheap
dialects running right along the along
the I guess I owe river you know okay I
saw you drive from Cincinnati to to
Lexington and the coochies become blue
cheese
but the so Quinta is from Philadelphia
she uses coochie our friend Chris who is
from California uses coochie you are
from LA when you use Gucci well I grab
them cook until del Hanlon I think
you're wrong I think you're wrong I
think you're wrong how could I be wrong
knee Keith Hammers burger wrong I had to
get to the bottom of this so I did what
anyone would do I googled it now again
there's lots of mentions of both but
eventually I stumble across a short
reddit discussion about the same thing
and it linked to a google fight web app
to see which had the most impressions
this was going to give
the definitive answer of which phrase
was most popular damn it but maybe a
different spelling would yield different
results damn it
that was wrong coochie-coochie-coo is
way more popular but not to be
completely outdone I ran one last
popularity contest one that I was sure
to win damn it
well I guess Quinta knows everything so
while we're here we might as well learn
about the word that got me into this
mess to begin with
people use gucci like often gucci has
become kind of a staple like saying was
gucci is like kind of normal to be like
with gucci no one has ever said that to
me well I'm not sure even kind of normal
you know I still I'm just so like how's
it going well do you use okay do you use
anything any word that's that
technically do you use anything any word
that would be considered something cool
doesn't count how about damn it
that's just a curse word damn it like
let me touch your belly let me put you
bendy cheeks you do the cheeks yeah then
you like tap baby's belly honey
Tessa baby belly like this I mean if
they're soft they're not a condom I'm
not tapping the moon the multiple
fingers like let's do a little baby yeah
that's I'm not like I'm not like hittin
up tight messed up my books</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
