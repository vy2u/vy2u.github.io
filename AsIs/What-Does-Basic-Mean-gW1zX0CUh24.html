beautiful Los Angeles California and a
month ago my BuzzFeed BFF Chris and I
made a video called if guys acted like
basic white girls oh my god I can't even
the video was pretty successful but the
comments seem very divided on whether or
not this was an accurate depiction of
basic girls or a basic white girl's
basic black girls or basic bitches which
made me realize that I really have no
clue what basic means so I've decided to
get to the bottom of this and attempt to
answer the question what does basic mean
since I work at BuzzFeed I thought it
would be a good idea just to check and
see if I was basic so I took the how
basic are you quiz on BuzzFeed com
but with a score of 7 out of 119 I had
my answer
Keith ain't basic but hold on are there
really 119 identifiable traits for a
basic person mathematically speaking
that is a ton I decided I might
have better luck just asking the people
so I hit up Hollywood to find some
basics so what is basic mean basic means
just like you're just like a plain Jane
everyday like let's say like a girl
walking with like denim shorts a plain
tank top and a cardigan like is so basic
you know with like the old looking shoes
just looking to impress other people
Lauren Conrad Lauren Conrad's follows
what everyone else does there's basic
like they all kind of look the same it
could be anybody that's this they could
be anybody could basics really be
anybody the quiz said I wasn't basic but
I guess it's true that I could choose to
start living off of Starbucks and
wearing forever 21 I guess but at this
point I still felt that I only had a
surface level understanding of basic it
was time to consult an expert so I
tracked down Laura Parker a BuzzFeed
writer who self-identifies as a basic
white girl
I'm whare I work here at BuzzFeed I'm a
writer what are some of your more
popular posts one of my most popular is
some things that all basic white girls
loves to do during the fall you know
things that basic girls do yeah you get
them I totally get you get them now do
you get them because you are them
absolutely yeah so you embrace it oh
yeah I embrace my basic man so let's say
let's say I'm walking down the street
hey how would I know
ooh a basic bitch is I mean do they have
an iPhone
are they texting on their iPhone I have
an iPhone are you tagged on sometimes
yeah you know I I mean that's a general
carrot but a lot of people have iPhones
are they carrying a Starbucks cup from
their recent Starbucks trip you know
taking pictures of things on the
sidewalk to Instagram later maybe taking
a snapchat selfie while walking it gets
a little dangerous but you know in a way
everybody could be basic but also not
everybody can be basic totally how could
a word like basic be so confusing I was
dissatisfied with this paradox so I
sought out my friend Quinta be who I
thought could help me understand all the
different types of basic you are an
expert on being basic I would say that
I'm one of the experts out there yes
other people that are more basic than
others oh yeah 100% I heard that there
are many different types of basic yeah
yeah can you elaborate on types of basic
oh there's so many levels to it so
you've got within the black culture
you've got the basic that too many too
many branding too many brands too many
brands because you don't have anything
that's actually significant to you that
makes you different you just look like a
billboard exactly you look like a big ol
billboard brain but a billboard that
doesn't have brand loyalty hmm and
that's even worse you know now I think
when you move over into white culture
there have been you know different like
labels placed on them a girl who likes
Starbucks a girl who likes yoga a girl
who likes Abercrombie and Fitch
a girl who likes one direction basically
the girl that likes anything popular is
the basic white girl the basic people
run the economy whoa
I think consumerism is built for the
basic woman or bitch for the sake of
this
I think consumerism is totally built for
them without them the pumpkin spice
latte would just be a latte there would
be no excitement around it we might not
even have pumpkins because there'd be
such a small demand there'd be no basic
girls to pick them
so we need we need them yeah so I guess
there are just multiple acceptable
definitions of basic but I feel like the
route explanation is something along the
lines of someone who likes really
popular stuff but there's really nothing
all that bad about that however I
personally do think there might be
something bad about people using the
term to demean someone else after all
when you call someone basic you are
judging a book by it's cover you're
saying that someone's character is
defined by the material items they
possess and really that superficial
judgmental behavior is so basic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
