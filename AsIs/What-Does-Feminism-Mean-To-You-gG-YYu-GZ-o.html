feminism is women being treated the same
as men in all areas of life believing
that everybody is equal feminism is a
movement that pushes for equality for
men and women feminism is not a bad word
it's not an insult not just for women
not hatred of men not about making women
more important than any other gender or
believing that women are better than
that Emin ism is not about putting
anyone down it's not hating women who
adhere to certain beauty standards I
have a boyfriend or a husband it's just
us standing up for what we believe in
and what truly is right I am a feminist
because I am tired of feeling apologetic
for being a woman because everybody
should be a feminist because I don't
think society should dictate what being
a woman mean because I think jobs should
be genderless because I shouldn't have
to worry about what I'm wearing saying
more about me than what I'm actually
saying I am a feminist because I want to
actively fight against the ideas that
we've just accepted into society that
are actually detrimental to women
feminism is important because women
should be treated like humans not like
objects for serious issues like rape
sexual slavery domestic violence men ism
is helping women to be able to stand up
for themselves speak for themselves in a
world where it's not always allowed one
where my children will have the same
opportunities no matter what
feminism is important so that women band
together women are underrepresented in
positions of power every facet of every
job in the industry I work for is
dominated by straight white men here's
what I have to say to people that don't
believe in feminism what are you afraid
of even if you don't believe in feminism
feminists are still fighting for your
rights when you say that you don't
believe in feminism what you're saying
is that you don't believe that men and
women should be treated equally my name
is Karen umma screening Stacia and I'm a
feminine my name is me C and I'm a
feminine my name is Abe I come from a
long line of feminists and I'm proud to
call myself a feminist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
