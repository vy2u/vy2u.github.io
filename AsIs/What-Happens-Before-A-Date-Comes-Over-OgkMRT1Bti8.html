she is not gonna respect you
I think the casual look is classy geez
you need to present an image of strength
and organization man so you're gonna
know in a second you're not an alpha
come on get it together
hey Argyle waffle for her pleasure pine
cones for her pleasure
I put an effort to an original gentleman
has interesting conversation pieces but
okay just walk me through the date no
fine I'll cancel it then no you can't do
that yes I can I brought this blind date
into the world and I can take it out
that's how the social contract works man
why do you care so much about how this
goes
jenny is Krista's only single friend
when Krista's friends are happy she's
happy and when she's happy I get K
dollars
what are K dollars it's just like a
coupon or regular currency I guess but
Krista gives them to me when I do
something good and then I can trade them
in for weird sexually oh hey I don't
want to know okay good then just tell me
we're gonna do on the date fine she's
she's gonna come in and then all right
dude pretend I'm her
fine
she'll come walking through the door and
notice that my apartment is normal and
not fake clean oh I'm so glad I spent so
much time getting ready for this date
we all have witty banter on the couch
for a while I feel like our chemistry is
like flying super hard back and forth
like two little birds going from tree to
tree trying to find food for the nests
for their babies and then we'll watch
Netflix Netflix
oh what a thoughtful and kind thing you
definitely don't do every night Ian Oh
Ian I'm really hungry it'd be awesome if
you had like an expired pop-tart perhaps
actually I have something I made myself
an original cuisine eggs and ketchup
eggs a la Ian you have to let the eggs
chill for three hours after you cook you
think the path to feeling up a girl
involves ketchup and eggs dude an
original gentleman impresses with
original quiz what is up with all this
original gentleman all right
there's this guy on YouTube all right
he's a real pro at girls hey guys what's
up it's Tyler and this is how to be an
original this guy is definitely not an
original gentleman well sometimes always
always always always never all you
saying is making sense and I feel to be
honest though sometimes I make this one
a sometimes and then you always are
looking great doesn't even have any
girls in any of his videos and he's got
a lot of pictures of girls that he's
dated so do stalkers dude she currently
has a boyfriend I guess her friends
don't really know about it yet because
your friends say she doesn't have a
boyfriend
look man I don't know a lot about this
kind of stuff okay there's no leukopenia
page on it okay how did you know how to
act when you first met Krista confidence
when you walk into a club see that I
just
my lips keep them lips moist style guy
is a total dude but dude there's a video
of him and he's going on two
simultaneous dates on different floors
of the same two-story Olive Garden we up
in the air at Olive Garden yeah I don't
go on a date that kind of girl
dominance assertiveness swag do you
think that maybe Krista is dating you
because you're a good guy it might be
like a little part of it and shouldn't
the one like me for who I really am in
it's a beautiful fantasy but in reality
relationships are initially a House of
Lies both sides build just seems so fake
yeah but don't worry I mean those houses
come crashing down when one person poops
and the other person's bathroom oh god
it's not happening on my end but it's
cool because once there is joint trust
people can start to be themselves that's
like ten dates in yeah I guess we could
clean up a little bit yeah but we're not
cleaning up as original gentlemen you're
right we'll do it like lazy gentlemen
alright man alright don't screw this up
okay okay
I need those K dollars you need to
go go
keep going out hey you must be Chris
Krista no you're not Krista you're
Chris's friend hey I'm I'm Ian
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
