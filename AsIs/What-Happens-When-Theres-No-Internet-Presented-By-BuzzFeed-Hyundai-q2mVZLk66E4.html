were just kids again Leon Jeffrey was
supposed to do but I got a deal on jump
rope and then they enjoyed their that I
hadn't seen since I was a child I kind
of saw the guitar when I came in and
it's just one of those things that was
in the back of my mind the whole time
and then when the Wi-Fi went out I I

some some words I think it was a great
connection between people you know
