kind of a douche in a few minutes he's
gonna ask you to do something and you're
gonna say yes even though you don't want
to why would I do that because you my
friend do not know how to say no I don't
yes
you don't let's face a kid you say yes
far more often than you actually want to
take last weekend hey do you mind
helping me move on Saturday sure I'll
bring boxes you want to throw a party
tonight
totally hey you want to go to a date on
Friday that seems like a great idea
okay maybe I do say yes more than I
should but I have a good reason okay
because if I say no people might think
I'm lazy I love doing nothing or they're
gonna think I'm selfish I hate doing
things for other people or that I'm no
fun and that they shouldn't make plans
with me anymore
oh the worst also sometimes I do say no
to things maybe not in that exact word
but I say it I would but I have to pick
up my parents from the airport I wish I
could but I hurt my face real bad I'd
normally say yes but I'm period Inge so
hard right now fair enough but you
shouldn't feel the need to make excuses
about why you're saying no I mean your
time is valuable isn't it it is don't
you trust yourself to know what's best
for you
I do then you my friend are perfectly
qualified to say no just say it say no
say no set yourself free
no no Jack no I just I try see if you
wanted a doughnut oh well uh yeah it's
fine yes I mean well actually yes but
next time no right
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
