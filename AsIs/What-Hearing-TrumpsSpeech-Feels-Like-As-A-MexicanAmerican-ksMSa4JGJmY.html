saw something on television that
terrified me and my mom saved the day
my name is Carmen I'm 24 years old I
live in Los Angeles California my family
is from Mexico my mother and I are US
citizens when Mexico sends its people
they're not sending their best they're
bringing drugs they're bringing crime
they're rapists and some I assume are
good people he keeps talking about
Mexican immigrants and he's not
specifying whether or not they're
illegal or illegal he's not giving
statistics out he's just he's just
talking about Mexican immigrants and
he's insinuating the majority of these
people are dangerous they're sending us
not the right people it's coming from
more than Mexico it's coming from all
over South and Latin America and it's
got to stop fast to witness a prominent
politician speaking on national
television saying these things to a
cheering crowd is just so unreal and
coming from my grandmother who was an
immigrant here became a resident then
got her US citizenship having a mom
who's a Mexican American citizen it's
hurt it hurts hurtful you know am I
supposed to feel ashamed of myself for
where I come from you know it had me
questioning my heritage just seeing that
speech I was really upset
I went to my room guess my mom could
tell it had gotten to me she went on the
computer and looked up some things and
about 20 minutes later she showed up
with a piece of paper with some facts on
I just think it's really important for
you to know the facts before you get
swept up in fear-mongering tactics so
this is a piece of paper that my mom
gave to me and here are a few things
that I want to share in terms of
immigrants being criminals immigrants
both legal and unauthorized are actually
less likely to commit crimes than
native-born Americans terms of bringing
the worst kind of immigrants immigrants
start small businesses at twice the rate
as the u.s. born and in terms of
immigrants being mostly a detriment to
our country
I have something to read from the White
House our American Journey and our
success would simply not be possible
without the generations of immigrants
who have come to our shores from every
corner of the globe when my mom showed
me these facts it helped remind me that
of course the majority of Mexican people
that come to America are not awful
people he's talking about a culture and
a community that he knows nothing about
if you know your heritage know your
roots you need to stand in the power of
that knowledge fear is not the American
Way of life and fear is not a way to
live Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
