like some skinny person and that's
totally fine I am 100% comfortable with
like where I'm at and the point is that
I feel so good like I can run a half
marathon now I couldn't run 30 seconds
before I would be completely out of
breath and just feel like I'm going to
collapse on the ground and now I can run
a half marathon that's insane these non
scale victories of things that you're
doing that have nothing to do with
weight it has to do with like how you
feel as a person and like what your body
can accomplish like that is what is
incredible that is what I try to do all
the time it's like really just get
things done and like really go for it
this is my Oprah moment hi I'm Oprah
nice to meet you
sorry I love myself because I'm a
different person I'm more positive and
adventurous and curious and just more
open to things in life and I think that
is something I never really did before
um so I think that I don't know I just I
generally love who I've become as a
person fine my choice a morning
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
