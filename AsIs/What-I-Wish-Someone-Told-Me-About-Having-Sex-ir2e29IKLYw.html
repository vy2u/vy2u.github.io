know about having safe sex I thought I
knew everything there was to know about
having safe sex always carry a condom
and never ever get pregnant but I guess
what I needed more than a dental dam was
a mental dam because I just can't stop
thinking about you people love to talk
about how to avoid STI s of the physical
kind but nobody likes to talk about the
STI s that can destroy your mind the
ones that can have you tossing and
turning at 3:00 a.m. raking your brain
and constantly wondering was I not good
enough for him was this just supposed to
be a one-time thing or my favorite one
how could I be so stupid enough to let
him in my sister always told me that my
body was a temple so never let a man in
that doesn't take the proper time to
worship you because you are a goddess
that is truly worth sacrificing for and
I only wish that I had taken the time to
listen to her more often but instead I
chose to listen to you and that would
have been okay if it weren't for the
fact that your love for me was untrue
because you like someone else when you
said that you liked me too
then deception turned into a matter of
perception and everything started to
feel like 50 questions except at the end
of the day I was still left guessing and
this asshole kept testing my patience
but my mama said patience is a virtue
and you said baby I'd never want to hurt
you but you did you me over and
left my brain impregnated with your
bastard babies called memories it was
all fun and games when I let you up in
me but now you won't even take joint
custody it took all but two texts to get
you through my door but let me text you
about some child support just and honest
why because I will never let myself be
reduced to some 2 a.m. whore creeping
out of windows and sneaking through back
doors I will never let myself be reduced
to some side chick just another side
dish at the kitchen table for you to
pick at while you wait for your main
entree to just being your other bitch I
am a person I have feelings and emotions
that have a right to be protected and
just having a vagina and two tits should
not make me any less deserving of your
time or someone to be disrespected so
if you're gonna choose to be with her
over me
well I guess you have to do what's best
then and I guess I just wish that we had
taken the time to use both mental and
physical protection and had a
conversation about what this all really
meant before we had sex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
