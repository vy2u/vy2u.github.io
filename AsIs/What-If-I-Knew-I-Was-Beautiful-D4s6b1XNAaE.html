what if I did you say I don't know I'm
beautiful but what if I did wouldn't you
just call me a bitch wouldn't you say
that I was stuck up or vain or some
other kind of unnecessary
wouldn't you try to cut my confidence
down to half its size so that you could
swoop in and tell me I don't know I'm
beautiful as if this was some sort of
surprise well I have news for you I am
NOT a parking ticket looking for your
validation your songs filled with sweet
nothing are no longer allowed to park
for free they're no longer allowed to
cheapen my self-esteem
you say I don't know I'm beautiful but
what if I did what if I looked in the
mirror and actually liked what I saw
makeup or no makeup flaws and all what
if I woke up really feeling myself and
could post the selfie to Instagram
without any self doubt no questions
contemplations or hesitations because
the only person's confirmation I would
need is my own you said don't know I'm
beautiful but what if I did
what if I accepted compliments at face
value instead of constantly feeling the
need to devalue myself for the sake of
someone else no stop you're just saying
that to be nice you're just saying that
because you're my friend
if you've ever caught yourself saying
these words please take a moment and
think again please take a moment to
marvel at the radiance of your beauty
both on the outside and from within
don't be afraid to be a woman who likes
herself there is no need to love your
body with trepidation because that
bottomless pit of hesitation that you
feel our only false expectations
appearing real so don't let your fear
get the best of you because every part
of you is the best of you and if that is
a crime if this just so happens to
offend everyone else
I guess I'll be doing bad all by myself
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
