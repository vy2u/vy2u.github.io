and all over the internet and I've been
called a lot of mean things because I
seem to be kind of polarizing but one
word comes up all the time and that is
 so I wanted to do an investigation
into what that word means and if I am
one so what's the first thing that you
guys do
first thing that we did is we took it to
the streets what makes somebody a
it's the quantity I think that makes a
person of such as a quantity five people
in one night
you know every day all day seven days a
week sexy clothes and buy sexy clothes I
mean just strings somebody that sleeps
with a lot of people well in my opinion
Isleta someone who does not practice
self-control self-restraint if you feel
like that you've devalued yourself and I
would think that that's a - what
how would I know
no I would say not no I know you notice
like well how do you know that you don't
know me that's true but I mean maybe
even I don't know you don't seem like a
slight I don't seem like a internet
now you know it's interesting that no
one seemed to have like this same
definition of what it was but they all
kind of agree goes bad five people in
one night just strings quantity
self-control when pushed a little bit
the definition falls apart am i a
no so what do you guys do next we asked
some lovely people to come in and told
them to draw what they think a
looks like alright let's watch that can
you draw a please oh okay I'm a
terrible drawer
a
you guys are gonna hate this answer why
you hold it up in point - what's what -
show us well I have a girl with her legs
open big boobs and if I had more time
and artistic ability maybe I would draw
like a dick in a hand her mouth opened
in your mouths open waiting for a deck
its Pigpen from the peanuts cartoon
because I heard that the word used
to mean just like dirty a doesn't
exist in my mind because I would never
call anybody a years of television
media I'm assuming this is what a hooker
looks like I just figured the easiest
way to convey is a woman that says
yes to all men okay she's got her legs
wide open swell little bit of a why
did you draw a woman because you know
I've like never seen on TV and movies
like a male streetwalker
okay so what are we learned from the
drawing well mostly we learned that
everybody's opinions on what a
looks like is different and I was still
pretty confused I mean it's a big word
it's um it's full of history it's full
of weight it's it's a lot yeah and I
don't think that anybody really knew
what they were drawing so the next thing
you guys did is you went in found an
expert to explain the word yeah I
went to talk to Emily Linden who's the
founder of the unslung project which is
a project that's anti-bullying and anti
slut-shaming awesome yeah check that but
what is slut-shaming I define it as
implying that a girl or a woman should
feel guilty or inferior for real or
perceived sexual behavior what have you
seen in your research has been reasons
that women have been called the
better question is what are some reasons
that a woman would not be called a
I mean really it's anything literally
any woman at any time can be deemed a
 it's in the eye of the beholder so
you're a if someone else thinks
you're a
yeah at any point in time or
one like spreads a rumor about you if
you can't prevent anyone from calling
you a by how you dress or how you
act or where you are youing out with
does another so there's nothing I can do
I wouldn't ask people on the street
right and they had all kinds of
different answers from girls who go to
the club too much than also the typical
you know girl who has a lot of sex that
they couldn't really quantify what a lot
is yeah how much tag how much is too
much so there were not a lot of real
answers and then when I would ask them
Oh am i a without knowing me at all
they would say no no no of course not my
takeaway is like is this such a bad
thing yeah or even that it's not a thing
I mean that can't be defined really
because it's whatever anyone wants to
use to keep a woman in a place that they
think she belongs in so when you're
saying that people call you a in
the comments it might be because the way
that you come across in your videos or
the way that you talk or the way that
you look is something that makes that
comment or feel like they want to put
you back in a place you know where you
belong I guess so I guess one way that
you could personally avoid it is to stop
speaking it's to stop making videos and
you're very loud please stop so what's
the last part of your journey so we
got a lot of opinions about what it
means to be a but we needed to go
to the source so we interviewed my mom
hi honey
hello this is my mom hi this is mom what
is your opinion on how I of you so do I
think you're a I wouldn't use that
word I'm proud I guess your ability to
have so much confidence and the fact
that you say whatever you want to say I
don't know many women who could do that
but sometimes it's just a little too
much yes bring it out so yes do it and
so sometimes like that sometimes I hear
your grandmother on my shoulder you know
like oh my god no I don't think you're a

I think you're alight
for everybody else who is recept surely
you've opened my eyes to look at women
differently and less judgmental you
mom I mean I guess like the question is
do you feel like you understand what a
 means and whether it's you like you
are a ah my takeaway is so what if
I am
doesn't matter I'm me I'm cool with me
I'm happy and it's nobody's business
and if I am one oh well then it's not a
bad thing all right it then be who
you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
