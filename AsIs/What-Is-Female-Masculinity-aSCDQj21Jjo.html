but if anything I guess it would be
butch MOC which is like masculine of
Center and a genderqueer butch mahu
gender-neutral and I'm gender-neutral
lhb long hair but I haven't always felt
butch but I've always felt like
identified more he's being more
masculine than feminine I see butch
almost like an extreme side of the
spectrum and I see myself falling more
towards the middle I think society is
actually just taking all those words and
kind of just throwing them away now and
creating a whole new world and I'm sure
they'll put a word to everything that
everyone's becoming there's a lot of
different types of Butch's and identify
more with like the butch queen aspect
sometimes a not male or female I just
I'm like I don't know where that came
out of I don't know what that is but
yeah that's me right there
I believe that masculinity goes beyond
aesthetics they like to associate that
with gender but I feel like each gender
has a little bit of both gender in
general can be inherent but also
performance and that your full identity
can be some combination of how you feel
inside and what you like to see when you
look in the mirror and sometimes can
also have like masculinity
there's tons of parts of you I feel like
your mind can be more masculine
sometimes your emotions can be more
masculine sometimes I think it's just
becoming so much more fluid than it ever
has been before female masculinity has
this whole background of growing up a
certain way and having to be put in
situations where a lot of men haven't
had to go through there's a certain
female sensibility tucked back in
between the d-cups they're both a
performance of gender but I consider a
female masculinity to be sort of like a
rebellion now that I present as more
masculine if I see another woman walking
around at night I'll consciously think
about how they are seeing me and present
myself as less threatening
it's personifying like all the best
parts of masculinity but they're leaving
out like all the worst misogynistic
aspects
straight girls are intrigued straight
men are sometimes intimidated sometimes
eager to create some sort of bromance
with me clothing lose their butt then
lose their or tied their and a too tight
they're not dressing the way anyone
would expect me to dress like in a
meeting I don't wear heels don't have
long hair I think the advantage comes
from your self-confidence in general I
don't get catcalled by straight men
walking down the street there's an
advantage inherent and just being Who I
am I feel like if you're happy and
you're not hurting anybody then what's
wrong with what you're wearing like I'm
not wearing anything that's hid like
hating towards somebody else or another
community I'm just feeling more
comfortable in my skin
I just dress the way I dress and I look
the way I do because it makes me feel
comfortable I feel pressured to act
flat-chested and not anymore
once you get older you start with like a
hunk of a this is me when someone puts a
label on me or when I'm labeling myself
even when I said gender neutral I feel
like I'm constantly watching myself from
what I do and if I'm doing it the right
way I felt like had to be more
chivalrous a lot of times butch women
are blessed with the burden of boobs
that's a very funny like cross to bear
on top of everything else I got Top
surgery two years ago and before that I
was miserable to be around because I was
always so insecure I would be at the
pool parties at the standard wearing
like a thick ass hoodie and a hundred
degree weather because I didn't want
nobody seen my body sweating to death
because I wasn't happy and now I'm like
I'm happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
