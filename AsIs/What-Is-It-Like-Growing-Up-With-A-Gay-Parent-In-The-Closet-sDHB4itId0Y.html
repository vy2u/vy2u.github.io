when you were in third grade what was
that conversation like I went to a
school that was super progressive we
knew what being gay met we had Gay Pride
Day he was already in a relationship
with someone I had asked him like
previously like what's going on between
you two
one night we were eating dinner and I
said to my dad I said I really want to
know the real reason why you two sleep
together in the same bed he was like so
we sleep together because we're in a
relationship
yeah and I was like what does like wanna
study he mean you know he said well I'm
gay and so I started crying
not because I was hurt that he was gay
yeah but because he lied to me like you
just told me what was going on and like
how you were feeling and what you were
going through like I was doing school
gave in
doing that and so his whole thing was
like well you know I wasn't comfortable
with it I wanted to make sure it was the
right time it's been heaven ever since
like him not telling you had more to do
with like his journey oh yeah definitely
because you were clearly like okay

lesbians are okay did I yeah I did when

family who yeah they were lesbians yeah
you would like a big queer happy family
going on yeah do you feel like you're a
part of the queer community yes I'm
still trying to find my place hmm you
know I think about it as like a black
woman who's dealing with black rice and
having a white Ally and thinking about
it in a sense of like when they can
speak and when they can't speak and just
it's time for them to listen that's how
I think about myself in the LGBTQ
community like sort of figuring out like
where is the best time to use you yeah

Oh perfect spin the bottle is we asked a
personal question we spin it whoever it
