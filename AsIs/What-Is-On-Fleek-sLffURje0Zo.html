this word come from I mean I gather that
it's slang but I really don't hear
anybody using it it would seem to me
like it's just something people say on
Twitter and it would appear that I'm not
the only one who thinks that so I'm
gonna make this video and try to figure
it out what is Shawn freak big new word
brand new on fleek on fleek fleek fleek
fleek so what would you like to know
about fleek today Keith well I guess a
what does it mean mm-hmm B where did it
come from
gotcha okay fleek is on point fleek is
good fleek is great fleek is perfection
this burger is fleek
or what I say this person say this
burger is on fleek on for you on fleek
like on its best behavior
yes where did Fleet come from um fleet
came from a vine I'm not sure of her
name but she said her eyebrows were on
fleek the oh so that it was first
used and accepted as an eyebrow term to
describe eyebrows what do you think of
my eyebrows um if I had your eyebrows my
eyebrows probably would not be on fleek
you know buddies need to be a little bit
more groomed out of fleek
that's the worst I still don't get it so
I head to San Francisco with Chris to
track down some linguists from Berkeley
to get their take on fleek now they may
look like two old white guys but trust
me they are but they also know a ton
about slang what is your explanation of
on fleek
well fleex interesting because it just
bubbled up out of nowhere
yeah in the way words didn't use to do I
mean used to be slang would begin among
high school kids and kind of work its
way around the school and maybe to other
kids about our generations and and then
bubble up into the speech of older
people by the time the older people were
using it the high school kids had moved
on to something else right the point the
whole point of slang is to keep your
language secret language but now you can
make a video or a vine or something like
that a word catches on the link is
passed all around
and you know two weeks later they're two
billion people who are using this
expression it's astonishing what do you
think about how virality is playing into
slang does that is it legitimate yes
absolutely I mean there are people who
try to introduce words into the lexicon
and generally speaking the so that's
something the urban dictionary and it's
open source and they'll put it in say
it's in the dictionary but nobody uses
it right
intentional coins are really rare but
they do happen and that's that's a great
example but the speed with which slang
is transmitted is sort of exponentially
faster now than it ever has been because
of social media
fleek strikes me as the kind of word
that everybody except that one gal with
her eyebrow used in quotes it was kind
of a slang word that existed to be a
slang word it nobody ever really used it
in earnest today people are debating
whether or not fleek is good and that we
saw this with BAE you know what I mean
like they're like fleek is corny we're
using that that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard and there are some
people who accept it I accept it I'll
use it if it's you know appropriate I
don't say it for everything right I
wouldn't say it in a professional
setting except for this one yeah but you
know you have to accept it into your
life hmm so if I really want to accept
fleek I need to understand it how it was
originally popularized I need to get my
eyebrows done or is it my eyebrows did I
need to get my eyebrows on fleek
dafuq
hi nice Henry nine Norton Keith hammers
burger nice to meet you
and I believe you want to have your
eyebrows done today yeah I want them to
be perfect you could use a little bit of
waxing right here yeah oh this area
won't be a sensitive already I'm just
such a beautiful boy and I will do
anything for beauty but I'm also no
emotional and sensitive I see that yeah
here you go Latoya just just that I miss
them already all right we did it
guys we did it you did it no you did it
33 years of eyebrows and probably a
million other things you're good at
right back to the parking lot and shoot
myself now okay great everybody had an
equally good time so we just got my
eyebrows done I feel like they're
perfect but now I'm going to ask the
people of Hollywood what they think of
my eyebrows and if they say on fleek
well then I know I've done it what do
you think of my eyebrows third fine
arched nicely uh pinned yes thank you
I can't believe see that you just got
the vent be honest thank you on fleek on
play very unsweet on blink that's a word
yes yes my friend has a shirt that says
on fleek on it so it's totally
legitimized slang yes did you use it in
normal violence did in normal day hello
do you use on fleek in real life do you
use it he's on fleek good good cuz so
they're on fleek yeah so okay so I guess
though it's still debated of whether
it's fun or cool to use people are
really using it out in the world even
though it did originate online so I
guess on fleek is good you can say on
plate it's slang we did it everybody
it's definitely slang and it just means
the same as several other slang words
that we already have
I got no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
