they have to walk miles just to get
water all I have to do is turn on a
faucet that's privileged
you have ever tried the changers
I think privilege is when some people
have some things and other people don't
have things I feel privilege is
something that you don't even really
have control over I think it'd be silly
for me to say I don't have a fair amount
of privilege considering like the
country I live in and the job I get to
do in the college I was allowed to go to
I suppose being a white male will help
me end up somewhere toward to the front
but I'll take a few steps back from
being gay I don't think I'll make it to
the front
I think I'll maybe be in the middle
that's just a gut feeling I have if your
parents work nights and weekends to
support your family take one step back
if you can show affection for your
romantic partner in public without fear
of ridicule or violence take one step
forward if you are embarrassed about
your clothes or house while growing up
take one step back if you have ever been
diagnosed as having a physical or mental
illness or disability take one step back
if you have ever been bullied or made
fun of based on something you can't
change take one step back if you get
time off for your religious holidays
take one step forward if you came from a
supportive family environment if you can
see a doctor whenever you feel the need
if you are able to move through the
world without fear if you've got loans
for your education there were more than
50 books in your house worth
so these are your final positions
I think it felt kind of strange for
everyone it's a hard thing to discuss or
even reflect on it was very awkward I
think when you can represent it so
visually like this and so immediately it
definitely takes on a new form I think
we were like all joking around in the
beginning I was pretty light-hearted and
as soon as the questions started coming
in the mood shifted immediately and we
all kind of it was a silent just looking
back and seeing like a bunch of people
behind you is not a good feeling it's
like weird how you wanna like hold on to
explaining a certain privilege like oh
but that's not actually me cuz like I
had to work really hard for that so it's
it's weird to like take a step forward
when you feel like you're taking a step
forward with someone else but you wear a
lot of the baggage of like how this
things are hard it was like more
emotional than I thought it would be it
reminded me of when they talked about
slavery and high school and you feel
like angry for a few days but then you
just realize like this is how it is for
me it was kind of frustrating almost to
look back and see how much further
some people were behind me and realizing
that you know a lot of that stuff no
amount of hard work or even legislation
can make up that gap it's interesting
being an asian-american cuz you kind of
you're not really sure where you fall on
the spectrum
privileged I know that for me they're
one of the reasons I ended up so far
back was that there are questions around
safety as an african-american as a woman
as a gay woman there are just so many
different ways that I don't feel safe I
feel like I just learned to be grateful
for what you have you know we're in such
a huge society where it's always
complaining about what you don't have it
just shows you that for some families
like each family you're meant to do
better my grandparents did good my
parents did good and I'll do even better
I do think if you're not like aware of
privilege you should do this exercise
but it's more complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
