demonstrating up slipped off hi
everybody welcome in the closet I'm Jen
that's Nikki we are here today to talk a
little bit about safe sex what what does
that mean what does it mean we don't
know I know
we're also speaking from personal
experience so I'm a lesbian Nikki's a
lesbian and we have a friend coming to
chat her name is the young Kelsey Kelsey
do you want to come in and on through
this side door right now yeah it's a
squeeze
well that's a she yeah hi it's relevant
a buddy
for you welcome to close it everyone we
are married once yah-tchi Beauty great
this also my my ex-wife and friend a
healthy yeah I'm Kelsey I'm bisexual and
I use she/her you smell nice thank you
like laundry fresh grass Andreea yeah
I'll cool it shirts like three days old
so today we are gonna talk a little bit
about yeah my favorite we've all been
with women right if you did you ever get
any idea like what safe sex between Oh
without never I mean in sex ed your you
picture like in the movies where it's a
teacher with a banana and they're
sliding the condom on you're never like
taught what safe sex between women look
like and then what that can do is make
you think that because you're not having
sex with a penis that there are no
precautions that you have to take
totally which isn't true
really vagina everywhere when you start
having sex with women did you guys think
there was like any risk for STDs no no
one ever you know had dental dams in
their side drawer the way that like
people have condoms in their side Rory
have you guys ever been with someone and
then just sort of like pretend it's a
second mouth and just like talk through
it like people it's funny no one I think
it's so funny every time I do it
you know everyone have sex however the
way the one as long as it's safe we keep
saying like them
down but like ways that I've never
actually seen one right like I've used
it once okay she brought it up and I was
like sure I guess I'm open to that I
just didn't know how it worked just was
all sorts of confused you guys feel
comfortable like having the conversation
where you're like hey when was the last
time you were tested no never
like I've never once been able to work
it in smoothly it's always just been
like I just was like okay wait Bella
oh maybe you can be like hey let me just
tell you this was the last time I got
tested yeah there's been anything on you
yeah and then it's a little less that is
smart moral of the story is it's hard to
ask questions about sexual safety and
sexual health but that doesn't mean you
should avoid doing it what is a dental
dam so a dental dam is similar to like a
latex condom therefore like if you have
a vagina you can place this over your
vulva and when someone like goes down on
you it creates a barrier between your
mouth and the vulva so like that and
that really is this taste far better
than a condom so if this is my badge
then that's my bunghole you can you know
reduces the risk of catching STDs such
as syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia herpes
and AIDS Wow why don't you use that why
wouldn't you do that exactly it doesn't
eliminate the risk for it but it reduces
the risk most importantly I think you
should just ask your doctor gynecologist
should have these very readily available
like like take home baskets like old
treats
Kelsey Nicki and I are going to make
dental dams I regret opening this this
is so Looby I know yeah are they all
follow up in the cooter dudes I was kind
of powdery for example if you want to
make a dental dam for oral sex you can
use a latex glove yeah and cut that in
half or you can take a condom
and cut it in half and then pull it taut
and you have time for a dental dam but
don't use Ziploc or saran wrap guys they
have little tiny cross-sections where
does easiest can get through so make
sure you use something that's used for
actual protection also if you're trying
to make something into a dental dam
maybe Google at first we added some
links in the bio here about safe sex
which you can peruse at your leisure
well I think it's really fair that if I
have condoms in my bedside drawer that I
should also carry some oh yeah no matter
what your genitalia is there options
that can cover you up make it safer
create a barrier and if no excuses why
you shouldn't be on safe sex be safe
take care of yourself be honest and have
fun yeah should we leave the closet
Kelsey I'm gonna forgot here I know
please do okay I got woo did it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
