I could have ever asked for
but it's hard out there for a thick girl
during summer season but two words tub
rub for those of you that are unfamiliar
with chub rub it's basically when your
thighs rub together vigorously when you
walk causing a disgusting beautiful Oh
cheeping sensation in between your
thighs it's essentially the agreement
that my mom made with the universe so I
would never show off my legs and shorts
thanks mom but this summer I'm calling
it quits I'm gonna be trying out
different products every day this week
to figure out which one will finally
allow me to say no chub rub I don't know
how I feel about this it's very light on
the skin I predict that this will get
old real quick you guys I'm in love I
just can't handle how great this is
working right now Monistat changed the
game it's the first time that my thighs
had ever touched one another but they
weren't irritated they just kind of
glided together my way to work right now
how does my thighs are starting to sweat
I knock off a point of a star because
after like 2 to 3 hours if your thighs
are a little sweaty it starts to wear
down but it got me through two hours of
salsa didn't get all my clothes it
wasn't greasy or anything like that I
give this 4 point 5 stars 4.5 out of 5
killin it Monistat I'm using the for her
body glide anti chafing moisturizing
balm I can't say I'm too excited about
this cuz the other day I'm gonna put it
on it was hella sticky I'm actually
pretty excited about this oh I don't
know now
maybe it'll hopefully do the job is no
good lying
non anti chafing
it had one job my thighs have been so
irritated I just kind of been trying to
sit all day cuz when I walk I want to
die and makes my thighs feel so sticky
and awful it was so bad that I actually
had to take a break between days that I
was experimenting because my thighs
especially after cardio bar which is
just a lot of like inner thigh work I
went back to the Monistat because the
chafing hurts so bad
I can like barely walk right now I'm
just I'm over it hated it is awful I'm
done with this I never want to see it
again
don't touch me got my extra strength cuz
I got some extra thick fat I think that
this is going to be yeah I don't know
what's worse the smell or having Ashley
looking five I think I wore it for all
of like 20 minutes especially as a black
girl like my thighs just looked like
they had snorted a liter of coke I just
looked down and I was like l-like what
is my laughing it also only worked for
like all of 10 minutes to it immediately
just like my sweat just went through it
it doesn't make me as mad as the body
glide though because this isn't even its
intended purpose so I can't be too mad
at it I think I gave it point 5 of a
star
this is what I've been waiting for these
are Bendel EPS and they're these cute
sexy ass little thigh bands I have
really high hopes for these I want these
to work because they're so cute it has
this little adhesive side on it so that
it hopes to stick to your leg I think
that these were the winner of the week
they were sexy as hell they were really
good at absorbing the sweat so these
also got me through two hours of salsa
dancing I will say the one thing that
bothered me about it was there were
times where the adhesive part on the
inside of my thigh would roll up and so
then the adhesive was rubbing up against
my thigh but besides that they win on
looks they win on sweat absorption they
win on everything these are the real
winners right here guys like if you have
these in your arsenal you're doing it
