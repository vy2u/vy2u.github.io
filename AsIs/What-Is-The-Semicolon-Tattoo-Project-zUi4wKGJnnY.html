getting tattoos but also we're here
right now because the specific tattoos
we're getting are about starting a
conversation and so we're going to have
that conversation
here's Mars came to us and said we've
seen this semicolon concept going around
and why don't we like the semicolon
metaphor is an author chooses to use the
semicolon when they could have ended the
sentence but choose not to and I also
love that the whole point of getting the
tattoos is that tattoos are a great
conversation piece so it almost is like
forces you to talk about this stuff
let's get some tattoos get inked up
i'ma get song lirik this world can be
ugly but isn't it beautiful it's
basically you know saying like yeah
can get rough in your life but if you
take the time to actually open your eyes
and and not just focus on what's
terrible and see what's beautiful around
you I mean it gives you a whole new
perspective you lost your two friends
both to suicide right yeah I lost I lost
one in high school my junior year I was
actually supposed to hang out with him
the day it happened so that kind of hit
really hard and then the other one I
lost my sophomore year of college and
that kind of changed my life pretty
heavily I mean you don't realize how
many people you affect until that
happens and it really opens your eyes
and you see that you impact people you
barely even talked to after that I
traveled abroad then transferred schools
switch my major and you know left all my
friends at that place I'm still
extremely tight with all of them I
talked to like four of them yesterday
believe it or not
well I am today getting mt6 34 which is
a verse that says don't worry about
tomorrow because tomorrow will worry
about itself and although it's not
grammatically correct the colon is gonna
be a semicolon I have had like
debilitating anxiety since I can
remember it's really hard because
there's a difference between like
worrying about a test or worrying about
a boyfriend or something like that and
then when you're sitting at like 2
o'clock in the morning thinking why am I
not okay with life when everything is
perfectly fine I felt so much guilt with
feeling so sad and anxious about my life
when people have such bigger problems
than me you just feel so weak when you
can't control your thoughts and then you
like start to feel like a crazy person
I think there's times where you just I
can't continue and that is the hardest
thing I want to talk about it just so I
can help other people with it because it
is a very real thing that happens to
anybody the tattoo I'm getting is a
quote that says rise and rise again
until lambs become lions and I think
that just like really resonates with me
because all of those kind of low points
really make you who you are
I've been living with depression for as
long as I can remember really I wasn't
officially diagnosed until I was 20 but
I think a lot of that comes from not
wanting to talk about it it's easier for
me to say oh I don't I don't feel good
this morning I was sick or I got locked
out of my house or there was traffic
there was an accident instead of just
being like my depression hit me in the
face of the birth this morning and I
couldn't get out of bed
I think the semicolon speaks to me
strongly because when I was 13 I came
very very close to killing myself I was
sitting on my floor in my bedroom with a
bottle of Tylenol because I'm 13 and I
thought that that would kill me and it's
it's it's laughable now but at the same
time I was 13 and I thought that that
would work
instead I resorted to cutting myself for
the next 10 years because that was
easier than talking to people about what
I was dealing with and I shouldn't be
afraid to be honest about this very real
illness that I'm living with we did it
we did it
you know done now comes the actual hard
part I feel like and that is having the
conversation that comes yeah
the tattoo yeah but I feel like that's
gonna be rewarding so it's definitely
gonna be more rewarding than it is
difficult yes we're all in this together
yes
