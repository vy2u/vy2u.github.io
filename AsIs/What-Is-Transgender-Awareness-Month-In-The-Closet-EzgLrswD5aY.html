the closet I'm Jen that's Nikki we are a
show where we talk about fun stuff that
makes everybody happy we are in a closet
we're also which is apparently a storage
closet because look at the amount of
cleaning supplies behind Nikki's head
today on the show we're gonna be talking
about transgender Awareness Month to
talk about that I brought my friend
Mariana she's a big friend of the show
she's coming in side on into the closet
right now and welcome welcome thank you
hi everyone my name is Mariana Marroquin
and I my preferred pronoun is sheet and
hair something fun about me that I love
to go shopping at the home people
late-night fun well yeah yeah so it's
November which is transgender Awareness
Month for people that may not know do
you want to just talk a little bit about
what that is so November is transgender
Awareness Month we're talking about
transgender right here but for many
people still the word transgender is
something that they have no idea and
transgender community suffer a lot of
discrimination and a lot of hate crimes
many transgender women especially women
of color and this is the month that we
need to get together and we need to show
our humanity to other people what is
some of the work that is happening
around transgender Awareness Month Film
Festival a lot of people talking about
it in their jobs also job fairs
something important in the transgender
community you know a lot of people is so
hard to find a job Mariana you are a
very interesting woman you have a life
and a job and dreams tell us like a
little bit about yourself this is funny
that you would say that I had dreams
because there was a time in my life that
I thought I was not allowed to have
dreams I was surviving and I was trying
to figure the whole thing out now I have
a job now I can give back to community
now I can share my story I can share how
great to be me I can dye my hair purple
I can do so many things that I never
imagined and that's great
Gogi did you break that sort in half
yeah accidentally sorry how I don't know
but if there is something you could say
to young people that were scared are
still figuring stuff out any advice you
might have to offer I think it's a good
time to be trans to be honest with you
we have programs so we have shelters we
have transgender awareness moms I think
getting together you know getting to
community and hang out in the closet
with friends that's good just close the
door and be inside and create your own
space where you feel safe you can wear
everything you want be yourself and be
safe
November 20th happens to be trans Day of
Remembrance what is translated
remembrance we have that day to remember
every trans individual that was murder
because of transphobia it's difficult to
talk about it because when you go to
that day you always think my life it's
so precious but at the same time the
danger outside for trans people it's so
big so every November we get together
and we say the names of those that are
no longer here what are some things we
can do call your friends and tell that
you care about them tell them that there
is a pizza or a March or a place where
you can go and light a candle or just
spend a good time together and some
things are easier than others like
supporting art done by trans people
listening to their stories seeing their
films listening to their music yeah so
here's the part of the show where things
get a little bit silly I think what we
will do is do the closed eye challenge
which is a challenge I just made up
Mariana you will close your eyes and
then we'll try and pay Nikki oh dear
okay hey Nikki I'm gonna show you my
love okay I bet it looks beautiful oh
and then what we can do is we can cut a
hole in the mouth and then Nikki can
sticker no beautiful pink hair
blonde hair it looks horrible now you're
all add something
Nikki let me look at your face okay so
this is Nikki's nose oh no it's good
the lesson here today was art can happen
no matter who you are you can make
something beautiful
um do you what do you think Mariana is
it time for us to leave the closet we
can take this with us okay okay all
right bye it will crop this way Wow
whoops sorry God dang pain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
