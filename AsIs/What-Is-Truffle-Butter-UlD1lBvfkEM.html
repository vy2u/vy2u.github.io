butter it's like a thing you like
truffle oil like the stuff you put on
popcorn at a fancy winery well you might
not want to put it on popcorn at a fancy
winery um
the truffles are mushrooms you know that
right yeah but in this term it has
something to do with things coming out
of your butt
whoa yeah what yeah it's a sex term what
really gross oh I'm sorry I added that
to this but I thought it was fair that
you know in case you ever came across it
like gross poop it was a nice poop any
other thing but girls well there's
there's definitely grosser poops you can
have I feel like the less solid it is
the grosser inherently it becomes mmm
I'm more about equality for poops I
don't like to is it like yeah sex with
somebody in the butt and then like the
mess around it
I needless to say I was pretty grossed
out so I ran a quick fact check and sure
enough
oh god it's even worse than I thought
no this is this is a UTI situation this
is a urinary tract infection just
waiting to happen I mean you're begging
for it at this point just no no don't do
this no this is awful no but I do need
to see if the term is legitimate slang
so I met with Geoff nunberg
a notable linguist and slang enthusiast
truffle butter truffle butter I don't I
don't think you want that word to mean
anything more than what it sounds like
what do you think it's out I just it
means truffle butters I'm just gonna use
that randomly you know like you know we
want to go out to the movies night
truffle butter I don't even heizak ass
okay do you want to know what it is oh I
have an idea but it must be okay well I
have an idea that I'm a little more
interested in anal anal anal anal yeah
okay so it's you you're having anal sex
with with a woman right and then you
stop having anal sex and you start
having vaginal sex and there is a
residue around this all this area and
that is truffle butter it's another one
of these words that exists you excuse my
saying it in order to be a dirty word
right exciting like it isn't like you
needed a word for that it's like what's
what's what's something really dirty
that we can give a cool name to right
and that there was a lot of thinking
went into that
it's because Nicki Minaj and yeah well
I'm just worried that now it makes for
that with Nicki Minaj oh okay yeah
understand don't smell it I try not to
don't smell it
she made a song and that's what got
truffle butter into the dike guys for
this year I like that you use truffle
butter and Nicki Minaj same house that
means I was impressed by thank you yeah
I don't see it lasting for a long time
so what happened fresh off the boat here
brand-new this is I have a new song man
yeah what's the how's the song go I'm
actually not familiar yeah I've heard it
but I couldn't repeat the rhymes to you
so I needed to listen to the song to
understand the term but I thought it
would be best to listen to Nicki Minaj
is truffle butter while eating actual
truffle butter on popcorn so I bought
some truffle butter made some popcorn
too much actually and while melting the
truffle butter to pour on the popcorn I
actually had a bit of a discovery I do
get yet I know you I know you but I'm
just saying that I get it I was ready so
I prepared myself to take it all in
account pretty ladies like yeah trouble
but on you plus a cuddle buddy
the song was explicit I just said
truffle butter on your that's what
I said it was what they said but the
song was actually pretty enjoyable
despite all that and as the song came to
a close I was ready to declare my stance
on the term truffle butter I guess it's
fine it's funny to talk about but it's
super gross and it's definitely gonna
give a girl UTI like no doubt about it
you put poop or poop doesn't go people
get sick that's just it's just a back to
life boop boop boop boop doesn't go I
feel like people shouldn't popularize
the term because I would hate for it to
popularize the act you know
you should never want truffle butter on
push hit bring up that's what they said
trouble butter on you push it you should
never want that however nobody should
want shuffle butter on the presentation
you shouldn't even want $11 an ounce
truffle butter on your because
mushrooms don't belong there either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
