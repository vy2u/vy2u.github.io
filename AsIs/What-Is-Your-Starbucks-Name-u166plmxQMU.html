Emmett
my name is wash MA my name is fazilet my
name is Nicholas my friends call me Niko
my name is heaven like the noun from the
Bible which my parents wanted my
Starbucks name is he been fuzz meri
Hamid John Nick like many immigrants
my name is an issue when I came to
America from Ethiopia it was spelled
h-e-b N and because once you get
American papers you don't question
things it feels like what I imagined
must have felt like for people who were
ready in Ellis Island and they were
called I don't know like Simon Roma
Leske and suddenly they were Simon Smith
it's just a natural part of being sort
of immigrant with a different name in
America I had an English teacher who's
from Texas who thought it was from
Mexico and I let her call me waka for a
year I want people to be comfortable
it's like I don't want anyone to feel
like my name is a burden my whole life
I've been mispronouncing my name to
accommodate other people
I usually don't correct them I usually
let them go with Nick it just seems
easier at this point I'm pretty used to
at this point
I accept that people don't like to work
very hard I know I correct them I think
it's a form of like respect to actually
try to find out how somebody's name is
pronounced I can either correct you or
be called by a name that is not my name
and both options kind of sucked well I
think that they are probably not
ill-intentioned it's easy to become
convinced that it's not important it
should be the person who is learning the
name who should be making the effort but
you can just genuinely tell when
someone's putting in an effort and when
they're not oh I make mistakes all the
time it's not like I've never
mispronounced someone's name wrong so
I'm totally like understanding it's been
so difficult and complicated introducing
myself throughout my life I've come to
accept that like I have I'll have at
least three pronunciations that follow
me around moving around so much as a kid
it was always really hard to fit in and
my name made it a lot harder I think
when you're a kid people kind of make
fun of you like washer wash me um
and I used to get so mad um when I was a
kid when people made fun of my name a
little bit of that kind of still sticks
with me I like my name more now than
when I was a kid I sort of grown to I
grown into the name I think it took
years of people telling me I had an
interesting name I'm gonna realize that
I should be proud of it I love my name I
can't wait to just go buy heaven like
Madonna some people call me Apollo but
not really that's not like really like a
thing that's just like a thing I want to
happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
