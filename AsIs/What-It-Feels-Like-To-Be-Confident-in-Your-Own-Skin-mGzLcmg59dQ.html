somebody else there are people who want
to change things about themselves I was
like I'm not even here I want to be the
girl that I read about in these books
one day though when I kind of snapped
back into reality I had to just grow up
and say it's not going to change this is
it
it was hard so steps who I was as a
person the only standard of beauty I had
was in television in mainstream media
and I would fantasize about being
someone else I read a lot of books and I
watched a lot of cartoons but that body
type and that perception of beauty is
literally fake what it took was kind of
throwing myself out there all of the
parts of my body that I was insecure
about showing before I just started
showing off as a curvy woman I believe
that women who are more petite that is
so easy but women have it hard even if
they're the media's definition of beauty
I learned that celebrating our
differences instead of fighting about
them is the key to change and growth
being confident has changed my everyday
life in such a dramatic way I think for
a long time I had to wake up and apply
things to feel beautiful what it took
was kind of throwing myself out there I
made a choice to commit myself to Who I
am little things about myself that I
wanted to change I realized this is it
it ain't going nowhere I started wearing
leotards on stage and show all my legs
off and showing my arms all things that
I used to cover up I'm now free to show
because I realized and I'm beautiful but
that's the beauty of beauty is that it's
not just one thing it changes every day
and today I feel good when you go to
sleep thinking about how excited you are
to be you the next day it makes waking
up such an experience the more that you
make your body happy the more it will
make you happy back stay strong stay
powerful stay beautiful
