disorders for most of her life it was at
17 that her hair started falling it I
knew immediately that it was alopecia
areata alopecia areata is when your
immune system attacks your own hair
follicles whether it comes from lupus or
just on its own it causes your hair to
break and fall out I'll never forget it
was the night before Christmas Eve and
my at the time highschool boyfriend was
over he runs his hands through my hair
and a huge chunk of hair comes out and I
freaked out and tell him to go and I run
over to my mom she looks and she just
has this like really worried expression
on her face she grabs a mirror and she
shows me the back of my hair and there's
this huge bald spot I truly felt like
natural beauty and my femininity were at
stake for nine years I have been putting
my hair in styles to try and hide the
bald spots it is the wind in the back of
your head you do ankles and I get
steroid injections to try to lessen the
condition so every three weeks I come in
and a dermatologist injects cortisone
into my scalp I am a really lucky and
grateful person but losing your hair
sucks and those shots suck every three
weeks for nine years every three weeks
now I've gone to this breaking point I'm
tired of the maintenance
unpredictability I'm ready to shave my
head and I want to wear wigs and I just
want to take control and I want to move
on Becky's gonna be taking off the big
trunks you're gonna get this thing
kicked off while I'm doing this can you
remind me that this means no more
cortisone shot no more shots in the head
and the backs kind of already fallen out
and that part's already taken care of
it's gonna be like something you've
killed and brought back ah
Oh ma'am now it's like you'll fall out
if you want on curve well you've done
most of the hard work so it's basically
like clean me up just cleaning you up
making you a nice vegetable very good
pension yeah yes is this kind of fun
yeah kinda I don't feel like I can
really mess it up you can't help
yeah you know what baby I think I just
found my calling yeah yeah that's
terrifying
look how good it looks what what uh how
do I feel about it
I new experience yeah yes it's okay if I
don't rock things although yeah yeah I
love the wig on the one I like the best
so far remind to the most of a haircut I
used to have right I liked it yeah so I
feel good feel a little weird I wish I
had felt as comfortable when I was
younger sometimes when you don't know
what other people are going to read it
can be telescreen things
