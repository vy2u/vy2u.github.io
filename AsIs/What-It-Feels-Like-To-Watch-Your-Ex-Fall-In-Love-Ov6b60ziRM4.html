to give you the wrong sauce it's not the
pizza we broke up in the parking love in
Uno's pizzeria in Boston maybe in a
couple years maybe that was my
justification three months later as I
clicked through his facebook profile
late at night trying to hold on to
whatever piece of him I still had left
and that's when I saw his first photo
with her the girl with the Red Solo Cup
I knew I wasn't allowed to care but I
did they met at a party at least I can
assume it was a party from that tipsy
half smile he wore his hands were
wrapped her under waist and as I stared
at the photo I tried not to imagine how
it felt when he put his hands the same
place on me didn't really work but that
night I dreamt about him as I so often
did there was a second photo they were
having a picnic a picnic my stomach
twisted as I realized the girl with the
Red Solo Cup was destined to become a
reoccurring character in his life I
still didn't understand that he had
moved on I couldn't digest that someone
could fall in love with someone else
well I still loved them but it's funny
how easy it is to believe the
unbelievable just because it hurts less
who are you girl with the Red Solo Cup
the internet told me a lot about her she
had darker features than I did in her
smile made her seem kind she looked like
she came from money and I looked like I
was living on hand-me-downs and budgeted
grocery lists but despite our
differences there was one overarching
similarity I couldn't miss we both love
the same boy
months passed and I watched them tag
each other in photos and their
relationship status change
I saw them driving in the car we kissed
in the car we broke up and I saw their
relationship go to places ours had gone
into places it had not maybe he's
different now maybe he doesn't snort
when he laughs or fold his pizza into
its sandwich before eating it maybe I
don't know him at all but still visiting
him reminds me that I'm capable of love
and I'm worthy of love it reminds me
that when you truly care for another
person it never really goes away
I watched him fall in love and maybe
someday he'll watch me do the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
