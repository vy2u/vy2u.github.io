I think girls probably experience it
fresh out the wound can't escape it like
you're born into it I think you always
know even when you're a little that
pretty and not pretty are two things the
way that we talk to young girls as
adults always involves Lux girls spent
most of our adulthood trying to get over
the fact that when we were young all we
were told to be with pretty oh god I
think it's I think the pressure of
pretty is coming from so many different
places
it's media media affects men media
affects women I think it's a cycle a lot
of my experiences about being pretty
have to do with boys and whether or not
they thought I looked nice it can really
like mess you up at first you know you
feel like well why not like good enough
I'm gonna pee now I'm not good enough I
needed validation from a guy or a
good-looking guy to feel that way
yes I definitely think there is it'd be
nice if they were all wrapped up in the
same thing but I think beauty is all
over you something that comes from the
inside out it's a combination of Who I
am and what I bring to the table
beautiful is something that can't be
taken away from you I feel the most
beautiful when I'm using my mind and
when I'm with my friends being around
people who appreciate me for every ounce
of what I am makes me feel beautiful I
feel beautiful when I'm happy being able
to say that like at the end of the day I
still don't care what anyone thinks I am
Who I am and I love that about me
I feel you girls it's not easy everyone
even the people you think are super
pretty has felt that way before and you
will feel more pretty and more beautiful
if you focus on the things that make you
feel happy and beautiful try and find
your own interview find things that make
you like that make you feel good about
yourself surround yourself with people
who think you're beautiful who think
everything about you is actually
beautiful like the real you be a person
that you want to be and I think that
will make you happy and pretty won't
matter anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
