mentality it's not like former in
anyone's fine I feel like when you were
fat when you were younger if you thought
you were chubby you're still that kid
it's all tied back to when I was like
eight years old and chunky and that it's
a cool girl I think when you're fat when
you're young you get self-conscious at a
much earlier point than if you're thin
sometimes I I can't help but see myself
still as that fat kid like and so it was
like can I really do this am I still
could I call myself a former fat kid
it's that's one of the biggest hurdles
you know the physical part is it's easy
exercise you kind of get in shape but
that mental block is sort of the biggest
hurdle of jump I realized my brother
who's about seven years older than I am
and I were wearing the same pants eyes
when I was in middle school there was
this one time where there was a girl it
was like a year or two older than me I
had a really big crush on her and she
like put her arm around me and like
right on the love handle and like slowly
removed it as as though she had like
found out something she wished she
hadn't found out my uncle he was like
I'll give you like twenty dollars he was
like five pounds or whatever I used to
like take a pen and I would sit down and
like draw a line where like my skin fold
it over just because I was like so sure
that I was like great fatter than ever
we know
you can get bigger but then my friend
saw while we were changing I like mighty
applies you would have to go to the pool
during the summer like hang out with
your friends but you didn't actually
want anyone to see you with your shirt
off so you wear a white t-shirt which
was like the worst thing to wear while
swimming you would go the pool and
there'd be like the thing where you get
to go like and pull it away from your
skin I was with my mom and my sister and
they were like well maybe you should try
like bootleggin Jones instead of skinny
jeans and like that even that comment
just stayed with me for like years
for whatever reason it was like big
girls couldn't be fashionable and that
pissed me off I remember when I was
younger I'm feeling like I really wanted
to lose a lot of weight so that I could
be and like cute clothes I remember
distinctly shopping with my friends who
were also all kind of heavier and
thinking no one is a medium everyone is
either a smaller and extra-large I
really at one point was like nobody in
the world is a size medium growing up I
was always shopping the Husky section
once your mom asked where the husky
pants section was the person working at
the store would immediately start
calling you nicknames all of a sudden
you like we're king or you do or chief
yeah you know like I said I think that
some of the personality things come with
you you know even after you've changed
everybody's changed all that kind of
stuff
I think there's always a part of me
that's gonna be like we want that white
t-shirt at the booth just weird thing
that kids do when you find out you're a
former fat head and you like to show
each other pictures of yourself so that
everyone will go like no way oh my god
I've gotten to a place
I mean I love my body now I can tell you
that Verbeck I love it like there's
nothing that makes me happier than like
seeing myself
