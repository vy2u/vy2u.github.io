love the idea of lash extensions but
considering I do it made the idea of
lash extensions even more intriguing the
first appointment the first appointment
is pretty weird
you Amelie lay down while your eyes and
face are covered in tape then the magic
happens
itty bitty individual false lashes are
selected dab with glue and then adhered
to the real lash while Linda chats and
makes her clients comfortable she also
must be considering each client's lash
preferences / condition and facial
proportions all while the clients eyes
are closed and their faces upside down
from hers of course there are downsides
well first and foremost there are
debates on its safety so I had to clear
with my physician first
then there is time the appointment can
take more than an hour and it is a
luxury I have to say for I set aside $65
a month for it which obviously adds up
but the perks for me the lashes lasts up
to 3 to 4 weeks these lashes are like I
makeup I can shower and swim in and
sleep with no eye makeups take off at
night or put on in the morning which
practically makes my morning Jean
effortless I've had so many people tell
me that they don't like them and it's
amazing how this is how pretty they make
me feel that despite all those comments
I'm still getting them done and I still
help them this is the Becky Harris wake
up process how do I get me in it's about
me you are yeah so I'm like sleeping
right yeah
sleep and then I wake up you brush your
teeth I put my contacts in don't do
anything with it as I go scare away you
want her to follow me yeah open this up
put it on and then I'm just like good to
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
