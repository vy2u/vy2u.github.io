you know please don't mention your
father's name I don't want to hear the
f-word every single year no matter whose
house I'm at I get a call from the other
parent being like it's 11 o'clock did
you leave yet you want to bring friends
you can bring friends to ours every year
my dad wishes for the same thing time
with his girls it's not really up to me
though so I got him a watch we're about
my family why can't you be here for this
I'd choose dead moms hearts broken you
know his heart really gets broken like
if I was with my mom last year I'm like
well that's easy on me my dad this year
he has to pull into the driveway she's
like you know just make sure that he's
you know a few hundred feet down the
street sibling teamwork through the
holidays of divorced parents is pretty
key because those are your closest
allies no more if my mom's like oh would
your dad give me for Christmas
forget it was a long day ago my dad set
up a conference call this weekend with
me my brother to figure out a Christmas
schedule I texted my mom asking if we
had figured it out yet and she was like
they have it figured out your father
will get what he wants mitigating that
guilt is tough
sometimes that mean that you can get
duplicate presents but you can just sort
of quietly return one and keep the cash
for yourself the worst though is when I
get a Christmas present that's like
non-returnable and a duplicate do not
give your divorced parents the same
Christmas list while both your parents
on the eve and the morning of every
holiday will never be more popular in
your whole life
because in time you improve and you know
how to handle it you coordinate and then
you're good oh I'm just gonna get you
the guitar like is it electric or is it
acoustic my mom wanted the acoustic and
my dad wanted the electric like I have
calluses on my fingers from both</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
