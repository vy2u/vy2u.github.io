police officers interrogating him
propped him up in the pigeon torture
position in this exposed position his
chest was beaten until he vomited blood
in addition he was subjected to the
motorcycle torture and plain torture
where he was forced to assume extremely
painful stress positions involving the
prolonged extension of his arms until he
collapsed when they were not being
interrogated prisoners had to stay the
entire day in their cell in a kneeling
position with the head to the ground 60
or 70 people were kept in a Cell
designed for 14 to 17 people at night
people had to take turns lying down
while others in the cell were standing
this led to extreme exhaustion among the
prisoners
Mr Kim described how guards had the
right to beat or otherwise torture them
at any point including for trivial
matters such as snoring while sleeping
mr. kim gwangnyeol testified that the
prisoners starved as they only received
80 grams of bad quality food per meal
they fed us some things that not even
the pigs would eat like for example
rotten cucumber boiled rotten cucumber
was given to eat and if we refuse to eat
that we would be punished mr. Kim added
that prisoners became so desperate that
they hunted and ate the snakes that
lived on the prison's premises according
to mr. kim gwangnyeol there were
hundreds of deaths during his two years
and five months at ordinary prison camp
number 12 mr. Kim was himself involved
in the disposal of the bodies of over
100 prisoners the bodies were collected
in a storeroom where they were often
eaten by rodents or rot in the summer
heat when enough bodies had piled up
they'd be heaved on a large cart and
driven up into the mountains where they
were burned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
