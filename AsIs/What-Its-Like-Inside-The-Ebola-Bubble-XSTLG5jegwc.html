foreign journalists to land in Liberia
to cover the Ebola outbreak there
weren't very many of us willing to go to
the world's hottest hot zone and there
was a general global malaise about the
disease so there wasn't very much
information around about how to prepare
as the story took off colleagues called
me and asked me what they should do I
told them how I didn't use a razor for a
week before coming to Liberia because
I'm a klutz and the careless slice into
your skin is a little of Boulud or I
told them I trimmed my nails low enough
that they wouldn't puncture my latex
gloves but not so short that I exposed
the nail bed raw flesh at the tip of
your fingers would basically be an Ebola
welcome mat but the most useful thing I
told them was to break the rules in
journalism and an aid work you're not
supposed to give people things but in
Liberia in the time of Ebola I felt like
you have to I gave gloves to nurses at
clinics and small change to kids who've
been out of school for months when I
left Liberia in August I gave my rubber
boots to a midwife all this giving isn't
being generous it's being selfish
because in the middle of a bowler you
can't touch anyone
if bowler puts a physical distance
between you and the world
no words can bridge and you feel that
distance in your body you feel it like
you'd feel smacking into the end of a
fat wooden pole that's pushing you away
from the world
I'd never understood that it was
qualitatively different to say to
someone a pleasure to meet you while
you're holding on to a stranger
I've never appreciated just how much
groundwork is laid in the way I extend
my hand the strength and the length of a
handshake touch transforms everything
and without it I'd also lost a skill
Liberia is famous for its finger snap in
greeting but there's no more Liberian
handshake there's no more hand holding
there's no more arm around the shoulder
you can't comfort anyone who is sad and
you can't hug in one out of joy so you
give you give what you have because you
can't touch and because you can't cure
and you can't walk away either you give
not because you're nice but because when
people are dying all around you the
kindest thing that you can do for
yourself is a tiny ordinary kindness for
someone else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
