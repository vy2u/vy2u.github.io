may have started as just a diet you pay
attention to what you eat but more than
you should you notice how much you're
eating but a little too often you start
to monitor your exercise and pay more
and more attention to what you look like
perhaps something happened that made you
feel like you had lost security perhaps
you never felt secure in the first place
maybe an over-critical parents or sport
that demanded your body look or perform
a certain way or significant other who
made you feel like your body wasn't
beautiful the way it was maybe you just
needed something to feel good about
friends start noticing something is
different you're losing weight have you
been dieting I didn't realize how skinny
you are but to you these comments sound
like compliments because it means you're
pulling it off hunger is just a daily
obstacle and exercises your daily bread
you spend countless hours in front of
the mirror only seeing the flaws in
yourself meticulously taking account of
where you need to improve and planning
endlessly planning how you're going to
change you have never been so determined
in your life no matter how strong or
toned or thin you become it is never
enough and then the comments become
concerns you've lost too much weight I
heard noises coming from the bathroom
I'm worried are you okay are you okay to
you the only thing harder than waking up
every morning is falling asleep every
night you can't concentrate except for
on your weight the shape of your
silhouette how your clothes don't fit
the way you want them to when every day
you say I'm fine I'm just tired you've
lost sight of the things you once cared
about and go quiet withdraw you've
pushed away the people that love you by
lying to them you insist you're okay but
they know that's not true and so do you
but nothing on earth will make you admit
it because that's the whole point you're
okay
everything is under control the day
comes when you look in the mirror and
don't recognize who you're looking at
your hair is dry your eyes are eclipsed
by dark circles you thought you'd feel
better about yourself but you don't feel
better if you feel anything at all it's
worse you needed something secure that
wouldn't go away or break up with you or
dye something you could keep under
control but now it's controlling you if
you want your life back you're gonna
have to start being honest both with
yourself and with the people around you
it will be hard finding help but it's
worth it
do not spend another day listening to
the voice that tells you you're ugly or
fat or not good enough somedays all
you'll be able to do is put your head
down and hope that it goes away it
doesn't go away it doesn't get any
weaker but you can get stronger it
doesn't get any quieter but you can
choose to stop listening to look away
from the mirror even when you don't want
to because you know it's not good for
you your friends may not know how to
help but they want to see you healthy
and that alone means you're not alone
count the things you like about yourself
and be grateful for them you are
excellent at noticing what can be
improved and you know how to suffer
through hard work
do not waste those skills repurpose that
drive and determination and make
beautiful things out of it you have an
eye for aesthetics after all things will
never go back to normal you will have
bad days and occasionally take steps
backward this is to be expected it does
not mean you have failed it just gives
you more fuel with which to move forward
soon enough you feel like you're in
control again not because you can make
your body what you want it to be but
because you've accepted it for what it
is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
