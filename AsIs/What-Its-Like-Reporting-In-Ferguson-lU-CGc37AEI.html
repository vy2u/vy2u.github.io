trucks have become a common sight in
Ferguson Missouri they are constant
presence as common as traffic lights and
fast-food restaurants it's unclear when
this will change ever since Michael
Brown was fatally shot by Ferguson
Police Officer on August 9th this st.
Louis suburb of 21,000 people have been
overwhelmed by protesters police
officers federal agents and
international media nearly every night
census concluded with a violent
confrontation between police and
protesters it's resulted in tear gas
flash bombs and dozens of arrests I
arrived here last week before tensions
reached a boiling point there have been
so much promise for change on Thursday
that's when Missouri Highway Patrol
captain Ronald Johnson had been put in
charge of the police response a black
native of Ferguson Johnson had promised
to enforce the state impose car feet
without trucks and tear gas
it only took Johnson one day to break
that promise things were really spiral
out of control late Saturday that's when
police fired flash grenades rubber
bullets and tear gas canisters of
protesters three hours before curfew
without any warning at all just like
that I was caught in the middle of the
chaos it was soon after that that I
realized nothing could protect me not
even those sworn to do so but with a
little luck and a mother three from
Jersey to Illinois I was fortunate
enough to escape the bedroom the next
two days have featured some smaller
clashes between protesters and police
and it's still unclear how a wind is
wind some protesters have said they're
waiting to see a Ferguson officer Darren
Wilson will face any charges to killing
Brown others simply want the police to
end their occupation and so the national
spotlight remains here in Ferguson a
city that will remain under siege for
the foreseeable future
