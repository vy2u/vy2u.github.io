something I try to avoid as much as I
can you try to tell yourself that you
are a brave strong person and you
shouldn't be afraid of walking alone
like it sounds really simple and easy
but that's just not the case walking
down the street and you get some cat
calls or comments from men and sometimes
they follow you and they won't let you
go sometimes I'm like I could totally
take this guy right now if I need to and
like I don't know if that's a good thing
stomp on the ground with walks really
loudly walk really tall with good
posture i dial nine-one-one and like
have it ready as i'm walking i carry
around a pocket knife sometimes when I
got at night I make sure I have my
running shoes on there's one particular
time that I stood in the center of kind
of like a busy street and waited for the
bus there because I was so horrified
that can get to a point where it's like
almost debilitating were you thinking
about it constantly I'll put my keys
like in between my knuckles and just be
like Wolverine like ready to go I've
done that a few times it's just kind of
like a defense mechanism that I've
developed number time people kind of
imposing these precautions on you and
they expect you to have these
precautions my dad had me take
self-defense classes
and at first I was really opposed like
I'm not a violent person I don't enjoy
hiding or anything like that and he was
like I know but it's stuff that you need
to be learning and I hated that he was
right as you get older and you know
people who it's happened to I think it
starts to become more real and starts to
probably scary more especially because
on the news you just hear about all like
the bad things that happen and all the
violent things that happen no one's
really told me what the best way to
handle it is so I'm kind of just
figuring it out as I go along
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
