weapon I'm not gonna lie
there was a woman one time at a Bruce
Springsteen concert who was really
getting on my nerves
so did I kind of ram into her ankles
just a little bit prove it
hi I'm Santina I'm living in California
by way of New Jersey and I'm an actress
I'm a writer I'm an improviser at that
parade Citizens Brigade theater I'm not
the only girl in a wheelchair so I speak
only on behalf of me today does it feel
like people are going out of their way
to be nice to you
sometimes yeah I get that question
sometimes it does but I don't know I'm
from New Jersey so I kind of have a good
 meter does it bug you when
people ask if you need help with
anything
no it bugs me when I say no thank you
and then they keep asking me like I
can't handle it or like I didn't
understand the question or like I
couldn't possibly do it myself but of
course if you think somebody needs help
or if you just want to be a nice person
like I am NOT here to discourage anybody
from being a nice person I don't have a
disability can I use the handicap stall
in bathrooms if you go into the bathroom
and all of the stalls are taken up and
there's like a line of girls right
you're out of concert or something then
yes go ahead
use the endcap stall and then get out
but if you walk into the bathroom and
there's like plenty of stalls available
but you just like have to take a so
you're gonna use the handicap stall can
you please not do that can you please
just use the non handicap stall for
 please would you rather people
ignore the wheelchair I mean don't be
delusional about it don't be like a
weirdo don't ask me to like step right
up but also don't focus on it you know
what I mean that's what life is all
about you guys balance do you get upset
when people ask you how you got into the
wheelchair I get upset when that's the
first question people ask me because I
don't know that's kind of personal and
also my story is a little tragic so if
I'm out at a bar or I'm out just like
shopping and I'm like having a real
feel-good day don't harsh my mellow
stranger
how does it make you feel when someone
says you're an inspiration it depends
why my inspiration if they're inspired
just because I like got dressed and left
the house and I'm not home I crying over
my disability then they can save it but
if you're inspired because you've seen
my work or you've seen something I've
done or you know you've always wanted to
move to California and never thought you
could do it but then you saw that I did
it and that's like wow if she could do
it maybe I can do it then yes great
thank you happy to help what can we do
as a society to better provide for those
in wheelchairs if people in wheelchairs
had a little bit more representation on
television and not just in the very
special episode I think that would be
awesome is it particularly offensive
when people stare at you yes it is
offensive when people stare and there's
a difference by the way between like I'm
staring at you because you're in a
wheelchair I'm staring at you because I
think you look familiar
I'm staring at you because I'm checking
you out there's like a difference and I
can tell I think I don't feel as
different as people sometimes make me
feel what advice would you give young
women in wheelchairs in terms of what to
expect when they get older if you're a
young girl in a wheelchair I do want you
to know that like you can have dreams
and you can follow those dreams and you
may need to make adjustments to those
dreams but don't assume you can't do it
you just might have to do it a different
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
