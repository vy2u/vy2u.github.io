making content that makes you laugh or
think or see the world differently but I
hate that my job comes with the daily
dose of harassment YouTube comments are
very sexist YouTube comments are very
entitled they're always nasty and
disgusting it feels like being back in
grade school but you're only in grade
school with the bullies you may be
talking about one thing and then people
just start talking about your boobs
I wish men who commented on videos that
women are in or make wouldn't comment on
the women themselves but would comment
on the content content content content
of the video this is a guy named Andy
who's responding to a video I made about
comic books if you get raped you should
lay back and enjoy it again the video
was about comic books
I just fact to this girl smiley face I'm
not making pornography I'm making
science videos you remind me of my
of an ex-girlfriends well then she must
be pretty awesome Wilford wrote
to me Wow
bitch ugly ass as we're not making
these videos so that you say oh she's so
beautiful I'd like to her or she's
so ugly I hate her the comment is I want
to brutally murder that disgraceful
Asian bitch who is obviously trying to
fit in with the norm
aka Caucasians it's brilliantly apparent
and I hope her parents feel shame to
have given birth to such filth I've
never experienced the racism in real
life that I have and YouTube comments to
everyone who posts one of those comments
I just want to say hey what's going on
over there who hurt you these people and
what they say has to mean nothing to me
otherwise I'm gonna be a wreck I feel
like I have very thick skin but there's
something about reading it and seeing 20
people like it or 200 people like it
that really just kind of eats away at
your self-esteem just because I'm a
person who works on the internet doesn't
mean that I'm not a person in real life
it can hurt I used to cry all the time
whenever I would read a negative comment
and then eventually I feel like you
actually get really used to it it's so
annoying because I
shouldn't have to I shouldn't have to be
used to this but I am there needs to be
lessons on how to treat other people in
social media if you have like a sister
or mom or if like think about how it
would feel to say that to those people
don't tell us about our body
don't tell us about the way that we
found or our ethnicities we know all of
that we don't need to hear it if you're
going to write a youtube comment just to
objectify someone or to try to make them
feel uncomfortable don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
