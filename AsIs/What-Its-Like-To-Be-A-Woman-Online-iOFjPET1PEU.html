doesn't agree with instead of being like
I kindly disagree the next at reply is
like you should get raped to death
damn ginger your red stupid ugly ass
hair is making you all fiery ugly Jewish
whore hey your jokes are really weird
but your boobs are nice so I guess that
makes up for it this guy said didn't I
see you on the cover of Vogue which
you've been and then he followed up with
I love your skeletal body I want to ride
your mind this guy who had never
interacted with before writes for your
age you're looking great
hashtag am I being nice or not hashtag
sorry Erin we can be really smart I'm
really smart but it doesn't matter as
long as we look good they try to pass it
off as giving me a compliment and I
should be flattered but they're talking
about my vagina or how hot I am I have a
podcast and so like obviously it's like
kind of an intimate forum of you know
one-hour talk some intimate details come
out and I had a guy messaged me that we
were soul mates and we were meant to be
together and that he would do anything
and he doesn't play games like he knows
that I meant for him want to see my dick
dick pic please you have the look that
every man wants in a woman's eyes
surprised with a little bit of fear
should we exchange naked pics be the
change you want to see in the world
anything that you tweet is explained
back at you as if you don't know what
you're talking about you could literally
write a blog post that consists of the
following words the sky is blue and
somebody some dude would write you
booking bitch ugly Jew blood sucker
stupid dumb bitch tight hashtag hashtag
victim privilege lolz
I've been called angry a lot I think a
lot of that is not only being like a
woman who writes online but also being a
Latina woman who writes online
you have to look the other way and I
hate doing that block if they get scary
and ignore if it's just annoying at this
point I'm so used to it it still bothers
me but I just expect it it's like why
would you bring up that you had lunch I
sublet the comment sections on the
things that I wrote cuz it's always it's
always about that but this is my work
this is what I do for work and it's a
problem it makes me feel demoralized
comments like keep me going when people
hate you you know it means that you're
on to something so I'm not really ever
going to shut up
alright what says where they're like oh
shoot this off and boom Twitter Gold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
