Mexican Puerto Rican Hawaiian a little
bit of Korean 4-h Japanese 3/8 Mexican
and 1/8 Filipino I'm Filipino my
family's from the Philippines I'm just a
white guy I'm in Chicago walking the
street minding my own business and all
of a sudden there's this lady who's on
the phone trying to get ahold of her
uber driver all of a sudden she sees me
and she's like excuse me sir can you
take this call this uber driver I think
he's middle-eastern Arabic can you
handle this can you handle this and I'm
like you have to be kidding me and then
I just kind of kept on walking but yeah
everyday occurrences we had a substitute
teacher and he was reading off the roll
like you know like everyone knows the
beginning class he got to Ryan Bergara I
raised my hand and him thinking that I
was pretending to be running for guy and
he actually asked where is the real Ryan
Vergara you're not him obviously because
he almost said because you're an Asian
guy but he didn't you know and that
maybe the were the few times where I
wasn't sure if I needed to be angry or
if I was more like shocked I actually
laughed in the situation so I thought it
was really funny but like when I thought
about it later I was looking that was
kind of racist we were hanging out
getting a drink just this she and I for
the first time I think and we were kind
of getting to know each other a little
bit and she mentioned something well cuz
you're like Columbian right Jesse I
never mentioned anything about Who I am
ethnically but she assumed
Columbian which was so specific and I
asked her I'm like no I'm not Colombian
where did you get that idea and she said
I don't know because you're kind of tan
you have dark hair and you talk really
fast I just say like I'm sorry I'm just
I'm like Jewish and Irish and from the
suburbs of Long Island
but not Colombian boring dude from the
suburbs
I was trying a online dating for a while
Asian males are not very popular for the
online dating websites but the times I
did get messages they were just trying
to figure out what I was just like oh
your are you Indonesian I'm like nope
I'm Filipino like are you sure like yep
pretty sure like man totally thought
you're Indonesian end of conversation so
I didn't I didn't do a lot of online
dating didn't really work out for me
people can't really put you inside of a
boss so people can't really say like oh
you're Mexican I'm gonna sign this
stereotype to you or oh you're white I'm
gonna sign this stereotype like people
just don't really know what I am so they
don't really know what to expect of me
until I show them I like to consider
myself on ethnic chameleon if you will
so so if ladies are like I only like
like light-skinned black as my girl from
right here you know if it's like I can
only do Asian guys like well I am
parties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
