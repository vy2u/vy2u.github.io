first things I've gotten so many times
is I don't understand you I would say
that growing up as a tomboy was
definitely hard I got made fun of by
boys and girls at school you know none
of the boys liked me or thought I was
cute and girls didn't I didn't fit in
with girls I started modeling I liked
skirts and stuff so I hated that I
stopped from modeling completely from
when I was like 16 to want to say 19
kind of took a toll on me and my
self-confidence mainly because I wasn't
doing stuff that I feel like I was meant
to be doing they have to put a label on
it and I just don't I don't get it you
don't have to be a man to have short
hair and wear men's clothing after high
school when I was living in San
Francisco I met a couple cool friends
when I was in theater class they're
really awesome it was through these
friends that I started to have
confidence in myself liking myself I
love myself this photographer in LA by
the name of Tosh guitar quiz reached out
to me and she said your look is so
androgynous that's what you need to
capitalize on so she started
photographing me a bit more in an
androgynous fashion for example she was
like you know don't wear as much makeup
let's mess your hair around and certain
just embody certain masculine
characteristics and mannerisms and I
found that it was not hard for me to do
any of that it actually felt a lot more
natural than wearing tons of makeup
crazy hair product really stylized
outfits and trying to be really girly
and feminine so working with her kind of
open my eyes and showed me a whole other
side to myself that I'd never even
explored and then I noticed people
reacted really positively to that I have
found like going on dates with guys and
they're like no keep it like that but
then I've also had the opposite of a guy
like I had a wig on for a shoot where I
long brown hair and he was like
way prettier like that and I was like
ooh not seeing you again now in my
career I work with people who accept how
I look and what I present and I think
they like it and they want to show it
and I think it's great to be around
supportive people that aren't trying to
put me in another box instead of feeling
self-conscious about things that I used
to like not having a typical woman's
body now I'm like capitalizing on the
things that I used to be self-conscious
about I did like a suit like last week
and we're shooting in a 7/11 like the
the parking area and this lady was like
she got inspired by us who's like I want
my daughter to be just like you really
cool now I can embrace who I am and I
don't have to change anything and alter
anything about myself and that feels
good I love dead I'm androgynous in my
look and my dress maybe even in my
behavior because I don't feel that I
have to be limited to just one thing all
the time and if I can show that to other
people and they can be more comfortable
with themselves I think that's
ultimately the greatest thing
