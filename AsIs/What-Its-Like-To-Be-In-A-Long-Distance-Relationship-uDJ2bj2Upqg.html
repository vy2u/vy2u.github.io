distance relationship.
- For two and a half years
it was long distance.
- The first was two years
and I am in one now.
- We've dated for two years.
Then we dated a year long distance.
Then we lived together for a year
and then we did
six months or so long distance
before it ended.
- We were long distance for a year.
What It's Like To Be In A
Long Distance Relationship
- The hardest part is feeling
that nobody else thinks
that what you're doing is sustainable.
- You don't have to
plan your day around it,
but you definitely have
to make extra effort.
- So there'd be a lot of issues
as far as communication
where I'm not willing to
Skype for three hours.
- We still call each other
- Sometimes.
- like every three days, I'd say.
- You run out of things
to say on the phone.
&amp;quot;How was your day?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It was fine.&amp;quot;
Like, &amp;quot;Did anything happen?&amp;quot;
It's like, &amp;quot;No, not really,&amp;quot; like,
&amp;quot;It was just like a normal day.&amp;quot;
And so then there's silence.
- What was special about my day
and how did it change me
and how can I share that
with the other person?
- Even if you're just sitting in the car
driving someplace in silence,
you're together and you feel that.
And you don't have that
when you're in a long
distance relationship
and you're trying to
artificially recreate it
but silence over the phone is,
I mean, it's nothing, right?
Silence in person means something.
- You fall in love and
it's hard and it's like,
will I connect with
someone like this again?
And is it worth it?
- When you really like someone
or even love someone,
it makes it worth it.
- You're constantly asking yourself,
&amp;quot;Is it worth it?&amp;quot;
And I feel like I learn something new
every time I ask myself that question.
- I mean, it wasn't worth it, right?
Cause we broke up. So.
- But, we were never like,
- But.
- this is ending our relationship.
- Yeah.
- It was just, this sucks,
that this is our relationship right now.
- Really when it comes down to it
any your relationship ends,
when either one person
stops caring about the other
or both people give up.
- I think the key to doing
a long distance relationship
is having an end in sight.
- Like a date, she would move in,
- Mmhmm.
- we would move in together
in July, so, we knew that.
- And then we did.
- We did.
- Woooo.
- You really learn about communication
and how to stay open with someone.
- It made us also, like,
not dwell as much on, like,
little arguments anymore,
unless you forget to bring
your girlfriend potatoes
(laughing)
from the German restaurant.
She will drill it home for an hour at you.
This happened last night.
- Waiting, you know, several days
before you can even talk
or Skype with the other person.
Or waiting months before
you can hug them again.
It's hard (giggling).
- It makes you appreciate loving someone
when you can see them everyday.
- Aaaww.
- Mmhmm.
- So sweet. (lips smacking)
- [Man] I had some--
- [Woman] I texted him twice
to ask for these potatoes
- No you texted me once.
- after work.
- about the potatoes.
- They're good potatoes.
- They're so good.
But I wouldn't know
because I didn't have them yesterday.
- Yep.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
