pigeon I'm Alice
I'm Emily I'm cypher and we are into
sexy intersex describes a person who
doesn't fit the typical definition of
male or female I have X Y chromosomes
but typical female genitalia
I'm a girl who has testes and XY
chromosomes identify as a queer gender
nonconforming intersex person I identify
as a black intersex man intersex is not
new it's been around since the beginning
of human existence I mean there's
probably even intersex dinosaurs if you
think about it transgender has to deal
with your gender identity whereas
intersex has to deal with your
biological characteristics often
intersex people get surgeries that they
don't want and transgender people had to
fight for surgeries that they do want
they gave my mom the excuse that the
internal testes were cancerous that I
would develop cancer didn't even come up
with an excuse basically in terms of a
health-related reason they instead just
said it was about the appearance a lot
of doctors are very uncomfortable with
the idea that I have testes and they're
still trying to get them removed but I'm
perfectly healthy and there's nothing
wrong with them
they did a surgery to remove my testes
and told my parents to take me home and
just raise me as a girl and I didn't
find out about it myself
until I was 12 there aren't a lot of
options or medical providers don't
explore other options my mom would put
me in dresses and she would be like Oh
aren't you so cute and you're so pretty
and I'll be like desirable I was put on
hormonal treatment which consisted of
estrogen and progesterone
I just wanted to belong I wanted to fit
in I didn't want to be different so even
though I knew something fell amiss I
conformed
he was very condescending
he was like you intersex activists don't
know what you're talking about it's
difficult for intersex people to find
each other because from an early age
were told not to talk about our bodies I
didn't feel like I was the only one my
doctors always told me there is nobody
else like me and so it just perpetuates
a vicious cycle of shame and stigma that
we can't break out of
I would tell another intersex person
that you are worthy you are lovable your
body is beautiful you're beautiful
intersex people don't need to be fixed
there's nothing wrong with them I know
you feel like you might not be able to
get through this I know you might have
really dark thoughts but I want you to
know that meeting other intersex people
and finding a community or a support
group can be one of the most important
aspects in your healing process and
we're out there we're out here we're
here I just hope you can find us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
