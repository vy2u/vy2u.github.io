the bra straps while she measures me
with tape from the front hi I'm Kristin
like most humans with boobs
I often struggle to find bras that will
adequately support my girls plus it
seems like you can't swing at it without
reading about how you're probably
wearing the wrong size bra so I went on
a mission to find out my real bra size
these were the rules number one I would
ask to get my bra size and I would try
on any bras that were offered to me
number two I would not offer any size
suggestions I definitely broke this rule
and number three if I liked a bra I
would buy it first I went to intimacy a
high-end boutique once recommended by
Oprah I walked in with some pretty high
expectations the fitter measures me with
no tape purely by sight it asks me if
anything has changed since I bought the
bra that I'm currently wearing which it
has for starters Obama is president now
she tells me my size in a 38d but when I
try one on in that size it feels a
little tight the fitter tells me that
that will make the bra last longer
since my current bra is so old I think
it might have lapsed into the public
domain that's a pretty good selling
point for me so I buy it my next stop is
Bloomingdale's where I get measured with
tape from the front over my bra to my
surprise the fitter tells me that my
size is either a 38 or 40 Triple D which
turns out to be way too big but then she
gives me a 38 double D which turns out
to be way more comfortable than the bra
I've already bought from intimacy I know
to quit when I'm ahead so I buy the 38
double D I then prepare to go to the
next store on my list the Thunderdome of
bras Victoria's Secret the fitter their
measures new tape measure from the front
over my clothes and bra it tells me that
my size is a 38 C this is where I
accidentally break one of my rules I
think I made a confused face because the
fitter then asks me what my current bra
size is which was a Victoria's Secret
bra in a 38 double D she
changes her mind and says that I should
be a 38d this is the second time today
someone has made a decision about my bra
size based on the disgusting bra
I am currently wearing the 38 D bra
makes me feel like I'm being strangled
which makes a lot of sense because the
fitting room looks like a sexy jail the
fit tells me that this bra will stretch
out but I want a broader fit because
it's the right size
not because I slowly broke its spirit
morale is pretty low by the time I hit
Nordstrom I am beginning to think that
I'm not going to figure out what my bra
size is today which i thought was
impossible this morning the fitter
measures me over my clothes and bra with
tape but from the back she tells me that
my size is either a 40 or 42 double D
and the 40 double D feels amazing the
difference between a bra that mostly
fits and a bra that really fits is huge
I'm no boob scientist but the fitter at
Nordstrom totally crushed it my last
stop was Lane Bryant the fitter there
asked me what size I'm wearing and then
asked me to lift my boobs by the bra
straps while she fits me with tape from
the front she tells me my size the 38
double D but that size makes me look
like a marshmallow monster I also tried
on a 40 double D push-up bra since 40
double D was my magic size at Nordstrom
but it was too small to I'm figuring out
that bras are a lot like jeans just
because two of them are the same size
does it mean that they're going to fit
the same way all in all it seemed like
everyone had a hard time coming to a
clear consensus about my bra size after
a day of trying on bras this is what I
learned number one just because you're
one size in one place does not mean
you're that size everywhere number two
be honest with the person who is fitting
you and if they ignore your concerns go
somewhere else
number three never buy anything you
don't love at the end of the day it was
my fault for buying bras that I didn't
feel comfortable in just because I let
myself be convinced that I was wrong and
finally number four a good fit is what
feels good to you if you feel comfy
supported and look good in clothes then
you're wearing the right bra size and
everyone else can shut their mouths case
