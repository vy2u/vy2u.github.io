renting it for about $800 got sold for
about 1.3 million or something like that
oh my name is Kai
I'm a 20 year old native from the
Mission District this is where we are
right now Mission District San Francisco
California Bay Area United States the
mission for me I mean the mission is
home for me
cultural center center of my influences
you know a lot of places in the country
to I travel and in the world are very
segregated not only race wise but also
class wise and I feel like that's
something that's very special about this
city is this melting pot of everything
though the wealth is is directly related
to people's displacement from their
homes and that's what happened to me and
my family um my family was a big deal
twice won since 2005 from the Mission
District and what's it to us a from the
risk of industry
that's your kitchen living room it's
funny this bar it's like a really
hipster bar now I guess you should be
like a motorcycle bar and I remember
like going to bed and to like basically
the sound of engines so I'm not really
affected by noise too much that was my
my bedroom window this corner is
completely different though this used to
be a Latino bakery
call me Rancho or everyone in
neighborhood used to come and and now
it's luxury condos as well and a luxury
salon which is is the way it is I guess
I just remember like being in my house
and having to stay in my room while
people are like going through the house
and opening closets and opening like
doors and checking the house out having
to be unseen being told by my mother
that I'm not supposed to be here right
now xx and mission
not a lot has changed this is like this
is it's beautiful because a lot of it
hasn't changed
I feel like looking around like so
there's certain moments when I walk
around I'm just like this is this money
I have no idea what that is no idea the
things
so we're about to turn on the Clare and
Ally um I'm on the crazy streets
probably in the world laughing I
remembered that is a kid I used to have
nightmares about that was like the
scariest piece of me as a kid I don't
know why there's something about that
bit Jim my family used to live on the
street before I was born down the street
but I've only got torn down it's just
kind of the ideal world in my opinion
but I would love to see more streets
like this oh this is a Mission District
or right here I never seen that before
been seen a lot of changes around here
especially with less you see and I feel
like this is just like the perfect
representation of change like you got
you got do Dilys mark those street art
and then when you're looking up you got
luxury restaurant and right above it
brand-new luxury condos
we're ganna turn from Valencia Street
awesome mission playground between 90 to
20 years
astroturf section that was established
by Citi field's and my Parks and Rec and
stuff used to be complete cement and
locals were always playing on it before
then I feel like not until it got nice
dude like people start did the permits
start coming yo you don't understand you
don't understand it's not on the field
it doesn't matter this field has never
been booked but you don't understand so
you had never seen what else even the
neighborhood robos how long have you
been in tears shed who over here oh my
god the argument was basically between
like neighborhood kids and tech workers
coming in with an idea that they had a
right to play and kick us off the field
I think a lot of Americans right now can
relate to the issues of space and who
space is it and the fight over who
belongs here instead of deciding to play
with us they decided to take this half
the field and the rest of us played over
there so there is still like this
segregation of people um people that
feel that they are part of the community
without showing at their particular the
community I think if those tech workers
that people take through nose out of the
phone quite literally
and look into the real world we would
have been playing together I don't know
where I would be if I didn't have this
places to go after school and
I don't want to think about we're out
reading I know that these kids need this
place you know I know it this community
needs places like this if you know
something's wrong
you can't just accept it for what it is
and if you know that yes there's a law
in place that shouldn't be in place
change it people forget the community is
only relevant because of people so when
you're displacing all the people in the
community it's like what is that culture
go where does that community go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
