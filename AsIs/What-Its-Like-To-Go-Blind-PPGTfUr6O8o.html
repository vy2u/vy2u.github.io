and I'm going blind I was born with a
genetic mutation to my abc a four gene
which caused Conrad dystrophy which is a
form of macular degeneration we didn't
know initially we found out when I was
in kindergarten and they make you do the
vision test where you have to say if the
red dot is inside or outside of the box
and I didn't know that there was a box
even they eventually brought me to dr.
Fishman who's one of the leading
ophthalmologists and he was able to
diagnose koenraad dystrophy so what I
see is the central vision is a sort of a
blurred mishmash of colors that is
indistinguishable and then around that
the rest of it's pretty bad too and each
individual eye
they're both of a different depth of
vision so one is 2,400 and the other is
2,800 so if you can imagine like having
one eye in a magnifying glass and one
eye not in a magnifying glass and trying
to walk around like that
they're constantly fighting for focus a
part of the issue with my eyes is that
they're extra light-sensitive so if you
can imagine going outside and everything
is super bright not being able to see
well it affects so many other parts of
your life you don't even think about
assume you're standing at a crosswalk
and depending on the lighting and if
there's trees blocking stuff you can't
see what color the different
streetlights are if there's no cars
you're just looking at the person next
to you in thinking is this person going
to risk their life to cross the street
do they have a death wish I think my
natural enemy is the fire hydrant
especially here in Los Angeles where
they make them yellow for some stupid
reason sometimes it's hard to tell the
difference between the lotion and the
conditioner at a hotel the most common
thing I get nowadays is are people
asking me if I'm smelling my phone so
I've got the text size as large as it
can go
so for me to read it I have to do
something like this I've learned to like
look at people when I'm talking to them
but the tough part is then I can't see
their face so I don't know if they're
happy at what I'm saying if they're
really upset at what I'm saying I have
to guess based on their intonation or I
have to find some excuse to like look at
a poster over there so I can get them
into my periphery and get a better sense
of what's going on I think it's also
given me a weird perspective you know I
know there's lots of things I can't do
so I can just let them go there's lots
of things in everyone's life that are
negative or that prevent them from doing
something they might want to do and some
of those things you can fix with hard
work and and by having other people help
you and some of those things you can in
the end you know I don't know I wouldn't
have the friends that I have I wouldn't
have the same relationship with my
family I guess I'd rather have me the
way that I am than have great eyesight
and the chance of not having all of
these things I have right now that I
love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
