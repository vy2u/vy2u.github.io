always knew that one day I would be a
mom growing up my thoughts were that you
meet someone you get married and you
eventually have children it kind of
seemed like something that I would
eventually do because it's what most
people eventually do I wanted kids
really badly when I was growing up
whenever I would get in trouble I would
write it down in my diary like see kids
even your mom was like this one day
in 2012 I was diagnosed with
endometriosis which is basically like
one of the leading causes of infertility
and women have hypothyroidism I have
Hashimoto's and a half PCOS as well so
all combined or just really really high
risk factors the definitive reason was
unexplained times when I would talk
about it people would either a change
the subject or just be kind of like
awkwardly talk to me about it because
they felt like it was something that I
was really upset about and they didn't
want to upset me further I kind of
didn't tell anybody for many many many
years because it's not something that
you tell people oh by the way I have
issues I shared it so publicly via an
anonymous blog when I got married within
a year I had I got pregnant I was like
yay God is you know sending me this
child so I'm supposed to be a mom and
this is a sign and within three months I
started having problems and I started
bleeding and eventually I had a
miscarriage at home there were a few
times where I thought I was pregnant and
then I wasn't
it started to feel like I was cursed
it was never my choice you know whether
or not I would be able to have children
easily I was seeing the face of the
unborn child that I would never have
whether or not you want to have children
receiving that piece of news is really
hard and can change your life I feel
like I'm missing out on this club I
wanted to be a part of that Club and I
still couldn't get in
I felt really lost and I felt like I
couldn't offer what I needed to offer in
order to be like someone that someone
wanted to be with for the long term it
sucks sometimes I don't know I was to
describe it except that it just stinks I
can possibly do the hormones and do
everything but with my health issues I
don't know that that is the best or the
smartest thing to do for either myself
or any child did I bring into this world
it just felt like my life was at the
whim of this thing that didn't even
exist we made the conscious choice of
not pursuing any more pregnancies you
don't have to give birth to someone to
be their mother and I think that was the
turning point for me so I said let's
just take this time to just be present
with what's actually happening and it
was the best time for me think about
like all the motherly characters in your
life or the influences not all of them
gave birth to you we may in the future
adopt a child or even foster for a child
now I'm 38 and I don't want kids which
is such a weird thing to say out loud
especially considering who I was I'm
going to talk about it because it's my
life and it's something that I went
through and I want everyone to be able
to talk about it and not feel ashamed
that
something happened to them that they
cannot control there's more ways to
leave a legacy than a biological child
walking around this earth we have so
much more going for us than just
producing children and I just wish that
everyone could see it the way that I see
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
