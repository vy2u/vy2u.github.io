fond of the earth the body the LA River
fifteen years
like 15 years
hey wake up in the morning I realize I'm
starving to death
I don't never see your head and I'll hit
the long brown and try and make enough
to feed me in my kidney back there
carved it out myself with a hacksaw I
got a little tin set up back there I
find this sheet along the way and then
just fruit spray-painted so it looks
clean and new again I'll paint him up
and
it's all leg stuff fish down the river
and I usually come home with a shopping
cart full of flowers that'll snake from
the businesses up above and plant them
up and down within I get up on ink is
about quitting time the hummingbirds
will be around the squirrels and come
down directions
I try and stay out of sight
I just was washing blankets I'm taking
them in right now I try and stay out of
sight the cops know I'm here and they're
they're really nice to not arrest me
because they know what I'm doing I'm not
I'm the only one that lives on this on
this wing there's a couple of treasures
way way down by the horse trails but
they keeping away from down here
especially because I go from tree to
tree to tree so I'll move my camp
whenever I'm done with that tree then
open up the next
I've done it for 15 years I've gone all
the way to the ends and all the way back
again all the way to the end and all the
way back you too so I'll go up and down
the river and pull the trash out and
break it so it's nice and put domestic
flowers and try and grow fruit I've got
some raspberry trees this year I mean
I'm from Fairbanks Alaska I've been all
over the US I used to check a lot when I
was a kid like thing is her
make cigar whatever but it's really the
only place left that's worthless
todd has to come back one day and the
Bible talks a lot about the river of
life I'm hoping that he'll take mine
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
