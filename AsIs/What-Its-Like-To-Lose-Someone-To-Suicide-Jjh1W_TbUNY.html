about it I'm not ashamed that my
daughter chose that way to not be here
I'm grief-stricken that she's not with
me
I'd left my phone in my room and I had
45 missed calls and I felt powerless was
so shocking and so unbelievable but also
before I had even taken the call my
phone lit up and I knew what the call
was about
I woke up the next morning to two
policemen banging on my bedroom window
so I let them inside and they sat me
down and they told me that my sister had
been found I wanted to double-check
everything that every the right name
came up the police sergeant started
talking to me and as soon as he started
talking to me it was just like my heart
had ripped in - it wasn't until quite a
bit of time afterwards that the dust
began to settle and you kind of realize
what's happened physical feeling of
going not know that's my daughter my
daughter is gone I got to a point on
Jared's birthday where I was worried
about myself I felt like going to join
her all the the first the first birthday
the first New Year's my first Christmas
it all just hits you when you least
expect it
my heart's never felt the same it was a
physical feeling of having a part of me
taken away
I developed a agoraphobia out of a
severe anxiety and general anxiety
disorder
I developed a depression worse than I
ever have in my entire life comes and
goes in waves of feeling from sadness to
yeah just just of course missing her if
you can just imagine one night where
you've stayed up crying or crying
yourself to sleep over someone that's
broken your heart every single time
that's happened all at once and the
feelings never really gone away it broke
my heart
I think the biggest thing that I have
taken from this experience is the sort
of fragility of life particularly when
it comes to mental health and not having
services around you that mental health
is not a weakness people to this day are
still sweeping us under the rug
people are still not talking about it
people are still pretending it's not
happening there's nothing wrong about
that's speaking out there's nothing
wrong with having a cry there's nothing
wrong with having a hug and it's not
weak to speak so I think dialogue is the
key I think conversation is the key I
think asking your friends if they're
okay and then listening is the key it's
really made me realize how important it
is to reach out to any loved ones to
talk about things more express feelings
and and just be there for each other
my entire baseline of who I am has
changed she was my only sibling so she
was my best friend for 20 odd years I
feel like I'm not the same person as I
was and I think a lot of people expect
you to kind of bounce back to become the
same person but I'm never going to be
them again my whole experience of life
has changed I don't think it's ever
going to be normal for me and if this
reaches just one person who was just
like me I just want them to know that
they're they're not alone you're not
thinking about what you leave behind but
the aftermath just goes on forever look
after yourselves and after each other
and life's really short just enjoy it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
