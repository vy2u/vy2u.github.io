mostly checked in and I hope I'm not
shaking the camera too much but I am
freaking out I get up four or five days
a week to run before work or on the
weekends because I found that it's a
little bit of dictum it's something of
an addiction probably I found that if I
don't run in the morning that my day is
it's very hard from the focus all I'm
thinking about is you know when I'm
gonna be done driving around running
errands when I'm gonna get X done so I
got it wrong I used the longer races as
a incentive it would be hard to justify
to myself to my wife to my parents all
the weekends all the time every morning
all the lost sleep and all the lost
social life if I wasn't able to say I
have to do this because I am running
hundred thirty-five miles hey even if we
pretend that my body was used to running
25 or six hours with longest race I'd
done before that those last nine hours
were totally in territory
it's a 7:15 I've been running for 11 and
a quarter hours now somewhere around 54
miles into the race I'm actually doing
okay I know I still have like 80 miles
to go but I'm still kind of in to make
it it's gonna be okay
when the Sun went down I knew that
everything about the race would feel
different and it is true that some of
the lowest points were those points
where I was alone out there by myself
there was a time in the middle of the
night where there was no for a couple
hours and there was nobody around so I
was very much alone it wasn't scary it
was eerie and quiet and seemed time
seemed to go much more slowly I find
that these long races are much more in
general much more challenging
psychologically than physically it's
very easy to stop running
I knew that once the Sun came up I would
feel differently I wasn't sure if I
would be really tired or if I would be
rejuvenated but I knew that once the Sun
came up I would feel differently almost
twenty nine hours into the race I'm
suffering I'm in a better state mentally
than I was many hours ago but my feet
are really bad blisters I think on my
heels my toes and on the balls of my
feet so that's fine
the benefits are running decrease after
a certain amount of time how long it
takes recover something like this
physically shows that this is really
breaking down the body to a point that
probably is beyond what's healthy I'm
more cardiovascular really fit than most
people in the world but
I would imagine if the health benefits
cap out somewhere much below what I what
I've been doing I do it cuz I love it I
love being out in the mountains to Train
there's a social aspect to it I have a
great group of friends that I run with I
have a lot of fun doing this but I don't
necessarily think that it's good for you
it might just be that that's my that
that's what I do with my time because I
don't do much else with my time
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
