definitely not trying to make a
statement by not wearing it the reason I
usually don't wear makeup is mostly
because I feel like I'm not very good at
doing it so I would rather sleep for an
extra thirty minutes then put makeup on
here's what I learned wearing makeup for
a week on the first day it felt like I
was wearing a mask I quickly realized
that when people would ask about my
change in appearance I'd immediately
feel this need to tell them I'm actually
doing an experiment for work and that's
why I'm wearing makeup oh cool
why couldn't I just thank them for the
compliment one thing that surprised me
was that girls that saw me notice that
it was my makeup that was different
maybe are you wearing makeup today I am
but all the guys that saw me like they
knew something was different they just
couldn't figure out what was different
about me my male boss even asked me you
just wanted your hair no it's exactly
the same by day three I finally had the
courage to post my first selfie I also
learned that I touch my face a lot
because I was smearing makeup all over
the place
on day five my boyfriend told me that
whenever you put on makeup you turned
into a bossy little sassy girl I think
he was actually picking up on my
heightened confidence
I'm really so much sure how I feel about
this as someone that identifies as an on
makeup where it feels a little bit
defeating to admit that wearing makeup
might actually make me more confident
maybe it's not the makeup but it's the
extra time that I'm spending on myself
that makes me feel good on day seven I
had an epiphany I realized that not
wearing makeup can be just as much of a
mask as wearing makeup in the same way
that women who usually wear makeup feel
insecure when they're not wearing makeup
I think that women who usually don't
wear makeup like myself can feel like
they're drawing attention to their
insecurities so I'll probably never be
the type of girl that wears makeup on a
daily basis I did come out of this week
feeling like makeup can be a fun way
that you can express yourself but I
still feel like my makeup free face is
pretty darn cute even though that's
normally something I would never say out
loud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
