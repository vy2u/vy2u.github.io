about people who wear makeup that
they're insecure or self-conscious or
vain but that hasn't been my experience
at makeup if anything makeup gives me
confidence I've worn makeup pretty much
every day of my life since I was 12
years old which is why I wanted to see
what it would be like to go without
makeup for a week after 17 years of
wearing makeup every day in my life I
just wanted to know if my confidence
would stay the same without it here's
what I learned
I'm makeup free today and I scared in
this day one first off I learned just
how uncomfortable I am with my bare face
I can't tell you how many selfies I took
until I landed on that one too close to
Instagram I was filled with relief when
people responded and said I looked good
without makeup but I didn't actually
believe them on day three I got a pimple
and when I get a pimple I cover that
 up with foundation and concealer
but when you don't wear makeup you just
stare at said pimple and whimper and try
to hide it with your hair I'm sick today
and I have a pimple and I'm still not
wearing makeup and I really miss makeup
that's also the day when someone said
the worst thing in the world to me
you look tired don't ever say that to
someone that is so mean
I really hate having to say that it took
a compliment for my boyfriend to make me
feel okay about myself maybe you
shouldn't wear makeup every day
it made me feel better than I had that
entire week on day six I really started
to appreciate my freckles without all
that makeup they really took center
stage and I got to see them as a unique
part of me instead of hating them by day
seven I actually in fact realized that
my makeup may be totally subjective
makeup is something that I really do
like wearing it makes me feel powerful
but in the end it doesn't actually have
much effect on the other people around
me the way I always thought it had it's
really about how you present yourself
that will change the way people treat
you and not about what you put on your
face not wearing makeup takes a lot of
courage and I'm so much more comfortable
not wearing it
