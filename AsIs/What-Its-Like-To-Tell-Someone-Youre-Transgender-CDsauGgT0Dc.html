dormant on power-save wondering what is
my source code telling no one my secret
I want to enable transparency I want to
be real with you disclose all of Who I
am but I'm afraid of what you'll do I've
heard it all before I think you're cool
it's just not for me
I just don't see myself in a
relationship with someone like you I
really want to have kids like the
natural way my family would never
approve I want to expose my hardware and
be taken at face value but loves for all
my sparks and my flares but I also don't
want to spill the tea this is important
I know and right now it's going good you
buy me a drink
we talk for hours is this the moment I
tell you I'm no stranger to
disengagement I've avoided disclosure
before because I used to feel inadequate
wired to be insecure but I've woken up
from power safe I've surrendered to
detection to initiate connection because
this is who I am I'm not afraid anymore
my existence enforced friends and
mentors and dates before who said well
I'm still here and it doesn't change
anything
there's nothing to be afraid of you are
stronger than I thought I have found and
been found by people who loved me by
people who are like me discovering a
world where I can be me do you live in
this world too so here is my story how I
break the binary code shattering your
ice and
destroy the option of stealth mode
because I want to enable transparency I
want to feel the electricity so the ball
is in your court how the rest of the
night goes to enforce the typical world
view or be transparent menu
