or it could be my calling hi my name is
Kristin and I am going to be trying
burlesque as a plus-size woman I am
scared I have no idea what to expect
all the people I've ever seen do
burlesque are very thin and very
athletic I've never seen a plus-size
woman do burlesque before so I thought I
should do it just to see you know how
scary could be because I like doing
things that scare me hi my name is
Natasha V I am one of the owners of hels
belles burlesque I have been a burlesque
dancer professionally for about 10 years
burlesque a the very simple definition
of it is it's the art of the tease and
it's a wonderful platform to be just
hyper creative you know I'm not super
comfortable being sexy in front of an
audience I think it requires a lot of
vulnerability I think it's like much
easier to just be funny or smart but
being sexy means like being proud of
your body and like being okay with
showing it to people
I think burlesque is super accepting and
very open to people doing it for the
first time it's an environment where
women feel accepted they feel healthy
they feel beautiful they walk out of the
studio more confident than when they
walked in so what I'd love to know is
you know what was your vision for this
youth has there things that you really
like types of music that you're
interested in I'm really into vintage
stuff okay I love the cool aesthetic I
love the music okay maybe like kind of a
Christmasy like a baking kind of thing
almost like at like a dirty housewife
with like an apron and you're like
baking in your kitchen and then all of a
sudden it's like oh it's it's getting a
little sexier and something but almost
kind of cutesy yeah that appeals to me
coming out of lesson two I was feeling
really confident and then I did less
than three today and it was like a
little bit more of a dumpster fire it
was like a delicate dumpster fire
there removes that I was nailing at my
second lesson that at my third lesson I
was just like you're on the ground but
I'm up in the air and I can't see cuz my
glasses flew off thirty seconds ago when
you're dancing you have to watch
yourself in the mirror so that you know
you're doing correctly and so having to
constantly watch myself do something
incorrectly it's sort of slowly wearing
down on me I am now aware of what all my
bad angles are okay so Kristin this is
our last rehearsal together do it what
are you feeling right now huh you know
I'm nervous I think that there's not a
lot to hide behind on a stage and the
idea of making it even easier for people
to look at me and judge me is like I
think hard I think you're gonna be
awesome I think I will do it if you're
sparkly you're cute as hell and you've
got an awesome routine I think you're
gonna great all right okay so I'm here
at the glove but I'm about to go on we
have an editor from BuzzFeed that came
and train with hels belles for last 30
days
and tonight she is making her her last
debut you know before the show I was
really worried like what if somebody
like says something really nasty to me
while I'm on stage like this is kind of
a drunk and belligerent group ladies and
gentlemen please welcome to the stage
miss cherry on top
I think I did really well we accept big
boobs and big butts and wide hips but we
don't really accept big tummies I think
having a big tummy is just one extra
profit you get to jiggle and I think
this was really a great way to see that
like no one cares I would a hundred
percent duper last weekend it was like
the most supportive group of people I've
ever been in everyone was cheering it
was super creative it was really fun it
was great exercise I honestly just want
to do this for fun one of the great
things about burlesque is that it's so
complicated but it actually takes your
mind off of your body and on to your
dancing and through that you can make
yourself feel better about your body by
the amazing dancing you can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
