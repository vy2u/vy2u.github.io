to Cuba especially if you're American is
how are you gonna get into Cuba you
might sneak in through Mexico or if
you're like me ostensibly a journalist
you could fly in our weird charter
flight to Rio you might wonder who these
other people on the plane how are they
allowed the first things you'll notice
when you get there are pretty much all
the things that you'd expected to see
old cars communist public art
dilapidated architecture music
everywhere tourist smoking cigars
that's me smoking a cigar you'll ask how
these cars stay on the road and you
wonder how you could survive in a
country where almost everything is old
and on the verge of breaking you might
stay at an old hotel by the port that is
supposedly pretty nice but when you get
there you'll ask yourself is this hotel
nice because it has great old
architecture or is it not nice because
it's all rundown the shower doesn't work
apparently the hotel like almost every
other places will go is owned by the
government you'll ask yourself if your
government could run a better hotel you
might meet up with some cuban artists
you'll ride with them in a weird
communal taxi that only goes a couple
places then you'll go to a party that
doesn't feel like a socialist party to
close down failing country
it just feels like a party you'll ask
your new friends if they liked socialism
and be surprised when the answer is yes
they got to go to college for free and
they feel encouraged to the artists and
you'll ask again
wait this is all free you'll ask how all
that works but the answer won't make it
any more clear you might go to a famous
restaurant that anyway used to drink at
and wonder if does this belong to the
government too you'll wonder what Cuban
restaurants would be like if they had
access to all the supplies that you do
and then you might go to a restaurant
that's actually a private business one
of the new places that have been allowed
to open since Raoul sack over if you
look in at the tiny kitchen you'll
wonder how they even run a restaurant
out of this place it seems like there's
always something missing for the menu
because they just don't have very much
of anything what will it be like when
the US government lets us citizens come
here and Cuban government allows more
private resources someday willis elodie
condos and finally you ask what's gonna
happen to cuba and that's the question
no one seems to know the answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
