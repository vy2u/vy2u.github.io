grandfather
so I witnessed a death back in I think
it was 1996 and I was 10 years old I
witnessed my grandfather's death when I
was 15 my best friend was involved in a
car accident after we got off work in
the car that she was in had hit a tree
at the scene of the accident I remember
from from I don't know some health class
or something someone telling me that
when someone is critically injured that
you shouldn't move them my mom and my
aunt and my uncle were all kind of in a
fight before they all found out this was
going to happen we came across a huge
pile of old telephone poles and me and
my friend climbed to the top while her
little brother waited at the bottom we
were at the highest point of this pile
and one of the logs came out from
underneath our feet and rolled over her
brother and crushed him
I didn't really know what was happening
I didn't know how bad it was up until
about 90 my grandpa was extremely active
the week before his death he went first
women on the way back he took a fall it
led to some bleeding in his brain so
from there he started to experience
seizures so for about the rest of the
week he was pretty much fully
unconscious and then eventually the
doctors told us that he they don't think
he was going to come out of this one so
when I was there with her I was talking
to her and I kept thinking that she was
trying to respond to me but that wasn't
what was happening she was in the
process of dying my friend's mom told me
that she died there was absolute
emptiness inside me like there was
nothing in my brain like nothing in my
stomach nothing in my chest immediately
when the room got quiet my grandpa's
breathing changed and it went from sort
of long heavy breaths
to these short inhales we were debating
whether to wake my grandma or not right
about as she walked in he took his last
inhale which was another short breath
another but then there was no exhale
from that breath the nurse was in there
by then and said I'm sorry he's gone so
I jumped off and went to the bottom to
see what was happening and there was
blood that came out of his ears and I
ran past them and my father and ran all
the way home it was unbelievable because
as soon as they looked at peace with
each other he decided to go all you want
to do is just tell them it's gonna be
okay and you don't know nobody knows
when you're counting and counting and
counting and they're not breathing
it's like this they're gone it's it's
one of those few moments that really
shake you and shape you when it did
finally end kind of in this quiet moment
of peace with three people who loved him
surrounding him the relief of knowing
that my family wasn't going to go
through months of having him in hospice
and not knowing what was going to happen
to him and having this false glimmer of
hope that maybe he'd wake up fine it was
sort of a positive thing to learn
through seeing his death he got to see
his family all together right before he
went and that was really what he wanted
witnessing that and seeing some like a
whole family finally at peace in this
moment was absolutely like beautiful and
if I would have known how it was going
to turn out in the end I I would have
just gotten to the car and held her
until the police came it makes you think
about your life in different terms
nothing will ever compare to how I felt
when they told me she had died so if I
got through all of that whatever else is
coming at me I can do that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
