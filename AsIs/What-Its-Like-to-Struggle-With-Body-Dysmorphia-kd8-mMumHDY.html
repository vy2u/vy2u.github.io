is so bad that I've already spent over
$20,000 on plastic surgery
you
although I'm a healthy weight and I work
out like crazy my body dysmorphia has
only gotten worse I truly hate my body
when I say I'm not pretty it isn't for
attention I have body dysmorphic
disorder so I literally don't see what
everyone else sees I have body
dysmorphia and no one understands my
need to go to the gym just to feel okay
today I am a model but I have body
dysmorphic disorder sometimes I see
photos of myself and cry for hours
I avoid mirrors except when I put makeup
on because of my body gets more fake
disorder I have body dysmorphic disorder
and I'm constantly told that my down
talk on myself is fishing for
compliments having body dysmorphia is
hard for once I just want to see myself
as beautiful because of my body
dysmorphic disorder sometimes I honestly
feel like I don't know what I look like
even when I look in the mirror or look
at pictures of myself I have body
dysmorphia I am not looking for
attention when I say I'm fat I'm just
telling you what I feel I have body
dysmorphic disorder and there's nothing
more painful than not being able to see
we truly look like when facing a mirror
I have body dysmorphia and I just bought
a bikini I plan to wear it out on the
beach this weekend
hashtag steps forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
