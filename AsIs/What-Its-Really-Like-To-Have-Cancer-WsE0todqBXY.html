survivor that is made and is used to
make people feel comfortable that the
people who are actually going through
chemo and dealing with radiation losing
limbs losing loved ones losing friends
that's what cancer is about a doctor
said you had cancer I thought about my
homework first oh I'm gonna die and I'm
not gonna finish my homework I noticed a
little lump growing out of my chest and
after I got the results from my biopsy
it was confirmed that I had Hodgkin's
lymphoma it is breast cancer in my right
breast and my axillary lymph node which
is kind of the armpit area my mom was on
the phone with the doctor
she said it can't be cancer I found out
I had testicular cancer just like a week
after I turned 30 I had a very large
tumor in my colon and unfortunately
about 11 other tumors in my liver they
told me if I didn't do anything about it
I would be dead in a month I thought
well this is pretty and
convenient I just left the building
ordered a fat burger with an egg on top
and ate it I was so pissed that that had
happened to me
and I was angry when the doctors had to
come in and talk and have like a real
discussion it was to a 12 year old
losing my hair was really hard on me
that almost worried me more than the
idea of going through chemo I wasn't
really addressing any of my problems
three months after chemo I had a pretty
disgusting meltdown my mom started a
career she had a quit her job my dad had
to take on more responsibilities it took
me a while to even let my family know
that I had cancer and I I was
sugarcoating it my mom had crayon
herself in the hospital room and she
stayed with me for 48 hours I really
realized at that moment that my life was
gonna be so different
that's an amazing partner it was there
for me the whole time
it was probably it was probably harder
for him watching me go through it they
think and they know that you're going
through something so challenging they
keep their problems at bay where when
you're going through something like
cancer sometimes you just want to get
out of your own head and hear somebody
else's problems some kids they would
tell me that my mom doesn't let me go
visit you at the hospital because she
thinks I might get sick when they find
out you have cancer is to tell you about
the person they know that has had cancer
and died which is the last thing you
want to hear when you're in chemo there
was other people that sort of withdrew
and that was really hard for me they're
not so much afraid of you you know in
fact oftentimes they want to take
selfies with you so that they can get
lots of likes from their friends about
supporting their cancer friend if you
know somebody that has cancer like go
visit them go hang out with them people
were changing around me it wasn't until
I ran into a dear friend I walked into
her office and she goes oh my god this
is the best diet you've ever been on we
just cracked up we just lost our minds
and laughed and made cancer jokes for
the rest of the day ever since then that
is what got me through it I would say
the mindset you're in is the biggest
weapon you have when you're fighting
cancer even if it were the tiniest
things like I didn't vomit this morning
or I was able to go outside today and go
on an errand I would tell anyone that's
going through any sort of surgery or
chemo or radiation you've got to find
the things you love and hold on to those
for the days you're going through your
interventions or your procedures I read
a lot we read a lot of Joan Didion she's
always good for a downer it's okay to be
sad try to laugh try to find things that
bring you joy and bliss and make you
smile we're all survivors everybody who
walks a day on this planet is a survivor
when everything is taken from you you
really do start to appreciate the
tiniest things live that moment like if
you're able to like wake up a little bit
or walk a little bit like go walk go
just take advantage of what you're able
to do there are so many support groups
there's amazing online support
if you want to stay anonymous if you can
find a support system whether it's your
friends or your family or a loved one
that is probably the best things you can
do to help yourself in this process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
