Malibu's through our own Victoria Secret
shoot there's no buffet or rose or Sun
but it's gonna be great I'm a little
scared to see myself you know lined up
next to the model last case scenario my
boob is the size of her head okay this
is a really beautiful perky butt and
then there's like oh there's my butt I'm
gonna look a lot darker than her
probably not like super thrilled to see
myself in a bikini next to the model
like they look bangin I know I'm not
going to look the same as the model
however I might still look okay
so you never know the model in the
picture has her hand like all the way
down here but like my hand look kinda
only comes to like here that's a natural
what it looks like now oh and you like
do it yeah
they got some long limbs my photo is
like the most painless of all of them I
think cuz I just have to stick my butt
out and my face isn't in it I'm too
worried about my face I have to wet my
hair for this job which I'm really not
excited about Mikey I don't know how to
be sexy they speak they all know how to
look like Supernatural while being in
these like weirdly contorted poses to
just drop something but I'm like
breaking my back a tiny tiny bit and
felt a little tiny bit to the right I
now know why they all do like ballet
it's to be able to put your body in
these weird-ass position these Victoria
Secret models make these poses look so
teeny easy and it is so hard
I just fish oh my it's freezing and
posing is so much harder than you think
it is especially when you're shivering
it was any colder than this site I don't
know I'd be out like sign me out I'm
done send me home to my bed with
blankets and epics please that was
really hard it was definitely an
experience my knees kept sinking every
time the waves came in women don't look
like Victoria Secret models do it I tend
to gravitate more towards one pieces cuz
I'm plus size and so whenever I see a
plus-size like kind of suit on a really
skinny girl I'm like wonder how it's
gonna look like on me I felt good about
the pictures and I felt good about
myself that day on the beach but like
the real self-hate kind of comes in when
you see yourself compared side-by-side
to the models it's kind of weird to see
myself next to a Victoria's Secret model
I think what I need to remember usually
when looking at these things is you know
that she had a hair and makeup team and
she had a little bit of Photoshop going
on probably if you just look at the
photo by itself it's like oh yeah I look
pretty hot then you kind of put someone
who was literally a hundred pounds less
than meat you're next to you and you're
really seeing the differences it is not
a sexy like her just like a rock
proportion the same as her for sure but
I think it still looks good on me like I
think it shows off my body well I think
that this like definitely encapsulates
how I felt at the beach I don't look as
awkward as I thought I would which is an
amazing feat because I feel awkward all
the time yeah if her photo wasn't next
to my and I feel like it would be an
okay picture of me I wouldn't totally
hate it not that I hate it now but
putting it in comparison with hers it's
like wow she's selling that suit more
than I am but like as far as a normal
human being that doesn't get paid to
wear swimsuits I feel like I look good
when you look in magazines you kind of
wonder
am I ever gonna look like that when I
grow up is that like if I work out
enough will I look like that but you
know that's not the reality for a lot of
people it's genetics and it's Photoshop
and it's hair and makeup so I think it's
important for young girls to know that
just because they don't have a
Victoria's Secret body doesn't mean
there's anything wrong with their body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
