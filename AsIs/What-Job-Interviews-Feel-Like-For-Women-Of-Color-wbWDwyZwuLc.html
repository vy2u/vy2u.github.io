this job and that I should have straight
magnet I don't see very many women or
people of color here I wonder if I'd fit
in I literally spent a half an hour
deciding whether or not to wear heels in
class I still don't know the right
answer am i laughing too much because
this is just Han conditioned to respond
when a man speaks what I'm gonna
apologize for things unnecessarily like
for taking a sip of the squatter sorry
yeah we have nothing in common you
probably already have a diversity hire
for this year don't you yeah we are to
actually have a black guy in accounting
so we got that box checked but you know
what thank you so much for coming in
well it looks like you attended the same
college I did we're a member of the same
frat I play tennis with your father and
you're a Sox fan why are we even doing
this interview I got a parking spot with
your name on it come on well that was
almost too easy thanks sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
