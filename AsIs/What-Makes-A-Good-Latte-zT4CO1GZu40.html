the surface of a latte as it's being
made we took a trip to Irving Farm
Coffee Roasters in New York City to
better understand how this is done one
of their managers Liz was a judge at the
world Barista Championships where the
best latte art can be found latte is a
shortening of the Italian cafe latte
which literally means milk coffee
because that's all it really is steamed
textured milk poured into a single shot
of espresso the milk is heated to 140
degrees Fahrenheit because this is the
temperature at which it tastes sweetest
any cooler and the flavor of the milks
natural sugars would not come out any
hotter and the milk would burn freshly
made espresso has its own micro foam
called crema an emulsion of the coffees
natural oils as it begins to settle a
sanding shot of espresso has a
convection like effect similar to the
head of a pint of Guinness as the milk
is poured in the crema is pushed apart
and a pattern is left behind on the
lattes surface a tracing of how it was
poured it seems simple enough but the
devil is in the details as I learned
first hand it's much harder to do than
to describe it's not simply dumping one
into the other the milk must plunge into
the espresso in such a way that it
doesn't upset the surface but still
evenly churns with the coffee underneath
a few of the essential pours are the
monk's head
the Rosetta the heart this one's a swan
or a dragon if you have an imagination
in judging a lattes design it's
considered ideal that a latte has as
much contrast between the white and tan
portions as possible while the tan area
also retains consistent shade without
any washout from the milk but in
creating latte art on a daily basis
there are more important aspects than
perfection of form another Irving farm
employee David Cellini explained I enjoy
making lattes
because after you see the exam so what
you've done in a cup and seeing how
people enjoy that drink
we give satisfaction I think we job and
everybody's happy to get my
my my laughter that I already actually
actually made for the customer it's
something that you have to do to know
how you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
