someone's energy when they're being
themselves and I think that's really
beautiful I just think that the
portrayal of sort of like this mixed
gender it's like soft and hard all at
the same time it's a major part of them
that they don't have to apologize for
not being afraid of what other people
think of you wearing what she wants to
wear presenting however she wants to
present doing whatever she wants to do
it really says a lot about their
character confidence is insanely sexy
and I think it's like really playful in
a lot of ways
- I think Angelina Jolie and hackers
that aesthetic was like everything
growing up I had pictures all over the
wall not the sort of super feminine sex
appeal that I feel like you see in
magazines a lot watching the Katie Lange
constant cravings video for the first
time and there she is wearing this suit
and she's just singing and I was really
little I wasn't necessarily sure what
type of person I was looking at but all
I knew is that it was special and I
liked it the Torn music video with
Natalie Imbruglia and she had kind of
short hair and she was wearing like
hoodie and she was tomboyish I remember
that was the first time one of the first
times where I was like attracted to this
woman but also kind of wanted to be her
at the same time I like pulled out my
fake ID and I entered this whole other
world I had never been to a gay bar
before and I'd never seen women look
like this like jaw to the floor I
instantly felt electric there was a
converse ad of this girl standing on top
of a building and she was like if I Spit
my gum from the top of here it could
split somebody's head open and I was
like that is like the sexiest thing I've
ever seen like she's such a badass and
now like Chloe's put that gum from the
top of that building so it's what's with
that Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
