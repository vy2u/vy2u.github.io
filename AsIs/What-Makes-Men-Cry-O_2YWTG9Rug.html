thing that makes women cry it's it feels
good to sort of let yourself feel bad I
try to hide it like I think most dudes
do but not because I'm sad just because
I don't want people to feel like they
need to help I honestly can't remember
the last time I cried in front of
somebody any movie that sort of
heartfelt and that I'm invested in will
generally have me choking up I think the
last time I cried was at a TV show I was
watching this HBO miniseries called
olive kitteridge I can think of the last
time that I like hits something but I
can't think of less my cried it was
about a month and a half ago my
grandmother had a stroke and she died a
week or so later I cried when I talked
to her on the phone and basically told
her I loved her for the last time a
friend of mine just died so I was at the
hospital and that was the last time I
cried which was last week radio lab did
a story about this family where they had
a breakthrough with their autistic son
and I remember just driving through LA
listening to that and just kind of not
just like tears like welling up but kind
of sobbing at some of the moments you
know you go about your life and then
there's something that reminds you of
that person then it's there it's never
gonna go away it's just like always
gonna there's always going to be the
pits and valleys I'm a person that cries
very easily and I'm not ashamed of that
I'm in touch with my emotions I think
I've always been pretty sensitive and
and never felt like it was a bad thing
if I cried a lot of my male friends like
I've never seen them cry
and I think society has told them that
they shouldn't cry and if they do cry
that they're somehow less masculine
somehow less manly but I think that's
that's all crap the last time that I
cried so much that I couldn't believe
how much I was crying it was when I
moved to Los Angeles I left my
girlfriend in Chicago it was very hard
at that time and I think that was the
last time that actually and I held it
out for so long before I moved away and
it was the last time that we had to get
out of the car at the same time I had to
go to the airport I just lost it being
able to express your emotions as a man
is a good thing the actual physical
release of tears you just can't help it
when you feel those emotions it's just
what happened I'm okay with it I'm fine
being a person that cries and oftentimes
I feel a lot better after I cry you
should seek out things that would cause
you to cry because crying gives new
meaning to things crying allows you to
seek the inner self I haven't cried in a
year it's weird how am i pick my eyes
not just like shut down one day and just
went you I'm just gonna like cry
it's weird when you do cry you kind of
feel like you've changed a little bit I
think and that's it's important feeling
for anyone to feel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
