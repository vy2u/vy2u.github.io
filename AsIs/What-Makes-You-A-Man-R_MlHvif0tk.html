had my nose shattered and a fight there
are a lot of mixed signals in the world
I was told that being a man was being
shown you don't talk about our feelings
or not it's a it's a very macho culture
I never saw my dad cry except for once
in my life but it freaked me out I
remember thinking that there was
something wrong like I felt like a
machine had like shut down you bury
emotion as much as you can until you
physically can't hold it anymore
and then you go somewhere privately and
have yourself a little cry
I never cried actually I've been I've
only cried twice in the past seven years
I was always very much belittled for any
sort of display of emotion you know back
home if somebody looks at you the wrong
way or bumps me the wrong way you kind
of have to do something about it because
it's testing your manhood don't back
down to from fights don't be ready to
pick fights there's a lot of violence
around from I've had my nose broken
three times when you feel threatened is
when you bow up is when you you know try
to get that swagger on this just so bro
e and unrealistic if I could instill
fear in others then they would see me as
a man when I think of masculinity I
think more of a gentleman and carrying
yourself with you know strengthened
weight not necessarily
violence and aggression masculinity
shouldn't require us to dominate
everything thankfully for the
opportunity to traveling up different
places and I've seen that a ton of men
could be any number of things it's not
one concrete definition when I think of
what I want to be as a man I want to be
a good man I want to be kind I want to
look out for people
there's a million types of men in the
world and there's no right way to be a
guy it doesn't matter who you are where
you come from who you love if you're
confident most people see you as
masculine it's okay to cry
kid hug hug a man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
