would ever really be clean if there
wasn't a potential of sex everyone's got
to try our Kelly sex once cuz you'll do
it as a joke you'll be like oh let's
have sex start Kelly this will be funny
and then you're doing you'll be like my
sexy underwear Hugo Boss or Calvin Klein
which I got in the discount section
girls we do it too we change our outfits
a hundred times
condoms are conveniently within reach of
the bed but not so close that it's like
oh yeah I knew we were having sex I put
a condom like under the pillow agent
people don't have much hair all over
their body so I really have a hairy
chest either so that's already good to
go
clip the nipples I don't shave the
nipples I don't shave anything for
gaming especially there's a lot more
preparation the trail going down and
then you got the triangle trifecta
maybe the active douching the sex is the
plane and those designs are is that guy
with the with the light baton sometimes
people use plastic gloves so that way
fingering can happen to help with the
process of anal sex not that I would
know I definitely try to work out that
day if there's if there's time in
advance I think the goal is to like put
effort in and make it look effortless
it's obvious you clean that much it's
not a sexy you know I'm saying his sperm
needs to leave my body and she's like I
get that we used to stop caring and they
like he kind of care and but eventually
they will meet at the bottom you know in
our sweat pants in a relationship I
think things are more spontaneous in a
the fact that like you didn't get ready
for it actually makes it better you ever
meet a man that that tastes much time to
prepare for sex as you do that's a
keeper like well this is the level of
good I am and if they like that then
we're right for each other
just be like yeah should I crown my hair
is great I got candles what's up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
