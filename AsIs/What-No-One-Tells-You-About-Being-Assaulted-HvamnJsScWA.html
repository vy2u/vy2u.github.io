it happened to me even though I wasn't
wearing revealing clothing I wasn't
drunk or inebriated I didn't ask for
these nightmares to be in a perpetual
state of PTSD constantly living in fear
of my own memories I didn't ask to feel
like a stranger in my own home
I didn't ask to be a statistic I didn't
ask to become a victim to your predatory
bullshit and yet it still happened to me
it happened to me and it felt like
drowning I wanted to scream but couldn't
catch my breath my ears will never
forget the sound of his soft footsteps
quiet like a deer's but filled with
volition and carrying ammunition of the
selfish kind my eyes will never be able
to unsee what you did to me you know
they say that the greatest visions are
those cleansed by Tears but mine were
through scratches as you threw the first
blow and knocked off my glasses and they
held me down like a crashing wave my
neck and back thrashing the icy chill on
my ribs when my shirt flew over my head
my pants came undone and even when I
thought it was over I soon realized that
the real pain had not yet even begun it
happened to me even though I thought I
knew this person it happened to me even
though I didn't know the person even
though I cried for help even though I am
strong nothing can protect you from what
your eyes cannot see behind you or
sometimes what's even right in front of
you I thought this was some shit that
only happens in the movies but never in
my wildest dreams did I ever think that
could happen to me but it did
and I remember feeling guilty I remember
feeling embarrassed
I remember saying I'm sorry to my
friends before he's been sharing my
story I remember the police consistently
asking me to repeat it over and over and
over how could you not hear me the first
time I was assaulted was that loud
enough for you now and the first thing I
remember hearing was I don't believe you
it's not that big of a deal just stay
out of his way that doesn't happen to
boys he just has a temper or silence
I remember the silence silence was
easier for everyone
easier for them easier for me easier for
him but I refuse to stay silent anymore
because I am NOT a victim I am a
survivor it happened to me but I will
not live in fear it happened to me but I
know that I am more than just a
statistic I am NOT damaged goods I am
healing it happened to me but I am NOT
alone it happened to us
