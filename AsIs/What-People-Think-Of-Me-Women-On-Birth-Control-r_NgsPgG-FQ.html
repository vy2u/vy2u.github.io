sex with everyone, everyone.
Where did I go wrong, I mean,
she's becoming this fast girl.
I should have taken her

- Now that that government
covers my ho pills,
I can have sex irresponsibly and
have the government pay for it.
Thanks, Obama.

We don't need these anymore.
We can go all day, all night.
Everybody's doing that.

and have sex with me at my place tonight?
