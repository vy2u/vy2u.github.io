something yeah talking about medication
for anxiety or depression there's
definitely a stigma I take a medicine
for my ADHD
I was panicky and sad at the same time I
can feel so weird even at my own
doctor's office I'm like yeah I'm here
for an adderall appointment and it's
just all the sudden this like we are
seeing in the room with people of color
it's almost like a thing that doesn't
really exist there's like a spectrum
there's like you're either crazy or
you're weak and in the middle is you
just act like you're fine it doesn't
mean you're weak and it's not something
you can just get over stigma comes from
people thinking that medication is an
easy way out and I think that's
absolutely not true I think it's really
difficult to take that step I'm not a
big fan of just forcing medication to
solve a problem quickly I come from a
very strong family we were athletes we
handle our business you know we know
that a lot of who you are depending on
your self-control takes a lot of hard
work on your own in addition to the
medication this isn't a cure-all there's
no cure-all but just because something
isn't a cure-all doesn't mean that it's
something you should just say it I use
it as a tool in conjunction with a lot
of other stuff that enhance my life
and now the medication it does my
anxiety doesn't reach that next level
but now I talk for myself Jessica that
doesn't work for some people doesn't
mean it doesn't work for anyone and it
was something that I needed I would be
able to calm myself down sift through my
thoughts and emotions instead of
reacting I can actually deal with my
problems a lot better and a lot more
head-on there's enough horrific in
this world like you don't need your
chemical sadness to make you a brilliant
artist you don't you deserve to be happy
once I got out of my shell and was open
with people they just started being open
with me and even asking me where I went
to therapy but then I really found out
that more and more of my friends were
really dealing with similar issues a lot
of people who feel alone about it
because there are not a lot of people
talking about it
some people think that when you take
medication it means you're really messed
up why doesn't it just mean that you're
taking care of yourself you should take
it very seriously and know that this is
not going to fix me but it can help me
fix myself you're worth taking the time
out to figure out and to take care of
your body in your mental health all you
have to do is what's right for you
that's all that should matter and it
goes for everyone else out there like
you don't need to feel alone or weird
about it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
