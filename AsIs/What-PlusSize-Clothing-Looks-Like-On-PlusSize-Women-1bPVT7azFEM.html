which is great because I hate surprises
I need something that I want to wear in
a store on a daily basis is nearly
impossible there is a huge advantage to
being able to try on clothes before you
purchase them a bunch of times I've gone
online ordered in my size and when I get
it I don't even know what it is
typically Emma size 22 24 according to
the sizing chart I'm supposed to be a 28
I hate these shirts why are they baggy
and at this awkward length they fit
technically but there's like so much
room down here I can like pull them off
of me are they supposed to be
high-waisted who knows
send these shorts back to hell
this is a fashion to figure size 3x
skirt if it's great clearly if you're
supposed to wear skirts below your Fupa
I can actually see the seams coming
apart in the ideal world this fad would
be distributed very evenly around my
whole body but that isn't how a lot of
people are naturally shaped I'm normally
a 3x on everything but the skirt doesn't
fit so I couldn't really wear it these
are the fashion figure millennium pant
which is weird because it looks like
they were made for my mother I can't
believe this size 3x pant came from the
same store as the 3x skirt
I could literally fold these over the
waist feels okay by the butt is like
here and my crack is like here I am
suffering from saggy crop syndrome right
now if I were super coal like a climb
inside this for warmth
this is a forever 21 dress in size 3x
according to forever 21 size guide a my
waist of the 3x but my boobs in my hips
are 2x which means that nothing ever
really quite fits me I feel like this
dresses main problem is that it was made
for someone who wasn't very boobie I
were to wear it out I would actually
unzip it but as a whole I can breathe
which is always nice I like the dress I
would probably buy it
I wasn't really surprised by the fact
that some things spent and some things
did it just because it fits the
measurements doesn't mean that it's
going to look good on us please clothing
companies I promise I will give you all
of my money just make the clothes put
them in store so that we can try them on
I promise you we'll make money off of it
if you're struggling to find clothes
that work for you be patient
get your measurements taken properly and
also unfortunately try a few different
sizes if you're willing to do the work
to really dig you can find a lot of cool
stuff because there is a lot of cool
stuff out there this is currently like
my favorite dress a little bit more
low-cut than what I'd normally wear but
if you don't tell I won't tell so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
