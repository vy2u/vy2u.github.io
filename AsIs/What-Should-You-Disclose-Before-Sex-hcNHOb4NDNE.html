go on a date you find a great guy and
the next thing you know you're like in
bed under the sheets ripping each others
clothes off like no one ever talks about
it in movies I have about a 50 cent
piece sized birthmark square in the
middle of my butt cheek so I usually try
and let them know it's a birthmark
before they assume that I have myself
during sex like if they like it rough
maybe if they like dirty talk if they
like maybe what they're into cuz then
you know how to pleasure them how to
make them feel good if you are not on
birth control I would love to know that
as well even if I am bagging it if
someone is a virgin age would be good
you definitely need to tell me your age
I always like to have a conversation
about STDs and the last time I was
tested I like to offer that information
so I can receive that information from
whoever I'm having sex with
I don't ask and I wonder if I should I
actually have to find out from another
friend who told me like oh you slept
with so and son and my god he was like
you know that he's positive right and
the guy told him he's like well you
didn't ask which I think is the dumbest
thing because I think that's something
that you just need to tell a person and
it also felt like because we were in a
relationship at that point I felt like
she didn't care about me as much as I
cared about her I think life would just
be so much easier you know if people
talk about it I don't understand why we
don't talk about it in a couple cases
they were like I've never gotten tested
and I was like this sounds like a great
date I think the more that people learn
about certain STDs like people will kind
of you know not be so judgmental but I
think that's why people are very afraid
to actually disclose any sort of
information for the most part I haven't
had to disclose that I was trans because
most of the people I've had sex with
knew beforehand they basically tell them
that I'm a transgender woman that I've
had surgery
it's like should you say I was born
without a dick like I had no idea what
to say or how to disclose that
information so since I'm somewhat public
I just was like have you ever googled me
there's a fear-based
aspect of it where they start to wonder
whether they're Jenn
and their sexuality is brought into
question other than that it's pretty
free and clear I say just sort of play
it by ear do a little like jazz you know
I kind of like the jazz of sex I guess
it's important to be on the same page
with whoever you're about to have sex
with right this is what's up what's up
with you we're good okay let's do this
you should feel comfortable asking for
that and if you don't then I don't know
how you can feel comfortable sharing
your body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
