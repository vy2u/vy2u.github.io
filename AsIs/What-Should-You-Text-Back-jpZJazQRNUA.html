you don't no one are you sorry I'm late
we haven't even ordered yes we're in
crisis yeah that's right we're in crisis
it's apparently urgent okay don't you
even because it was everything okay I
texted this beautiful perfect man I met
last night that it was great meeting him
and not six minutes ago I received hey
3:1 oh girl how's it hanging so this is
about a time yes it is his name was
Blake well was it Jake no no it was
Blake and he was so funny and super
smart I hate to be the one to break this
to you but if somebody spells a house
with a V instead of an S they're
probably don't you spell house with the
Z's I'm doing it ironically and stop
talking about my future husband that way
okay you're not even a hundred percent
sure his name was Blake I'm not not 100%
sure
okay that doesn't make sense it was as
if there was no one else in the club but
us I'm sorry you met in the club
of course he says he actually doesn't go
out that often but I did the bartender's
know him yeah they kept commenting on
his man but
oh I am I'm bringing the man button and
let me tell you it was glorious okay
what do you need from us right now as
you thought I need you to tell me how to
respond to his text so that I sound just
like effortlessly cool you know right so
not authentic or you just God no cool
steely so the furthest thing for you yes
exactly
even if he totally doesn't remember if
he doesn't remember me why would he text
me back at all do you want the truth or
do you want us to co-sign on a bad yet
maybe fun decision because we are here
for you he remembers back okay I'm
afraid he doesn't okay well then we can
start fresh right here here's an idea
why not be honest oh okay what I'm
saying is hear me out
if you like this dude just ask me on a
date oh that's a terrible idea
no I know what I'm gonna do okay hang in
just fine
over here then keep it simple
congratulations he took no-one's advice
and still made a terrible decision okay
you don't know that love is about taking
risks he could see the text you could oh
my god yeah phone died who dis
not one word okay let's just hurry up an
order I'm gonna
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
