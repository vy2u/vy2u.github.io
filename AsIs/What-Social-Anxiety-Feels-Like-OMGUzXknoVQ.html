severe social anxiety they just assume
I'm being rude
all I've ever wanted is to know what it
feels like to have self-confidence
social anxiety ruins me I have severe
social anxiety if I initiate a
conversation with you know that it takes
every ounce of courage I have as someone
with social anxiety getting ready to go
out feels like getting ready to go into
battle I can't get a job because my
social anxiety has been too scared to
leave the house
social anxiety skipping lunch because
you're too afraid to ask your coworker
to take theirs out of the microwave my
family members are all very outgoing and
can't even begin to understand the
social anxiety that things like talking
on the phone and using a drive-through
give me I'm sick and tired of only being
known of as the quiet girl I've had
social anxiety my whole life but there's
a lot more to me than my silence when
the term social anxiety surfaced I was
finally able to identify my issues so
that now I can overcome them I have
social anxiety disorder and not long ago
I started a job in retail I thought I
would have a hard time with it but
surprisingly I think it's helping me
open up more I went out by myself today
I watched a movie and had lunch in a
cafe afterwards I think I'm finally
getting control of my social anxiety</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
