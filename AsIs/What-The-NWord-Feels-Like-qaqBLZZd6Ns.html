the cab dropped me off to my apartment
without someone yelling the n-word at me
outside of a car like why is that I
think I'm dealing with
I was 11 years old I was at a
convenience store I was 18 I was
experimenting with YouTube I was between
7 and 9 years old and I was with my
mother it was when I was at Columbia
University I was in grad school I was
studying abroad in a small town in
Germany like just like at night like
walking down the street this random
drunken dude outside the lecture hall
yelled nigger at me don't wonder what
the story came out and told us to get
out you bloody nigger these two white
dudes in a car like drove by and one
yelled nigger and one yelled afro I was
at the cash register and she asked me
for proof of ID to prove that with the
Columbia University and she hadn't asked
the other students I asked her why she
asked me and nobody else and she just
kind of mother under her breath you give
these niggas an education they think
they know everything on YouTube the
commenter is like a greasy greasy n-word
hanging from a tree we were stopped at a
stoplight and after sitting for a while
there was a very angry knock on her
window I look over to see a scruffy
white guy the trucker hat not looking
very happy and then he says well
you nigger with me in the passenger seat
you're gonna use that word against me
like you want it you're doing it to like
get a rise out of me but then you also
have to deal with like people's
expectations of like how you're gonna
respond to feel like after she said what
she said I kind of stood in shock for a
moment but then I took my things that I
had purchased and went to the next
cashier and asked to return them and
they were like why and now because I'm
not going to pay to be called a nigger
when it happens to you I think there's
still such an innate shock because it's
just like it is 20
was like like 2010 and like I'm still
having to like go down the street and
like deal with like people like using
that as like an insult against me our
ancestors were called that and they
didn't have any control over it but I
guess you bring it back to like sleep
you're not equal to us and this is what
this is what they called everyone back
in the days and this is what we feel
like is right to call you it was a word
that was used purposefully with the
intention of like keeping black people
down and in their place they just see my
skin color and then the first thing that
they think is like hatred this terrible
word basically I thought was exclusive
to America and America's history with
slavery had traveled across oceans to
other countries and it was just really
hurt
