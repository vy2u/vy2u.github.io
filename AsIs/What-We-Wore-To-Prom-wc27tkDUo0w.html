fuzzy per se
problem means to me underage drinking
pictures that you're gonna want to burn
from mean sweaty Mormo shellin poles
temperature prom is such a weird time
grinding for everybody you think it it's
like so important and then like a few
years later you like that won't
this was a big show and you better be
ready to go big or go home
so if I had to describe my prom look
from head to toe wait I'm reliving the
trauma give me a second but I knew like
okay this Kelly Rowland's inspired look
something that vein isn't I was going
for
I don't know what's this did to my hair
but like it did not translate like the
Usher who's like you know her potato
salad good you know her pound cake
Poppins but she not necessarily your
fashion go-to so my mom gave me a budget
I think I was waitressing at Applebee's
for like literally a week and then I was
like this is too much work I can't do
this I had a little money saved up from
that and then my mom also gave me some a
little budget she was like cans for more
than 150 or like 100 and I was like okay
well that's gonna be hard I wanted the
Hat or Lose a Guy in 10 days dress but
in red cuz that's one of my favorite
colors so I went to Macy's one day and I
went in the clearance section and they
had this beautiful red dress it's just
the back wasn't what I wanted and it was
also like four sizes bigger but I was
like you know what we can work with this
I grabbed it I took it to a tailor it
was already open back but they just made
it like lower and I don't know why my
mother it was like yeah sure you can do
that I think I spent $75 on all and I
liked it I still like it you had a
picture like the high schools you see on
TV that you don't think I go no high
schools actually like that so like the
football jocks I'm like prom queen and
like you're like oh and doing anything
else other than footballs weird but that
was my high school I had it in my head
of it this was my chance like I was
never gonna be able to wear a prom dress
again and this is my last chance and I
wanted it to be as big and pink and
poufy and insane as possible and boy did
I deliver my dress was so wide I could
not fit into my car we had to borrow my
dad's car
and my date had to stuff me inside of it
and fold me up like a little hot pocket
the boobs were fuzzy weirdly like I look
like a fembot from Austin Powers with
like pink fuzzy boobs it was covered in
sequins and I vividly remember taking it
home and going you know what this baby
doesn't shine enough made my mom put
more sequins on we amped up the sequins
on it because it was too plain keep in
mind I looked like Cinderella had thrown
up on me we did like a tasteful
rhinestone headband which as you can
probably see is just a toned-down tiara
don't let not having a prom queen stop
you from crowning yourself from queen
bee also all got eyelash extensions and
my best friend got glue dropped on her
hide and she had to wear an eye patch to
prom
that's real if I had to describe my prom
look I would say it it's a floor-length
silky dress that was like spaghetti
strapp purple kind of like wavy things
and then like a splash of Tiger orange
and black stripes and then a splash of
zebra stripes as well almost the texture
of like a Windows desktop background the
dress and so it was just all all in
there
I had my mom's dear dear dear friend
make me a flower accessory and she
literally made like this big like this
size flower and she used fabric that
matched the dress and then beating that
matched the dress so in the flower it
was like black/white zebra tiger purple
and I'm just kind of like tucked it
right there above my ear you know was
like a little matchy-matchy but as as a
wee teen I was convinced that this tiger
flower is good for anything that would
really fill my look together the thing I
regret most from prom is definitely my
outfit people at the time thought my
look was fun we all had a good laugh
about it
I don't remember whether my date felt
the same way I had black converse
sneakers with black dress pants that
were far too large for me I had a navy
blue black jacket that was also too
large and under that I had a bright red
tux shirt with red suspenders a black
cumberbund and a black tie and the
cherry on top was a red velvet fedora
with a leopard print band around at the
top I still have the Hat I like to keep
it around I wasn't working here very
long before my co-workers found my old
prom photos on Facebook and so they
turned me into a meme pretty quickly I
think at the end of the day you should
go to prom in whatever you want to as
long as you are comfortable and you have
fun you shouldn't care about looking a
little goofy I stand by the fedora
