the story behind it first and then I'll
explain why I count pigs I've not really
talked about it before so I don't know
maybe a lot of people do have a probably
know on what does this mean react smile
I don't know I remember as a kid I was
really short like my growth spurt didn't
come till later in life so I was
constantly looking up at people and I
just remember thinking in my head how
many people would it take to reach the
ceiling and then it turned into like a
game of Tetris in my head of trying to
stack various people what if I laid them
on their side what if I laid them on
this side what if I laid them on top of
each other big boobs small boobs that
would affect things go into weird places
in my head and then I realized I've
missed an entire meeting because I've
been stacking my bosses on top of one
another when I was in Boys Choir
they had a practice on silence which
meant just standing in a line completely
silent for like an hour so we had to
come up with ways to occupy our time and
our brain for what we were doing one of
the ways I did that was to imagine pigs
or any object and count how many it
would take of that object to fill the
room if that wall is this big it would
probably be about three pigs wide and
then a couple like ten pigs could stack
on top of them but if you stacked them
this way it was facing each other they
fit like 20 pigs or something like that
depending on what kind of shape of the
room you have you're gonna have pigs are
going to be vertical all sorts of
positions I mean really it can get
pretty wild you count pigs wait oh my
thing is that
to ceiling right do you use the people
that are already in the room yeah oh so
that's way too complicated my brain out
of a good function like that I have to
use people or animals that are all the
same size my pigs I don't I don't know
it's not just pigs it's like farm
animals the pigs is the best thing just
okay that's weird I like to have really
better TV so Oh have to count things and
stack things oh my is this for fun no
it's not like I have to do that I'm just
like yeah sure is it relaxing no I'm I'm
glad you count things though yeah I
don't know anyone else that does this
yeah I'm gonna be friends hahaha
so we're doing know things mm-hmm
you guys all do I like right things with
my feet like I sort of like write in
cursive like usually just my name and
sometimes I'll like do my name and like
with both feet so like kind of be like a
mirror image of each other going towards
the middle it's really weird but it's
like very swirly and like if no one sees
it it's not that weird I think I write
in the air and cursive with my pointer
finger or on my hand or with my foot on
the ground actually also I also do with
my thumb on my pointer finger and now
that I'm feeling it like this so I write
words I'm like them with this like with
my other finger like hello like whatever
like little cursive words okay I write
on my index finger with my thumb do you
like purposely doing a new circuit I
mostly write things that I just said or
someone else just said yeah well you're
like I just want a word that like yeah
it's just like random but like
trying it again again when I used to do
it in school I would write like whatever
I was feeling the time so if I was like
in math that's great Octus or something
like my status update would be like a
rigid with my but I just caught myself
doing it right ha ha ha ha I was
literally holding my hand like this and
I was writing doodle on my finger like
oh my god I don't even ask</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
