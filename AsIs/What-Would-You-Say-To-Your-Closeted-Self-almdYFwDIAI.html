recollect not feeling gay all the other
girls in school like had boy crushes and
I just didn't care at all and then I
thought that would change they never did
I've never really had the ability to
kind of pass I've always kind of acted a
little bit more flamboyant my voice is
always a little bit different I didn't
want people to look at me differently I
didn't want people to think back on like
oh I changed in front of you were you
checking me out there are just tons of
people that I felt like I couldn't tell
because they think that thought
something was wrong with me I honestly
thought that coming from a Latin
American family that I was gonna have to
find a new place to live I definitely
think off the bat the first thing I
would say to my closet itself is that
everybody knows already the jig is up
like here you're not fooling anybody
it's okay stop stressing out like just
be gay and be out about it
even though I know that's so much easier
said than done don't be afraid to come
out to your mom she might freak out at
first but she gets used to it and
everything's cool you can pick and
choose who you want to tell it doesn't
matter if the world knows that you're
gay it's your own thing if you want to
share it you can share it if you don't
then you don't have to there's like tons
of different you have to go through
and you have to go through people not
being in your life anymore it was like a
big deal to me and I worked up
like anxiety for so long about coming
out and then I came out and everyone's
like yeah you are
you're right I wish I had somebody is a
Christian that could account to me
through the reconciliation of my faith
in my sexuality I still identify as a
Christian I still know what I believe in
grow into yourself being a lesbian
doesn't necessarily mean you have to
wear men's clothes I mean I still wear
men's clothes sometimes but I think I
know how to wear them better at this
point it's kind of Awesome getting to be
who you always thought you were and
sometimes you have to kind of go through
extraordinary measures to get there Here
I am no one's upset that you're gay mom
and dad still love you Grandma and
Grandpa still love you there's a whole
gay world out there that's waiting to
have fun with you and take you places
and show you different things different
drinks different music different culture
is like
so it's a very loving world and you just
got to find your space in it and you'll
find it eventually
we're out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
