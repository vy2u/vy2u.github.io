look like people have the perfect lives
or like nothing has ever gone wrong but
realistically we know that's not true
so I'm tracking down some of my friends
that you probably already follow to have
them tell you something about themselves
that you probably don't know because by
telling these stories that we don't
normally share on a public platform we
can find out who's behind the handle and
I'll grow together so first up here's my
friend Jasmine my name is Jasmine and I
am a video producer at BuzzFeed I feel
like people see me online as many
different things people consider me to
be very confident I'm going to be
walking in a runway show as a plus-sized
woman for the first time very I hope to
be empowering to people and I hope to
push people out of their comfort zones
and help them feel good about that some
people might think of me as a bitch
though too so I would describe my social
media to be kind of like me which
changes day by day I post often because
I really like my outfit so hot I also do
it for like visibility purposes I just
want at least once a day someone to see
a story or a picture of something of
mine and to feel seen but there's
something you might not know about me a
lot of my close friends know about me a
lot of my family know this about me I
think the only times I've talked about
this publicly is when I'm feeling super
vulnerable I'm also like nervous it's a
lot to talk about like we all have
history knowing this backstory will
either make people be like oh that makes
sense
or oh that doesn't make sense why does
she look like this there's just so much
room for judgment
well now we can just kind of like go
back to the beginning and just talk
about what we've been kind of beating
around the bush about oh okay so setting
up the full picture here I'm from a very
small town with a lot of cornfields and
a lot of people who didn't look like me
everybody and my town was very small
everyone was very blond or had very long
hair I was the only person of color for
a long time and that got to me I was
like 10 looking like I was 15 already
went through like all these changes that
my friends didn't understand
and my dad's black my mom's white I had
like curly hair I was darker than all my
friends who wanted to be as black as me
or as tan as me it was a hard time so by
the time when I got to high school it
was rough just trying to be myself and
the one place that I was allowed to be
myself was in volleyball I played
volleyball all my life and I loved but
it got to this point where I was around
16 years old and everything was just
coming at me so fast I was the captain
of the team I was first team
all-conference getting good grades I was
also working I was doing travel
volleyball I always had so much pressure
and I always put myself to that pressure
even if people weren't telling me about
it
I was putting it on myself regardless so
a lot just got to me and then it came to
a point where I heard there was another
girl in my class who was like people
knew that she had like an eating
disorder or a problem with eating and
for some reason that like sparked an
interest in me there was so much just
going around and running crazy that the
one thing I could focus on was the food
and how I eat it and if I don't eat it
so when I was 15 normally what I would
do is I would not eat for a very long
amount of time if I did eat like an
actual
miel the first thing I would do is make
myself sick afterwards I obviously was
not okay to think that an eating
disorder sounded like that's the only
way I could get control into my life it
would go periods of like eating maybe a
meal per two days or I would get sick
after every time I ain't it would get
almost immediate to the fact where I
almost felt sick after I ate because I
knew I was gonna make myself sick
tons of people would compliment oh
you're looking so good
Oh have you lost weight and I'm like oh
I'm starving myself for two days things
of course people don't know this and of
course people are being nice but I don't
know people only know what they see I
guess did anyone around you know that
this was going on nobody around me knew
that this was going on nobody at all I
told my best friend at the time and she
was the person that actually drove me to
telling my family she was just so
worried about me and was like your
family needs to know this if you don't
tell them I'm going to tell them and you
know when your friends pull that card
like what are you supposed to do oh I
think she maybe allowed me to sit on it
for like two weeks and then I told my
family it was about a year between me
starting my eating disorder and me
telling my family when I told my family
this I remember we were sitting at our
kitchen table and I was like
hysterically crying I told them all
together my mom my dad and my brother
that like I had been starving myself and
I have been getting sick every time
after I ate and they just broke down you
know it sucked
to like let people down that care about
you
my family for
so while they were distraught that I
would do something like that I also was
like a very good child I remember my mom
like immediately the next day printed
out like all of these like things you
can do if your child has an eating
disorder and like got me a book and she
really really tried hard but eventually
I found a therapist and went to therapy
I was going through my mom's emails and
I found an email between her and my aunt
talking about it and it like it like
tore me apart of how sad she was for me
so that sucked and then there was one
time in therapy where I was talking to
her in this like room and I passed out
because I hadn't eaten anything and then
I woke back up and everyone was like
freaking out around me telling me what
happened and I was like okay this is
where I need to like Reath evaluate my
life I'm really hurting the people
around me I'm putting myself in danger
that was kind of my breaking point of
like I need to stop doing this
I went to my therapy appointment early
and my therapist was in the office and
like the door was cracked and she was
talking to her boss he was like okay if
she's getting this bad then we need to
submit her to go to rehab and I heard
him say those words and she agreed and I
was like oh I can't I can't do that like
where in my life timeline that I have
mapped out for me for the next few years
where is rehab going to fit I started
freaking out and I like went to that one
therapy appointment we talked about
stuff and then like I immediately
stopped after that because then going to
rehab would have made you be out of
control yes yes exactly going to rehab
would have meant that my control would
be in somebody else's hands I couldn't
do that so I was like you know what I
don't need to be doing this anymore so
then you just stop kind of cold turkey
yeah I completely stopped didn't look
back
having an eating disorder is still a
really big part of my life
I don't think about directly starving
myself or making myself sick but there
are things that definitely trigger me
that I'm a lot more sensitive to I
forgot to eat all day or oh I just lost
track of time and I'm like I never lose
track of time it's breakfast I feel like
my body now it's so weird because a lot
of people think it's up for discussion
and it's not I currently love what I
look like and I have for a while like I
think that I have a problem to be honest
I could put on 20 pounds and I will walk
around like I just dropped 50 I always
look at myself and I'm like damn like
someone's gonna want this and it's me so
that's all that matters you know I get
so many comments on YouTube to the point
where like I'm numb my favorite comment
that I ever see over and over again is I
don't know why but I hate jasmine I know
you hate me because you're not familiar
with a bigger woman with no hair wearing
lipstick wearing whatever the hell she
wants and being confident at the same
time you're not familiar with that and
that's how I know I'm doing my job
correctly for me personally it is always
going to be a time and a point in my
life and to watch that growth is amazing
and so I don't necessarily think that
it's something you have to be ashamed of
or embarrassed of we're all people and
we're all going through things and all
we want to do is just feel good and be
loved and to be loved by ourselves at
the end of the day I'm living with me 24
hours a day seven days a week and you've
got to be happy with that so now you
know this about me and hopefully this
helped you and can help you and power
yourself and everybody around you it's
perfect cool that's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
