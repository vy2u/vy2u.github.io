released their hot clothing line and I
have to say what an urban style I know
that the elements of this are associated
with a culture that rose from
working-class black areas but I will use
this vague term to describe it instead
who says urban anymore like my roommate
was just out of control this weekend and
I finally had to tell her off oh my god
you are so sassy Wow
you know I associate yourself esteem and
demeanor with a one-dimensional
finger-snapping depiction of black
femininity right yeah I am bassy yeah
hey man let's cut down this alley it's a
short cook I don't know man
this seems like a pretty sketchy area
well like here there's a lot of
working-class black people in this area
and it makes me uncomfortable sketchy
neighborhoods like it's just an alley do
you mind if I use your phone charger
when batteries has been dying
damn your phone is so ghetto that's a
negative thing that I associate with
blackness and poor people since when
could an iPhone be considered ghetto
based on my three-step plan this is how
we'll take over the Internet
great job good job you're so articulate
where did you grow up I just can't get
over the fact that you speak so clearly
and confidently for a black person so
rare um Massachusetts how does my hair
look your hair always looks cute touch
it actually never been as close to a
black person before so I have to seize
the moment you're so different from me
huh okay I know it's really cute but
don't edges okay I touch it all right
cool sure always looks cute
try not yet I keep saying that thing
he's creepy sorry it's like it feels so
wrong I heard him talking about a beam
oh okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
