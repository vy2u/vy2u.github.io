chances are you likely know of at least
one of these clothing stores but more
specifically you're probably more
familiar with one of their outlets you
know for the great deals and the huge
discounts as a fairly new clothing
enthusiast I wanted to find out if there
was any difference between retail stores
and their outlet counterparts and after
a little research I was surprised to
find quite a few sources that not only
said we weren't getting a bargain but
that we've been unknowingly buying lower
quality products my name is Weston and I
want to find out if we're really getting
a deal from outlet stores
my questions about this started when I
read an article by BuzzFeed news
reporter Sapna Maheshwara I figured
speaking with Sapna would be the best
place to start so the difference between
outlets and retail in terms of the
product that's coming out what is the
difference so the difference ranges from
brand to brand traditionally it used to
be excess goods and so it was actual
items from the full-line stores that
wasn't sold for whatever reason and then
made it to the outlet because outlets
have gotten so big their goods that are
made for the outlet specifically and
sometimes well more often than not
they're of lesser quality in this TV
news footage a fashion consultant was
able to pick out the lower quality
outlet versus the higher quality retail
product now this has led some consumers
to feel that the MSRP or the
manufacturer's suggested retail price is
kind of misleading and that a lot of
people believe they're buying retail
quality products at a discount when they
really aren't it was this very idea that
led for members of Congress to request a
federal investigation by the FTC of what
they considered as deceptive outlet
practices not to mention a class action
lawsuit against Gap Banana Republic and
Neiman Marcus by a California resident
but then I got to thinking maybe we just
don't have the full picture of what's
going on in the clothing industry so I
figured it would be best to speak with
someone who truly knows the fashion
industry the president of the California
fashion Association Ilsa met check are
they getting a deal when they buy a
coach bag at a coach outlet and not at
Macy's or at Nordstrom's or at Neiman's
sure because the outward fabrication of
the coach product is the same they're
not going to make a lesser plasticized
cover they may not have as many findings
that is the gold rings the buckles and
the things like that for the outlets is
it mostly a manufactured factory two
outlet goods that are going for the
larger brands absolutely they all are
creating outlets
of themselves now they have separate
buyers who go into the market for things
that fit into the outlet price point
when you're going into a coach you will
see certain things have an MSRP because
they may be things that didn't sell at
the regular price but you won't see it
on things that were made exclusively for
the outlet stores so if I go into an
outlet and I see MSRP I can assume that
that came from the main retail branch
exactly that came from the main retail
branch and was an existing pattern got
it thankfully for us
calling Tressler a consumer education
specialist from the FTC has a few tips
to make sure we get the most out of
outlet shopping you can check out with
the sales associates just specifically
ask them
you are you selling merchandise from
your non Outlet stores and do comparison
shopping with ABS to see what an outfit
perhaps might cost in the non Outlet
Store and then you'll know that price
and when you go if you like the quality
that the outlet is providing you could
save a lot of money if you're looking
for something trendy maybe you'll wear
it for a couple of seasons and outlet
purchase may be fine if you're looking
for an investment piece you may want to
shop at the non outlet retail store the
other thing you can do is go online and
check reviews from other shoppers see
what they said about certain stores at
the outlets and what they thought the
same you get what you pay for
unfortunately applies to the outlet
world but at least now you have a better
idea of what to expect from outlet
stores and ultimately can decide when
outlet shopping may be right for you 40%
off MSRP sweet
