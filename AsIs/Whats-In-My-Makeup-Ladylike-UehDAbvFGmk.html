you're talking about
what ever wonder what's in your makeup
not just a liquefied essence of Kylie
herself but the actual name and uses of
the ingredients going on your face its
ladylike and today we're gonna find out
what's in my makeup when I first find
new makeup it's kind of just like an
adrenaline rush
I don't really bother to look at what's
on the label I kind of just thrown on my
things immediately pen tear erisa rittle
I never really look at my makeup
ingredients as if they were like a list
of food ingredients tetra ISOs Terry
eight but I do try and research the
brand beeswax I know a beeswax is I have
no idea what's in this though I just
know that it stays on the lashes and it
keeps them curled Wow it is it's weird
having any of that in this I'm gonna say
that it is in
DiamondClean er antifreeze why I chose
diamond cleaner cuz I was like at least
diamonds are a little bit glamorous one
of the beautiful women at Sephora helped
me find this one but I've been using
this guy for about a month I have no
idea what mica is and I don't think it's
the second one I'm gonna eliminate B I
don't think it's in fish food maybe
because it's a rock
maybe C love this stuff if I use it
pretty regularly I think it eliminate
Jack totally makes sense because this is
a matte skin too so I mean it smells
like makeup
I wouldn't necessarily consider this
smell to be a soft sweet scent so
don't know about that now I want to know
what's in the archive I don't think that
any of those ingredients are harmful to
any sort of like ecosystem or people
they're just kind of weird things that
happen to be in this tube nice to have
the knowledge of what types of
ingredients are in my makeup and what
I'm putting on my lips and what I'm
putting on my face it's definitely a
more daunting task to figure out what
ingredients are in your makeup and what
those ingredients do it's so hard for
like the everyday consumer it's like
know what these chemical names need you
and I mean it's always better to know
more than to know less I so hexade
decane sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
