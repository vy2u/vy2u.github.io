Echo Park but I'm pretty new to Los
Angeles and I know probably less than a
dozen of them in my neighborhood I'm
hoping that by the end of the week I can
change them my mom didn't like this idea
very much she said it seemed kind of
dangerous but it only took about 20
minutes before I started meeting other
people on the street and of course they
were making a video too so I followed
these two guys around the corner to a
building that I actually thought was
abandoned and it's not but well I guess
I kind of sound sketchy that I say it
out loud
I was feeling pretty confident my plan
at this point I mean I didn't really do
anything and I was already getting tours
of big cool art studios and jumping on
trampolines and you found me on
Instagram yeah okay great sweet all
right
wave Jenny I started getting a little
cocky with my skills introduce myself to
this channel
hey this is Andrew hey people we met
Andrew while he was eating breakfast
yeah I can see was getting a late start
today Yeah right you know who are
thinking the same thing you wanted to
say really I think it's you have to be
sort of open Andrew and I had a lovely
afternoon and I went home thinking my
day was over but when I checked my email
I discovered that my flyers were
actually working I'm trying to pick out
a beer because I got invited to a
potluck tonight hey nice to meet you too
that's JP he's someone of my fliers by
the lake ari come on in thanks you guys
how do you all know each other we're
gonna pull pork sandwiches guys
just bros meet and videogames I totally
forgot how much I missed this kind of
thing
Sophie it's pretty bold for a woman to
call on a flier but after a couple beers
and a few tacos we both got a little
more comfortable with each other and
started talking a bit about friendship
and what it really means and then when
we got on the subject of making friends
as an adult thank you she said something
that really struck a chord with me and I
haven't really forgotten about it I
guess the hardest part about making
friends is admitting that you want to
make new friends because you feel like
when you're an adult you should already
have friends and you should have already
found your place in the world but really
you
know what's going on at all and that's
okay right there that's when she nailed
it and she's right the only thing that
really gets in the way of making new
friends is ego I mean nobody really has
this figured out so I decided to
start calling back the new friends I've
made because I realized that that was a
lot scarier than meeting new people
meeting new friends was starting to feel
easy and that's when I got a call from
Jesse in Echo Park native who was
looking for a Soph on Craigslist and
found me instead
after a few tacos we hit it off
immediately I learned something
important from all my new friends I
realized that it's just not that weird
to call a friendly looking dude on a
flyer
it pays to just put yourself out there
and you know make the connection and
yeah new friends have perks
you're filming yeah oh man I want you
guys to wait a minute wait I'll grab
this and you grab that then you grab
that now grab this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
