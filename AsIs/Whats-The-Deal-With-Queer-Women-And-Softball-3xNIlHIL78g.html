and I want to know if softball really is
a queer sport by my appearance I'm not
too great at sports I told this to
someone the other day and he went would
you like really good it's opal confused
I took the internet and discovered that
if you're a woman who plays softball
people are gonna think you're a homo our
queer woman better at softball and
straight women do more queer women lay
softballs and straight women to get to
the bottom of this I decided to attend a
BuzzFeed softball game one so that I
could ask other people their thoughts on
the stereotype and two so that I could
potentially bring the game home for
everyone there hi I'm Jen I am here at
the BuzzFeed softball game with my
teammate Ryan Ryan do you identify as a
queer woman negative do you think you
would be better at softball if you were
a queer woman uh which queer woman I
don't know know any of them Ellen are we
winning or losing
I don't were winning which is rare for
us do you think we're doing better
because I'm here yes absolutely yeah
mmm-hmm oh I'm up we got to go is
softball a queer sport the only piece of
evidence we have is that I am killing it
right now
look at this team they love me
unfortunately my good performance was
short-lived the game is over we didn't
win we didn't lose we tied ten to ten
which means that the results were
inconclusive
and we need to investigate further after
pondering BuzzFeed's disappointing tie I
decided to speak with some players who
were a bit more experienced than me my
coworkers
there are a lot of stereotypes that
surround female athletes but I think I
get softball players in particular and
some of them are that the sport is full
of queer people I didn't have some
experience where there was just like all
lesbians or all this all that we're a
varied group of girls but a variety I've
played with straight girls and lesbians
I think like anything it's just people
like to perpetuate these kind of myths
there are a lot of career women playing
softball but I wouldn't say it's any
more than women's basketball it goes in
every sports direction because you spend
so much time together and I feel like a
lot of people you know take that
friendship to the next level and that's
kind of how it happens you're with them
all the time if Julie is correct and
queer women don't play softball more
often than they play say basketball it's
still unclear where softball players are
more frequently accused of playing for
the other team
unless of course queer women really are
better at softball I decided to test
this theory again with a larger sample
size I took a team of queer girls and a
team of straight girls to the batting
cages to see who's really the best hey
everybody I'm here with the three
members of rainbow power incidentally
our career tools team Tigers the
straight team there is a stereotype that
queer women are better at softball they
play sophomore more often there was a
girl in my school that played softball
everyone thought she was a lesbian big
reveal
she's strength how do you think you're
all gonna do
I'm really scared I don't like balls
these ones the first contestant for the
Tigers is up to bat now her name is
holly she's going to kick ass
let's do this first up for team rainbow
power is Kelsey Jones
Linda barsy a number two from the Tigers
is about to go up to bat contestant
number two from team rainbow power Gaby
Dunn is up now Jenny the last contestant
for the Tigers it's up to bat now Karen
is the third and final batter or in BO
power our victorious team also
incidentally our queer team how do you
guys feel right now feeling pretty good
you guys want to go top some kids yeah
that's it that's our like listen to
Tegan Sara or yep sounds like she's not
in hero who's Tegan and Sara never know
what
at the end of the day yeah the queer
girls were a little bit better than the
straight girls in the batting cages but
regardless of sexuality we were all
really bad oh we're all gonna die in
fact the only conclusion I'm comfortable
making is that no matter who you are you
can still suck at sports and we did
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
