commercial came on and I started crying
because the people in the commercial
were finally getting a good night's
sleep one time I was on my period and I
was like oh my gosh and I want
McDonald's so I drove to McDonald's at
10:55 and breakfast stopped at 11:00 so
by the time I went to put in my order
the woman was like breakfast has stopped
it's 11 o'clock and I started bawling
hysterically and I was like does
breakfast just disappear at 11:00 a.m.
and then I drove away one time on my
period I cried just because I thought a
burrito was so beautiful my sister took
our 11 year old tug on a walk by the
beach and when she came home she told me
that no one had offered to pet him and
he loves people so I imagine that he was
devastated by this and so I cried
because no one wanted to pet my dog I
was driving home from school one time
but I really hate country music and all
the stations were playing commercials
except for one and it was playing
country music and I hated it so much
that I cried I showed all my friends the
movie Meet the Parents and while we were
watching it they're just all making fun
of it and I got so frustrated when I was
trying to defend it that I started
crying I was drunk and on my period for
this we're at this like div' bar and
they had that game like Big Buck Hunter
which is my brother started playing it
and I just started like weeping and they
were like what is wrong with you and I
was like we just have like a really big
issue with gun control in America he had
to take me home afterward one time I
called my mom at one o'clock in the
morning hysterically crying asking how
to get rid of a giant cockroach in my
bathtub one time on my period I asked
him a mom to buy me cocoa puffs from the
market and then when she came home I
excitedly helped her unpack everything
and then everything was put away and
there were no cocoa puffs and I went mom
what about the cocoa puffs she was like
oh honey I forgot and I just sobbed I
was at the airport flying home and I
went to the sandwich
to get a sandwich and I really don't
like onions so I ordered a sandwich I
was like yeah I'll have turkey and
cheese but please no onion and I walked
away with it to go eating somewhere else
and I open it up and there's onions on
it and I was like and so I took it
back and I was very politely like excuse
me I ordered this sandwich with no onion
I got it back and I opened it up and
there were still onions in it and I was
like in this big Airport cafeteria and I
just started crying because I hate onion
so much and it really felt like the end
of the world when I was in third grade I
put a piece of gum underneath the desk
and I felt bad but then three weeks
going on my period I remembered and I
felt bad again and then I started crying
I turned 25 in November</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
