so popular because how do you have sex I
mean you guys walk around while you have
sex what's the problem
hi everyone it's me Santino muha and we
are answering more of your questions
about what it's like to be in a
wheelchair today we're answering
questions about love dating and yes and
I want to remind you that these are all
very personal answers I do not speak on
behalf of everyone in a wheelchair I am
only speaking on behalf of myself do you
think there are any advantages to dating
in a wheelchair yeah if you date me
we're gonna get really great parking at
sporting events and also really great
tables sometimes I don't even need a
reservation do your dates ever offer to
push you around in the wheelchair as
opposed to letting you do it yourself
does this make you feel angry or awkward
no not angry or awkward I actually like
when a guy offers to push but if a guy
just starts pushing me then I think
that's weird right because would you
ever just go up behind a girl that
you're dating and pick her up and start
carrying her has a guy ever been able to
pick you up and almost cradle you what
do you do when your date says they want
to take you someplace you know is not
wheelchair friendly I'm like oh it sucks
because now I have to tell this guy we
can't stay here
on a first date I don't want a guy to
think I'm high-maintenance well I mean I
it's not that I'm not happy then you
know but it's like I'm not
high-maintenance because of the
wheelchair how awkward is a blind date
for you blind dates are awkward so it's
that awkward do you like it when a guy
gives you more attention because you're
in a wheelchair well if I'm attracted to
the guy weird sex question
weird sex question illegal sex question
alright I guess I guess it's time to
answer the big question can you have sex
everybody wants to know how do you have
sex when you're in a wheelchair it's
like I get on a bed typically and I you
know do people have trouble making a
move on you what are we talking are we
talking put your arm around me are we
talking like swing me around you know
throw me up on a countertop that's
different but you can put your arm
around me and then we'll talk about the
countertop stuff later
does your wheelchair ruin the romance
okay here's from experience what I can
tell you I dated a guy one time and he
lived with me and the wheelchair I think
kind of did I'll contribute to our
demise because he was helping me so much
around the house that it almost started
to feel like he worked for me but I have
other friends in wheelchairs who you
know their boyfriends are helping them
with personal stuff and it works out
great but just I think keep the lines of
communication open because you don't
want to be in a situation where you're
asking too much of somebody and you
don't even know that it's too much right
so just just talk about it
look dating is tricky bit or not so if
you are in a wheelchair then don't give
up if you're not dating someone you can
totally do it and if you're attracted to
somebody in a wheelchair but you're not
sure if you can date the person I say
give it a try it's probably not as
different as you're thinking there's
gonna be stuff that comes up for sure
but I mean telling one relationship you
were and where stuff didn't come up
you didn't mean or where it was easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
