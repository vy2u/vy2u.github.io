her she was with me when I worn my
medals when I cross the finish line in
Ironman when I start with my girlfriends
when I broke out with them and so after
my second Olympic game when I won four
gold medals I gave a lecture for kids
and one of them asked me would you give
up your medals to see again I realize in
that moment
blindness wasn't wasn't an issue I did
what I've done in my life because I'm
blind and that was a gift
the day I realize gala has to retired
that day was very hard for me I mean I
remember was Sunday and I woke up in the
morning I call her because she needs to
go out every dog loves that moment in
the morning he wants to go out they need
it and I start calling her CD camera
saying gala cam gala let's go and she
didn't move in that moment I realize she
can't do it anymore when someone retires
they're happy the first days because
they don't have to work but after a
while they feel they don't have this
that purpose in their life so they feel
lost and Gail experienced the same
things it's a little bit hard for gala
now because gala always wants to help me
so when we are walking I'm a little bit
lost and I'm trying to find the door
i'ma tell Adele Adele find the door gala
she just walk in front of us because she
knows which door I'm trying to find
because she was there before and she has
a great memory so I feel like gala wants
to help but at the same time she's so
happy because she loves to be with us
and she's not working which is great is
perfect so all things gala has given to
me the best way to give her back is just
help her to have the happy life and
healthy life so I'm trying to give her
the best food I'm trying to give her the
best bread so she can feel comfortable
in her bed and play with her every
single day because that's very important
for her
some of the best people I've met in the
last seven years was through gala when I
was walking with a cane what happened is
when I move it to one side another that
pushed people away but the dogs bring
people to be and that's what I love to
me nine months to decide to retire her
because she's not only my leader dog
she's part of myself she share a lot of
moments with me and I know she's gonna
have a good life and she's still with me
but it's not the same I wouldn't say
Gayle as a senior dog even if she's not
working anymore I don't want to think
about her in that way because that means
she's in the end and I think it's just a
new beginning for her without a little
dough yeah where would you be in your
life and in the poof
class everything will be definitely
different if I Wow
that's a good question
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
