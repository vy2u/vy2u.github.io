if you're not asexual you probably do to
guys girls I don't know if you know this
but there are a lot of hot people out
there I can hear the slut-shaming now
but having lots of sex isn't bad you
just have to be safe and if you haven't
been tested in the last three months I
don't with you but let me back up
there are a few key steps to a
successful hookup first you want to make
sure you're clean and be thorough
someone's going to be up close and
personal with your body
it's just thoughtful next comes the
pregame do something that makes you feel
comfortable and confident a fun pregame
sets the tone for how the rest of the
night will go and about alcohol drinking
is a social lubricant it's to help you
loosen up if you need it but going out
is not about getting really drunk it's
about having an experience that appeals
to your senses on a primal level and
tonight it's about sex
here's a secret a lot of people don't
realize being nice is the easiest way to
get someone to go home with you no games
no nagging a genuine compliment can get
you so far and it's not that I'm against
relationships it's just not what I want
right now all right take note see those
sheets fanciest right also notice
how the room is not too dark or too
light lastly and most importantly when
it's over no sleepovers but sometimes
there's an off night it's times like
these when Grindr becomes your best
friend Kenny yeah hi I'm August nice to
meet you
do you want a drink sure
oh you're like making a drink yeah here
Thanks
whoa I'm nervous I can tell I'm sorry no
we can just talk if you want it's just
that I've never done this before done
what before well I've had sex I've just
never done the whole Grindr hookup thing
really never well I did just get out of
a serious relationship
Wow well how do you do it though like
how do you just hook up with someone and
have it not mean something I mean sex
doesn't have to be a big deal you know
like it can be meaningful and great even
with someone you never see again I mean
all it is is two people or more agreeing
to do this intimate thing together
you're in your head too much come on
where are we going a bedroom
this is
oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
