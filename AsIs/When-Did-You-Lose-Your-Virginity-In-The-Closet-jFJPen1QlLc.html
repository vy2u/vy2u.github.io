I wish that's where our virginity's was
yeah and they're all in here oh it
smells bad hi welcome in the closet show
we talk about things that matter to you
we bring people into this closet they
leave a little bit thirstier maybe a
little bit sicker because I am sick so
is Nikki today we are going to discuss
losing our virginity's I think sex is
kind of complicated I'm going to be
talking about it from the perspective of
a lesbian with another lesbian my good
friend jazz is here Jasmine you want to
come into the closet right about now
we're gonna talk about popping some
cherries oh yeah yay Jasmine why don't
you tell us a little bit about yourself
I'm jasmine um you can call me Jasmine
and she and how she and her yah we have
matching furs and matching sexualities
which means we're here to talk to you
about sex for me growing up sex was
always framed as something that happens
between a cisgender man and a cisgender
woman and that sex occurs when they do
things with their you know their p NORs
intervenors I think it was always
obvious that it was between like a penis
and a vagina but the big thing was that
it was really special like you couldn't
wait to just be with that person I'm
sorry she's wrong her signing sexiest
I've ever film how old were you when you
lost your virginity and also how would
you define losing your virginity as a
queer woman if I'm talking emotionally I
was like 17 or 18 if I'm talking
physically I cannot give a number
I don't think does that make sense but I
know like with my first girlfriend I
know I was in love with her it was I was
in love and we were intimate and that
was that when you're a queer person and
like your sex looks different than what
you might be seeing in
you know the 1970s sex ed films then I
think the definition of when you've lost
your virginity is harder to define
because you don't totally know what
counts where is it coming from
oh so when did you lose your fortunately
I was 19 with a girlfriend
we were dating I knew she wasn't a
virgin I felt like I was late to having
sex at 19 so I thought that the fact
that I hadn't had to be some
embarrassing thing which I now know it's
not for me like to figure out what would
be acceptable I like went to the
Internet but I feel like there should be
a class and after-school special
learning only about heterosexual sex in
high schools like learning about only
white history
oh okay takeaways people it
here the thing sex is confusing but if
you talk about it it might be a little
less confusing and it's okay
have questions yeah don't act like you
know what you're doing because no one
does much so this episode we can play
truth or gay
we can play truth or kiss what if those
are rugs I hope they're not okay so the
game is called spin the bottle you asked
a really personal question and then you
spin and whoever it lands on has to
answer that question because we're not
going to kiss because this is a
workplace marry kill the cast of
the hour just because I'm watching it
right now hey you you got a yes answer
myself yeah you okay yeah I
would kill Tina I would marry Tasha I
would no just kidding
I would Benjamin with a Mary Helen off
so you would who Tasha
each bucket Asha Mary Helena and you'd
kill I'd marry Bob okay she's married
 Tasha Mary bet
Mary bet Cal Tina fell Tina I stand
strong with this answer right goodbye
Tina should we should we get out of the
closet Jasmine's at time for us to leave
the closet it's time for me to leave of
course okay I'm gonna come with you you
