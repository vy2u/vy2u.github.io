decide in the moment and then it's like
oh I'm out of control and it just
happened kind of a thing I wouldn't go
on a date with someone if I didn't see
myself having sex with them so the
minute that I like see them and they
start talking to me that's what I'm like
it could happen well first I do it after
I know that they want to do it to in the
moment that's how it usually happens
it's just like you're hanging out and
they're like oh we're gonna go there
cool like let's do it I decide to have
sex with someone when I know I'm not
gonna regret it I think you know before
the date if you really like the person I
fall into that trap of like oh I don't
want to do it too soon because society
society even if I want to do it I think
all women know like from the bat like oh
he can get it like but then you don't
know that you're gonna give it to him
but then like it's gonna happen like in
that moment like on a date or something
you're like okay this is tonight that he
is in fact gonna get it
I'm not like four dates in I'm gonna
have sex like that I ever have a
Stephanie keg I've only engaged in sex
with people who I've dated for a long
time or like no really well alcohol
plays one of the largest roles in my sex
life I think be like recently for me
I've kind of been like set up I'm like
sex dates if that makes funny sense or
it's like what knew going into it like
we were gonna if waiting makes it more
special for you that that's totally fine
too
I mean you think about it in advance but
like actually making the decision
usually is like either like the kisses
or a little further into the kisses
that's that stigma or if you see doesn't
you soon they're not gonna want to see
you anymore
I honestly think that's why I do anyway
oh we danced together I guess you're
kind of cute oh we're going back to the
same place oh why not let's go there's
usually a pause in the hooking up and
then it's
a conversation at least for me where I'm
like this is gonna happen and also when
they consent always get consent consent
ice need you to act right so they can do
things
what's acting right just doing all the
things I want you to do and ice not
being creepy right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
