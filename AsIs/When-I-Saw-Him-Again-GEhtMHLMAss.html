okay the other night was horrible David
I mean he won't even talk to me about it
yeah it doesn't make him look great he
says that you're crazy and that he
barely knows you and you believe him yes
I trust him to marry him I guess I just
really needed to hear the story I just
need to I just need nowhere else I'd
always be wondering about it um are you
sure yeah okay
you can stop me at any point
um I hope that was a but a few weeks my
freshman year it was nothing serious you
know he was a senior it's one night we
went to his friend Sam's party
he was in the psych 101 class I was
taking and I thought he was so cute I
felt lucky you know it was fun we were
drinking whisky and dancing and he took
me to the bathroom to make out
god I was so naive like I thought this
guy just wanted to make out with me in a
bathroom but no obviously not do you
want to have sex and I was a virgin you
know I went with him so for a long time
I felt like well I put myself in that
position what could I have expected and
I didn't want to happen that way you
know drunk in the bathroom at a party so
I told him you know I said we could do
it later but he wasn't listening to me I
tried to leave and he grabbed my arm
he pulled me into this corner he locked
the door he turned on the faucet he
pushed me against the sink sometimes I
think like I could have moved right then
but I froze completely it was paralyzed
and you he has made up his mind he's
gonna have sex with me you know rape
wasn't even in my vocabulary as a thing
that could happen to me with that fear
the the feeling of knowing it was about
to happen still what I remember the most
um he turned me around
I've heard so much that I just kept
staring at this handprint on the mirror
wondering who's what you know was it
mine was it someone else's how long had
it been there you know anything to
distract me from what was happening and
finally I you know I could talk again
and they started screaming than he
um I just
I don't know what I'm gonna do don't
know I mean David doesn't even think he
did anything wrong it just it doesn't
sound like something that David would do
yeah but you know I mean even I couldn't
call it a rape until many therapists
later I really didn't want to hurt you I
just saw him and I got so mad again
maybe I should have said anything
I know I should've known I there was a
time and this is like a really long time
ago where I just didn't feel him
listening to me and they were dating
like we were having like sex all the
time but he just liked him stop and I
thought he was just warning me
so um we kept on dating and it's not
like it's not like your situation I'm
sorry that happened to you it's nothing
it's it's nothing it's nothing
it was something
hey hey uh you still want to try that
new Italian place tonight yeah let's do
it

story okay so I should set this down
