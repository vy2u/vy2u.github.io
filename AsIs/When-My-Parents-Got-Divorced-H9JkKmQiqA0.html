came to me and told me they were getting
divorced
I've actually been through two divorces
in my life my parents separated when I
was about six my parents got divorced
simply because they didn't get along
anymore I was 2 years old when my
parents first got divorced my parents
have been married for 40 years and
they're getting divorced this year the
first divorce that was like my dad that
was the guy that you know I'm half of
and not seeing him the way that I saw
him growing up was really strange I
thought if my dad like wasn't my dad
when my mom told me that my dad was
moving out I was in disbelief it was
almost like I put up this wall of denial
my dad didn't live at home he moved to
Miami most of our conversations from
that point on we're on the telephone he
recognized something's different and
then you're confused about what's
happening and then you go okay like try
it you're trying to figure something out
and maybe you still haven't figured it
out but you're angry about it because
it's different and then you're wondering
like is this different bad or is it good
and you're not sure but then you're
wondering if you had something to do
with it wasn't just about them getting
divorced it was about my whole family
being broken up mom talked about dad a
lot couldn't stand it I think I was like
a young teenager at the time and you
know I mean my advice if that's
happening is to you know respectfully
ask your parents not to discuss the
other person in front of you because
it's not healthy be like it makes you
feel like I felt different in terms
of putting myself out there with men
I am a humongous commitment-phobe
because of my dad I find it incredibly
hard to get close to a guy every day I
fight it's a struggle to not become like
my dad and follow into those footsteps
in those decisions and I feel like you
can too and you can better yourself and
you can wake up every day and make a
conscious decision to be a better person
and be who you want to be so we all have
these ideas of what we're supposed to be
doing and I think that that only
exacerbated you know the feeling of my
family is different or there's something
missing from my experience growing up
because my parents aren't together
through the winding road of life I've
realized that divorce is not so great
so if I can prevent that in my own life
and really take time to get to know
someone
everyone thinks that divorce is so
common and it's not a big deal and yeah
it is common but it is a big deal and it
can completely affect your life so you
need to stop being so like it doesn't
matter and actually talk about it and
actually accept that it's something
you're going through and it can be hard
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
