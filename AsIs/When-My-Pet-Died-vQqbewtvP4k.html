Nala I picked her out at the shelter
myself and a few years later we took in
Freddie my cat lived for a long time and
he was part of the family for a long
time we had blue for nine years and he
passed away last year when I was 22 she
was with me every step of the way every
breakup I had every problem I had every
test I took she was there
when I found out that we had to put both
dogs down I was away at college out of
state I didn't really know that they
were sick before because I was out of
state and I wasn't home and I wasn't
witnessing kind of the deterioration she
was having dementia and like he was
going into kidney failure and I just
like I couldn't let go that part of my
life I went on a trip to an improv
festival in Hawaii two days before I was
supposed to leave I got a call so I
realized that I was not going to get
back in time to say goodbye
I remember going home for like fourth of
July and seeing her and it kind of
knowing that it might be the last time
that I would see her and I always told
my parents that I wanted to be with her
when she died and I couldn't and I
picked up of this blanket and I held him
and I told him to be good that I'd see
him when I came home again and I hugged
him and I kissed him and put him back
down and I was lost too much seen it and
I wish I had known that he was sick then
because it would have taken more time
and so my mom put the cat on the phone
and he hadn't moved or spoken in a
couple days as soon as he heard my voice
he perked up and he started meowing and
he recognized my voice coming over the
phone and I told him that I loved him
and I said goodbye
it didn't feel real until I went home
and I like saw like where she used to
lay and stuff and she wasn't there
you're in that space that you're used to
sharing with them and it just feels
really empty it seems so silly when a
pet dies because like it's just this
animal this is this little thing that
means so much to you I don't know some
people say animals don't really have
spirits but I feel like they you know
they have to don't be afraid to get
another pet one day in the future like I
will have to deal with that loss again
but the stuff in the middle is so worth
it
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah that you don't know the
half</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
