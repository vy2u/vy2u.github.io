people you may know tab on Facebook it
felt like the closest to investigating a
crime scene that I've ever been that is
if I don't count the clockwork murder
that I make of my own memory every time
that I Drive down Colfax Avenue still I
sit in my living room and I sift for
clues click he is smiling and I see
myself caught in his teeth he's dancing
in some club in a city that I've never
been to click he is eating sushi over a
few beers with friends and I am under
his fingernails click I know that alley
click I kill the memory of that t-shirt
click this is an old photograph a baby
picture there's also an older man
presumably his father
they're both round and bright and still
smiling click he is cert lists and I see
my reflection in the weight-room
mirror hashtag beast mode selfie I call
him the wolf when I write about him the
wolf so as to make him as storybook as
possible the wolf when I'm right about
him which is to say when my memory
escapes the murderer when the internet
suggests it Facebook informs me that we
have three mutual friends
which is to say that he is people you
may know and that I in people you may
know and there are people that know and
people that don't know people that don't
know I want to know that I'm afraid to
let know and probably people that know
him that know of me that know the word
no no no nose a flock of sleeping sheep
sitting in my mouth and now now I know
the wolf's middle name and what he
listens to on Spotify and the
all-too-familiar company that he keeps
and he can no longer be a wolf for the
nameless grave that I dig for myself on
bad days we have three mutual friends on
Facebook and now it feels as if they are
holding the shovel 64 people liked the
shirtless Jim pick four people have told
me that they'd rather I said nothing two
police officers told me that I must give
his act a name or it didn't happen that
obviously I could have fought back which
is to say no one comes running four
young boys who cry rape when I told my
brother
he also asked me why I didn't fight back
Adam I am right now I promise every day
I write a poem titled tomorrow
it is a handwritten list of the people
that I know that love me and I make sure
to put my own name at the top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
