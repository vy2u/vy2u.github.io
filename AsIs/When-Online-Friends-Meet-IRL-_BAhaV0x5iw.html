picture man don't you like having the
time to come up with a response when
someone says something to you I just
like to think off the top of my head say
whatever comes to mind and that's you
okay but the first response that comes
to my head isn't always representative
of who I really am so
we're saying is the end I know is just
some curated version of a human being

leaving
what you're right about to break his
mistake you should post it on the forms
