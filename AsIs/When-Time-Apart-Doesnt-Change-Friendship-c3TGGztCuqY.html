so long since we talked sometimes life
can be so overwhelming you know we get
caught up in schoolwork and finding a
great career and dating and all the
pressure society puts on us that we
forget what's truly important friendship
the good news is I'm still weird I miss
having sleepovers in your basement every
Saturday and staying up all night
talking I miss laughing so loud into our
pillows that your mom would come down
and yell at us every time she stormed in
we would pretend to be asleep
I miss how you used to sing all the
songs on the radio at the top of your
lungs with lyrics that were completely
wrong remember when we used to go to the
movie theater and order the large
popcorn you always spit the kernels out
in the middle of the movie at other
people it drove me nuts
remember that one summer you tried to be
a skateboarder you had so many scratches
you must have kept band-aid companies in
business
I don't see you anymore but I want you
to know I still think about you all the
time the memories we shared are some of
the best moments of my life even though
we're far apart you're still close to my
heart
I love you stay weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
