starts freaking out so I have to sleep
through the second-floor window to get
out you can no joke oh it's amazing
it really is what about YouTube a good a
first-time story
the same really
painful and unmemorable I feel that
thank God it gets better
no stop stop
only have you conversations for brunch
let's get drunk I just don't understand
my sex is so painful for me um
there's Lube past sexual trauma dilators
just you know you tried relax just relax
relax so how does it feel to be a
cannibal cannibal a chicken eating a
chicken pretty messed up if you ask me
and I'm a chicken because you haven't
kissed me yet
the very first time
try a different position physical
therapy let's run some other tests just
to be clear no sexual trauma okay yeah
Luke dilators be a glass of wine you
tried relaxing we're really hard to just
relax okay
endometriosis vulvodynia and vaginismus
there's no QR well I won't accept that
you have to forget me John you need a
woman who can give you the life you
deserve I don't want another woman you
hear me I want you damn it I want you
and they never have sex Sean my vagina
is often in a lot of pain especially
when penetrated it can be excruciating
what are you saying we may never have a
normal sex life and they'd never be able
to make love to you under the stars or
go at it like rabbits in an HBO limited
series what can you love me John can you
love a woman like me this whole
depression thing is getting kind of old
your whole life isn't dictated by sex
that's easy for you to say you're not
the one I seen your vagina every night
go out see your friends have fun why so
I can listen to them talk about their
relationship problems and try not to
think about my vagina so you can get a
real man who doesn't give a damn about
your condition there is no kind of
attitude well I don't want to live with
this the rest of my life
so how can I expect someone else to want
to you have no idea what this is like to
think about your future and see yourself
alone and then pain be dramatic she's
right
I can't keep disappointing people and I
can't keep spending thousands of dollars
on physical therapy hoping for a cure
that doesn't exist just stop hoping
start living you are not your pain
we should get it done what's the best
you have right now bring that syrup over
oh you never told us about that date you
happy relieved yeah it was fun just fine
yeah I mean nothing special girl you
never give us details fill the tea yeah
I mean where did you go
what did you do when did you come after
I go on dates y'all can't get me to shut
up I actually told him that I can't have
sex with him so it was a little downhill
from there why would you do that I mean
because it's true I can't it's really
painful for me is that because of your
condition yeah
shoo I mean I knew it made your periods
bad but I didn't know it affected your
sex life like that yeah honestly it
affects everything
my sister she has something similar she
was to a support group or sometimes
y'all should meet I think he'd be really
helpful yeah that'd be great
yeah thank you
o-cedar up
what if I break your heart how did I
break yours first how about no one
breaks anyone's heart and I get doing
that person or all that leather and
layers of self defense even though we
might never have conventional sex I've
never been very conventional even though
I'm a bundle of anxiety when it comes to
intimacy I like you tomorrow
I'm not going anywhere
this doesn't hurt does it it's super
painful but you play your cards right
you can have a nice later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
