Mexican restaurant okay oh I chose last
time so um seriously fine either way you
have to like one more than the other
I like both the same oh my gosh okay
I've been meaning to do this for a while
hi can you bring someone over right away
please thank you love hello miss
Davenport hi who is this
he's worried that we're sleeping with
each other he also judged me the second
I walked in anything sees about an inch
taller than me that excites him because
he thinks he's a little bigger
downstairs but this is a professional
boyfriend translator he's gonna help us
get through this conversation what the
hell so would you like to go to the
Mexican restaurant yeah Mexicans great
whatever I do not want to go there see I
knew it
okay fine I don't feel like going there
I had a really rough day at the office
the Mexican food place is a little too
far and I was just trying to avoid an
argument why didn't you just say that
okay
also there's like a waiter there that's
way too hot oh you notice you're like
that huh no I can't help it if I have an
appreciation for human form and I for
symmetry okay I like that you're kind of
possessive but you really need to
communicate with me more hang out
through that I want to agree with you
but I was kind of zoning out too busy
thinking about who would win in a game
of three-on-three basketball pack of
wolves are a pack of sharks oh my god
Kevin this is serious if you don't
communicate with me this relationship is
gonna fall apart
okay I'm sorry it's just I really like
you and I'll be better about it I'm
sorry I'm really trying to make this
work also I think a wolf would win nine
out of ten times unless the match was
under water
Thanks so thought is then cool I don't
want to go to the place either did
not work anything okay it's just
sometimes it's nice to go somewhere that
makes you happy right the last time we
went to five I got diarrhea you should
be able to talk to me about health
issues yeah I know
I didn't want you to think I was weak I
wouldn't think you were weak
everybody gets diarrhea I'm actually
touching her right now
your diarrhea is the first time I've
ever looked at someone and thought I
could say I love you most of the time I
play it safe and just say nothing at all
Oh Kevin I love you too
I love you too I really want to get it
on right now I get it on - okay do you
know what he do oh hey man do you mind
some space he wants me to watch his
words not mine
