Adele's new album
I think she's outdone her last album to
be honest controversial but true Nick
have you listened to Adele's new album
no I haven't sorry why not
I just haven't why do you hate Adele no
I don't hate her I think she's an
amazing singer it's just a little too
depressing for me what do you have
against empowering women wait what are
you a sexist no no no no holy no
the next thing you're gonna say is you
don't like Beyonce Nick can I talk to
you Nick
sit down now did you read your
employment contract before starting here
at all no I decided so I can move out of
home and buy a fish tank so typical of
you to talk about yourself greeted again
all employees must love Adele me
there it is look if you want to continue
your employment here you need to accept
it sorry I was listening to Adele on the
way to this meeting you need to accept
Adele into your life understood
everyone Nick has an announcement
I like Adele prove it
I love Adele oh oh oh
hello it's me
I'm here to tell you I'm sorry for
everything that I've done
the does happened</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
