born in Lima Peru I was adopted by
parents from New York and they're both
Caucasian and clearly I'm not I'm the
youngest of four and we're all adopted I
have a Filipino sister white brother and
a half black sister and our parents are
white my entire family is white and I'm
black my mom's side of the family is
white and my dad's is Indian my mom is
100% Mexican and my dad is by Mary Lee
Scottish my dad is Danish and my mom is
Indian I am the father to two children
mixed-race married to an Indonesian
woman who I met in college and we've
been together now for a long time I
think in elementary school everyone we
like why are you a different color than
your mom and I was like what are you
talking about and then it kind of hit me
like wait something's up people would go
to my dad in front of me like Oh like
your mother she must be Asian because I
look like an Asian kid when I was
younger he's like no and thankfully he
was very quick on explaining what
adoption was even at a young age for me
so from the get-go they were definitely
like my mom and dad for sure I mean
there was four of us and we asked a lot
but it always started with like well
your birth mom loved you very much but
she couldn't take care of you we really
wanted to have a kid and we were lucky
enough to find you which is a great way
of explaining doesn't really touch on
the fact that we look different but it
touched on the fact that you're loved
which is the most important part I
didn't really know the word race when I
was a little kid I just knew that my mom
was brown and my dad was white my mom
loves talking about how white her kids
look she likes to make fun of us for it
in elementary school kids would tell me
that I was adopted that it's impossible
for me to have a white mom because I
have brown skin when I got older I would
be out with my dad and people would say
like
that guy that you're with and I was like
that's my dad why would you assume that
he was anything else and then I was like
oh yeah because he looks nothing like me
people have commented on my children
and they're saying oh that's a good mix
you got there unless I want to start
fighting everybody or correcting
everyone which I imagine I'll do down
the line I just kind of see whatever it
gets like tiring sometimes like
explaining it to people my brother's
really good friend was like so confused
about it and my brother convinced him
that my dad was half black and that's
why I was black my white brother really
identified with like the ghetto culture
live like that kind of lifestyle and my
parents got into parenting me against
that a lot of times in my mind that
wrapped up to them keeping me away from
my being too much of a black guy more
than not feeling black I feel like I
don't fit in anywhere for a long time I
just wanted to fit in so I got angry I
got angry at myself and I was upset and
my parents for not teaching me enough
about being Indian or being white I
don't even know how the topic came up
but I asked some you know well what are
you a Latina Asian black whatever my
daughter said specifically uh she was
white and then I asked my son the same
thing and he said the same thing my wife
and I correct them very quickly
your mother is an immigrant from
Indonesia your father is the son of
immigrants from Central America you are
not white and from then on we've had
some some legacy of some interesting
conversations on on ethnicity race
cultures all of that the only thing that
really gets me is when people say oh but
you're basically white right which
doesn't really make sense to me because
if I were the exact same mix that I am
but just looked more brown people might
say the exact opposite it has nothing to
do with how I was raised
or the cultures that I grew up in or you
know sort of like how I feel it's hard I
think when people find out that my
family's white they're just like well
like you're not really black and I'm
like what does that mean like last time
I looked in the mirror like I did
we black because I look how I look
people will come up and just start
speaking Spanish very quickly and then I
have to say you know I'm sorry I don't
speak Spanish and they get mad at me
they get very mad you know it kind of
does make me sad that part does make me
sad cuz I really do wish I spoke Spanish
but I don't and in terms of like not
feeling a part of something like my
parents made me feel part of the family
but I really feel unfortunately
disconnected from my actual culture it
is weird falling into this middle ground
because you feel like you always have to
identify with one or the other like you
have to choose a side and that you can't
just be what you are I think it's
interesting for my generation of kids
growing up in multiracial families to
sort of have to go through like the last
wave of misunderstanding and I'm sure
there's going to be new obstacles there
always are but in my mind it's getting
so much better and it's so much more
normalized which is really exciting
honestly like I'm hopeful
it's here it's here
what get it get it they're fine I got it
get it get it and get it it's here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
