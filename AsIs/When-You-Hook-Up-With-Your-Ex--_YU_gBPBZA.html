and I feel like a fool out in the
rafters

town uh maybe we'll see don't grow your
feelings back man that was six months
ago
okay I mean it might be awkward but if
you like we should see each other do you
think anything's gonna happen I mean no
he's a girlfriend so I don't think so
have you looked his Instagram lately
I took a cigarette no that's fine so so
but it was like why would I be wearing
your shoes well I thought you're trying
to be funny
I think the concierge just left at that
point he was so done with us so that is
it - that is the cue ball that didn't
happen seriously hope to hope to see you
soon yeah wait
I feel
you rollin over
which to my desperately
wanna come over for a bit yeah I do I
just don't want to screw anything up
I don't think it well can't believe it's
happened yet okay so why Jane Sarah
break up she's a great girl
it's just you know not right for me
Oh Cho so just to be clear this between
us it's just you know one-time thing
I mean we live in different cities yeah
so what couldn't feasibly yeah I can't
broker okay maybe one more time
why do you look so guilty you just got
laid it's not bad I mean we said it was
like a one-time thing but I think we've
figured out life away from each other it
wouldn't make any sense so you guys were
just having fun right
yeah we were just reminiscing on the
past okay and the past is the past
period great I didn't think this was
gonna make me miss her so much analysis
