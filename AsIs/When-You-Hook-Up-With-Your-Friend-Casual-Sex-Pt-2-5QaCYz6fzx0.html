pictures in my guest bedroom would freak
you out so much yeah can't sleep with a
photographic cemetery just staring the
good news is that snoring will be kept
to a minimum so you want big spin or
little spin I think I prefer a little
spoon but it feels like society comes I
sit don't be gross
or I'll put up a pillow wall mom oh no
it's that's right
she like think we're dating wait now she
said she probably just thinks I'm on I
didn't not tell her that we weren't not
did you know tell her I'm gay yeah she
doesn't know what gay means what are we
now what are you doing I'm getting ready
to sleep in your weird childhood bedroom
no no I know that look number I'm not
giving a look I told you have casual sex
Amy with me dumbass come on it really
that crazy idea yeah is it the nest trip
I can crazy an idea
oh no you're serious okay
that guest bedroom at death is looking
real attractive wait no no no hey hey
look like what click look I'm don't make
this weird I'm making this way I'm
putting the nose strip back on oh I made
it weird
but like sexual preferences side aside
what are you putting it said you've
hooked up with a guy one guy in college

for you look what if you just like look
at me is like if you mean sexual oh
Jesus Christ

don't because that's how I look
do you know what
you wouldn't hook up with me anyways why
yeah cuz you shouldn't hook up with your
best friend
it's a rule earlier today you said you
have sex with a friend nice thing about
casual sex is that you can have with a
friend also you probably have a huge no
I said that acquaintances maybe but we'd
have to be on the same page to analyst
through the wicked soundtrack again
alright I guess I misinterpreted it yeah
clearly it would just be so fuzzy you
know it's like we already have so much
fun together we could still joke around
we could still hang out with each other
and play but then we could also do the
most fun most relaxing thing to adults
can do together have orgasms
no one will get hurt and no one's gonna
fall in love with anyone else and I'll
get over my ex-girlfriend and everything
will be perfect
no Chris that's not how it go at all
okay this is how it would go we both
have to be incredibly drunk because
that's the only way that's what ever
come up then we'd have sloppy and
coordinated sex
then we both of us very dissatisfied
really break up in the morning and
regret it completely friendship and no
longer be innocent platonic be ruined
forever so you want for things to change
didn't know buddy
