Hillary yeah you know if I don't get my
coffee I'm kind of like a zombie but not
like Walking Dead zombie like live from
eyes on them yeah yeah yeah hi I'm Tina
I knew hi I'm Sarah I'm you know can you
hold this for a second
yeah I'll be right back okay people this
is Tina I need to know everything about
her what she likes what she eats what
y'all bring in she's written and most
importantly a big question here is she
day what do you got through the company
database I found that her last name is
Haley which then I cross-referenced on
Facebook to figure out that she
graduated from USC in 2012 putting heard
about 25 or 26 years old okay
age-appropriate what else I found her
Twitter in her last tweet was I'm not a
bad person I just hope that anybody that
rides a hoverboard wipes out
she's funny I can work funny I ran her
name through this online generator and
her sugar name is Bettina ooh I don't
like that run again but what about the
big question is she gay she likes Ellen
everyone likes Ellen she likes taking it
Sarah now we're getting somewhere
anything else like any LGBT groups he
belongs to any movies you know like what
I'm a cheerleader imagine being you all
even take blast on any case she likes
living wild sufficient face that means
at least bicurious
but we need more does she like the l
word as you were dipping the bell but
she has several pictures with a girl
named Kara
is it a current girlfriend ex-girlfriend
just a friend
I can't tell god what is she the results
are inconclusive
I'm just gonna do by myself here you do
women uh just wondering it's just so sad
what's happening over there oh yeah you
don't know the half</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
