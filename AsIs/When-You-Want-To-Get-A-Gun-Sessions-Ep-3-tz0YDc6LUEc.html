wanted it hey do you wanna smoke mochi
balls go to 7-eleven no man I can't

what dude alright hey yeah I'm actually
just at the Walmart right now we're
about 20 Stuart I'm all right I'll be in
our driveway your driveway I have a gun
can you say something I'm just
processing okay you want to process out
loud okay before I moved here I was in a
relationship I was not that bad okay so
this is good no I mean looking back on
it now it was all bad but you know
that's saying about the monkey house
monkey house no person like you don't
know how bad the monkey house smells
until you're able to like step outside
of it mm-hmm
okay I mean we're not the monkey house
maybe in like a monkey and around hey I
thought I got that call back for the KFC
thing yesterday oh oh okay thank you
um but I didn't get it I didn't get the
part
Oh sucks but it's like you know just
because I didn't get the part doesn't
mean that I'm not good it just means
that I wasn't the right fit
yeah but them you know it's an
analogy Chris okay like all right um you
know when you're playing blackjack and
you have 16 you can either stay at 16
stay comfortable or you can you know bet
on it and risk it all to get 21 right
yes and that's what I'm doing um your my
21 okay you're not my 21
okay okay no first of all you don't know
if you stay on sixteen you see what else
is on the table my plays an idiot yeah
well she's not that dude you know
successful guy know if I can even dream
that one day I'd have a friend who let
me stay in his driveway no I'm not man I
mean paying rent is an accomplishment
for me alright look at Sean's life okay
so but that's just circumstances dude if
you want to be like Sean and lock into
one thing you can do that but honestly
if you want to do other things you can
do that too if you want to explore then
explore bro if you want to rage on top
of a mountain in Italy which sounds
awesome you should do that okay and if
you want to start a dope-ass business
I'm your dope ass business partner you
can do anything alright you can do if
you if you want to win a red carpet
premiere date with idina menzel you can
do that now yeah like honestly I think
if you just cut this part out and mail
it in and I have some stamps so I want
you to like get out there right
okay my friends rights activists are
really getting behind you they say you
wouldn't be able to stop them if you
don't carry a gun of your own thanks we
need a but I'm not a hero I'm just a man
and I want to use this opportunity to
say that I'm not for guns asshole
took my idea tell Obama and Trump don't
worry man no matter what anyone says
we're still gonna be able to get guns in
this country then we could finally just
be
back to you Joseph sometimes when we
want something so bad we make up
rationalizations of why we need it and
people compensate for what they don't
have like if you don't feel secure or
powerful or loved you look for an easy
fix
to fill that hole but I guess I wondered
how do you know when you really need
something I when you're just trying to
fill that void because there's something
wrong with you
first you have to know yourself
how much fun time do we have
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
