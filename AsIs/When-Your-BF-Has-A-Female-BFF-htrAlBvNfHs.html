sustainable way hey hey Kelsey Holly

William can I talk to you for a second
any other room so I'll he's over for
dinner she's my best friend and I wanted
you guys to the best friend

female friends I don't want anything el
friend you're really arrested two women
nearly a frat boy she's a snob she is
not a snob we'll do you remember when we
got those brie sandwich isn't that
better Oh God what was the name of that
driver who was telling us about Fran
Wow memories we did a semester abroad
together in Prague our junior year that
sounds magical yeah it was I think it
was probably my favorite trip I thought
our trip to Vegas was your favorite trip
favorite overseas trip he's always been
so indecisive oh I don't think so
well you probably just don't know him
that well yet tell me how are the men in
your life how is that going I'm single
I'm so sorry Oh are you sorry I don't
care cuz her ovaries are probably
drawing up no I mean I don't really want
kids and also I think I'm a lot younger
than you so look at that we are gonna
wine William will you help me get some
more wine please
there's actually two bottles on the
table
ideally you would be what up with this
with this what about your fact Charles
why not Charles Charles guy where's
transition lenses year-round he's not
actually creepy that's just a nickname
with me it is not a nickname it's a way
of life you're saying that your being
with ally because she wants to thank you
no dick she was all thanks well I get
what you're saying but do you actually
think Bernie Sanders is a viable can I
don't think Bernie is why do you think
that men and women can dress be friends
of course think I was talking to Ali you
know there's actually an article about
this in the Atlantic that I read
recently a lot of times in male female
friendships the guys I think that the
girls are into them so they have a hard
time we're just being true friends did
you hear that man always thinks that the
girl is enough oh if it's in an article
it must be true sorry well doesn't know
how to read articles are hard Bram this
could have been a great evening but
instead of showing me sympathy but it's
like to be a handsome man living in 2015
you ruined the evening fighting over me
what no well I cannot believe that he
thought that I might be into him I mean
we've been friends for 10 12 years like
I would rather you know always my friend
you're my girlfriend I don't want to
have sex with Ally rude what did you
think was gonna happen here some sort of
three-way situation I'm not a
fortune-teller I don't know what's gonna
happen you would be lucky oh he is lucky
oh please please you're amazing I know
but that's he now this is this is
ridiculous
okay I have to drink to the table with
him for 45 minutes
I was drunk our entire semester you know
sometimes I feel like I just can't win
you're pretty good listener creamy
Charles what about the time we bought
him replacing your toothbrushes
he needed a toothbrush kept them in a
ziplock bag marked treasures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
