and chill oh yeah he wants to bone
uh-huh I was really excited about
watching friends he's a no that's a no
that's a maybe probably not so once I
get Quinta for a birthday Justin you
haven't gotten her anything what it's in
three days actually listen he listed his
height a 6-1 which means actually five
eight which means is a pathological liar
which means you foggins you you know
when I'm like oh I don't want to make a
big deal of my birthday I still want
someone to acknowledge it in a nice way
it's just so hard to find a guy who just
wants to watch friends that was gonna
exist we all say we want to watch
friends but really Wow
Justin where are you taking her Chili's
yes yes it's her face not her favorite
Scorpius so I suggested we get dinner
and he responded saying can do dinner
maybe drinks later
yeah sounds like he just wants to bone
well when was last time you guys
watching Netflix and chill and you watch
Netflix all the time just don't chill
anymore I gotta get back in the wagon
chill maybe I should ask her to watching
friends well maybe just use her birthday
as an excuse to do something really
thoughtful
remind her what she means to you oh my
god Justin he sent me flowers he just
wants to bone I think this means he
wants a long-term relationship it sounds
like you wanna bone is that right you
can just say it if you want a bone you
can just say something about getting are
that a necklace from a Pinterest board
or whatever oh really
oh that's great that's perfect she'll
love that that's a good start
yeah you want a boat that's okay we
gotta go Danube oh I want to bone him
and then maybe never talk to them that's
a great plan yes he said you should do
that that's meat drag hello hey I'm
