might happen something that you can't
protect yourself from you can't even
admit it to yourself
I guess if your body can't protect
itself your brain tries to sometimes the
word know isn't one that everyone hears
we went to a bar for a first date he was
handsome in a way that intrigued me but
didn't intimidate me
he insisted on buying my drink and I
insisted we split it but before I could
even reach for my wallet his plastic
card was sliding across the bar it went
as well as first dates usually go we
revisited the small commonalities we had
things like family and the minor
stresses of our jobs he made a few jokes
that I thought were worth the small
laugh but gave a big one instead after I
finished my first drink
he bought me another
after the second drink he flagged on the
bartender for a third I could feel
myself getting tipsy getting uneasy I
was two vodka sodas in and drinking on
an empty stomach so I told him I should
call it a night
he made fun of my early curfew and asked
if I drove myself grazing my name of his
thumb I said I took an uber so he asked
if I needed a ride home I said no but
again
he said he wanted to make sure that I
got home safe I remember how he shot me
a toothy smile how I trusted him I
remember how in that moment I believed
him so I said yes
as we walked to the car I felt a pit in
my stomach though I couldn't pinpoint
why I reminded myself that he had done
all the right things when it came to
dating he showed up on time and told me
I looked beautiful he held the door he's
a nice guy right when we got into the
car I felt the space around me getting
smaller he put his hand on my leg and in
that moment I realized how alone we were
I realized we were still just two
strangers
when he pulled up to my house I told him
I was tired I told him he could pull
over and drop me off right there that
that would be perfect
he asked if he could come in for a quick
glass of water he said he was feeling
the few drinks he had and he didn't feel
like he could drive home just yet the
pit in my stomach was still there but I
told myself I was being crazy I told
myself I couldn't be responsible for a
drunk driver on the road I told myself
that it was fine that he was a nice guy
so I said yes and I let him inside
when we got inside I went to the kitchen
to get him a glass of water I wondered
if my roommate was home I wondered how
long he would stay
he took a sip of water and then wandered
towards my room without invitation his
barely touched water glass sitting on
the table when he got to my room he
touched the books on my shelf skimming
there back covers he turned a picture of
my sister and I over in his hands and
many moved towards me at first I let him
kiss me I let his tongue part my lips
and his hand rest on the small of my
back I told myself I would kiss him back
for a few seconds I told myself after he
kissed me after he was done he would
leave then his kisses got harder his
hands moved more quickly suddenly my
spine was hitting the doorframe suddenly
he was being too rough and as I tried to
pull back he pulled me towards him
harder I told him I'm tired I told him I
had my period I told him my roommates
home that I don't want to go any further
I told him to slow down but he didn't so
I closed my eyes and I wondered when he
would stop I wondered if agreeing to
have sex with him would be easier than
what the alternative could be I hated
myself for thinking it but as he pressed
up against me I thought maybe I should
just get it over with but I didn't get
it over with I wiggled and I shifted and
I moved his body off me I told him to
stop and he said it loudly him with
purpose and luckily finally he did stop
but they don't always and that's the
thing about nice guys you can't always
pick them out they have good haircuts
and they open doors they pay for your
drink and they laugh at your jokes and
they ask
your family but sometimes nice guys do
those things not because they're nice
not in the real sense of the word but
because they associate doing those
things with getting what they want or at
least deserving it I found out the hard
way that in modern dating that
translates to if I spend at least $50 on
you you better sleep with me I'm sick of
hearing about the friendzone and being
called a tease I'm sick of the unwritten
rule that if someone spends their time
or money on me that makes them worthy of
my physical affection maybe there will
be times when I'm just tired and maybe
there will be times that I'm on my
period or when my roommates home or when
the time just isn't right but maybe none
of those things will be true and you
know what I still don't need a reason
for saying no my body is my own it
cannot be bought for 3 drinks at a dimly
lit bar with flowers or tickets to a
show when I do say yes it will be
because I want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
