I've got you,
let's get some drinks,
and fuck Steve, you know?
- Yeah, man! No, I'm
good. A couple of drinks,
I'm not going to get drunk,
like, I'm not that girl.
I don't even care that much!
- No!
- Like, this was good.
- This is good, this is good.
(rock music)
- Let's take breaks in between.
- No, no, you're right, you're right.
- You want to play pool?
- Yeah.
- You love playing pool.
- Yeah.
- I think it's only like, a dollar too.
Did you just join Tinder?
- No, I didn't just--oh, my
god! That guy looks like Steve!
- Well, how's your little puppy?
- Steve loved puppies so much!
He liked music! (sobbing)
- [friend offscreen] Hey,
karaoke! Karaoke over here!
- Okay, yeah, let's do karaoke!
- ♫And I don't know the bartender
♫But I do because (stops singing)
you're stupid bartender, Steve!
What is his career? I don't even know you!
And you broke my heart,
and I've lost three pounds already, and...
(vomiting)
- 'Atta girl. Hey,
you're good, you're good!
Yeah, fuck Steve, huh?
- I love you.
- I love you, too. I do. No,
no. We're not getting close.
- (slurred) I need a burrito.
- Okay, get the rest up.
(vomiting)
Oh, my god.
