you don't actually know how to parent
until after you've parented this is a
series where we show real live everyday
parents different scenarios and ask them
how they'd respond if it happened in
their life because when it comes to
parenting we're all kind of asking what
the would you do I am a mother of
an adorable - you're a little boy I'm a
father of a seven-year-old the parents -
two-year-old Eli and four month old Lou
I've been a parent for five years
already
since I was 16 I've been planning for 14
years we have two kids uh almost
four-year-old and an almost one year old
Cindy I just cannot deal with this LA
traffic anymore it drives me nuts I know
I I just can't do it I can't deal with
this it starts at three o'clock in the
afternoon and doesn't end till 8:00 are
you kidding me yeah thanks Phyllis
all right here we go I think this is the
move I won I won games over are you
 me Uncle Matt
what do you do uh Wow cursing what would
I do if he said are you kidding me we
would probably just start laughing
honestly I have been through this it is
so funny I can't help but laugh I think
it depends on the like situation you're
in I'll say like if we're at home I'd
probably react a little differently than
like if we were in public give a
half-hearted no that's not good is that
work you cannot say that I grab my son
by his face when he's in trouble and get
the serious eyes and I say you do not
ever say that word again
and who did you hear that from you have
to understand that it's all your fault
we're pretty bad at this look you just
try your best I mean as parents we do
have this tendency to curse all right
guys that was interesting let's see
scenario number two oh gosh oh baby oh
baby oh yeah what do you got I got quick
Liddy you got to have quick reflexes
okay ah that hasn't happened yet this
may have happened a couple weeks ago
that never happens to me this is this
happens more than anything I just don't
think I ever envision that happening but
it could but it could happen it's a huge
fear um you stop daddy and I are
wrestling and having such a good time
and we didn't know you're gonna walk in
that we're playing prob'ly with the H
that are cross it up right now
hipsters for a snack yeah I think that
was yeah this doesn't happen before but
once they can get out of the toddler bed
and go wherever there just isn't work
privacy we lie come on
we live I critique well that was their
thoughts let us know in the comments
what you would do about those scenarios
and if you've got any parenting
conundrums that you want us to weigh in
on we're here for you on what the
would you do
parenting is hard
