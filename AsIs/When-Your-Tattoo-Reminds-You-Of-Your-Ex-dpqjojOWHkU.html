this girl just right below my belly
button and above my wiener he got my
initial in Morse code and I got his
initial in Morse code
we had it done in like opposite risk so
like they would touch when we were
holding hands it's so cheesy we moved in
together and everything was great for a
couple months and then I discovered that
he had another girlfriend I had a friend
come over and she was like we need to
take care of your tattoo first diamonds
can only be broken by another diamond
it's the hardest rock in the world it
reminds me that you know I got out of
that relationship and I learned so much
when I was about 16 years old I was
seeing a girl I really should not have
been seeing broke things off with her
but I was still riddled with guilt I
wanted to remind myself to always be
true to myself so of course I got the
tattoo Veritas which is Latin for truth
but was also in the hit movie Boondock
Saints I eat burritos and drink beers so
thankfully it's kind of hidden below my
belly so I don't have to worry about it
that much we have been dating for almost
a year and we got into our very first
argument he went you know what I don't
want to be a boyfriend anymore and we
broke up from one of my really good
friends and took really good care it was
a really really fantastic friend I said
I need you to give me a ride and he said
where and I said to the tattoo parlor
while I was depressed I started reading
a lot of Charles Bukowski and he has a
poem called Bluebird now it really
mostly reminds me of this amazing
friendship I had with my and have with
my friend he was the kind of friend I
wish everybody would have last-ditch
effort was to maybe get a tattoo to
symbolize the ever-burning love that we
had for each other which still didn't
exist and a few weeks later the
relationship ended
I met my fiancee she was sick of seeing
that tattoo for a while her name was
right here which then I had to get this
cloud concoction thing luckily you can
go over mistakes in the past five years
ago by we're kind of roommates at that
point we're like on the couch
our laptops watching something and I was
like I think we should break up he said
okay what do you want me to do and I was
like well if I could keep the apartment
because we live together almost the
whole time he had been in New York I was
like you know take as much time as you
need and then it took him a long time so
when he finally moved out I wanted to
celebrate it so I got this silly
tombstone tattoo that says alone again
people were like what happens when you
get a new boyfriend I was like well
you're still going to be alone again
when you die it's kind of like my own
personal joke</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
