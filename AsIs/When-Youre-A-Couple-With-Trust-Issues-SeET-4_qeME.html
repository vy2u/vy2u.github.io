Charles he's gonna murder rape you
 again with creepy Charles I've
been $45 I
I'm ridiculous he's still sending you
edible arrangements every week it's
still an issue you don't trust me I
trust you I just don't trust other men
listen I've been a single guy I know the
fun you don't trust me to know who to
trust and who not to trust that's like
the same thing okay I'm not trying to
piss you off but you've put me in an
impossible situation either I go with
you and I look like a jealous asshole to
you and all your friends or I don't go
and I look like a lazy asshole well
which is it we can come back here but
yeah no really we can like to cook that
up you can I actually once put that in
um I made hot toddies at a campfire shut
up yeah just it's just it's natural
stuff that girl's right because I know I
know the area so well oh my god see I am
so glad we did this
I have not been outside and smelled the
air I mean like I feel like I'm popping
up a breeze can it's really good cheese
sorry it's really not good at this are
you know I never got a tie huh okay

tent camp fire yes cook yes I make some
drinks drinks first drinks first yes

didn't realize you come to this gym yeah
dude ah I touched your hand huh it's
okay just got a few uh you know a few
minutes left on the whole bike are you
up - um I wanted to come and apologize
for last night I feel like it kind of
flipped out it's totally fine you had a
bunch to drink don't worry about school
tell Scott please cuz you know my night
wasn't so cool I got into a cab and I
smelled like pee and the cab driver was
like yo dude to get out of my captain
here's my like pee and guess what I did
after that I walked home smelling like
pee oh oh that sucks man you leave
pretty close to the club though huh
yeah so thank God for that yeah
all right well man dude good talk
cool man yep hey dude are you cool with
me and Kelsey being friends yeah totally
cool dude look I just want you to know
that you don't have any of the reason to
be jealous of me and Kelsey I'm not
jealous
not jealous person okay not jealous cool
cuz sometimes I just feel like maybe
you're get jealous and then maybe
because you're jealous you do things
that you don't realize you do and
someone walks like okay listen
Kelsey is on a camping trip with a guy
right now
Paul and it's completely platonic and
I'm not jealous in the slightest
advertising home that's the same guy I
really misjudged this situation I I this
whole time thought that you were the
jealous woman I guess maybe I was like
projecting jealousy and because you guys
have the type of relationship that is
like glue but you can send her out into
the woods with like a man God you guys
are gonna fight cuz you guys talk and
you guys listen to each other you know
and there's no jealousy Scott I I got
stopped right there I'm sorry I got a go
bud sorry if you do know that word you
know the word sorry dick dick
I was Paul's supper club huh
we'll always have some excuse
no it wasn't about he on Scott talk to
him you know he's just too
stubborn it's not what I thought my
twenties were gonna look like maybe you
need a break I mean cut it was so
embarrassed
