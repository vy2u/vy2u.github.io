- So, you said you do
stand-up too, sometimes?
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Okay. (laughs)
Oh shit.
- What?
- Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
- What's... What's going on?
- You have to hide!
- Why? Why do I have to hide?
- Hide! Now!
- Why am I hiding? What the?
- My wife is coming home.
- Your wife?!
- She...
- You... (sigh)
- Go, go, go.
- God, you said you were divorced! Ugh!
- I am getting divorced.
I think.
- God!
- I can't talk to you
about this right now.
(Sighs)
(Door opens)
Hey!
- Oh hi, babe.
How are you?
- You aren't at your book club.
- No, it's breakfast book club.
- Oh, breakfast book club.
- Yeah.
- Early in the day, yeah.
You must be so tired.
Maybe you should take a nap.
- No.
Do you know,
I was telling you I was reading that book,
that book called &amp;quot;Following Your Dreams&amp;quot;.
- Oh yeah.
- It's about following
your purpose in life
and like, true love and destiny.
- Uh-Huh.
- The whole time, I was,
keeping thinking like maybe
we're calling it quits,
just a little too early.
You know because, fate.
Destiny.
- I think that that's...
- Babe, what are you doing?
- I'm just dancing with you.
We're dancing, dancing.
- Oh, dancing.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Why don't I get some music?
- Yeah!
- Some like Iggy Azalea or something?
- Sure.
Oh, I love that song.
I love that music.
- Oh okay.
- Iggy Azalea.
- Today is magic.
Today is magic!
(Laughs)
- I'll get my speaker!
(Loud noises)
- Oh no!
Oh no, I just realized,
I think my speaker is right...
well, it's here.
- Oh, there it is.
- Honey, did you sign the divorce papers?
- No.
No!
(Screams)
- No?
- I don't want to get divorced.
- Oh.
Babe, that's exactly what I'm feeling too.
I just believe that we found
each other for a reason
and it's to love.
And I like your parents.
I like our family.
I love the gifts that they give us.
All the money.
- You should take a shower.
- What?
- You should take a shower.
- Do I smell bad?
- No, no.
I just think that after
reading a great book,
it's nice to just take a shower
and let the thoughts and
the narrative just soak in.
(Sneezes)
- Oh, what was that?
- We should go get some ice cream.
Why don't we just do that?
- Ice cream.
(Door slams close)
I don't want ice cream right now.
(Kissing)
I think that's what I want.
(Laughs)
- Okay.
- No, right here.
- The bedroom!
- Bedroom?
- The bedroom.
- Okay, sure.
(Laughs)
(Kisses)
(Speedy music)
(Fumbles with lock)
I feel the energy is here.
Let do it on the squirrel pillow.
The squirrel pillow.
- It smells strange on that couch.
How about we do it in the garage?
- The garage?
- Yeah.
(Speedy music)
(Shouting)
- This dining room table,
this dining room table.
Let's make a baby.
- Nope, nope.
(Screams)
Ah, it's not worth it.
(Laughs)
Hi.
Um, I'm Jill.
- Jill is a surprise for you.
That I... a new friend.
- No!
Nope! That's not what's happening.
Hi, I'm Jill.
I was just about to
sleep with your husband.
He told me that you were divorced.
Don't worry.
I was just using him for sex,
but uh...
- Wait, what?
- Wait, what?
- Okay. You know what,
maybe the two of you guys can uh,
work it out or something,
I don't know.
Um, you know what, no.
I'm gonna... (sharp exhale)
I'm gonna... How do you...
(Fumbles with door)
Yeah.
- You gonna lift up.
(Door closes)
(Sighs)
- That was crazy.
What was that all about?
Oh baby.
(Slap)
- Sign the papers.
