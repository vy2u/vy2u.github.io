broke up oh god I feel so bad he's a
really great guy I just realized I
wasn't into it anymore so he just broke
it off yeah one night after class I just
asked him to take a walk with me and
probably took him off garden so you
broke his heart
yeah I think so but I just don't think
we had that much in common
dude Destin are you seriously still
thinking about it oh I know I shouldn't
but it's getting his master's in
ceramics he seems so artsy and confident
and sophisticated you are sophisticated
you have to day covers the Shan lost
interest in Ryan what if he loses
interest in me too

walk one night or wakes up one morning

number from your phone last time you
tried a drunk text Emma listen you don't
think I have his number in there under
different names you don't know me at all
Dustin what's wrong you've been a little
preoccupied yeah
I guess I've just been feeling a little
insecure after running into Ryan
what what would you be insecure he's
cute and personable and doing super cool
things what you want all those things
and so much more you were literally my
favorite person I'm completely myself
when I'm with you I feel the same I
never had that in any my past
relationships I felt like I always held
part of me back like I always had to be
charming Shane
but everything feels real with you same
for the record I was the one who thought
you didn't like me in the beginning
remember I always knew that I liked you
I still don't get why though you don't
have to I just do
