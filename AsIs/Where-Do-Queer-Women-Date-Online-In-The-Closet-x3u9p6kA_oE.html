hi everybody welcome in the closet I'm
Jen that's Nikki today we are talking
about online dating for specifically a
online dating app called her hair her
hair for her that's good yeah you lose
that yeah they should we'll pitch it we
can visit because we happen to have the
founder of her right here she's coming
into a closet to hang out with us her
name is Robin Robin would you like to
come to the closet come on in Simon
hello / Jen hello Robin have you welcome
to the closet thanks great great to be
inside yeah yeah okay yeah that's great
Robin tell us a little bit about
yourself I paired a saucy huh my
favorite food is mainly Ferguson
mayonnaise I mean okay so we're talking
about this app / you found it why don't
you let everyone know a little bit what
is hurt huh is an app that helps lesbian
bisexual and queer people meet each
other something that's cool about that
we noticed like you can have a lot of
different options for what type of
relationship also like different options
for like sexualities more so than just
gay or straight or bi and then different
options for genders all main thing is if
you want to express as something you
should be able to find it inside via and
know that you're communicating to people
something that's important about
yourself how would you say her is
different from other dating apps out
there we started off by focusing a lot
on how women use technology differently
guys on other male apps tend to meet up
within 15 minutes
or the hour women tend to meet up at
least 24 hours away from when they first
hello said hello to each other a lot of
stuff that we do is try and help that
first conversation kick off what made
you decide to founder was sort of like
the history of the app so I started it
because I was using this really bad
lesbian dating website in the UK and as
you were signing up it used to ask you
how much body hair you have on your
profile and I was like the reason it was
like that was because it was a platform
that was built for gay men and her name
would just like turnip pink and go great
lesbian tada on top of that once we're
actually inside there were loads of
profiles created by dudes and guys
asking for three sir
and so decided it wouldn't it be nice if
there was something where I actually
could dress the people that I met and
they didn't ask me we're not lost
lasered or shaved it's really a
community space for people to meet each
other even talking all about her but now
we are going to load it on up and play a
little game I just set up a profile okay
I already had one how can I make my
profile the best profile you want to
have eight pictures on your profile
eight but don't go over ten is the
general winery's just you get fewer
messages stay still
me me this is our post that Robin made
telling people to come talk to us and
give us
truth or dare and the only people that
have liked it are me and Nicki it's been
about 15 minutes still no good through
dares I'm just going to tweet we are on
her okay I eat a whole Clint can of
beans no am I gonna find bean where we
gonna find beans no one is asking us
questions so now we're just reading some
of the very good lines which is no gaze
on this app are you Google because you
have everything I've been looking for
whoa
I'll be Burger King and you've been with
Donald's I'll have it my way and you'll
be loving it wow the moral of this story
is that no one wants to talk to any of
us on dating apps but they'll probably
want to talk to you well done everybody
is it time to get out of the closet oh
all right a side door let's do it by the
way okay I put the pee out oh how good
of a job we did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
