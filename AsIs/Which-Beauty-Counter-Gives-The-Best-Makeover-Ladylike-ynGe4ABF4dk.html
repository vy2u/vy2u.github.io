transformed into a nice lovely contoured
butterfly it's date night and we're
putting our faces in the hands of
professionals we're going to three
different makeup counters to see who can
make me feel like the Beyonce to my
jay-z it's ladylike and we're getting
Beauty counter makeovers my typical date
night look has gotten really bronzy and
neutral a smoky eye I usually spend a
lot of time on my hair I try and look
like Tracee Ellis Ross
I don't like lipstick my goal today is
to find a really pretty eye look that I
can do on my own I would like to look
cool and polished and like retro
beautiful without like just a crayon
full of lip liner look contoured without
looking like I have a bunch of makeup on
is that possible let's do this thing
hi I'm John Stapleton senior artist for
MAC Cosmetics and here at Mac our slogan
is all races all ages all sexes so I'm
excited to meet Kristen today here she's
engaged which is great this is the
exploration stage of the relationship so
let's have a little fun so I hear you're
engaged I hear you're having a date
night oh yeah amazing we are gonna go
out to dinner and dancing I mean I like
the vintage look but I think that like
really anything is new on me because I
don't try a lot of things what do you
typically like for coverage I like
honestly just to you know trick everyone
into thinking I don't have a very red
face I don't think you look terribly red
but what I will do is put a little bit
of primer and that will help combat some
redness so the apple of the cheek really
should get a little bit color
let's talk eyebrows obscure into
eyebrows I think because I wear glasses
I don't really focus on my eyes so much
they tend to be sort of an afterthought
down to me when you're wearing glasses I
actually focus a little bit more in your
eyes I'm just using the lightest color
in the top of the palette there just to
kind of pop a little bit of brightness
in the center of the lid I think a
winged liner would be really beautiful
I've never done that before
really No
all right so hot and naughty mascara has
like the purple in the pink the purple
one has a lot of mascara the pink side
pulls off about 50% of the mascara so
you have very little that one let's just
do it let's do the hot pink are you
ready to see actually singing actually
see okay I hope you like it oh my god ah
oh my goodness like I feel like my eyes
aren't like lost in like the wood right
they feel like they're actually a part
of my face it feels like me but like
plus two thank you so much pleasure so
fun part of your guy my name is Jasmine
I'm the lead trainer here at blushing 10
and our model here is feeling prettiest
priceless whether that be a super
natural look or a super glam look for
you guys so today on Candace we're going
to be doing a date night look and what I
like to keep in mind with date night is
just picking one feature and really
amping it up what do we have in mind
today I think something really kind of
like badass thing Oh edgy you know like
come on Tori we're gonna star in your
eyes first Oh
you kind of want to give it a little set
first with powder so that way you have a
nice even smooth texture feel like I'm
going to look like a bronze Grecian
goddess
I'm gonna come in with a super metallic
gold now whoa
it's like that one who's in the
Terminator this is my favorite product
ever that's amazing it's super super
metallic so then we'll line the top of
her eye and I'm going to use our steel a
black smudge pot so I'm just using an
evil amound ation on her right now which
is a really nice light feeling
foundation it'll still give you a good
amount of coverage yeah it feels like a
teddy bear we're going to come in we're
going to kind of bronze and contour you
so the best type of color to use for
this is a matte color so if it's too
shimmery and that's when we start to
look a little too glowy
I'm gonna get lashes I'm so excited I've
never had false eyelashes on before
you're ready to see I think so alrighty
and take a look my gosh I look like
airbrush I'm gonna doll pay the goddess
you always whine I'm a goddess right now
I'm like Athena I feel so good thank you
so much for awesome
hi I'm Virginia Franklin and I work at
Sephora at the Grove LA so today I'm
gonna be working with Freddie I think
for a date night if your complexion is
on point and is looking glowy and
gorgeous and pretty you're everything
else kind of falls in a place so where
are you going today we're going out to
dinner yeah I had a book run away from
like a shadows and stuff just cuz like I
don't even know where to start
okay I'd love to sort of like have the
eyes be the focal point
I love this foundation it just gives a
softness to the skin says it's a first
date is with my boyfriend I just wanna
you know spice it up and then I wanted
to do a really pretty like poppy blush
like gobs makeup Forever's number eight
20 or geez an eyeshadow primer when you
put on eyeshadow I don't put on
eyeshadow so we're taking this plummy
purple color and we're concentrating the
outer corner and I'm excited for Paul to
see it he pretty much likes anything
that I like he'll like it he'll like it
anesthesia she has the new brow definer
dark brown in order for me not to feel
crusty I have to fill in my brows the
pencil feels great it feels like velvet
so I'm gonna have you curl your
eyelashes definitely it really opens up
the eyes that's where you really wanted
to posit a water your mascara is right
at the base if I do use lip liner should
I be over lining my lips you already
