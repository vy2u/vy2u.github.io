play no games today we are going to test
out three different types of nail
services regular gel and sms and at the
end of the week we'll see whose nails
have kept up the best this is the
ultimate nail Olympic home girls about
to get her nails done I want to win the
nail Olympics I have no idea what the
reward is if we win the nail Olympics
but I'm a competitive person I'm hoping
that this gel manicure lasts a good few
weeks if it does I definitely will have
no issue spending the extra money
usually cooking ruins my manicure so I'm
hoping that it'll last long
we're here at whit nail spa and we're
about to get our services I'm getting
regular manicure
I'm getting the gel manicure
but to get my first SNS nail treatment
I'm going to work hard to make mine last
but I'm going to be realistic with yours
I don't think my glass I'm hoping that I
don't have to work too hard to make it
less because I think the gel is gonna do
the work for me all right let's do this
pampering on a Thursday morn I feel done
I'm ready to start the week oh not
talking these up I'm going to the gym
tomorrow morning I'm a little nervous
we're gonna have to see if they hold up
well my fingers feel very light I'm a
fan so far we'll see how this week goes
though I just got to the gym and I'm a
little bit nervous because this is
usually the time when my manicure will
chip so I really hope it doesn't chip
yet because I haven't been able to
flaunt these nails I'm handling a lot of
equipment and metal and Java there's
just so many factors that like my nails
don't stand a chance I just got home
from the gym and meticulously checked
over my nails not a single chip in the
beginning of the week I was a little bit
more careful about like hooking and like
going out ended up like forgetting that
I have gotten SMS this is the second
time I've cut up stuff and have cooked
this week with my sms nails and look
there's no chipping I literally don't
know what to do to make these nails chip
so here I am and I'm trying to open a
bottle of wine and I just became very
very cognizant of the fact that this
could ruin my nails my first night I
ended up chipping like the edge of the
nail tied open a bottle wine I had a
really big shoot day this week lots of
building and breaking down equipment and
using my hands and the shine is
beginning to dehl a little bit but other
than that I just came home from spinning
class and that's how great they look
there's been absolutely no chipping on
both hands literally just the littlest
moments are the biggest culprits for
ruining your manicure fetching your ID
out of your wallet
is the number one culprit to chipping
your nails I swear I did it like twice
today and I lost like half of the color
off of this nail and then another half
off this one it's just it's unbelievable
my week was good my nails look perfect
there's not a single chip or crack my
nails are writing a struggle bus to sad
town
pretty sad alrighty my nails look like I
just got them done yesterday I'm very
very impressed and very happy you know
based on like the durability and
longevity of these nails I definitely
think I'll stick with the gel manicure I
was definitely hesitant to spend the
money on a gel manicure but now after
having one it's worth it I think if I'm
gonna do like a typical regular manicure
I'm just gonna do it at home and save
the money but if I think if I'm gonna go
to a salon I'm definitely gonna invest
in gels the next time I go cuz I'm
looking at the other girls nails and
they look beautiful like if you're gonna
spend money spend the extra $10 to have
your nails last a little bit longer I'm
never going back to acrylics never S&amp;amp;S
has definitely taught me that I can let
my nails go for a little bit and then
get them done screw acrylics I'm done
I'm done with that game I'm we're
breaking up we're over
