mascara all over your face today we're
testing four different mascaras to see
which brand holds up best against the
elements
we've been randomly assigned to mascara
and we won't know which brand we have
until the end of it number one the
smudge test event number two cry a
little bit event number three venture
into the rain its ladylike and today
we're playing mascara Olympics it's so
true that it's really hard to do your
mascara without making a weird face into
a requirement that your mouth has to be
open when you're putting on mascara I
can feel like all mascara inevitably
gets in your hair this is a really great
mascara actually
I'm about to nap and then when we wake
up we're gonna rub our mascara and see
if it comes off Friday looks like a
beautiful angel see you later
you know let's find out um no oh yeah
here we go I'll see you there
that's where my eye was I see maybe a
flake or two my eye was right here so I
see a couple of flakes I don't think
there are any smudges and my eyes don't
feel like they're gleich glued shut so
there's nothing on the pillow um I have
a feeling I have a few kress sees in the
corners now we're gonna go actually rub
our eyes and see how the mascara holds
up I'll be honest I think this much test
game is he flakes I would write my
mascara 1 out of 5 stars because it
literally just smudge right off there
were a few little crumblies that sort of
like dribbled down my cheek after my
smudge test I had very little on my
hands and I think that my eyes still
looked pretty much the same
let's have some damn onions I just have
to think of sad things like the first 10
minutes of op I never saw of ones that
really get me our proposals at
Disneyland also those make me cry so
hard I don't know why
oh I don't poster Disney World when I
stop oh it's happening yep mm-hmm I was
crying so hard I took the ring out of
the box and shoved it on my finger
without saying anything oh my god are
you serious right now
can I see your ring that was such a bad
idea
oh my god I'm such a I just got
put through the wringer with those
onions I don't know what the deal was
this mascara it performs about as well
as an eighteen-year-old college boy my
mascara smeared a little bit right under
my eyelid but it didn't stream down my
face or anything so that means that my
mascara is probably pretty good it
smudged and pulled slightly underneath
my eyes but it did not run down with the
tears my mascara was just like latching
on to each individual lash and just
being like god damn it Candace you hold
on
you know when it's raining and a car
drives by and splashes yeah well we
don't know that because we live in LA so
we're just gonna splash each other with
the water because why not just do fun
they're having fun
um it's not holding up well I feel bad
because I was pretty ruthless no no it's
not it's a little flaky but that's about
it you actually have like a little bit
underneath your eye which is amazing
because your face is literally covered
in water
there's a small smudge on the edge but
nothing too crazy nothing rushing down
our team we're gonna peel the tape off
our mascaras and see which ones we have
oh I had been in sex ah I had covergirl
I had your show I had L'Oreal manga I'm
just mad I don't look like an anime
character after this it's kind of sad to
see like this is an expensive tube and
it doesn't do that well I kind of feel
inclined to start wearing mascara more
it was fun and my lashes were just leaky
was it actually better than sex
yes whoo Wow that's bold in here
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
