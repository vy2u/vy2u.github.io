you a little bit about my new show feed
famous it's a social media modeling
competition where we take real
unfiltered beauties from all across the
country and make them battle it out and
weekly photo challenges but there's only
one rule you can only use your phone
we received over 1,000 submissions we
were looking for the bold the fierce the
confident and the authentic and we
finally got it down to our top six
contestants I would love for you to be a
part of this competition yes I'm so
excited
katie is a gorgeous girl from Dallas
Texas she is passionate driven and a
total dreamer I'm hoping to bring a lot
of spunk and a whole lot of smizing to
this competition
Rosie lives in Los Angeles and this our
oldest competitor at 48 years old I
don't believe that anything should limit
you so being chosen I'm gonna start to
cry very emotional it's just really an
affirmation that nothing can hold you
back
Rosie is eccentric bold and not afraid
to put herself out there next up is Oso
Oso is an effortlessly cool guy from
Jacksonville Florida yo I'm so excited
to be a part of this super happy quite
nervous but I think more anxious than
nervous what a way to start the
competition you'll fall in love with his
authentic Street style next we have
Victoria he's originally from Venezuela
and now lives in LA you can be sure that
I'm gonna bring fierceness fashion
fashion like you've never seen before
when she's not working being a freaking
paralegal she's doing bomb-ass photo
grids with her vibrant style on her
Instagram I'm not to bring it to the
competition
now we have the fabulous Anthony whether
he's rocking a totally beat face or a
natural look Anthony can't help but
stand out being free is like the
greatest thing that you can do for
yourself that's why I want to be a voice
for people that are scared to be
themselves and his feed is literally
last but not least divinity is a unique
fierce woman from LA I'm so excited and
I'm gonna work really hard to prove that
I deserve to be here when make everyone
proud make everyone laugh and slay it
snatch edges and flip wigs and it's
gonna be great
divinities had a lot of hard times
throughout our life but prides herself
on pushing through them each week these
competitors have to complete a photo
challenge only using their phone then me
and a celebrity guest judge will decide
who has the best photo and who's being
kicked off the feed one of these six
competitors is about to become
feed famous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
