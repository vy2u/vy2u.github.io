the
the most beautiful woman I know would
have to be my mom my best friend my mom
my sister my mom my girlfriend her
presence emanates confidence there's
just something special about her soul
my sister was never afraid to speak her
mind and challenge others being able to
watch her persevere and just be herself
within any situation really made her a
beautiful person to me and even in the
face of eight years of battling breast
cancer she was still there for me I
don't think I'll ever meet anyone who is
as loving and brave and strong as my
mother she is very kind to others and
she has a very warm presence that's very
inviting she's just like a little ray of
sunshine every time I see my mom she's
just smiling and then I just feel happy
and everyone just feels beautiful around
her being around her taught me how to
love everybody around me she's
constantly going the extra mile for
people she barely knows and that hard
old I get she's always just there for me
the moment I got to spend with her were
some of the best of my life it's
something that I'll always remember and
carry with me
I miss you and I'm really happy that
we're sisters just thank you for being
the best influence in my life people
remember you because you really love
what you do I can't imagine this world
without you you're incredible
Fifi I love you
