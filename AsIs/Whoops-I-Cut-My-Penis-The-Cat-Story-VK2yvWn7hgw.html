my penis cut oh yeah I was about a month
ago I was sleeping on my couch fell
asleep watching a movie or something and
all I remember is having a great night's
sleep and waking up to my cat making
muffins you know when they're like
digging into your belly and it's really
cute when they're just trying to find
like the perfect spot that's you know
it's usually an adorable thing well my
cat was doing that to my penis so I just
woke up like in shock to him just
digging his nails into me as hard as he
can and when I was like ha ha you gotta
stop you gotta stop you guys stop he
started doing that thing that cats do
where they get their nails sort of more
stuck into you or into a couch or
whatever if it's fabric it's fine when
it's your penis um
it's not and then he started also
sneezing on my face
at the exact same time so I'm like
trying to pull him up his claws are
digging into me sneezing into my face at
4 o'clock in the morning I'm like a
Tuesday I don't think very much blood
was drawn but they were definitely like
markings it's the claw and your penis
what more I don't know I think I got off
easy compared to everybody else that
I've heard so far but still get your cat
away from your penis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
