so I took my electric razor and I was
like well which side do I use it's not
like your dad teaches you how to like
shave the fields or anything like it's
very just like trial by error and so I
flip that out and I just started
drilling in town and I think I got like
a little too confident because it's
really easy I was like why does everyone
like complain about shaving your pubes
and cutting yourself like this is
virtually impossible
like I'm like so safeguarded I mean
nothing is going to happen and I wasn't
even trimming at this point I was just
like going broke I was like clinging the
rainforest and then yeah that's when I
started to like knit myself and I didn't
think it was actual like cuts and stuff
cause it was on an electric razor so I
kept going and then um my my hand is not
the most stable thing in the world for
this kind of machinery and technique and
it's just kind of like really like like
across like the fine skin of which my
penis is made out of um so I pulled back
and there's blood coming out of my balls
like just not like gushing blood
I was just like losing out like just
growing like bubbles of blood then the
next step was I took tissues and wipe
all the little blood off and kind of
like the same way if you make yourself
shaving I took like little like lipids
of the tissue and put it around after
that I took the aftershave cuz I feel or
any germs or infections I mean that's my
job as those open wounds on there now I
filed the after state for my drug and
it's done a lot and uh
I then took a shower and surprisingly
the water stung even more I don't know
why the water stung so Valley without
really starving laughs but I've never
had like backed out of a convoy like
who's across the three across the penis
divide the great team is divided</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
