I'm visiting friends in Austin Texas
they asked do you want to go to the
swimming hole and I'm like sure I just
have to get a swimsuit real quick so we
stopped by Target and I get the cheapest
swim trunks they have so I'm feeling
great I'm like awesome I put them on and
we go to the swimming hole now it turns
out that it's not just a place that you
go and jump in the water you go there
and then you walk through the woods for
a mile before you get to the place where
you swim so I do that in these swim
trunks and flip-flops and it feels a
little tight but I don't think too much
about it
I swim everything is fine and then I
hike a mile back in a wet swim trunks
and then it's starting to feel like a
little bit sting II and I have to pee
but I'm still not too worried because I
guess I'm an optimist and so when I pull
down the swim trunks to pee I have one
of those moments just like in like a
horror movie or something where you
don't see the injury but you see the
person hold their hand up with blood on
it and they're just like and apparently
there was some plasticky part down there
that had just been like rubbing and
chafing the entire time for miles of me
walking in this luckily it was on the
side not the end if had been on the end
then this would just be a horrible
painful memory but as it is we can laugh
about it and always pay extra for the
softer swim trunk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
