black woman and who are the black women
you see on the local news at night in
cities all over the country
they're usually angry about something
most disrespected person in America is
the Bible the most unprotected person in
America is the black woman the most
neglected person in America is the black
woman
mmm
I think about all that black women do
for society and how to thank you that we
get it's just constant disrespect how
we're not protected how were sexualized
and fetishized in the media how it's
kind of like we're abandoned a society
like does not have a black woman's back
but she didn't even do anything she just
was being black when you're born and
you're born a woman you already have one
thing stacked against you you're born
and you're a black woman you have both
of those things stacked against you you
just have to work hard as well and
there's no system in place to help you
thrive it's really sad to think about
how young it is that we all internalize
those things I may not have had the
words for it but I knew that I wasn't
going to be accepted being a 4c you know
dark skin thick black girl I just knew
that people in elementary school who
would call like me a monkey or something
like that and it's just it's sad that we
like to think that we've come so far but
we haven't it's mind-boggling the fact
that black people in general and then
also black women are still being
compared to animals I feel like I'm a
very strong person but I'm always afraid
to show that I'm too strong because I'm
always afraid that it will play into
that stereotype and all of a sudden I
will be looked at as masculine because
of these stereotypes that are put upon
black woman black women should be quiet
into themselves and sort of have their
heads down and just like kind of try and
blend in you are not allowed to be a
bigger woman tall and also stand up tall
and be confident it's just like not
allowed
the thing that makes me most angry is
the fact that I feel like no one really
has my back except other black women
it's really tough to feel alone in a
fight to be seen as equal and just as
successful and just as amazing as anyone
else
the variety of black women is really
important in media because we are seen
as only one thing and that's a C or we
have too much attitude and we can never
be anything else without that there's no
such thing as an angry black woman but a
black woman who happens to be angry I'm
going to do everything that I can to
then channel that very deep pit of anger
that I have into something to show you
that that's not who I am that's not who
I've ever been that's not who Leslie is
that's not who Michelle Obama is like I
get that that bullshit is out there and
I'm like how what can I do with my work
with my art to change that to change the
narrative to tell people that you know
we're more than this for the young black
girl out there I would say think about
all the things that we contribute every
day to society and how we built this
country on our backs like we did it so
think about how even though that's a
tragedy
think about how awesome we are like all
the shit that we have gone through we
still win the gold medal I mean come on
yeah you are worthy you are beautiful
and no one gets to take that away from
you like the minute that you let
somebody else dictate who you are and
your beauty like you've already given
that to them I don't get like you don't
get my worth it's my worth and just
because someone lays down rules of what
is beautiful that doesn't mean that you
have to agree with that I think that it
is important though that when you are
feeling that intensely about any kind of
injustice or some kind of you know
people belittling you for something that
you don't deserve to be belittled for it
is important to be in that moment when
you feel it but then I don't want to
live in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
