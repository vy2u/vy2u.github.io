published analyzing why women are
constantly competing instead of
supporting each other but what do real
people think this is my kitchen this is
my school district I'm on the board and
you don't belong here get out of my time
zone you're bouncing that baby bitch I
need your diaper change why do you think
women are so competitive about
everything oh I think women they aren't
secure with themselves and so they need
to project their dominance onto others
feel more like valued and they're just
insecure about their achievements we
didn't say you could talk so I'd say the
second time I was on a boat what is
better than that first time oh my god
Lauren from Leland high school hi how
are you are you oh great I'll see you
yeah yeah the lady and I were in the
middle of a conversation
buddy okay well now you and I are in the
middle of a conversation
buddy let's dance
why can't women just interact without
turning everything into a competition
well they're competing for male
attention when a woman is successful or
attractive they make it harder to entice
the most eligible man I feel like she's
also searching for the approval she
never received from her father oh that's
a really good point let me just conclude
by saying this our enemies are many and
they are tireless they will not rest
until our loved ones and everything that
we hold dear has been stricken and smoke
from the earth
we will destroy our enemies if elected I
will destroy our enemies
I will hemorrhage their bloodlines and I
will salt the earth where their houses
once stood ah and become death destroyer
of worlds witness me why do women there
on their periods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
