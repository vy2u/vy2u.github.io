they're just friends but I think there
might be a little bit more going on so
today I'm gonna help them answer the
question why aren't we dating cuz I
think they should be dating I think
they'd be perfect for each other
what could possibly go wrong thanks for
being here why don't we start out with
having you both introduce one another
and say something nice about each other
oh you're Nick you're loud that's not
nice
you're Corey and you are charming so
loud and charming great start tell me
how you met each other I think we met
each other while we were both
intoxicated most interactions with you I
are hazy it's cuz we're friends and we
always hang out when we go out yeah we
don't like hanging out to like go
grocery shopping but we met through a
mutual friends and we hit it off right
off the bat we connected over where
we're both from or Arlington is right I
was like I went too little and then you
were like I went to done sure sure
it's like I don't remember you went a
little and you went too short those
can't be hoes can't be wheels like that
yeah yeah right now I want you to take
turns saying things that you both have
in common
Texas we like finer things in life like
alcohol sassy definitely sassy look
those funny yeah I'm definitely funny
okay confident sexually active whoa whoa
don't put my business out there like
that
wait I'm not a sexually active as you
you're a bit of a oh but what is
your friendship mean to one another
you're loyal King I sure the am
which I very much appreciate
I am very loyal but if I get on the bad
side I want to kill you sometimes why
what do you mean you need a bad side
okay
it's nice though cuz if somebody comes
and starts to mess with me you'll be the
first one to twirl on over so I
appreciate that yeah I mean I would say
the same about you if I called you and I
would be like Cory my tires
flat can you come and help me like I
feel like you would be there to like
coming out me I think we're both
actually present in the friendship yes
yeah
let's say Nick over here started dating
somebody would your initial instinct be
to like that person yeah
you don't think I would like somebody
you're dating no I'm just saying really
why no I'm just shocking you want to get
jealous no I think you should always be
skeptical wouldn't that piss you off
I don't think so I'd want another truth
I want to know how you feel I'll keep
that to my ready finally get a bed yeah
you guys are gonna go on a date and then
you're gonna come back tomorrow we're
gonna talk about it and just see how you
feel about each other what if we end up
having that that's gone bad that's a fun
ending I'll tell you also wrap it up so
this is different but we're trying here
we're giving it a go so we're here the
game arms it's different weird that were
even on a
like I kind of wish I was at home to be
honor like cuz I know we're having a
good time we're just friends so like
it's weird but we're having a good time
like we're catching up good friends you
know Kelly's birthday right I feel like
you kind of need it sometimes like a
Friendship Day
I was just want to see the same things
like we should start up I gotta be
friends I have an accent and they should
catch up later he's not fit me he is
ready ready we were born ready okay
we're back you guys just went on that
date had a wonderful time why don't you
both tell us about it how did it go
our date was grass amazing the food was
amazing our conversation was great we
caught up well we didn't get caught up
didn't get caught up in each other's
eyes ever he got lost in his cell phone
a lot Helen him out right here yeah he
was on his phone which is a date no no
okay so we actually have one last thing
to do here we have two sheets of paper
one in red and one in blue for each of
you I'm gonna spin you away now the red
one means you would be interested in
maybe going on another date sometime the
blue one is not we're just friends maybe
don't want to do this again somebody
give me five seconds to decide you're
going to put the one in front facing the
other as I pull you around five four
three two one okay clearly that's it so
you had a good time so why what why
ultimately is friendship better for both
of you
cuz we're just not compatible yeah we're
not compatible
we're both crazy and if you put
two crazy people together it doesn't end
well I'll run for the hills cause it's
scary we're great friends
we don't need to take it to that next
level great at least now you know right
now it gets definitive you don't want to
see his penis oh wow what my friend what
about my penis
well another show well we had a great
time here we looks like we figured out
why you guys aren't dating and why
should stay friends
we'll see you next time maybe someday
we're gonna make people fall in love
somehow I'm gonna make people fall with
your penis or with someone else cool
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
