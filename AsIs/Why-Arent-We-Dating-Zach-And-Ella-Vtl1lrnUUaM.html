they're just friends but I think there
might be a little bit more going on so
today I'm gonna help them answer the
question why are we dating cuz I think
they should be dating I think they'd be
perfect for each other they feel like we
should have talked before this what
could possibly go wrong
thanks for being here guys we're going
to start this off with having each of
you introduce one another this is that
and that has good taste in sushi okay
this is Ella she's a badass bitch how
did you guys become friends Ella and I
went to college together but didn't know
each other in college it was like a lot
of like mist we almost ya know then
finally I got her on this project you
know it's funny though back in college
I always thought that you were this like
really cool person
that would never like be friends with me
and I like I remember going to
going-away party and I was like oh man
like we get to go to sex party alright
really I need a coolest one I don't know
how do you describe your friendship we
eat dinner we go to movies we have a lot
of the same interests totally have the
same friends now at the beginning of our
friendship was definitely rooted in way
work and like we both loved work yeah we
what both love working really crazy but
yeah work all the time I love someone
that I can like share anxieties with I'm
definitely like called you and been like
yeah I'm excited about this thing so
you've relied on each other already Ella
yeah if tomorrow
Zak started dating someone else would
your first reaction be to like that
person
I I don't know I think so yeah yeah I
would say like she better be really
great and if she wasn't I would be like
a little bit judgmental so Zack same
question if tomorrow Ella showed up says
I have new boyfriend how would you feel
about that thinking back on the people
that you've like sort of being sort of
dated over the past and I feel like I
have been super harsh and judgmental
so as friends and close friends who hang
out a lot and they're vulnerable with
each other have you ever in your life
ever looked at the other and been like
okay okay I could okay I mean it's like
it's a weird thing like when you have I
think definitely thought about it for
sure and Zack yeah let's say this is the
last time you ever speak to one another
because something happens and you can't
what is one thing that cannot be left
unsaid if we were both gonna die and
I've told you this before but I would
tell you that I love you and that you
mean a lot to me and that you've made my
life a lot better well I love you too
back and we make my life better
oh thanks this is so
oh I'm sweating very nice look I love it
and they're like clammy this is why I
don't know I can't control how your body
reacts to your emotions actually what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna let
you two go on a romantic date
are you planning the date now you are
I'm gonna let you guys do it do
something you would enjoy doing together
but I want you to experience it like you
would on a date with someone you cared
about this is just for a test then
you're going to come back tell us how it
went and tell us what you feel about it
here to pick up Ella for our date yeah I
know I don't know how I did that are you
excited yeah oh yeah I told I actually
I'm normally really awful and stressed
out about playing dates but I thought of
one very quickly and I'm very excited
good all right we just finished dinner
great so I wanted to get cookies but
cookie place is closed but I think this
place has cool
we just came here for full but Ella was
like man I really always liked Matt
Bobby and they have it
blame the show Ella just beat me finally
won one game Zak pour it on himself we
don't need to tell people me I just
dropped Ella oh it was a really good
date I don't know how she felt I think
we had a good time we'll see how we feel
in the morning
great you ready yeah okay so we're back
you guys went on your date you had a
wonderful time I assumed why don't you
tell us how did the date go it was a
pretty good date I'll tell you that like
from a date perspective I was like man
what if effortless date you each get two
pieces of paper one is a blue smiley
face that means you know what friendship
is the best thing for us no matter what
one is a red heart which means I
wouldn't be opposed to going on a date
again like that with each other I
wouldn't be opposed to the idea that
maybe we could be more than friends so
I'm gonna spin anyway no put the piece
of paper in the front that you would
rather choose and we'll do this and
we're gonna have you turn in 5 4 3 2 1
your question was would I be opposed on
another date like no it was fun I had to
find time I want to just say like I
wanted to be friends yeah I would do
that again but to be out like this is
this is how I'm happy and this is where
I think oh I think this is good yeah I
think this is great great then I'll just
keep this sort of popping your head in
between just in case you ever want to
snap it you know in case you ever change
your mind like BAM I want this I just
want to
hey that I not know was going to happen
when I came here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
