oxytocin also known as the cuddle
hormone that's what makes you feel warm
inside psychologists also say oxytocin
promotes feelings of devotion trust and
bonding allowing us to connect with
other people these connections become
even more valuable as you age the
loneliness that comes with years can
increase stress and harm overall health
hugging has been proven to directly
fight feelings of loneliness a study
published in Psychological Science found
that touch and hugging has the ability
to comfort people who suffer from low
self-esteem a hug can provide
existential security to someone who's
drifting even embracing inanimate
objects like stuffed animals can help
alleviate fear oxytocin has also been
shown to decrease the risk of heart
disease
when you hug receptors in your skin send
signals to the vagus nerve this nerve
has the power to slow down your heart
and decrease blood pressure commonly a
study from Harvard Medical School
discovered that children who were not
hugged had stunted growth and poor
behavior so be liberal with your hugs
yeah that's some grade-a comfort</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
