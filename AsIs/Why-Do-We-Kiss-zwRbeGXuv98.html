why do we kiss is it instinctive is it
learned behavior perhaps it evolved over
thousands of years from how our
ancestors used to feed their children by
chewing up their food and then spitting
it into their mouths it's a theory the
truth is we don't actually know how
humans started kissing but we do know
that we've been kissing for 3500 years
and we know that because the first known
documentation of kissing is in the Kama
Sutra I bet he wants this back there you
go currently 90% of the world's cultures
engage in the act of lip locking but why
why is kissing so good we enjoy kissing
because kissing creates a drug like
blend of endorphins this release of
adrenaline dopamine oxytocin and
serotonin gives you that rush of
pleasure and Trust and attachment and
awesomeness and a significant release of
these hormones can leave quite an impact
which is why most people can recall up
to 90% of the details of their first
kiss kissing can also help you find a
mate you might be attracted to someone
and when you kiss them that attraction
could grow or it could completely fade
out altogether that's because kissing
transmits sensory signals on a
subconscious level women can even
understand the amount of testosterone a
man has and the quality of his immune
system simply by exchanging a kiss and
that's chemistry
oh it's a lot of chemistry but perhaps
the greatest thing about kissing is that
it always stems from someplace positive
it's an intimate moment of trust and
vulnerability shared only between those
closest to us and sometimes strangers
yes sir fight the cooking do it up and
spit it into my mouth people please do
this all time yeah yeah kissing could a
compliment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
