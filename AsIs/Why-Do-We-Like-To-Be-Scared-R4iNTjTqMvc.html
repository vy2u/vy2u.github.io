dopamine it controls the reward and
pleasure centers in the brain some
people get more of a kick from dopamine
than others some people don't have any
limit on how much dopamine is released
so that means being scared can be really
fun the brain is time to process the on
a haunted house or a scary movie is a
real and there's no actual threat to
really enjoy a life-threatening
situation you need to know that your
life isn't actually threatened sounds
and smells are tied to our fear response
but the brain is time to process that
these aren't real threats now because
it's scary we don't all release large
amounts of dopamine when in a state of
fear certain fears are gaining childhood
if you're scared by something when
you're young and you don't know what's
big that fear can remain into adulthood
the brain can become more and more
accustomed to certain for your still I
to the point where it no longer releases
dopamine or triggers adrenaline if
you're a practice thrill seeker
eventually you'll need to up the ante
what scares you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
