probably haven't well maybe you should
it's like a leg or something
mm-hmm that one good not good oh my mom
there are 1427 species of edible insects
and when people eat them it's called
entomophagy just like a fish just like
God dumb if you live in America you
might be eating bugs and have no idea
the FDA allows a very small acceptable
amount of bugs in all kinds of everyday
food including peanut butter camp fruit
juices and chocolate but it's not so bad
insects are healthy because they contain
a lot of protein fiber and nutrients
like iron and zinc they're not very
different from their close relatives
shrimp crab and lobster it's a tail at
first it's like popcorn it's kind of
like fried chicken two billion people
around the world currently eat insects
like deep fried tarantulas in Cambodia
chopped elitist or toasted grasshoppers
in Mexico even the old testament
encourages people to consume locusts and
beetle larvae with the growing
population and demand for more food
insect farming could provide a cheap
sustainable food source for the future
so what do you think that's the not bad
it's like really well cooked so you know
it tastes it tastes good I say it's like
a potato chip
I just tastes like fried food it'll just
no good anymore it's actually pretty
good I was like
we tried eating bugs would you oh oh my
god oh my god oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
