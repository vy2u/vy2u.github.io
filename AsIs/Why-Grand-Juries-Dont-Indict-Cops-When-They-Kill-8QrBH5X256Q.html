former Ferguson police officer Darren
Wilson told grand jury that Michael
Brown looked like a demon who might
shrug off a hail of bullets before
Wilson shot him dead shortly after
Cleveland Police Officer Timothy Loman
gunned down
Tamir rice a 12 year old holding a toy
gun he told the dispatcher that rice was
shot within two seconds of Loehmann's
arrival was maybe 20 Milwaukee police
officer Christopher manney told
investigators that dontre Hamilton an
unarmed man whom he shot 14 times in
October was so big and muscular that he
would be impossible to control if you
were one man at five foot seven and 180
pounds Hamilton was below average height
and overweight Wilson Loman and Manny
are white and brown rice and Hamilton
were black they were also unarmed but in
the eyes of the men who killed them they
were frightening enough to provoke the
use of lethal force these lingering
sometimes unconscious biases help
explain why police encounters with black
men are so much more likely to end
fatally on December 3rd a grand jury
declined to indict Daniel Pantaleo the
white Staten Island police officer with
a past record of race-related misconduct
who was caught on video choking Eric
garner to death during an arrest on
suspicion of selling loose cigarettes on
the video which went viral garner can be
heard yelling I can't breathe
over and over Joe colds have been banned
by the New York Police Department for 20
years and the coroner ruled Garner's
death a homicide we don't know what
Pantaleo said to the grand jury or why
they let him off police are empowered to
use lethal force under certain
circumstances and sometimes they have to
the Supreme Court has held that police
can use lethal force if they have a
reasonable belief they are facing danger
or if a fleeing suspect poses a danger
to others it is difficult to know how
many people are killed by police each
year because despite police and their
advocates affinity for the phrase
data-driven policing how many times
police kill people is data they simply
haven't gotten around to properly
gathering yet police sometimes kill
unarmed white men like Dylan Taylor in
Utah but the flawed a we have shows
police kill white people far less often
than they kill black people relative to
the proportion of the population the
white men are also harmed by a system
that disproportionately allows black men
to be killed with impunity does not
exonerate the system this is something
to do with the way police see things
police are people after all subject to
the same flaws and vices as the rest of
us America's police departments tend to
be wider than the general population and
nearly half of White's believe many or
almost all black men are violent White's
overestimate the amount of crime in
particular violent crime involving
blacks black children like Tamir rice
are more likely to be mistaken as older
be perceived as guilty and face police
violence if accused of a crime when
society weighs whether the deaths of
black men at the hands of police are
reasonable it does so with the
additional burden of American beliefs
about black criminality black super
strength black dangerousness on the
other side are our collective beliefs
about police scene is more noble more
selfless and more resistant to all to
human flaws like wrath or deceit
small wonder then but the scales of
justice are so often unbalanced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
