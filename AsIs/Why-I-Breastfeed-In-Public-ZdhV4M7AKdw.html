you don't have to do all the other stuff
that I have to do so it's like if you're
uncomfortable you can turn your head
breastfeeding in public um I try to do
it it makes me a little nervous but I
try to be brave about it because I think
well she doesn't understand it this is
my daughter's first exposure to body
shaming her mom getting all tense and
anxious and shameful because her breast
is out I was definitely nervous about it
because I just did not know what to
expect in terms of people and staring
but over time I got over that you know
Sydney is hungry so now I feed her
whenever I need to feed her it was
really stressful to even just breastfeed
even when you're just at home but you're
out public and your child is screaming
and you're trying to maneuver them
underneath the blanket it could be
really horrifying I never had anyone say
anything to me directly but I have
gotten a couple disapproving glances
I actually was asked one time to move
when I was breastfeeding at a mall and
the security guard asked if I would go
to the family restroom I'm feeding my
kid
and I just can't imagine it I pulled out
a sippy cup no one would say anything if
I pulled out Cheerios no one would say
anything I have friends who odd me for
doing it I have friends who still think
it's a little bit too intrusive and I
just remind them that well when we wear
our bikinis our breasts are out other
people's breasts are out so a mall
security guard asked me to move to the
family restroom and I looked him dead in
the eyes and I said do you take a
where you eat intellectually I know that
there should be nothing I should be
ashamed of but somehow it's been baked
into me just from society so as much as
I want to ignore it that's like my
biggest thing about breastfeeding was
about modeling my fear of inadequacy as
a mother and being able to breastfeed in
public for me like fuels like I get to
like kind of wear this badge of honor
like look at me look at me go
breastfeeding without fear for me means
that I'm a confident mom breastfeeding
without fear to me means having a
regular opportunity to do best by my kid
the natural thing to do it's what our
bodies were meant to do so we shouldn't
be ashamed of it mothers have way too
much on their plate already you need to
provide for your child and feed your
child in a relaxed environment
breastfeeding without fear to me means
freedom to leave the house and
live my life because it's a beautiful
constant important part of mothering and
it
we shouldn't have to hide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
