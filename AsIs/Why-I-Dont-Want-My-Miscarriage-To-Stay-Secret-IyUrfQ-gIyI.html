don't want my miscarriage to stay secret
I thought my first ultrasound would go
like this my doctor would point out the
baby and I turned to my husband Brendan
he'd tear up and I'd whisper can you
believe it he'd finally see our burrito
one of our favorite foods and our
nickname for unnamed fetus instead I saw
a fuzzy gray screen my obstetrician told
me there was no evidence of life just a
gestational sac she asked me to come
back two weeks later if there was growth
we were in business if my uterus was
still empty
I would miscarry I worried every day
that nothing was growing inside of me
still i religiously read mommy online
forms where other women saw the fetus at
their second ultrasound this gave me
hope but the second ultrasound showed
there was no baby talking to my doctor I
was completely calm asking when we could
try again everything's going to be okay
Brendan said it wasn't until later that
I curled into a ball on our bed sobbing
my very first pregnancy became my very
first miscarriage the budding belly I
had grown fond of and now hated no one I
knew ever posted to Facebook I had a
miscarriage today
I told a few close female friends and
that's when the story started coming out
about their own miscarriages one friend
was going through miscarriage at the
same exact time I was another suggested
I check out hashtag I had a miscarriage
I thought I was alone but it seemed so
many women had miscarriages many of us
were still grieving meanwhile in
subsequent checkups I was still pregnant
even though my body was slowly bleeding
month later my OBGYN scheduled a DNC to
remove what was inside of me
when I woke up in the recovery room the
head of ob/gyn came in he demonstrated
with his hand how my uterus was inverted
when my doctor went in to dilate me she
accidentally punctured a small hole in
the top of my uterus they had to go in
and stitch me up leaving me with small
scars on either side of my stomach a
group of medical workers were walking
through the maternity ward
congratulations
one woman said to me I shook my head no
there's no baby
she found and left at home I spent two
days in bed I didn't cry
I just wanted to not exist anymore after
the surgery complication and an awful
phone call with my doctor I started a
frantic search for a new obstetrician
through her friends recommendation I saw
a new doctor
she answered my dozens of questions my
new doctor made me feel comfortable
whereas my old doctor didn't seem to
care and even dismissed my concerns when
the miscarriage finally happened I
welcomed the cramps and the tissue that
finally came out now that the physical
part was over I could finally move on I
told more friends via email that pouring
of support and love was tremendous two
months later Brendan and I were shopping
at Target I accidentally wandered into
the baby section with rows of cribs
suddenly my heart raced tears were
coming so I ran out of the baby aisle
and found Brendan all I had to say was I
went into the baby section he pulled me
into a giant hug what I've learned is
that there is no getting over it the
grief of my loss is part of me it always
will be
now instead of being ashamed to tell
anyone on Facebook I'm going to break
the bad news barrier and say it last
fall I had a miscarriage
