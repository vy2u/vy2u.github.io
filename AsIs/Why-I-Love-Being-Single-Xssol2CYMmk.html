brain you thought exercise dick Dania
that's a boy
oh these are lovely I feel like my cats
would just tear the out of this I
like this one but this one might be a
little bit of like my mom who sit like
that like I would like lay on my mom's
lap gonna put no panties on her maybe
this isn't reminding me of my mom
actually give the woman some exact oh
you can take this ah this is like a
shrimp a creepy don't like that no
nipples but it doesn't feel like a human
feels like a pillow just like all of my
boyfriend's I am not mad at this one but
you know I like a little bit of a tan I
like a little bit of a melanin in the
skin you know she know daddy likes hips
do I ever want a relationship sometimes
but then I think I want to really be in
a really super as like a form of
validation I love being single not so
much for the reason that you should want
to be in a relationship which is to
share your life with someone there's
definitely a give-and-take about not
being relationships to be honest I'd
much rather prefer fellow than like a
human being hanging over me I think at
this point in time I've been single for
three years and I'm ready to head pop
back on and I have two hands that I can
use at any point but then again I can't
force it you just have to meet the right
person
all of the benefits of being single and
live you don't have to do anything you
don't want to do I don't have to worry
about turning somebody off if there's
any time to be selfish in my life it's
Polly right now there's just like less
responsibility to take care of somebody
else I feel when I go home I get to take
care of me
I got to take care of nobody else you
learn so much more about like yourself
and the going on inside of you when
you don't have somebody else to tell you
how you feel you should have sex with a
lot of different people learn a lot of
different techniques learn about your
body I think that society definitely
makes people feel like they need to have
kids they need to settle down I think
just get to a point in life when
relationships only again like better you
because it's only gonna make you
stronger when you start this whole
relationship game back up again you
don't ever need someone you should never
need someone if you find somebody find
someone if you don't you don't love
yourself before you bother somebody else
through crazy-ass problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
