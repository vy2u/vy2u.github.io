girl my group of friends the overweight
girl they were all like super tiny and
thin and athletic I always just like
felt that I would never be good enough
which is crazy we shouldn't be thinking
like that at all I lost 100 pounds in a
year before I always focused on losing
weight as opposed to actually being
healthy so this time I changed my
mindset I stopped counting calories I
started like moving my body more and
that doesn't mean that I went to the gym
everyday I walked a lot and I ate a lot
of fruits and vegetables and I cooked a
lot before my idea of the gym was oh
well like you're here to lose weight and
like that's the point and it's not
you're there to get stronger you're
there to get rid of stress you're there
to feel better about yourself in your
body just this body awareness of like
what your body can accomplish and what
it can do and that's awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
