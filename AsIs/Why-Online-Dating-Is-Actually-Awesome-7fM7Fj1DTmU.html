stump why are people still so ashamed to
admit they use online dating really
it's weird meeting someone online online
that place we spend basically all our
time yeah crazy no you know it'd be
really weird
getting caught in a hostage situation
accidentally brushing hands with someone
and making eye contact as the room fills
with tear gas and feds form the building
now that would be weird but meeting
online only nine percent of current
couples reported meeting at a bar cafe
nightclub or party so statistically
speaking meeting in real life is
actually weirder than meeting online and
grosser meanwhile one-third of married
couples met online and not just their
dating sites one-fifth of that action
comes from meeting on social media like
Facebook Twitter sorry and the internet
makes dating way easier what are you
doing going out some guy you know
nothing about he could be a murderer or
worse he could hate pizza look I'm not a
vegan or anything I just I don't like
the texture what
he's a total psychopath and you just
wasted an entire evening discovering
something you could have found out from
the comfort of your toilet almost 40% of
America's single population uses online
dating
and that number is only gonna keep
rising so don't feel weird about dating
online it's only weird cuz you're making
it weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
