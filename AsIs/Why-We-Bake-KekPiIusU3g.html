run my own baking company hi my name is
aimy main Robinson I am a mom a wife got
two cocker spaniels my name is Nastasia
Johnson I blog but mostly I just like to
eat dessert my mom was a baker she had
her own business and I got to go on
deliveries with her I think my mom's
influence on me was huge I would get the
calls I was just with the ladies and I
told them all you were taken up to me
and going to pastry school I like to
bring a lot of the things she did to
what I do now it was a little bit of a
twist to make it more modern
I started learn how to bake when I was 8
my grandmother was such an amazing Baker
and I was always able to watch her and
after that I just wanted to be the one
that's like here taste this try this my
family we kind of moved around a lot the
past 5-6 years
I feel baking really has brought a sense
of consistency to our family because we
can be in the kitchen doing everything
together I mean I eat sleep breathe
sweets when I bake I can make any sweet
creation I want I think social medias
really changed baking it makes it more
accessible today I'm gonna be making
double chocolate baked doughnuts with a
chocolate ganache
if I could have my own cooking show it
would be a tour of Donuts around the
world called hashtag donut judgment
today I'm going to make the best
mouth-watering chocolate-chip cookies
ever once they get in the oven everybody
knows mom's been baking today I'm making
a six-layer devil's food cake with
peanut butter buttercream on the inside
and Nestle Tollhouse chocolate
buttercream on the outside I didn't
realize until after I changed careers
kind of what a big deal it was the
baking to me is sort of my happy place
and my goal was to find something that
was gonna make me happy so that's what I
do all day every day and sometimes at
night baking becomes a tradition and
families because a lot of families tend
to congregate in the kitchen people want
that nostalgia they want to feel that
all the time and I feel that every time
I'm in the kitchen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
