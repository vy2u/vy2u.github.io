awesome
when I was 11 years old
over the summer I grew three inches and
lost 30 pounds three months and that was
not on purpose and there was nothing I
can do to gain weight and I felt really
really insecure I would get really down
on myself and I would always just be
really hard on myself because I didn't
look like the people that were praised
around me I felt confused about myself I
was really shy as a kid and I only had
like a few close friends I just wanted
to fit in with all the girls that were
around me which meant dyeing my hair
blond getting good contact I just sort
of felt like a freak I'm so different
from everyone and I felt like my
differences were really clear to
everyone I was often the only Asian
American girl often the only person of
color and really just felt like an
outsider wasn't pretty enough cool
enough talented enough that the right
thing I was depressed and I never felt
like I had a purpose in life I felt like
I didn't have a sense of style I felt
like I didn't fit in with the other kids
I really just felt uninteresting
compared to everyone around me insecure
and doubtful of myself I was constantly
questioning everything I was doing I was
constantly trying to shove myself into a
skin that just wasn't me
the moment I accepted myself as is was
when I realized that perfect is boring
cookie-cutter beauty where everybody is
in a box and looks the same is boring
and it's also impossible to live up to I
started all of myself as is in my late
teens when I started to realize that
some of the best people in the world
were different from everyone it was such
a moment of power for me when I accepted
myself as is because I stopped wishing
to be something else I stopped wishing
to have a gender that made more sense or
be the right kind of trans person and I
started embracing what it meant to just
be me and live in the world in a way
that felt good for me and to celebrate
my own unique incredible version of
beauty I don't think that I really
accepted myself until I was in my 20s
and it started become clear to me that
the things that made me feel different
were actually talents they were actually
strengths and things that I shouldn't
hai less than a year ago last May when I
took some time to actually like
disconnect from everything like I
finally found happiness with myself like
it wasn't about anyone else around me it
wasn't somebody else bringing me happy
with myself and that was when I started
to really feel like me as I am is just
good enough more than good enough it's
awesome when I started college and for
the first time I was aware that there
were other people out there like me who
fought like me who dressed like me who
felt like me who was the same size as me
and that was really eye-opening I don't
feel like there was a like aha moment
it's more been a series of gradual
understanding that if I don't show up if
I don't represent if I don't speak out
no one with my perspective will I think
the moment that I accept myself as is
honestly hasn't come yet and I don't
expect it to ever a hundred percent calm
I think that's okay because I'm working
on myself every day and every day I'm
getting a little more confident every
day is a journey for me the difference
now is that my growth in change is
because I wanted it not because others
think I should be something that I don't
want to be now I feel like I accepted
myself as is in relationship to all the
other Outsiders and all the other people
who feel like they don't fit in and in
my
to get them to make the world the kind
of place where we can all feel like we
belong and contribute I finally started
accepting myself around my junior year
of college I started wearing like bold
lipsticks and I started dressing a
little bit out there and it came to a
point in time where I was like man like
I appreciate myself and I love myself so
much that if anybody disagrees with me
or my lifestyle that's in my life then
they don't need to be in my life because
overall that's hurting me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
