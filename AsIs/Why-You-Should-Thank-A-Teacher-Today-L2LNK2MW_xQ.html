three geometric shapes now if I take one
of them off then you have it what's
wrong a Morgan no one is dead now oh no
no it's okay look look see teachers are
definitely underappreciated or school
seven years ago our fathers brought
forth teachers have to answer millions
of questions how big his outer space
where do my sister from from is the Sun
following me teachers have to deal with
every type of emergency no one is gonna
know that you had an accident okay wrap
this around your hair teachers have to
know everything about everything get a
second so in a way this is a very
realistic portrayal of a volcano
cuz everybody thought I was gonna
explode but it didn't explode I'm the
math giraffe then I'm here to say we're
gonna use her mind cameras now and
imagine people running down the hill cuz
they were warned but they're like nah
this thing isn't gonna blow you guys are
gonna stick around town and see what
goes down long division long division
not wrong division teachers have to be
like a courtroom judge they must be
honest and fair you'll read you the
answer you put on your math test I
forgot to study last night so here's a
drawing of a donkey
during roller skates it's a good drawing
but you got to study teachers have to be
really really nice all the time it's
harder than it looks
hi miss Rachel I made you some cookies
Wow
for me thank you we made a chocolate
chips favorite and hot dogs
even when they're not at work they're
still working Lindsay what are you still
doing here
this waiting for my mom no way with you
teachers have to be good role models
they must challenge and inspire their
students Oh Stuart your shoes untied
when help Oh need any help because it
taught me mr. OSHA
in conclusion teachers have the hardest
job in the world what amazing things did
your teacher do for you tree sir
yes
I'm a tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
