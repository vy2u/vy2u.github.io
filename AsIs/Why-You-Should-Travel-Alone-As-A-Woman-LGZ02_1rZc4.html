didn't really think about the fact that
I was traveling alone I just kind of did
it I didn't really have a plan for
post-college so I just wanted to do
something fun and crazy and not anything
permanent but just do something on my
own I was studying abroad in Italy for a
couple months and I wanted to go to
Spain one weekend and no one else wanted
to go so I just decided to go on my own
I remember being alone on the plane on
the way to Paris thinking what have I
gotten myself into I remember wanting to
land and find the next flight back home
I have traveled all over the United
States by myself it wasn't until later
on that it occurred to me like oh I'm
actually by myself and I'm totally doing
this whole thing on my own independently
I think when I realized most I
constantly wanted to be validated by
other people about the amazingness of
the things I was seeing or doing why
couldn't I just believe it was amazing
without other people validating me the
coolest part about traveling alone is
the people you meet along the way
sometimes it's really nice to be alone
it's the most adult that I've ever felt
in my life nobody that knows me has any
idea where I am it's quite a freeing
sensation
you're your own decision-maker you don't
have to rely on anyone else so if you're
an easygoing person you can kind of just
go with the flow but just remember that
people are softer and gentler and and
more helpful than you could imagine
bad things gonna happen anyway so be
prepared be knowledgeable but don't
select yourself out of things stay in
alternative places and
don't just stick to the beaten path
traveling alone as a woman is exciting
traveling alone is it it makes faintly
free time going a lot is a confidence
boost traveling alone is empowering
traveling alone is badass
lonely scary but it can also be quite
amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
