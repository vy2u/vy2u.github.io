what's the point of starting a puzzle if
you don't finish it we start a lot of
things you don't finish okay if anybody
can find the piece with the guys side
burn let me know there Gary has worked
been oh um fine
you know so the same old the bird flew
into one of the conference rooms either

I heard about that
oh you did I hear a lot anything I
should be concerned about Anna always
does this
you know when I'm introduced Kendall to
my friend I do to Beyonce Khan he said
friend like with no ass and you should
have a good time at the concert and if
she didn't like my friend so maybe you
should suggest doing I don't know
something that Hannah likes I have done

charcuterie plate I love picnics that
sounds great Hey thank you it was
actually Gary's idea no uh so Gary said
that Kendall told him about how you
don't like my guy friends and so he came
up with the idea that if I did something
you really liked like a picnic then you
basically couldn't say no okay then we
could all meet each other and have fun
are you serious are you serious Gary
oh I'm sorry he should know better he
knows better he didn't mean to I thought
that I could fix all this is not the
relationship committee okay we do not
need fixing that's
I met Brian and I like each other a lot
for the record there was four condoms in
his pocket before you came okay well
