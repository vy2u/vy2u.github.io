you like that it's not a fancy wine term
yeah that was some Somali a
we're trying white is today so does the
lipstick taste like wine hope it doesn't
taste like wine because that's gonna
trick some people it's eating it is
probably toxic hoping that I'll smell
like wine I don't really care what the
color is someone kisses me do bacon trip
to wine ten remind him to lips oh there
are different colors you put it on a
cheese board these are gorg oh my god
these are really cute
I'm really into this yeah come to mama
okay oh I appreciate this Oh
oh my god it does look like a wing man
just look at it this is like four little
mice is having a little dinner
mmm great no it doesn't make it good so
it smells great smarty clean No - look
it's really oh yeah hi I'm going in
again it feels more like a stain but
very liquidy this is a stain a stain
esque sort of situation the Reds are a
little stronger
all right come Oh the ultimate test
it didn't really come off yeah it's like
actually barely coming up get our
glasses there's really not anything on
there I'm hoping on the rim I think this
is pretty subtle from the low white this
is exactly what my well looks like to me
and it takes better than row in my
opinion it doesn't come off like doesn't
come off at all this is like a really
good idea for you know the one the wine
lover in your life it's like a really
cute gift and a novelty item but it's
actually very practical as well if you
know someone like so I move either this
and the bottle of wine yeah so cute
bringing together two things that we
love so dearly it used to that Cheers to
wind him to Mountain all of my worst
decisions are made were drinking wine so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
