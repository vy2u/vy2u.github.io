so today we are answering the most
googled questions about women women I'm
hoping most of them are about women and
for women I think gonna be mean they're
like why are women such bitches I have a
feeling there's gonna be some priory
it's only natural I think we're gonna
get a lot of like biological questions
why do women go to the bathroom with
each other why do women look so freakin
good all the time I don't have a lot of
high hopes
oh we're gonna be here for a while I
find it fun it's like a fun little thing
you get to do and you go out it makes me
look less dead
I would be a walking corpse if I didn't
wear a red lipstick it brings out our
features and it makes us in the boss
auspicious it feels very therapeutic
it's also like artistic like look at her
shins right now she's like killing the
game it tells me a lot about her
aesthetic and wearing your natural face
without any makeup
I think it's seen as beautiful more now
but like a few years ago it was kind of
like you have to wear makeup
historically men wore makeup powdered
wigs and powdered faces and high heels
the drag was on point
I'm gonna have to go with the patriarchy
on this one it just depends on what I
did for Thanksgiving women's clothes are
not so tight
some women walk those are sorry if
there's two different answers there's
why are clothes made this way for women
and then there's why do women wear these
clothes they wear the clothes because
that's what's offered to celebrate our
curves and to celebrate the natural
aesthetic that the female body is also
it's sexy some women like to
show off their bodies cuz that's their
prerogative and their bodies are
beautiful why are your short so long
that is a good question I don't
know I don't know we even created a
market of women feeling powerful through
their beauty so you can charge more for
women's products shorter it is the
easier it is to mess up so I feel like
men's haircuts should be insane I think
the way to trap women into spending more
money it's a racket
I don't women wear thong Cesare the
early 2000s in like Paris Hilton and
 so there's no life ya know
underwear line still no you're wearing
underwear god forbid I actually loved
thong
I hate songs I love grandma panties this
is porn free game that's what that
question song they're gross therefore
your butthole if you find a good comfy
Donn great but you don't have to wear it
you're gonna see a panty line no matter
what if you don't want to see a panty
line go commando women wear thongs
because of Cisco I don't know if the
team's know about that one hey Google
that Gen Z oh yeah yeah I think it's up
to each woman to decide if she's
attractive to beards or not yeah she's a
little texture of my saddle you know
what I mean
I personally don't but I think they look
good aesthetically if they have a long
beard they better not give a if I
shaved beards make my kitty part like I
mean I even gonna live even as a gay
woman I like a man with a beard but
women do not like mustaches no the key
here is you need the full thing that's
hot
yeah women have very different
preferences for how much muscle tone
both in men and women I'm not
necessarily into like super big muscles
but again that's my preference and
there's nothing wrong with those I like
my men thick I'm a thick woman and so I
need to feel like I'm not gonna break
you I just don't always like the
mentality that's associated with muscled
men who cares about the muscles just
dress queue at the end of the day always
work on what's happening inside first
because if you're trying to attract
someone it doesn't matter how many
muscles you are if you're a garbage
human being
and it's still not sure I'm sweating
right now so on our floor there used to
be a lot more men sitting on it and they
would always be like it's too hot and be
like it's too cold and I don't know I
read some study about how we interpret
temperature differently the temperature
is set with men in mind that's just
whatever your body is like they're dudes
I get cold we all come from different
climates we have different Heritage's
and that probably has something to do
with how our bodies interact with cold
and heat our lip gloss is made of ice it
is a government woman only secret but
it's true ice that's science for you we
could ask that of any person on this
earth and the answer would be different
a relationship is all about balance and
having someone that supports you in
everything that you do end of the day we
want to be satiated I want to be able to
trust you I want to be in my own
individual and I would like a dog you
want somebody to share yourself with
across the board everyone just wants to
be truly loved yeah you're loved and
known like I understand you as a person
if you're interested in someone you
should ask that girl what they're
looking for in a relationship ask for a
question why see get to know
to come yes candy bars I'm a sleepy derp
so sometimes I wake up and I reach for
something if I tell you this is not
going to satisfy me don't say oh but I'm
gonna do it in a way that it will and
you're gonna look foolish like you're
gonna look dumb you want good sex but
after it's over you want to feel like
they still love you I know to fall
asleep immediately right try not to fall
asleep like too quick mean to give it
like five minutes I think what women
want in bed is someone to appreciate
their unique desires and take the time
to learn what those movie just let us
tell you what I want we're gonna let you
know and then can you do it we're coming
to cut your internet off that's it
women's rights are human rights for
people it's gonna if we didn't have
women we wouldn't have a population we
offer a different perspective that I
think is really needed in our society
right now everyone just wants to be
loved and respected as someone who gets
a lot of like what can we do to help
black people I am kind of glad that
people are googling these questions I
guess rather than going up to women and
being like why do you deserve rights
equal rights across the board about
gender sex a Missa tee orientation any
of that stuff does it mean that it's
taking away from anyone at the top
without your mother you would not be
here and she deserves every right that
your father you or your brother has
thank you so much Google people what you
trying to get from us they are though
yeah I always think that I like look
around that I'm like wow this world is
so lucky makes your heart melt is it
because of our makeup our hair our
clothes our personality our intelligence
our spirit there are so many things that
make each and every one of us beautiful
I think that all women are strong and
that's what makes them beautiful I was
surprised by these questions they were
deep
