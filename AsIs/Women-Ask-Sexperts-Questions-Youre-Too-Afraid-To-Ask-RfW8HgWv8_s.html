going in and pressing up it's usually a
couple of centimeters in and you can
tell but oh that's actually quite
accurate it's kind of ribbed
I'm dr. Ruth McGregor and I would
consider myself a professional pervert I
have had sex what a couple of times
not too many the right amount I feel you
I have been there I mean your vibrator
the toys you using that's what they're
designed for what I would suggest is
bring it into the bedroom show however
you're sleeping with how you like to be
pleasured it probably just comes down to
communication without mine sometimes and
usually quite often slip into things
that are taboo and things that are taboo
often have an erotic charge and it
doesn't mean we have a desire for that
to happen it doesn't mean we hope that
dead relatives are watching us massbay
cool if you do no judgment
first of all really really common maybe
you haven't hit on that combination of
physical stimulation and this is so so
important the psychological factor in
orgasm is key being relaxed feeling safe
just that simple fact of feeling
self-conscious during sex even during
masturbation some people aren't going to
experience orgasm and that's okay if we
take that intense fixation and pressure
of orgasm being the only reason to have
sex yeah yeah they actually happens both
men and women and they're also referred
to as nocturnal emissions which will be
the name of my band when it comes to
orgasm there seems to be a lot of
pressure on achieving it sort of as soon
as you can but really the fun is just in
taking your time and if it happens it
happens
first of all there could be a day when
you become in three minutes another day
maybe with a different partner it takes
you an hour and a half
20 minutes is really short I promise
vibrators are designed for that purpose
so they're usually very good at their
jobs and there's absolutely nothing
wrong with only being able to orgasm
using toys the walls undergo a regular
cycle of preparation for this job and is
discharged from the body yes female
ejaculation is very real the reliable
thing that confirms that the hell
ejaculation exists is your experience
and the experience of thousands of other
people Aristotle wrote about it does
that help yeah I'm sure it does everyone
respects the Canaris tatl but not your
experience when someone says I don't
believe that female ejaculation exists
because I haven't seen it happen you say
well can you please explain to me how
the power of urethral ducts interface
with the urethral sponge this is the
urethra where P comes out and it's also
very Jack youlet comes out and I can't
really say this enough it is not urine I
don't care what you think so what
happens when you're putting pressure on
there and activating that area is the
urethral sponge and the glands there
they fill up with liquid so we have two
liquids happening when female
ejaculation occurs usually the bladder
sends out the clear
watery liquid which joins up with the
ejaculate from the sponge and out it
goes up aretha ejaculation and orgasm
are actually two separate processes
though they often occur together science
stay safe stay strange and don't get too
wrapped up in what's normal because you
know what no one's normal and that means
everyone in and use Lube all the time
male ejaculation is celebrated it's
talked about it's the finale to every
promo imagine if the finale was women
ejaculating let's make that happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
