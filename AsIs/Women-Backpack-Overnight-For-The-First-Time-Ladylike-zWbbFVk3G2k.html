experienced I am with like hiking and
backpacking and camping is probably I
did not see any instructions
I'm putting sunscreen on with a brush
listen I got it Sephora a one
most of people in ladylike we're not the
most outdoorsy folks oh yeah like that
and I was like yo let's dive right in
let's get a backpacks go to forest let's
find a dope badass guide and let's just
go I am Helen Sweeney and I am a
survivalist I have been hiking camping
and backpacking my whole life thank
heavens we have Helen because if we did
not I'll be right at the office type it
away on my little computer having a
normal Friday yesterday we went to a
camping store and spent about seven
hours in there and I like shopping but
that was too much we should adjust Falls
not right now happy hour packs around 30
pounds and they take up my entire back
and going down to basically below my
butt my pack is so heavy but I am
incredibly strong so it's gonna be fine
and I am optimistic about this you are
all going to make this we're going to go
all the way up to the pines today we
started off pretty fine we all had our
packs on we were just trying to sort of
figure out everything it is our one of
our hike and it's going pretty well I
did catch a little horny toad little
lizard thingy oh my god how's it going
hunter your back spill my back I
adjusted my pack and my back feels so
much better
we're on mile two really one and A one
and a half that's it
the first part of the hike our main
objective was just to filter water these
lovely ladies are trying to figure out
how to put together this water purifying
we had a water filter that we hadn't
even opened until we got to the stream
and it was a bit of a struggle where's
our bottle without it do we have another
piece question hi Jenna catching
butterflies
Helen's already filtered three gallons
of water meanwhile we have all these
pieces at the fall I ended up being the
designated person who just held the
bottom of the filter in the pool he just
finished filling up SAS Camelbak and so
now she's going to taste it to see how
it tastes or die once we got the water
pump working it's pretty easy to do so
after the water situation we refilled
everything we had we've had even more
weight than before and we went on this
semi steep incline hiking is already
hard when you have like a bunch of stuff
weighing you down it's gonna be harder
there were moments where I was just like
what did I get myself into like I
genuinely genuinely was very afraid I
think all of us were sort of a little
bit shocked at just like how precarious
the ledge would feel I'm feeling the
incline I think the altitude a little
bit I don't think I'm as scared of
heights as holy cow just came up on this
view we're in the literal wilderness
like we saw a sign that said too much
wilderness
when we arrived at the campsite like it
was incredibly beautiful there were
trees everywhere
right here the end of the hike was was
it pretty much like it comes to Jesus
yeah I was like here we are what do you
enjoy about being out here it's home
we're about to start setting up our tent
and Helen's done
I did not see any instruction it's so
tranquil out here - yeah like once you
get settled and like start sort of like
actually setting up your area like tents
and things and like just getting more at
home you know just you like kind of
relax a little bit we learned how to
make cordage out of yucca plants I
didn't know that was a thing that you
can make really really strong rope out
of a yucca plant collecting sticks for
the fire because we weren't very good at
making rope you gotta hold it well Jenna
and stop hunting for wood I mean while
Freddy night here making gentle yucca
cordage the web the look at them working
huh they're not actually doing Helen and
I i mean Helen mostly but I helped make
the fire we have a bunch of water on
hand on standby in case it gets a little
bit out of hand I could also bring the
poop trowel out so we can shovel some
dirt on it oh do you have to put this
I've got the poop trowel oh I love my
loss it gets all this food it's all
freeze-dried we're going to be testing
it out none of us like really
anticipated how difficult boiling water
would be to paper cup I filled it up
with water the fire is not going to burn
the cup as long as there's water on it
our food didn't turn out great this is
what mine looks like pretty good mine
looks like we did get the same meal
however the differences are pretty stark
I got huevos Sun Chips which we found
out after the fact that you need a
skillet also after you put the water in
the bag so we improvised and that looks
like eggs I don't hate it yeah I'm gonna
have matter I'm definitely like I think
we're all very hungry yeah and I think
we're all like moderately satisfied
hidden light we don't want to get fares
so we're gonna go treat it food which
means tie a rope to a rock and throw it
and then hoist the food and leftover
stuff high in the air so the Bears can't
get it oh well it has to go down a
little bit
if you jump do you think you can get it
Fred no soccer probably reset can you
redo you got it
sleeping though sleeping was a thing
Freddy's bundled up it's so cool do you
a pillow
no I mean we miss our friends they're
just next door can you hear them
Oh see something room say hi guys hi
good night and until tomorrow good night
and good luck
it is morning I was freezing the entire
night this is caterpillar Fred look you
see that the head is completely
submerged we later found out that it got
down to the 30s at one point I was just
like Jen I am so cool and she's like do
you want it like cuddler so I was like
yes I was like Jen we're spooning we
woke up packed up our tents said goodbye
to our campsite my campground how do you
feel now that we're done I am happy that
we're done I'm ready to get back to
normal normal life I want to take a
shower
and I want to use a pillow but the hike
down was pretty uneventful right so as
we can see this is Jen's pack I don't
know if you guys can tell but she has
both the kettle and the poop trowel
sticking out the camera bag draped
across jackets on either side the pack
is nearly as tall as she is we see
things that we recognize crew
yeah we made it how do I feel I kind of
can't believe that we did that because
it was just like so overly ambitious
I am very beat like I'm very very tired
but I will say that I am happy that we
took this trip my feet do hurt a bit and
I think that I've got some shoulder pain
but I've been pretty good honestly I
feel like weirdly rejuvenated I knew
that if we had fun and no one died it
would be a success and we definitely
crossed that metric I hope that you all
will look at this as the beginning of a
backpacking experience that on your own
you'll find other places to backpack and
you'll keep on going from this point I
feel proud to say that I have gone
backpacking it wasn't on my bucket list
but now that I've done it I'm putting it
on there so I can check it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
