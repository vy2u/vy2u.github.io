this week we are going to be breaking
plus-sized fashion rules we are trying
on clothes that society has told us we
shouldn't wear long time ago someone
assembled a list of rules that bind all
plus-size women and if we just abide by
them people won't be mean to us but that
isn't true people are mean to us anyway
so what's the point don't wear stripes
you can't wear crop tops if you're this
size no strapless dresses not wearing
white after Labor Day we're supposed to
be dressed in a way that's flattering
and so all these rules are supposed to
make us look flattering I hate the word
flattering so much that I would rather
wear a steel tampon than hear this word
again yeah I honestly think like a whole
bunch of small white people in Europe
made up fashion rules and now we're
supposed to go buy it so this week every
day we'll be having a new fashion
challenge I'm gonna push myself extra
and to really like just full-on show my
body I think it's actually gonna be like
a little harder in practice because as
much as I know in my heart that these
rules are nonsense they still govern the
world around us each day is going to be
very different
one day I'll probably be loving life and
the next day I'll probably be hating it
so basically I'll be like my 13 year old
self this is the week that I'm going to
conquer these fashion rules
all right I'm wearing my crop top and
high-waisted pant outfit and apparently
I lost a lot of weight or at least it
looks like you've lost a lotta weight
which is like wow so basically like all
of me was covered except for like a
little strip around the middle it was
like my Achilles stomach basically
definitely like confidence boot camp has
this been giving you anxiety all day ah
yeah
so the crop top and high-waisted pants
day wasn't supposed to be that hard for
me because I wear that often so I wore
very tight high-waisted pants and I was
not for it I'm sure it's one of those
things that like I'm self-conscious
about but know what also say anything or
notice I just set myself up here I'm
trying to be positive but it's not
working I have no idea why we did crop
tops and high-waisted pants on the first
day because it was literally like hi
welcome to hell here's my stomach day
two is short shorts woof here's why
shorts are dumb number one they're pants
but they don't fulfill their whole
obligation they're like pants that
didn't try hard enough now they're short
they're shorts
I've always enjoyed like showing a
little bit of like butt cheek in the
back but the problem is is it like you
can't show butt cheek in the back
without showing front Sheik in the front
I was really worried about chafing but
that didn't really happen
everything was comfortable but I'm
getting a little compliments I so I'm
feeling pretty cute right now I don't
know I'm feeling comfy it's about 60
degrees outside and I'll
and it's raining so I decided to put on
some tights hmm well I had to shave my
legs for like first time in four months
well I think it's it's sexy because it's
like not over-the-top blue bitch but
it's good footage yes I mean honestly
like I don't mind it as long as I ignore
everything happening in my southern
hemisphere it's pretty good I always
think about the inner tube around my
middle and how it looks other people
think about it are you really like
looking at someone's problem areas all
the time when you're hanging out with
them that's weird
no one does that this isn't what I
wanted to wear today really and here I
am Anna you look so good I don't know if
it's my like state of being right now so
I think I look okay in it but it's not
something that I'm like overly excited
to wear nothing should ever be this
tight it does not feel good but it looks
great people say I look hot I don't know
someone call me Kim Kardashian feels
very weird to be in a body con dress and
not be out with like 12-year sorority
sisters in Vegas I remember going into
the limited the adult limited because I
was too big for loops and there was a
dress that had black and white
horizontal stripes my mom was like no
like you can't wear that so I was like
eyeing your dress Oh feel so soft and I
kind of want to get it you should get it
I bought it like like last week getting
to reprogram myself with a a miracle and
being really opened me up to more credit
card debt in the future whenever I see
something cute normally I am NOT a very
girly feminine person so I decided to
wear like this full-on like lemons
outfit I had a lot going on there but I
loved it
I hate these pants I feel like
they make me look huge actually
looked like a real leopard running
through the jungle like my ass is huge
in them I think I put more into it than
I thought Hayden
no counterpoint no okay
relaxing outside think about bikinis
when you're sitting your stomach trues
so just getting comfortable with that
you know what if you're like confident
with your body you're gonna exhume that
I was really happy like once you step
out of your house and something that
you're not confident in you're like ah
and then people like feed you compliment
or like say that they like it and then
you're like okay and then you get on
that mind set and you're like why was I
mad in the first place oh you're
shooting video yeah I love it
coming all the way down no it's like oh
no oh my god I can't even talk about it
well I'm gonna have to but I am an adult
human professional lady and I look like
I'm about to go run a marathon in an 80s
sitcom about a mom who just got her
groove back.the boobs are kind of out I
really liked it I was super comfortable
I'm digging that this has come back into
style
I would routinely go workout on this so
I'm calling an athleisure athleisure day
to me is like I just walked out of a
really cool dance class I don't know I
think it looks really cool I love this
outfit I love it so much it's actually a
little confusing when I was in high
school I actually dress more masculine I
wore like lots of shirts and ties
something that I kind of stopped doing
because I realize that like oh like
that's not what you're supposed to do
because like I'm supposed to be more
feminine it's kind of a thing that I
abandoned I like suits
I like shirts and I like undone bow ties
once I figure out how to tie them
understand how sexy and fun menswear is
I think I knew it all along I just
buried it I wore this look all day today
and it went over really well
everyone who loved it like stopped ask
me where it was from said I look so good
that I look sharp I think like tucking
in my shirt and buttoning up that shirt
I just felt like a mix between like
Ellen DeGeneres
and pitbull I felt a little bit more
like pepper which are always the girls
I'm attracted to I was in a very
tailored blazer and like great pants and
I felt like the best stress European man
I felt like a French man like on
vacation it was fantastic
yes you should totally do this you're
going to be real sad some days but then
one day is going to happen where you
wear something you would never expect
and then you become Cinderella you have
got to wear what you want to wear if you
feel beautiful and confident in a
certain item go for it I think as people
we decide to tell ourselves like no we
can't do this and we cut ourselves off
from feeling more confident or more sexy
like I don't care if you have two
followers on Instagram or a million
followers on Instagram you post that
selfie and whatever clothes you want and
you will look good and it doesn't matter
because you're doing it for you rules
are designed to make people feel like
they're behaving but if you're not happy
following them then throw them in the
ocean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
