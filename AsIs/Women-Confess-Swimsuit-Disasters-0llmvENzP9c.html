bleeding all over the place.
(upbeat music)
- So one day I was swimming in the pool,
I ducked underwater,
my swimsuit bandeau top
just fell right down,
came back up, fixed myself,
no one saw me, and went back underwater
to find a little child
was there the whole time
wearing goggles, just peekin'.
- Once when I was in eighth grade,
I went to a pool party with
this girl that I had a crush on,
and I was wearing a
t-shirt over my swimsuit,
'cause I was embarrassed,
and I was adjusting that
t-shirt in the water
and accidentally hit her in the nose.
She started bleeding all over the place.
We didn't get together.
- The other day I had to leave the beach
before my bikini top was dry,
so I just threw my shirt over it
and then we were at a grocery
store not near the beach.
I looked down and I realized that I had
two giant wet patches on my boobs.
People gave me some really strange looks.
- In Germany with my German friends,
we met at the beach.
I realized that I was the
only one with a bikini on.
It was a nude beach, everyone was naked.
It was so embarrassing,
but my dignity was more important.
I couldn't face to take it off.
- I bought the cutest
strappy one piece this year
and when I got it and
looked at the tag, it said,
&quot;I don't do well in water.
&quot;I'm better for posing by the pool.&quot;
And I was like,
&quot;What the hell?
&quot;How can you make a swimsuit
that you can't swim in?&quot;
- I was at the beach
with my crush at the time
and we were really excited
to spend some time together.
So we jump in the water
and before I know it,
this enormous wave just topples me over
and takes the top half of
my bikini kind of with it.
He had already made eye contact,
but then tried to like look away,
and so I duck under the
water and put on my swimsuit
and we both kind of just
pretended like nothing happened.
We just never talked about it.
- So I had this one bikini
that I absolutely loved
and I wore all the time,
and I was at a pool party one time,
went into the bathroom,
looked in the mirror,
and realized that the fabric had worn away
to the point where it
was basically see through
and you could see all my boobs.
- We were at our community pool,
so there was this guy I
wanted to impress so bad,
and I was doing all these crazy dives.
And this last one I did,
and then I realized that my bikini bottom
was floating on the water.
It was so embarrassing,
but I dated the guy afterwards.
