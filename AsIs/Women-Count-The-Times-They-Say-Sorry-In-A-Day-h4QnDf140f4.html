that's my mommy
today I'm gonna be counting how many
times I say I'm sorry say sorry for me
is almost like a natural instinct
it's very automatic I'm gonna guess that
I say sorry about
at least 15 times a day I'm feeling
pretty good about it I don't think that
I'm like overly apologetic but I guess
we're just gonna have to find out I'm
reading this article and basically it
says that women's reasoning for
apologizing more than men is a link to
our perception of politeness and that
makes so much sense so I just stopped to
get a coffee and I spilled it all over
the place because I was saying sorry to
someone who was literally in the way
from me getting this so I apologize
while they were in the way and I spilled
it and that's what happened so the first
time I said sorry was in the morning I
apologized to someone for not saying
there you go which I feel like is kind
of a normal thing to do I just apologize
for someone on the coffee line
because the coffee machine was taking
two which is not my fault
I said sorry to my fir nephew yes that's
right my fir nephew assist his dog I
walked in the house and accidentally
stepped on her because she always likes
to stand at the door when she hears the
key cept on the dog said sorry not like
she understood what I was saying but I
said anyway the next time I said sorry
was I had unpackaged a bunch of things I
had ordered for work so I had boxes
sitting in a corner and one of the
interns asked if he could move them and
I was like sorry I'm on my way back from
lunch and I've already said I was sorry
about six people who haven't walked fast
I just went to open the door to the
bathroom and someone from the other side
opened it as they were leaving and I
said sorry
then they said sorry and then we just
awkwardly like shuffled past each other
but like I wasn't really sorry I didn't
know they were there okay I just tried
to recreate that and there was actually
there and I did it again
so I just had a meeting and I showed up
on time but I said I was sorry
I do crafts and projects for work so I
had to paint a wall and everybody knew
that I was painting this wall and
everyone was okay with it but I had a
co-worker who brought it up again and
then I apologized even that this was
something everybody knew I was going to
do I didn't need to apologize for it I
wanted to take a picture for my
Instagram of the hospital that my sister
was at because I'm really excited that
I'm an auntie there was someone standing
in front of the sign so walking over to
the side I said sorry even though they
weren't technically in my way and I
technically wasn't in their way I still
said sorry
so I just apologized because I opened
them
and then I closed it when I was done as
my mom taught me to do but there was
something behind me was getting in there
I feel like I could have left it open
but instead it closed it faiths re bred
are you sorry see I can make people say
sorry too actually that's probably
against the point of this video just
filled up some really hot tea and then
someone comes around the corner
knocks into me
those whitey
come on idea
I apologize I said sorry
nine times within 24 hours
I think that's honestly a low number
from what I'd normally what I normally
would do I feel like because I was
conscious of the fact that I was
counting my sorry's I was more conscious
of how many times I said it the total
amount of times I apologized in my day
was six and every time I say sorry I
feel like I've done something wrong and
that's not a productive way to go
through the day I can't imagine I did
six things wrong that day that deserved
apologizing so I think the lesson I'm
taking out of this is to really try to
be conscious and stop apologizing so
it's the end of the day and I am
pleasantly surprised because I only said
sorry three times which is crazy because
I definitely thought it was gonna be
more than ten today was different
because I knew I was supposed to keep
track of how many times I was saying
sorry she was actively trying to avoid
it
and when I told co-workers I was doing
this people were like yeah you do say
sorry a lot this is definitely something
I need to stop especially if other
people are like oh yeah that makes sense
that you're doing that video because you
do that a lot today I said I was sorry
9:00 and times there's two sorries
sorry's that are meaningful like for
friendships and relationships that are
really really important and then sorry's
that are just basically a reaction to
anxiety and politeness and feeling like
you just have to say you're sorry for
existing and those are totally not
necessary and I'm gonna work harder on
removing those sorry's from my life
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
