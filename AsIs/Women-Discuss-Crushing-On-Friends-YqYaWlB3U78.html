sexual tension is fun but if it doesn't
lead to anything and then sexually
frustrated and mad this is like the
lesbian lifestyle you love with your
best friend oh my god this happened I
think I've ever revealed it I've been
too showy
I'm bad at this cuz like I just say it
but like I feel like maybe I should be a
little bit more coy I hate playing games
I would probably ask all my other
friends except for that friend if I
thought that friend was interested in me
I had a best friend in high school where
we were like clearly into each other
finally we hugged up once and we're like
this is amazing this is we're gonna be
great and then we like didn't work out
dating wise and then the friendship was
kind of ruined I think I have nightmares
of like if I ever liked a good friend
like going in to kiss them and then
being like ah I just hate feeling like
I'm being led on and then like it comes
down the line and then eventually
they're like oh no like I was just
flirting to get out my pent-up energy
but like there's actually nothing there
what work Frenchie can't do it as you
work together I agree I've done it and
it's awful I did it too I would probably
speak in metaphors for a while and then
I would eventually tell them so my
friend is really in love with my friend
what should she do asking for a friend
there's eye signs like if you're going
in it completely blind just hoping to
like your back just it might not hope
for the best I've hooked up with friends
before and then are you still friends
yeah you have to decide if going into
them dating if you guys break up badly
is it worth losing the friendship you
have to like say what you want like yeah
great you want a relationship but act
like you want one like communicate talk
get to know someone a lot of my
girlfriends and boyfriends have been
people that I was friends with first so
one of us had to make that leap it's
just about communication making sure
that it's something
both of you want to do it hey Chloe yes
you see you dating anyone right now
Oh wide open are you what are you into
um it's all metal brown hair well see I
know Chloe doesn't want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
