a wild night and you just like Barroso
to Goods Club oh if I could just talk to
my like younger self I just feel like
the ultimate idiot I'm like so nervous
so if this ed is soon
as a person high school I knew I was
weird but I don't think I fully embraced
it a lot and I was afraid to really like
be myself and show it to the fullest I
didn't really know a group I belong to
socially and I think that reflected in
the way that I dress I would wear like
white tennis shoes and I loved loose
fitted clothing and I always like wore a
bow and back of my hair I don't know
what my thought process was when I got
ready in the morning but let me just
tell you it was not cute my signature
look was like a graphic t-shirt that
said something quirky some ill-fitted
jeans a headband or a bow and then a
vest just to mix it up a bit you could
bet I was wearing shorts some kind of
boots like ugg boots and a brightly
colored jacket hair in a ponytail oh god
these earrings this is taking me back to
ninth grade oh come on really look at
this oh my it's crazy how close can
really transport you back in time like I
put on these eggs in these shorts and I
really feel like the high school version
of myself I don't want to step out in
public and I'm scared about the
reactions I'm gonna get I'm not looking
forward to wearing this for a whole day
like I'm already uncomfortable in them
this headband I really hope that I
forget that it's there because it's just
not my thing
all right I got my clothes it's time to
go out into the world this is my new
look I'm like so nerve
to let people see me in this justine
what do you think of my outfit you
remind me of every girl I went to high
school with as long as you love what
you're wearing that is all that is
important so what do you think of my
fashion I think you look a bit confused
confused I mean you look different
you look like like you're about to go
play dodgeball they're so big
well I thought this was cute back in
high school who told you that
it escapes to an elevator I feel like no
one could possibly take me seriously
while I'm hearing this I'm so confused I
like saw you from a distance I was like
who is that my pants are a lot more like
baggy than I'd like them to be even
though they're skinny I don't know who
thought that was cute but it's not no
god I just look a mess today walking
around work and passing all these people
and these producers that I really
respect makes me so uncomfortable I
don't want them thinking that this is
like how I really dress I just feel like
the ultimate idiot okay so it's like the
middle of the day I feel like I'm
constantly like adjusting the jeans and
pulling them up just because they just
don't really fit my ass Davey's just
laughing at me right now I feel like I
said where does one person likes it what
do you think Lauren I used to wear vests
in high school I get it so I think it
looks like fake you're in now that I
have a much better sense of who I am in
my style it's funny how this can feel so
wrong you know at first I was very
self-conscious about wearing my outfit
but now I'm honestly embracing it I feel
confident with these hoop earrings I
know why I wore this now it's just so
comfortable so I'm trying out some
friends outfit guys what do you think do
I think high school U is killing the
game probably yes I did notice something
with like a little different but I was
like you know shoot Brady oh my gosh
today is over I'm so happy I'm ready to
take my hair down and never wear this
again I'm glad I did this challenge it
was a good reminder of how far I've come
and how comfortable I am with myself now
I feel like I looked for so much
validation when I was younger what you
think is so important in high school
doesn't matter years down the line you
should wear things that make you feel
confident comfortable and at the time
this is what I thought I looked Cuban
and there's nothing wrong with that what
I learned through this whole experience
is that if you're confident people will
see that and that's the best style you
can ever have I think it's time went on
I grew to like like wearing the graphic
tee I think that a lot of people said
that I looked young which was really
interesting but I think I've learned
from this experience I think there's
things I'm gonna take with me it's good
to embrace the past and also you know
find ways to not forget about it and
infuse it with your future I'm really
glad that I was able to relive my high
school days and appreciate them for what
they were it's just different from my
normal style I guess yeah sure
