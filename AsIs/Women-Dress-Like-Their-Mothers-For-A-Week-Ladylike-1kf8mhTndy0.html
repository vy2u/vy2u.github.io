whatever Oh Fredrika mm-hmm I asked you
is a question and you're gonna answer it
I don't want to talk about it anymore
you lived inside me and like on and it
just keeps going today I'm going to
transform myself into my mother we're
gonna dress like our mothers did when
they were our age I guess I'll just be
like an 80s cool asian chick
my mom's name is Mumtaz she is very
colorful she's very talkative my mom was
in her early to mid 20s in the 80s she
does have kind of the puffy hair but not
really like the 80s puffy hair kind of
just her natural hair she wore
traditional like shield arkanese plus
sneakers like running shoes
I found the my mom's section just show
Laura her toe bar I don't know why they
have this in like American vintage
clothing store there are a couple of
pictures that she sent me with her and
kind of like a really cute wrap dress
and a shirt my mom's name is teri people
called her TV back in the day anytime
I'm looking for a comedy I just call my
mom she always makes me feel better
back in the 70s she was in her 20s she
was living on an island she was very
like naturally stuff she was just like
hippies status to be a thousand degree I
think I might go with this boho chic
shirt teri was very boho in the 70s she
threw some color in there she had some
nice little like billowy sleeves short
sleeve shirts with like embroidered
flowers so it's just as quite long also
my kids don't do it out so is that how
this yeah my mom's name is Debbie she
has like very strong feelings about
things
she's fiercely loyal if you were like in
a back alley knife fight and you needed
like a mom that would be my mom picked
my mom my mom had like two basic styles
she liked bright colors big patterns she
also wore a lot of short dresses I feel
like I'm going to a very conservative I
love all the details of the skirt I love
the show
I see pictures of her from the 80s and
she is big hair really bold lipstick
really defined eyes it's definitely like
really into the whole 80s pastiche
Elizabeth is very particular she's
really smart she's funny without meaning
to be there's a group chat with my mom
and my two older sisters and at 9:53 my
mom said what are you guys up to
and then at 9:54 not even in like two
minutes later one minute later she
responded with Hello exclamation point
exclamation point question mark question
mark question mark my mom's also just
very very private any photo you see of
my mom will be her body but I've
photoshopped my face onto it my mom was
in her 20s and 1980s she wore a lot of
sweaters with shoulder pads she wore a
lot of button downs with like big bulky
belts this is a blouse that has shoulder
pads and my mom said anything solid
colored with shoulder pads and a
button-down
so I'm dressed like my mom from the 80
my hair is like a beautiful southern
marshmallow
I feel pretty peak mumtaz in this outfit
my mom is very loud very in-your-face I
will be bold this week
part of what I want to achieve this week
is sort of her like free spirit in a
frame of mine in the 70s it makes so
much sense that your mom would wear this
outfit got a lot of attitude but then
it's classy on top when I think of my
mother I just think of someone that is
very much a go-getter I do like the no
 attitude that comes with this
type of outfit we're doing a mom
activity we're going to Freddie's house
to get Freddie's cat his medicine the
funny thing is my mom hates cats
our mom was stylish she was stylish
thank you look pink here doesn't seem
like something that you wouldn't
normally win steven has been wildly
unsupportive of this look the question
is is this your mom's outfit or your
great-great-great great-great
grandmother's outfit what is sex
don't I look sophisticated 80 chic I
mean you look like a mom play setting
it's very nice it's very well done but I
could see it on a nice dining room table
of the seventies the great thing about
the 80s that everything had shoulder
pads it's like the print size I love
spring but the shoulder pads say I also
love negotiating this is one of my mom's
actual dresses and it's kind of fun to
walk around in it oh this is what I see
please will you tell Sofia to call me
back she hasn't called me back my mom is
a very put-together woman and the
clothes that I wore this past week felt
very you know no-bullshit feel like I'm
dressed like a schoolteacher
I'm a school teacher that gets fired I
do feel like I'm wearing a lot of
materials flare jeans are a bit much I
didn't feel as mobile I like to feel
mobile all the clothes from the 80s are
really hot because they're made from
polyester apparently people have been
dealing with Gabi shirt since the time
of the dinosaurs
I look like an Iowa Lucy who also loved
jail a lot of the stuff that I was
wearing is actually stuff that was my
mom's cuz she got really excited about
this and sent me a lot of stuff and I
made me feel a little bit closer to her
which was fun my mom
we just had a lovely brunch how was
brunch guys it was wonderful
overall this week was very educational I
was really surprised at how my tastes
and clothes are so similar to my mom's
taste it was fun to kind of think about
my mom is like a young person it was
cool to kind of see those pictures that
she sent and see all the clothes that
she sent my mom's fashion in the 70s
definitely reflected her personality in
the 70 she was very very free-spirited
and I tried to channel that but I am
slightly neurotic but I did try and keep
in mind to just like chill out my mom is
someone that always has a plan and then
she's also someone that always fulfills
her plan it was actually really cool to
sort of channel that side of her I've
always really felt like if I could just
be a little bit more like my mother
hard-working like my mother then I would
be in a good place thank you so much for
