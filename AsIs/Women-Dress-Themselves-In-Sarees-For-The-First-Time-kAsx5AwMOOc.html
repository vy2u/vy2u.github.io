every time I've tried it's come up
looking like a fitted sheet that I tried
to fold and I always have to have my
grandmother help me I can't wait to see
the look on my mom's face if I don't
fail at this I feel like she's gonna be
so happy and proud of me
hi I'm Amy Desai and I'm gonna show you
ladies how to drape a sari all right you
guys ready yes
all right girls I want to know who here
is actually attempted to tie a sari on
their own you have I just mostly stuff
and then / oh all right so with the
normal sorry you're gonna be working
with about six yards of fabric gonna
start two inches from your navel fully
tucking the sari completely oh my god
you've already done it she did it once
ok good job typically oh my god it's
good you didn't like doing it we're
gonna take this saree and we're gonna
pull it all the way to the edge and then
you're gonna flip it horizontally and
this entire part right here we are going
to pleat how I just gonna hide don't
look like a Bollywood yeah you're gonna
be using these three fingers to pleat
accordion style did you get it there you
go
I didn't think I did it oh you didn't
get any practice did
so now that I have my pleats done this
is going to be the part that goes over
my left shoulder which can also be
called Baloo good girl sitting there
we've made it now we're gonna take this
bunch right here put it around and bring
it over and you're gonna put it throw it
over your shoulder yes you got me like
it it's Molly incoming your Butler
how short or long should be as you can
see Michelle's is really short I know I
cannot believe that sure I like to bend
my knee a little bit and right where
that bend is that's where you want to
end of the bubble to be it's gonna
really help elongate your entire
physique oh my god this is stressful for
a perfectionist and then you're gonna
take the innermost layer right here pull
it nice and taut and then I'm gonna
bring it around did I do that
did you did you didn't it right in this
directly under the first pleat we
started with underneath here yep exactly
like how did this even come to the top
this'll get about it so everybody there
the last part we are moving on to the
last part I don't think I've ever gotten
this far so now what we're left with is
a circle now this little circle is what
we were going to pleat and it's going to
give us our finished pleated look right
in the front of every sorry I mean blast
pleating more bleeding how we were done
with the bleeding there's more cleaning
yet oh there is more we're gonna do the
same method that we did for art Balu
which is the accordion this is harder
than the first yeah this is definitely
the hardest part I'm so focused you like
my greatest accomplishment is if I could
wrap mine on you Masari
this is to make sure your pleats are
nice and straight and it just makes the
pleats really nice and crisp I am so
proud I'm so proud of my babies here oh
yeah I feel accomplished I feel like the
biggest thing I got out of this is more
appreciation for my mother because she
is the go-to sorry person every wedding
and I've tried really hard like really
hard to do this and it's not easy I've
never wrapped my own sari before and
being half Indian I feel like you kind
of like put on different hats per se
depending on which different community
you're in it
was so empowering to be able to wrap a
sari on my own finding a place of
identity can be a bit difficult when you
are mixed-race but today I definitely
feel a stronger connection to my Indian
heritage
