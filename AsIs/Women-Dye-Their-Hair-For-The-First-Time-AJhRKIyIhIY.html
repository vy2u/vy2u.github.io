first time getting my hair dyed I'm
really really excited I feel like it's
about time because I'm 26 so I'm just
gonna go all out and do the color that
I've always dreamed that I'm very
excited I've always wanted to do
something like this particular color but
I've always been kind of afraid to try
I've always wanted like a really cool
crazy color hair I've never done it
because I am a pretty young parent and I
get a lot of judgment as it is but I
want to teach my kids that doesn't
matter what anyone else thinks
you do what you want as long as you're
not hurting anyone else or harming
yourself do something fun today I'm
going to go like a silvery purpley grey
I really like denim because it's kind of
subtle and it goes with roots and I'm a
little nervous too because I think it's
also I've heard like the peroxide burns
a little bit so a little well afraid of
the pain but beauty's pink
Oh oh my god
oh I love it oh my gosh it's amazing
it's everything I wanted and it's so
sparkly and shiny I love it so much I
love his I was afraid it was gonna be a
little too strong like but no it's not
oh my god it's just like shocking to
like want something so bad and always be
too scared and then you do it it looks
better than you ever imagined
oh my god and I'm so excited to show off
my new look I was gonna Know Who I am
that's awesome I feel like a new person
I feel so pretty and confident and it I
wish I had done this sooner it just it
feels so nice if you're thinking about
doing it about coloring your hair
something crazy or wild or weird do it
it's so it's so worth it as a mom I
spend my whole day worrying about other
people and just to have this one thing
for myself it's like it feels so good if
I knew it felt this good I would have
done this years ago
I'm just I'm so happy little cloud nice
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
