mush my diet just consists of like
chicken rice vegetables eggs and peanut
butter during the week I stick to a low
sugar low carb high protein diet on the
weekends I'm a little bit more
lackadaisical with my diet my current
diet is a lot of meat protein I know
nothing about Beyonce's diet except that
I think it's vegan I'm worried this week
about not having new protein while I'm
still training I am a little bit nervous
because I think the vegan and vegetarian
diets tend to be a bit higher in fats
and carbs course we're excited to try
our diet I bet there's something magical
in there anything to get me closer to be
on set
we are the plant-based revolution French
lentil stew it's completely browned
apricot cauliflower rice salad creamy
eggplant lasagna what happens if you
don't like something in here lunch day
five like vacuum-seal
all seems very starchy carbs heavy I'll
just have to do a lot more cardio to
make up for this is Beyonce believes in
it I should at least give it a chance
fairly filling but still pretty white it
doesn't feel like I'm really weighed
down by the food it definitely left me
wanting a little bit more though I'm not
gonna lie
this was alright I'm not like a huge fan
of curry flavors we're not off to a
great start
fine I guess I just finished eating the
first meal and it was actually pretty
good I thought it was gonna be factory
made feeling but it felt like it was
cooked fresh but then vacuum-seal really
just wasn't expecting that kind of
quality
where's your champagne glass that's the
real question that's really good boy
just finish my Beyonce meal it was good
hate the whole thing and I feel pretty
decently full but not too full so
three o'clock and I'm starving
three more hours to eat dinner these
recipes are things that I kind of wish I
knew how to make the fancy vegan stuff
it's cool to get to eat that every day
this one's the ratatouille I'm enjoying
this it's day four it's 12:30 in the
morning and I'm having a lot of trouble
sleeping I don't know it's because I'm
hungry you guys I got a convenient that
I don't have to think about what I'm
gonna eat or prepare
I think I'm ready for it to be over so I
can go back to like my normal diet
because I feel fine but I don't feel
good I'm not gonna lie I'm really
excited that tomorrow's the last day I
gained a pound and I think it's because
I'm not used to just eating a ton of
carbs I'm not like super obsessed with
me so it was like fine not having it I
struggled the most with being hungry
I think I'm used to eating more and I'm
used to eating more often what was so
nice was coming home and having a meal
done I would just pull it out and I knew
it was healthy I knew all the
ingredients I couldn't do this forever
I'm tired and I'm hungry it's not a
great feeling not necessarily a diet for
me but I definitely think it's a diet
for other people I think it was really
healthy tasted pretty good honestly I
wasn't ready for the jelly but I do feel
a little bit more bootylicious I feel
like everyone's gonna hate me for that
