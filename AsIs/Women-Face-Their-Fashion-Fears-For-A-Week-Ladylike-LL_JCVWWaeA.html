Boulevard this week we are facing our
fashion fears hmm hmm to me a fashion
fear is everything that I don't want to
wear that insecurity that I've kept
repressed for years and years and now
focusing on that and doing only that the
thing you don't do on your body
my fashion fear is my boobs just
everything surrounding them the bodycon
dress pants low-rise jeans overalls big
big overalls it'll be interesting
confronting our insecurities head-on
wait I'm like sweating now this is a
real this is actually happening I'm
moose
I'm Tiffany Reese of lucky boo calm I'm
a big believer in facing our fashion
fears because I don't think we should
let clothing have so much power over us
hi I'm Kristin Tiffany it's so nice to
meet you
I need a help I am afraid of bodycon
dresses it's more the being exposed that
freaks me out
I just prefer a flowy dress just in case
I want to eat a big lunch one time I
wore bodycon dress to work and Freddy
was just the whole day like hey and I
was like this is why I don't do it even
though they're all tight-fitting they're
tight fitting in different ways so I'm
hoping you'll find one that's like the
winner the go to so I am afraid to show
my boobs in any sort of way I think I
don't show them or display them because
they are large for my body and I don't
like getting that attention as a kid I
pissed myself constantly you have like
10 to 15 seconds to get everything off
and sit your ass down or else pee is
dripping down your legs and if you're
wearing overalls you can't get them off
in time do you piss your pants a lot
well I have had three kids so the
pissing thing it zip all the way down
then you just sew if you really have to
pee yourself these are the overalls for
you my fashion fear is pants
I don't like pants because I have
something called PCOS and what that
basically means is the majority of my
fat congregates around my stomach and so
whenever I wear pants is just like a
here's that thing I can't get rid of I
have a good variety of stuff to try whoo
and I'm hoping that you will only hate
them 50% I go for pants that cover the
belly button anything below that makes
me stressed do you not like belly
buttons I've never thought about it but
I think I hate belly button
I'm gonna have you start with the long
t-shirt but the shirts are gonna maybe
get a little tighter and shorter as the
week goes so we're gonna push it let's
start with this one okay this girl
what's her name
sexy secretary I do things my grooms so
they just are the marshes like their
name is Marcia here we go we're all
about to experience the marshes and all
their glory I can't wait so these are
full-length overalls so they are similar
to coveralls but they don't cover it all
my bellybutton is indeed exposed I'm
trying to not use my hair as a crutch
we're out here they're a little warm
which is what I was concerned about but
that is the nature of pants and I need
to accept that
step one is accepting pants for who they
are step two I think is to wear them and
step three I think is to throw them in
the garbage so we're gonna skip step
three and just enjoy them and have a
great time this is the worst possible
week for me to be on my period and guess
what week it is
to be honest I'm trying to not think
about it because they're just they're
just so here I think these are more of
like maybe a jeggings material so it's
not really cutting Tiffany gave me the
option to maybe you know tie the shirt
ups like make it a little more like
ba-ba-boom and I decided against it I
feel a little bit like a sausage if I go
to Chipotle at any point during this
week it's just gonna be food baby
central I'm expecting a burrito in
t-minus three weeks more like t-minus 24
hours but I feel uncomfortable about the
fact that the necklines might get
lowered but that's what we're here to do
that's my own insecurity and I have to
deal with it I have to face it I have to
face my fashion fear its alliteration
for you so
wearing my low-rise jeans I just keep
pulling up my pants even though they're
not even falling down but I just keep
pulling them up I want them to be above
my belly button hi
in tough because it adds an extra like
45 seconds to my bathrooms which is sort
of why I was so scared of them in the
first place I do not know how you guys
were pants all the time I do feel
flattered in this outfit but I don't
feel what's the word comfortable I've
only been wearing this shirt for two and
a half hours and it happened someone
exited the bathroom our eyes met but
before our eyes met their eyes met the
marshes I think I look a lot fancier
than usual because I've had a lot of
people open doors for me I think that
the lip and the sunglasses are like
helping me along with this kind of like
character twisted Joan from Mad Men day
to pants got these cords I mean they're
comfortable honestly the one thing I
like about them is like I feel like I
can do cartwheels so this is the lowest
and most revealing outfit that I have
how do you feel about my jeans like a
cocina Millian Vidya I officially made
it through the day wearing this dress
and not covering him up but I was
definitely uncomfortable the whole time
it's not me I'm at a work event I'm
wearing overalls I've gotten so many
compliments or comments on overall it's
like a big surprise I kind of like them
when I'm like outside let's have them
outdoors makes me kind of feel like a
happy farmer is a very boss ass bitch
outfit I love this outfit you know my
fashion favors showing like any boobs or
just like accentuating them Oh
and so here they are I'm just taken by
the dress and the overall effect that it
had like it's just boobs are part of the
ensemble what do you think of my outfit
I love it
you didn't notice anything different
that I'm wearing a really tight dress
it's got little bit red on it oh I mean
I don't know I think it look you've been
staring on my butt
well I always do that as the days go on
I'm starting to hate low-rise jeans a
little bit less I realized why I like
highways to Jean high-waist jeans make
me feel like I have a father movie
low-rise jeans
d situate the B is that a we're all
right judge how do you have to do in the
bathroom and her to you stuff it feeling
like I could dance
I can't dance but if I could dance this
would be great this is one of my
favorite dresses of the week I like this
dress I like the way it's styled a lot I
like to pretty much everything about it
balus except for the fact that we did
eat a lot of curly fries rice kind of
trying to suck in and get rid of any
curly fried food baby action to the days
here where I have to wear crop top I'm
very upset barely want to go out the car
I'm cold
Danny Danny Danny I'm getting kind of
used in these pants so many people isn't
giving me compliments like I feel like
maybe I'm just overthinking this a
little bit and the pants aren't that bad
this is the legally brunette dress for
real do it do it do it okay
it's a lot the shirt is fine I'm just
I'm just done I'm just ready for it to
kinda be over what does happen Jen you
just trip on your overalls and almost
got pierced by this wall so this week we
faced our fashion fears and it's been
terrible educational better than
expected um I definitely feel like I
actually look better in pants and I
thought I did like today I got lots of
compliments and at first I was like
really on this outfit and I look to the
mirror and I was like okay yeah I can
see a world where if someone else was
wearing this I'd complement them too I
guess I'm just not seven anymore and I
don't piss myself as often as I used to
I also never really thought overalls
could be cute before this but they can
be so cute look at how cute this is
I felt weird because I was like is it
bad that I'm an empowered woman but I
still don't feel comfortable showing
these natural parts of my body I want
the attention to be up here and just
like what I'm saying and what I'm doing
rather than
I did not have a great experience this
week but I don't think belly buttons are
as bad as I thought they were at the
beginning of the week let me see your
belly button Freddie now I saw that
maybe by the end of the week I would
feel more comfortable but I just don't I
think I might start wearing over also
because I kind of felt like hey this
item of clothing not that bad I think
that after this week I am more likely to
wear a body con dress this was a little
bit of like rejection therapy where it's
like people are staring at your butt
people are staring at your butt but then
after a while you're just like listen
it's my butt it's there you know what
are we gonna do about it pretty much
nothing because you know I go to yoga
twice a week and that's a lot as much as
I can manage thank you so much for
