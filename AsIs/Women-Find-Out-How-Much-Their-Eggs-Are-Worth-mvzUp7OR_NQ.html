money our eggs are worth it's not all
women are fertile or produce enough eggs
to have babies and so I think it's
really cool that there's this procedure
out there that allows for one woman to
give her eggs to somebody else having a
daughter and being pregnant with a son
it's one end of the spectrum I can't
imagine putting a price on an egg that
would go on to create someone that is
priceless but then people want to be
parents and wouldn't want to deny people
that opportunity I'm really curious to
see what makes someone a qualified egg
donor I find it really weird to put a
number on my eggs because I'm putting a
value just to my body at 27 years old I
feel like a lot of my friends are
getting more interested and getting
married and having babies I don't feel
that pull to motherhood
I do understand why it matters to others
though I'm Andrew Baumer and I'm an
attorney that specializes in
reproductive law there really is no sort
of cookie cutter approach to how
compensation is established for
individual donors it runs the gamut and
it's based upon both subjective and
objective factors donors that may have
an advanced degree Ivy League education
a particular skillset or proficiency
start at $10,000 up until a few years
ago there were price guidelines in place
established by the american society of
reproductive medicine
I want to preface my comments by letting
you know I'm very uncomfortable in doing
this one of the reasons I got out of
owning an egg donor agency was this went
from a field where we were helping
people have children to an industry it's
weird because I don't know how to put a
value on my own trades like myself in
that way I grew up playing tennis as I
was 4 and I don't really play that much
anymore but maybe like my athleticism
would translate I went to Cornell I also
am a computer scientist shreya
she's an interesting candidate she's got
a bachelor's from Cornell her ethnicity
is Indian which is highly desired she
play competitive tennis she's involved
in computer programming
she realistically could receive 10 to 12
thousand dollars depending on the agency
a significant minority of recipient
parents are looking for donors that have
comparable education levels to them and
there is a desire for Ivy League egg
donors I have these trades and I would
not expect my my eggs would produce
those traits I don't know if it's like a
nature versus nurture thing I think my
background and kind of just my growing
up it's kind of gonna give me some
leeway in this I was a college athlete I
have a master's degree I've traveled a
lot my parents were in the military I
come from a healthy background destiny
has an advanced degree she's got a
master's given both her education level
her athletic background and the fact
that she has some expertise in the arts
she likely would receive somewhere
between eight to ten thousand dollars
for her donation would be a high belief
desired donor
I did not see going above six I think
that's another thing that concern me is
a little off-putting for me so want to
go through with this procedure it's like
do I want little knees walking around I
don't know about right and take into
consideration like you can't just go in
this purely for wanting fifteen to
twenty dollars yeah do this for the
humanity of it I think I would make a
good donor because I'm currently
pregnant and having had a baby that she
work in my favor I went to college Kate
would be otherwise a wonderful donor
except for her age ASRM still has
guidelines that deal with who can be a
suitable egg donor and the guidelines
still or 21 to 30 so any woman over the
age of thirty it's very difficult for
them to be approved as a donor how I
think it's unfortunately discriminatory
but the medical research indicates after
the age of 30 the chance of chromosomal
abnormalities increase the other point I
should also make I need to back up is
that as a woman gets older she tends to
produce fewer eggs I made this decision
at 25 I'd really be obsessed with that
decision now like I would think I would
have been cool with it and then now that
I have a family
it'd be too much yeah I think the fact
that I went to an Ivy League university
I think that is going to increase my
eggs worth my blood is 100% Jewish
I think Jewish families would
potentially want a 100% Jewish egg Kelly
would be an incredible candidate there's
some medical issues that maybe if a
concern but quite frankly could get as
much as 15 to $20,000 for her first time
why Jewish egg donors an Asian egg
donors are the hardest donors to find
from a cultural standpoint many are just
uncomfortable donating there is a
tremendous demand it's nice that women
are given the opportunity to make some
money by doing this but I don't think it
should be the sole reason this is a
medical procedure that's available for
people struggling with infertility I
think the focus should be
about how much these donors are being
compensated and more about ensuring that
we have healthy children the most
important thing is having a healthy baby
