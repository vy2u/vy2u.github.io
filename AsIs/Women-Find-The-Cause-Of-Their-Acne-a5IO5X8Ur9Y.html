not like oh my god your skin looks
really good right now but it's just like
oh my god your skin is flawless
today we're getting our acne diagnosed
and I'm very excited about it I'm
slightly nervous just because I've been
avoiding them for a while now when I was
a teen I actually had a really clear
skin and like never had to wear makeup
it wasn't until like I was in my 20s and
almost then I started getting like weird
cystic acne but I was like what the
is going on so about six months ago I
was completely normal skin now as of
today I'm pretty combination I feel like
the dermatologist is gonna tell me that
it's like hormonal because I do find
that my acne is very cyclical at first I
thought it was my makeup so I changed my
makeup and then I thought it was because
I wasn't cleaning my brushes enough and
I just hate that I can't walk out the
house without makeup on I'm ready to
just get it figure it out
my name is dr. Vicki Rappaport and I am
a dermatologist at Rappaport dermatology
I'm gonna help diagnose and actually
explain to them what kind of acne that
they have hi Elena how are you doing I'm
doing well I'm excited I'm gonna take a
really good look at you and then we'll
decide what to do based on what I see so
now comes rule number one in my book
absolutely no picking allowed right see
that's a problem okay to see you're a
picker that's good information that
stuff I need to hear about from afar it
looks a little bit t-zone not so much on
your forehead but down the middle of
your face is essential acne and yes it
is definitely cystic I mean they're
small cysts but they're cysts even if
you told me you didn't pick I would know
you we're not telling you the truth
because I can tell but that's good in a
way that it's mostly old picked lesions
it's not a lot of active things we do it
a couple of tiny pustules and then you
have a couple old scars on your chin
it's pretty clear you have a genetic
predisposition to either have a lot of
oil glands in these areas compared to
the average person or your oil glands
are just easily turned on remember stick
with science we do know a couple things
now and it's kind of new there's
something called the glycemic index been
shown that high glycemic index foods can
affect acne white sugar white rice
cookies candies sodas having a high
glycemic index food that increases your
your insulin levels does actually affect
your oil production we've diagnosed your
acne and now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to do a liquid nitrogen slush on
you gonna take off the very top surface
layer just help start the whole
exfoliation progress I like the idea of
doing the lights dim on you it's gonna
take about ten minutes and like I said
there's no downtime and it kills the
bacteria on your skin
let's talk about three first it's really
interesting about Bree is that you see
her from afar and you think that she has
a lot of acne but actually she just has
more host inflammatory lesions that are
old so we're treating Bree topically
Lena she had a little bit different acne
hers was a little deeper a little more
cystic she was very very very oily oil
production will be good later in life
but now it's just causing more acne for
her we did something oral an antibiotic
which will kill the bacteria thank you
so much for everything today I feel like
we've worked out some serious issues
you're now my dermatologist and my
therapist the first time going to the
dermatologist I was quite nervous I knew
she would have to tell me what I needed
to hear and I didn't think I was
necessarily ready for that because I
thought I was doing the right things I
had a very strong inkling that it would
be hormone only based and I think she
emphasized more of like a genetic basis
on it she had told me that my diet is a
big cause of my acne I thought she was
going to tell me something completely
different I fully recommend going to a
dermatologist I honestly don't know how
it took me so long to go like I feel
really silly about it I recognize that
like healthcare can be kind of expensive
and finding the right doctor it can be
intimidating but like if there is
something bothering you about like the
way your skin is there's not a reason
for you to live like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
