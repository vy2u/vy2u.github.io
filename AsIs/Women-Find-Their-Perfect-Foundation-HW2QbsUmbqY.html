advanced since the 10th grade
today we're finding our perfect
foundation I wear a foundation every day
right now I'm using loriel foundation
but it still isn't hundred-person like
matching my skin color I have a myriad
of problems when I'm looking for a
foundation often I would go to the store
and not be able to find like the right
shade for me they also suffer from like
chronic shine so I'm hoping that what
this customized foundation it really
matches my skin color so I don't need a
lot of blending but also not too dry but
not too oily either I feel like I'm
gonna have this weird sense of pride
like watching her mix my skin tone I
also think that having this sort of
process is really beautiful to have your
skin tone so celebrated and have someone
formulate something that's based only on
to you now we're gonna go find our
perfect foundation let's see how it goes
I'm Caroline Ashton and I'm Lancome's
area artistry manager little petite leah
is long combs very first customizable
foundation it allows us to satisfy the
needs of many clients whether they need
to blend their makeup with two
foundations or more or if they have
super fair-skinned super deep skin it
really allows us to meet the needs of
our clients I have oily skin so
something that is an oily would be good
and something that would last a long day
without being really shiny we can not
only match up to 20,000 shades the
customer has the ability to customize
their moisture level and coverage so if
they'd like ol medium sheer coverage I
actually don't worry foundation
currently I've never really had a
foundation that matches I just sort of
roll with it because you don't currently
work on dation pretty sheer yes I talked
to the lady about just my skin color
what I want for my makeup and she scans
three different parts of your face to
get the best approximation of like the
entire spectrum of what your skin looks
like from there she put it all into the
computer and the computer was like a
little business and when the makeup
starts pouring in the machine
they pour in this bottle and they always
keep like a little space because after
the formula is all pour it into the
bottle they have to shake it and they
need room for it to mix once the bottle
was mixed they put it on my face I look
in the mirror and it didn't even look
like a fairy makeup it's really natural
I feel like every single person in that
room when the first drop of color hit my
face was like oh no this might be a
little too light but we'll see and then
she rubbed it and it was perfect now I
can't tell I think I was wrong I can
feel everyone take like a ha auditory
sigh we create your label that's
customized to you Wow it even says my
name on it
I love it this foundation is really for
anybody really struggling to find their
perfect foundation and what we really
really awesome about this was finally
getting to see what went into making
foundation the coverage the color it was
basically everything I needed to have in
my makeup oh I have something that can
like really up my looks it looked like
my like skin was like sculpted by the
gods actually having someone talk to me
about what makeup would fit me the best
it was kind of cool I think it's one of
those experiences that every woman
should have at least once because if
this is something that you do then it
only stands to reason that it should be
tailor-made to just you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
