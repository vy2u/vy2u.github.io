Princess all the featured Disney films
The Snow White's and the Beauty and the
Beast I've never felt myself represented
as a Latina girls would always play
Disney Princesses and say oh you're
Belle oh you're Cinderella and then just
kind of assign jasmine or Pocahontas to
me when I told people that I was going
to be redrawn as a Disney Princess they
automatically assumed that the artist
would just draw me as Mulan even though
I'm not Chinese I'm Filipino Jasmine is
actually Arabic and I'm Indian we need
to have a princess that is maybe a
little bit like curvier like a normal
curvier my name is John Ramirez I'm a
storyboard artist at Disney TV animation
we should make you a Indian princess yes
but this is just a rough I'll clean it
up oh oh well okay thank you
well we're gonna put you in the the
waters off Cuba mmm to caricature it's a
caricature of the flower biracial
lesbian loved I'm fashionable I don't
know I have a wife too she prefer one
yeah do you want allowed to go out I
mean I just feel like that's just all
Filipino parents that they were just
like no no boys I'm always challenging
people
kind of notice I'm ready
Oh Bing Oh
oh my god Oh
oh oh I've gonna love this I'd really
like to see this character along with
like Tinkerbell and like all her little
friends it's so colorful I love the pugs
I like even the curl detail to my hair
and it's the perfect shade of pink love
the hair color can say he got the hips
right because I do have they're not
super big foot pretty curvaceous it
would be so cool if this were a
character in a movie oh yeah this would
be cool like a Filipino princess like
flying around in like the forests and
jungles of the Philippines would I want
to see a movie of this yeah maybe like a
short I definitely know that a lot of
girls out there would love to see this
because like from piercings to tattoos
to different color hair to anything like
