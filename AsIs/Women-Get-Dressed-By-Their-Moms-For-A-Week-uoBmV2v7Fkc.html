yeah yeah but we buy separately I'm
going to be styled by my mom for an
entire week and not with her taste no
input whatsoever and she can't say no
I've never had anybody take control of
my fashion we just don't have the same
style of cars I have different age I
like to be very vibrant fun flowers are
my favorite not mine I gravitate towards
forever 21
hmm Urban Outfitters I love I'm Taylor
I love stripes she now doesn't like
start so much they're a little overdone
I'm gonna put me need luck should I be
nervous
well I just woke up and lo and behold my
outfit is there I haven't worn this in
years ready for my first year school I
felt like I looked like a teenager I
looked at me yeah that's a peach not the
usual I thought you're trying something
new and I respect - Arthur mom asses are
actually something but she would
definitely wear maybe on a casual day
like on her way to Costco she sent me
text I hate this
like in capital letters I'm like it's
not that bad what is it does this make
you feel I feel a sad feeling a friend
took me like a good 30 minutes to leave
the house because I'm not enthusiastic
about going on like this I legitimately
feel like a mom brothers go oh my god
you're just like mom and then I like
score well you look cute
hey it looks like you work at some like
really boring place where like people
are like Mondays right
I approve Emma I want to see her how she
would look in the future when she gets
of age my sister has currently given up
on life
it looks nice mom but her head looks
like an egg this has to be my favorite
day so far cuz it's more of me it's not
exactly my style I don't usually wear
that much black yeah because I love
black oh your mom so stylish she gave
you a crop top yeah this outfit is kind
of tolerable but paired with this it's
no no I look like I'm about to go sell
something on Venice I just thought it'd
be fun oh that was hilarious that was
sabotage that was very mean even I was
like whoa no she's gonna hate me getting
better guys it's getting better thank
you I do not think your mom dressed
that's a good thing good thinking mom
this is like very much of the mixture of
her style indoors this is not me at all
like at all I don't even think I lined
it up well I don't have roof liner
I never liked with lips my mom she saw
her almost every day and she was in love
she's I kind of love how your daughter's
dressed lately no Alicia doesn't look
nice book on it oh thanks it you might
just refer to Matt I see you you look
nice I'm just ready to be done
honestly this may look fun on the
outside but this is actually becoming to
be really draining not having control
over how I look every day I noticed
through this experiment that like I have
a very specific way of dressing like
everything is simple like simple colors
simple pants but like the only thing
that pops is my scarf and these outfits
were like the opposite the opposite of
what I would ever wear it's a beautiful
breeze
cool day and sunny and my mom picked out
this nice little romper it was fun I
think that was perfect that day
considering it was kind of warm that day
yeah Oh to the 70s yes and my mom loved
disco too
that's right this Alfa kind of reminds
me of like a third grade school teacher
who's about to teach her kids about the
ocean so she kind of dresses like it
almost at church we are running a little
late because outfit situation so when
I'm on my period of bloated I always
like to wear something loose and flowy
the pants were super tight and white
well it was perfect for the top because
it has white collar so today my mom is
absolutely dressing me twice because we
have an event to go to later on I've
actually been really looking forward to
this event and now I can't even go dress
the way I wanted to go dress what like
that's not fair that's not part of the
rules that you would did one outfit I
mean are you doing two outfits for today
and she's a king and I just do a fit I
love your fire thank you
never in my life have I let someone else
control my style it was very new and
challenging for me to do so once you
taste autonomy and it gets taken away
you're like uh-uh never again and it
wasn't I was trying to take away from
her I was having fun with this do what I
thought she was just gonna choose
everything that she likes I don't think
I would do that I don't want her to look
funny she's a rock star because as much
as she hated it she like she still made
it work I felt like this week gave us
the opportunity to kind of bond
despite the busy week oh look love me
too easy Layla would you ever let your
daughter aggressive no no okay we can
work on Hannah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
