known as the vampire facial I honestly
should have researched it before I got
here and signed up to do it I saw like a
clip of Kim Kardashian getting it won
it's one of those so crazy that it just
might work things I don't know I love
like blood and gore so I'm excited for
it I don't really do much to my skin now
so anything would be an improvement I
had a lot of acne so I have some dark
spots so I'm hoping it helps to erase
some of those give me any kind of skin
advice I will try it
I will go like put my face in someone's
ass and have them fart in it if it helps
I like to think that I have a high pain
tolerance and then like I get a period
cramp and I'm like I stay home today the
best-case scenario is that I walk out
with the best skin in the entire
world that I'm gonna be addicted let's
get bloody the vampire facial is
actually a very popular treatment and
the reason for its popularity is that
there's very little downtime and also
there's something in it for everybody
whether you're a young person you want
to prevent the aging process whether you
have acne scars whether you're beginning
to have you know at the start of aging
with fine lines and wrinkles we will
take your blood into a small tube and we
spin it down we take the top part that
has all the growth factors so if you
think about it this way when you get a
cut and you bleed from that site there's
a lot of growth factors that come to the
scene that try to heal that that area we
are isolating and concentrating that
segment that part of your blood and
using that in the skin we're creating
these micro zones of controlled injury
in your skin the needle kind of goes in
and out about a hundred times a second
so then your body responds to the trauma
by creating good healthy collagen if
you're not going deep enough to see
blood you're not hitting the collagen do
you have any particular concerns in your
skin that you want to tie get breakouts
because I decided to go through puberty
in my 20s and set
like middle something like everyone else
because this makes your pores a little
bit smaller less likely to get acne and
then if you're using any acne products
on the skin it will kind of absorb it
better right most of the time we get
enlarged pores kind of here in the nose
and on the cheek in the lower forehead
so the my friend Ling would help you
with that
we'll start by numbing you we're gonna
give you the good stuff so you won't
feel anything it feels really cool my
lips are so no it's so weird like
touching this I mean he getting blood
drawn I would rather like have surgery
than get my blood drawn what I saw my
first Quentin Tarantino movie when I was
six and I could have looked on blood
ever since so this is the blood after
it's spun as you see it's separated the
platelet-rich plasma is on top which we
will pull off in two syringes to be
applied with skin so this is actually
really well concentrated I can tell by
it good yeah so we've taken all the red
blood cells and the cellular stuff out
so this is just your plasma we're gonna
drill this back into you
sounds painful a little bit of juice
okay here we are okay oh okay
so I can see your skin's getting a
little bit rosy oh that's not fine okay
here's oh yeah oh oh
down moment bad it's like what does it
feel you feel like pokey yeah so I'm
gonna go a lot deeper on this side with
you okay hey the Chi can like stickers
now has on your forehead you don't have
much jaw so you just feel it is it like
so bad that you wouldn't do it again no
okay so is that concept of ear 18 along
yeah no aerate the lawn a little
fertilizer you do it again
if you stop oh yeah oh definitely it's
not no it's not painful enough to keep
me from if I don't see blood I keep
pushing kind of until I tell ya so this
is like producing more blood does that
mean more collagen okay so I think about
it excited to see what it looks like
yeah I can't wait he did it so how was
it for you it was honestly so easy I was
really surprised I thought it would hurt
there was some spots where it hurt a
little bit but all in all totally fine
totally manageable oh my oh my god it
feels like I have like a little bit of a
sunburn like you said but I also look
like a gel like I look like Patrick
Bateman from American Psycho I also look
like Megan's body so when you go home
tonight you're going to take the
remainder of the PRP we leave it in a
syringe for you you're gonna just put
that all over like a serum that's it I
sleep like a princess tonight and in the
morning wash your face just use gentle
skin cleanser moisturizer and sunscreen
I just woke up and I look insane
yep
my face is still covered in blood
I'm very excited to finally wash this
off okay I just got out of the shower
and I'm not gonna lie it's way more read
that I thought it was going to be
definitely gonna have to wear some
foundation today son Bert cheek this is
now two days after the facial and it's
still really red so it's now been a few
days honestly I really enjoy the
experience it hurt a lot ooh it was
rough I didn't think the blood facial
was that painful I showed one person a
picture of my face right after the
facial and they threw up in their mouth
a little bit so my face is like a little
bit bruised underneath my eyes I didn't
know about it until I looks in the
mirror and then I was like oh I look
like I was kind of punched in the face
now I only have like a couple of red
patches a lot of my dark acne marks went
away on my chin which is insane I feel
like I look better my face is a little
bit dry and red in some areas but I feel
like it would be weird if it wasn't
because we cut it open and put in a new
blood I had really bad chicken pox when
I was like - goes for I still had scars
on my face and I noticed that those are
gone - which is kind of insane I feel
like I have new skin like I was blessed
with new skin that they like implanted
on my face and I like want to take care
of it now I would probably try this
again I mean I already feel like my
cheeks and my chin um just like so much
glowy er I would definitely do it again
and hopefully someday I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
