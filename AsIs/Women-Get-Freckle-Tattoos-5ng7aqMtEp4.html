I have it I am a hundred and ten percent
guilty a teen I'm just thinking and I
just like spray him across you know just
like a fairy has shuttle over my face
today I am getting freckles my face
growing up I always wished I was as
lucky as my older sister to have
freckles I remember just looking at kids
with freckles and being really envious
of them and the more freckles they had
the better the person they were in my
mind I don't know why it's just the
sunkissed look dust of cuteness society
tells us that they're imperfect that to
me just makes them so much more
attractive they're just stunning
I just love bronze and golds and moves
landscape over the body I just think the
gorgeous I've been waiting for this for
a long time I'm excited I have a picture
that I will just show you I like it yeah
I'm excited we're gonna do some small
ones some big ones where you throw it a
couple different shades oh you had some
dance
this is semi-permanent so it's not going
to be there forever
it's usually between six months to a
year we're depositing pigment underneath
your skin differences I use pigment
tattooists using pigments of different
consistency in that's why it's
semi-permanent you're excited I'm so
excited
let's get these freckles on your face
I'm just going to go from yeah freckles
are actually not perfectly circular so
you'll find that each of them have their
own personality like a unique little
fingerprint I find that people who've
got freckles spend their entire life
either trying to hide them or I actually
spend a lot of my time removing them
with laser and people who don't have
them which off the right arm to get them
see you ready to go yes let's get us bad
I think that I've always been attracted
to features that weren't necessarily
renowned for being beautiful when I hear
people ashamed of their freckles or
disliking their freckles it just baffles
me a bit such a beautiful addition to a
person so you need four just blows my
mind
ah just joking truthfully it's funny
because part of me is a little bit
nervous that people are going to be
watching this and thinking like why the
hell would you get freckles there's so
much controversy around freckles you
either love them or you hate them like
coriander I love coriander and freckles
and I don't understand why you would
hate something so beautiful
for it's funny because my sister doesn't
like her freckles but I I love them I've
always wished I had them like her I have
a few tattoos already so I'm not nervous
about the pain just really excited to
see how they turn out oh wow okay Oh oh
my ah they're so cute I can see how
they're good they're raised and they're
gonna they're gonna eventually fade into
my face it's my childhood dreams come
true a six year old me would be so proud
right now this is this is fantastic this
is what I've always this is what it
wanted in my face oh my god they come
all the way up here - they're beautiful
it's so funny that so many people who
have freckles hate them so much I hope
that at least through this video they
see how desirable to hang on to so many
people I guess the grass is always
greener but I feel like I finally belong
to the freckle clan at least for the
next six to 12 months
no worries take care of them huh
I will how well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
