colors two years ago I started with a
vibrant blue and then I went to a
vibrant purple and it was the whole head
but now it's like sort of grown out so

and then pastel purple definitely a
funky hair color kind of gal I'm super
excited to get color back in my hair and

super bright to be honest I am a little
nervous about it looking kind of crazy
with what I normally wear but also

rainbow on my head I think it's awesome
I think it really adds something to my
my look I feel like my friends are gonna
freak out my hope is that they love it
and that it's not like too crazy or out
of the box like I hope they think it
fits me as a human I haven't shown my
co-workers yet but I'm really excited to
I feel like they're gonna freak out just
it's such a drastic transformation and I
feel like I need to change my outlook on
life to match it i fun crap all over my
head and I love it yeah thank you
