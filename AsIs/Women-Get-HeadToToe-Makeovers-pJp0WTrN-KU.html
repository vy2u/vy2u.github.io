moms today I know personally as a mom
myself to two small children how
ridiculously hard it can be to just take
a moment for myself so I am really
excited to really have a date just for
them we were living in New York for
years and then we're like well let's get
a dog let's get back on our feet and
then we got the puppy and then we got
pregnant when you have a baby on your
hip it's like you have a pass I don't
need to have a style because I'm a mom
right it's really hard to feel sexy
after you've had a baby the clothes I
have are too young I've always loved you
Barrymore so I want a little bit more
grown-up a little bit more confidence a
little bit more just feeling like myself
I always thought I'd have told me
younger but I just might
happily-ever-after didn't happen till I
was older so that's why you do you nanny
for a while now church now is mine and
it's such a weird transition
I would wear like cutoff jeans and
shirts with sayings on it right now it's
just whatever I can cover up with best
or be comfortable in but I'd like to
have a little bit of style Jennifer
Aniston
name she always looks good whether she's
casual or dressed up was this was in the
pentose anos polyester mama so many a
fedora so mystical Wednesday October and
so with me that without your than me
persona
what was your didn't you stop before you
had kids oh Jenny said my son was born
in June of 2014 at 28 weeks early right
before Jackson's first Christmas he had
open-heart surgery he's almost had every
holiday in hospital so it's been trying
it's been exhausting it's been a legal
battle
I like really sophisticated clean but
still functional Khloe Kardashian
because she's trendy and risky at the
same time
as I got to know Lindsay I realized
she's so cool then we go to her closet
these are not clothes that fit your
personality at all she was dressing as
someone else cuz she lost confidence
after she became my mom for Lindsay's
makeup we're gonna do that soft matte
earthy look just to play up that boho
chic vibe she has going on Tracy was a
nanny for a long time but now she's a
mom and she wants to advance it you're
not really into prints but I am seeing
stripes because that's all they had
maternity clothes I love working with
Tracy's hair especially by putting in
the express blow up it allows for their
hair to have more softness and movement
so I actually went ahead and gave her a
blunt bob just to give him more of a
strong structured haircut look Oh God
the feeling I got when I came to our
house it was so warm and so I wanted to
really bring that out and what she wears
I wanted to take cues from her style
icon Jennifer Lopez so we gave her a
fresh glowy look with some nice dramatic
lashes and some glossy lip Sarah her
story there wasn't a dry eye in the room
she's constantly going to and from the
hospital so when I shopped for her I
really thought colors we're doing the
dramatic eyes we're doing the nice
contour cheeks it's gonna be amazing
are you ready to see yourself
I don't recognize myself mother is
really hard it's wonderful and I love it
that's really hard and takes a toll so I
feel really excited there's no way
you're seven weeks out woman oh wow look
awesome it's normal to not feel like
yourself after having a baby people
won't talk about that it's been a great
experience getting a chance to be
transformed and look in the mirror and
like who I see I love it I'm holding
back my tears she looks beautiful to me
every day but I know that this is gonna
make her feel even more beautiful than
what she is already is that Chloe
look at your side don't a bit let's are
looking pick up the hot and check out
your I have I feel weight lifted off my
shoulders I encourage people to take
time for self-care get creative do
something out of the box what's inside
now is easier to be presented on the
outside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
