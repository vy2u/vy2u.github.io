going to a dermatologist to see how
allergic we are to the products that we
put on our face so I have dry skin but
it's also kind of sensitive it flares up
every so often I purposefully wore no
makeup just so you guys can see what the
 is happening to my sensitive ass
game my whole life I've had eczema and
when I was younger it was really bad on
my face I'm someone who's obsessed with
beauty products I love trying new stuff
I'm subscribed to a ton of different
Beauty glam bags I wonder if that has
something to do with the fact that my
skin is completely just a show
these days I think that I just generally
have sensitive skin not too long ago I
actually got into putting like glitter
loose glitter on my eyelids and I use
this glue thing I put it on my eyelids
it was great throughout the day then
when I wiped my makeup off my eyelids
were swollen underneath a couple weeks
ago I actually had a really severe
allergic reaction I just woke up one
morning and my eyes were completely
swollen shut the doctor was confident
that it was my makeup I'm definitely
interested to see if the stuff that I'm
putting on my face every day is actually
bad for me I am nervous about the
results because I like my current makeup
a lot because if I want to over hold my
entire skin routine alright it's time to
go to the doctor
hello I'm dr. Vickie Rappaport and I am
a dermatologist at Rappaport dermatology
I'm her father
Marvin Rappaport we practice together
today we are going to place patch
testing on three different people to
figure out what their skin allergies are
inflammation of the skin often can be
caused by external chemicals or on the
skin what we do with the patch test is
we put a little bit of the offending
agent under a specific bandage to see if
they are alerted to that particular
antigen so here we have 40 of the most
common allergens found in skincare
products these can be made from lotions
makeups anything like that we are
leaving this one blank this is gonna be
for what a patient brought in
so all of these will go on her back and
they'll remain on her back for 48 hours
and they will not get wet and then in 48
hours we'll take them off and see what
reaction
I feel like a Bionic Woman I feel
uncomfortable I feel like I can't move
my arms too much I really didn't think
it was that bad I wish I would have done
this when I first started wearing makeup
my biggest concern right now is how I'm
gonna do anything at the gym it's a
little itchy if I hurt X my so long I'm
always it Chi so this is like my worst
it is starting to itch already a little
nervous about the next 48 hours they're
kind of itchy but I can't tell if it's
the patches or the tape I am dying I'm
like getting these splotches and like
everything freakin itches something in
the 20s is really bothering me so it's
the end of the day and I think I spoke
too soon when I said that this thing was
only itchy in some places because now
it's just an all-over itch it's that
time my back smells tight it's pretty
hard to get comfortable so I made it to
the gym today and it was the most
distracting workout it was super itchy
it was hard for me to focus you it's
number 22 I was walking to lunch and
they got really hot and I couldn't take
my cardigan off because I'm an insecure
person I didn't want people staring so I
just got really hot hopefully I didn't
sweat and hopefully my patches are okay
I know we're not supposed to shower I
gotta do it luckily I have a detachable
shower head I woke up today and I am so
much more itchy than I was before half
an hour luck and I can't wait for that
satisfying rip feeling there was like a
brief moment where it calmed down but
it's back I am just about to hop in the
car if I go to this appointment and I'm
not allergic to anything I'm gonna be
really pissed because this was just
itchy and annoying for no goddamn reason
so I'm super excited to see what goes on
underneath these me too we're gonna take
everything off and get you a little bit
instant relief but we do let it sit for
about five minutes and kind of air out
before we do the official reading so the
dead giveaway the really really really
crazy positive would be red blisters
you know if it's sort of half positive
it's like a little couple little pink
dots
I'm allergic to them right you actually
are but you're also very normal things
you're allergic to are things that
everybody is a lot of dick to do number
one cobalt the metal it's really common
in cheap earring and really sensitive
years when you have a cobalt allergy you
usually have a nickel allergy so nickel
sulfate is also seen in like very very
cheap belt buckles you were only mildly
irritated by number two if your acne
medicine I literally said that the other
day I was like it feels like it's
getting worse like the stuff you use on
your eyes at the urgent care doctor said
you were quote-unquote alerted to not
allergic to that crazy so I could start
using my concealer again I mean it could
be allergic reaction to something in the
environment the most amazing thing is
there with all of your tendencies
towards being allergic and your history
of eczema the only thing you were
alerted to but it was a really mild
allergy and it was cobalt which is a
metal so if you do have like cheap
jewelry that's not 22 karat or titanium
Ohio module or having the history of
allergies and eczema I would recommend
you continue to seek out those high
positive products all the things we
tested art were absolutely negative 37
is your only positive action 37 is
actually thimerosal it's basically a
preservative you have a true allergy to
it its antiseptic and antifungal so just
check labels the most important one
being that glitter glue adhesive that
you say really swirled up your eyes I
was absolutely sure that was gonna be
positive but shockingly it's negative I
would actually recommend that you do
avoid I still then there's something
about that that's very irritating to you
ever since I had had that allergic
reaction to what I thought was my makeup
I have been really stressed out and
anxious about trying anything new so
it's really cool to know that I can
continue to use all the glam bags that
I'm subscribed to I could kind of tell
that was having their reactions because
I wasn't that itchy it was like a little
uncomfortable but when I talked to
Kelsey and saw see I could tell ya I
don't really have anything compared to
them
so I had all three women send me a photo
of their backs at the 72-hour mark to
look for delayed reactions and swaths t
actually did have a delayed positive
indeed the adhesive to the glitter that
she put on her eyes it's nice to know
that I am really allergic to it and I
feel like everyone should get an allergy
test and you know what time your saw it
was and here we are go get an allergy
test you'll be happy you did it so as
you may have noticed boldly is now as
its new but don't worry you look it'll
be awesome continues to we're just even
more new great stuff click here to
