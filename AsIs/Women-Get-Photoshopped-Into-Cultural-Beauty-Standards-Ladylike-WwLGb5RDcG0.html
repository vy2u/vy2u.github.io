beauty ideals in mind Japanese beauty
ideals african-american beauty ideals
Italian beauty standards
I am half Danish and half Indian half
Japanese half Italian African American I
am a quarter Italian and then
three-quarters mutts beauty standards
for Japanese women I think are focused a
lot on like femininity and cuteness I
think black beauty standards in America
are pretty different from what white
beauty standards are in America Indian
beauty standards are from what I know
like big doe eyes Italian beauty
standards are like the upside down
version of me paler skin a youthful
appearance I would say in East Asia I
know there is a lot of focus on your
eyes specifically whether or not you
have double eyelids thicker thighs big
but big breasts kind of like a coke
bottle shape
I definitely trim fair-skinned been
toned tan apparently Italians are like
big boob people having lighter skin is
desired more exotic looking I've spent
my whole life coming to terms with my
own body through like a American lens
and I feel pretty decent about it now so
adding another set of beauty ideals to
worry about is a hard thing of a word
that's better than annoying I have a lot
of cousins as a lot of Italian people do
they're like beautiful people sometimes
I look at them and I look at me and I'm
just like what what growing up I put a
lot of pressure on myself to fall in
line with what was considered beautiful
in the black community you know it's
really petite kind of on the thinner
side and anytime anyone would call me
skinny I would pretty much cry it's
gonna be weird to see myself through
this lens of like Japanese beauty
because I I just already assume that
that's not what I am I think it'll be a
really cool experiment but I don't know
if I'm gonna 100% like the way it looks
I think young Freddie will get the
opportunity to see something that she
thought she wanted I'm definitely
interested I like learning new things
but I can't say that I'm like too
nervous about it I'm prepared for my
body to undergo a transformation that
like will render it basically
incompatible how I look now see what
happens
see what I look like okay
I don't know what it's gonna look like
but it might just be freaky like I think
we're all so used to what our faces look
like that any like subtle changes is
sort of gonna be like what like who is
that I know that I'm just gonna have
like a lot more Vavoom happening in the
bust achill area and on the breast
K'Ehleyr eeeh I mean I bet I'm going to
look like someone who could generically
sell you a pair of jeans and a catalog
the Japanese media that I consumed
primarily growing up was like Naruto my
expectation is like unless like I have
blond hair and start talking about how I
want to be Hokage then it's sort of just
like whatever let's do it abracadabra
that's that's a sim that's
terrifying Oh what is that
it's creepy like I just kind of feel
like all the shape of my body has just
been like but my boobs are still there I
was expecting for it to be less
straightforward I thought there would be
like more differences I think it's very
skinny the face is like what's most
noticeable as unlike me the thing I'm
most weirded out by is not even just
being like thicker and having a bigger
butt in bigger boobs
it's the lighter skin I still have a
butt cause like that's where it's okay
to have fat cousin your boobs in your
butt but nowhere else and certainly not
in those creepy witch hands I don't even
know if I'd buy jeans from me I think
that achieving both larger breasts and a
thigh gap is not something that my body
could probably do at this point
hide the head that's like basically all
my cousins I'm not sure if I'd be
considered beautiful there but I also
I'm not sure how beautiful I'm
considered in America so it's sort of
just like what
it's interesting because when I was
younger I did want to be lighter as well
so seeing what it looks like on paper is
pretty surreal kind of this is like me
with all the me sucked out of it this is
like who would play me in the movie
version of my life
I don't not feel connected to Japanese
identity like I do I very much do but I
I think it's the Japan part is super
important because it impacted like
everything in America so I think of it
from a very American stand looking
outwards back to Japan next perspective
thinking about the stuff that I wanted
when I was younger than actually seeing
it on paper like all put together it
makes me sad and happy at the same time
it makes me sad that I was so insecure
with the way that I looked growing up it
makes me really happy because I'm very
satisfied with the way that I look I
feel like I've grown into my beauty I've
grown into accepting the way I look and
I wouldn't want to look any other way I
think after seeing this I obviously
prefer myself I realize that like I am
full of imperfections and things that
people don't like and things that I
don't even like but like I am greater
than the sum of my parts and so kind of
nitpicking yourself and to make your
parts better isn't necessarily going to
make you a more beautiful person it just
makes you different
