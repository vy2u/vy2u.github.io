obsessed with astrology I probably
looked up my birth chart for the first
time last year I've been studying
astrology since I was around 16 like I
have a pretty casual relationship with
it and I use it a lot to like connect to
my friends and my co-workers and
sometimes it's nice when you have like a
crush to find out like where's the Venus
at baby how do you communicate Cristina
has tried to get me into astrology she's
pulled up my birth chart she's trying to
explain it to me but it's not something
that I have ever really understood
I'd say my style is usually pretty clean
and minimal I wear a lot of things from
thrift stores so a lot of its vintage I
typically wear clothes that I feel like
walk themselves into a room I love
pieces that I consider like signature
statement pieces I tend to wear all
black but I like to layer it up and I
like to have bits and pieces that feel
edgy today we're gonna be meeting with
Rebecca Gorton who's been studying
astrology for over a decade and she's
gonna tell us about ourselves in ways we
might not have thought about before I'm
Rebecca I'm a professional astrologer
also columnist and author I grew up with
astrology my stepmothers an astrologer
so since I could speak I was learning
astrology a birth chart is a snapshot of
the sky at the exact moment you were
born nobody else in the entire planet
has the same birth chart as you when I'm
doing a style chart I take out all of
the planets and I only look at three
things I look at the Sun the ascendant
which is the rising sign and Venus
what are your staples you probably have
like two or three of them that's your
Sun Sign your rising sign tells me about
how the Sun sign does its job and your
Venus sign tells me about your personal
magnetism your powers of Attraction now
I recommend everybody dress as their
chart because that shows us that the
inside of us is displayed on the outside
hi everybody
I've prepared each of your astrological
charts and yours personal style charts
you are all actually pretty
much dressed as your chart right now
this is yours Christina Emily oh and
koala Lonnie nice so now we're gonna be
meeting with stylists who are going to
actually dress us so what do you think
they should be looking for I'm Sam and
I'm London and we're stylist
my typical aesthetic is to incorporate
vintage and secondhand into pretty much
everything that I do my goal is just to
make sure every client looks sexy and
feel comfortable in what they were first
of all let's start with your Sun Sign
which is a Gemini when I think of Gemini
I think is mixed prints fun flirty lots
of accessories and also always an
interesting hairdo I would recommend to
our stylists to bring more Gemini in for
her I want to see more mixed prints more
fun
Gemini Jean Scorpio Rising so we're
bringing in equality of shadow here and
bad girl I see your Venus isn't the sign
of Taurus quality is everything when it
comes to Taurus I would love to see you
mixing this all up in one look you're
the person I could do it
and what about coil any Sun signs Gemini
which is fun flirty mixed prints you're
Sagittarius rising this is the
Globetrotter look eclectic bohemian
jewelry from all across the globe so
your Venus sign is an Aries bold
powerful and fiery Aries I would say my
challenge would be for you as well to
amp up on your Venus sign more clean
lines and bold geometry and what about
em
black black and more black here we're
talking about the dark and powerful
statement piece the next part is your
Taurus rising this is not just any black
clothes this is top-of-the-line high-end
designer black your Venus isn't
Sagittarius Sagittarius brings me to
world travels bright pops of colors I'd
like to see more of a glam influence
with the Torian element on top of that
we're gonna add in some pops of color oh
God romance is dead forever it's true
romance is truly dead for me but I am
happy to try these tips I promise you
you're going to have so much fun with
this
in terms of getting styled by London and
Sam it was really exciting to see what
they picked out for me just because that
outfit was something that I would never
have worn myself so the final look that
Linda and Sam put together was so cute I
feel like it was me if I had a little
bit more money and smiled
it was just like super fun and flirty my
only negative comment on it would be
that it felt like there was a lot going
on like at one point I have like two
bags on and a ring on every finger I
just could never see myself wearing that
red blazer parts that I did enjoy we're
mixing up the structure of what I was
wearing I don't usually do crop tops
because I don't like to show a whole lot
of my skin they put like high-waisted
pants with like a big thick belt
underneath a crop top that kind of
spaced me out a little bit made me look
just a little bit taller even if I
didn't feel totally myself in the outfit
they chose for me it did give me really
good ideas of how I should tie all those
elements together I definitely want to
play more with leather I think I dress a
lot to my Sagittarius and my Gemini so I
was hoping to see a lot more of the
Aries it didn't feel like I'm a boss I
take up space I'm courageous this final
look that I got was most reflective of
what was available for the size that I
am it was a little frustrating because I
wanted that cool street style edgy
moment and I just think that it's really
hard for London and Sam to find these
pieces when designers don't make them I
did really like the final result I just
wish it was a little bit more street
style even if you don't really believe
in astrology there are elements to
everyone's personality that you are
particularly proud of and with fashion
sometimes you want to highlight those
parts you dress yourself to remind
yourself how beautiful you are
so why not have astrology walk
hand-in-hand with that I thought it was
interesting that Christina and : II and
I all had very similar risings and
settings and all the different
astrological elements that I knew
nothing about Gemini Gemini Venus and
tourists there and Taurus rising here
we're like where the crash when I came
into this room I didn't expect to become
closer to YouTube I already I'm like I
know so much more about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
