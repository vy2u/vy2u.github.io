they fit ah in between size it's just a
matter of not being able to find those
items that are flattering for your body
type the size is kind of end at around
12 or 10 ish not quite right for the
straight size stores and not quite right
for the plus-sized stores I haven't
really registered that I am the size
that I am I can be a challenge and it
makes me feel a little bit lost in the
world there is a lot of pressure to
obviously look good I definitely
sacrifice either comfort or fashion when
I'm choosing what I'm going to wear for
the day I feel like when you wears like
black sweatpants and a black t-shirt
every day you're asking not to be seen
and I want to feel good about being seen
again hi I'm Tiffany so excited to work
with you today I don't know what size I
am or how to dress myself anymore so
have you noticed any body changes you
grow a person inside things are gonna
happen um oh this is a maternity skirt
and this is a nursing top this is yeah
life right yeah we've covered all the
sizes on the clothes so you're not going
to know what size we're going to focus
on looking at the shape of your body and
the shape of your clothes and what works
with your body let's come over here to
the rack and take a look you like that
hippie vibe punk rock hippie fun black
high-waisted maxi skirt that's gonna
accentuate your waistline
you're asking me to wear white pants and
I dropped I yeah it's a little unnerving
honestly not knowing the size like
showing off your stuff but not all your
stuff it has been a while since I've
shown off my stuff she has no idea what
size they are and we're not worried
about the size we're gonna see how they
fit and from there you're making me
dress like I'm going to Coachella maybe
you'll go I think that the pants are
completely see-through so we're gonna
try this should I come out yes dramatic
trust exercise go ahead take a look oh
oh that's cute oh my gosh
I'm not wearing black what happened it
looks good I like it it's different I
would not normally have chosen this for
myself
sexy but
there's a little surprise back there
just a little edge so do you want to
know what size they are I don't care but
I'll happily hear it your top is size
extra-large the skirt is 13 15
extra-large
I would not have bought an extra-large
for myself we get so emotionally and
mentally hung up on I don't want to go
up one size individuals are stuffing
themselves they're forcing themselves
into clothes that don't work for their
body and they're actually making
themselves look bigger it's actually
liberating to not have to focus on the
numbers I think my confidence level
would be higher because I not feeling
like a stuffed sausage and the clothes
that I chose to wear I really like the
feeling of these clothes on
well don't I look like I'm having fun I
agree I feel a messing this whole in
between a size is more just a state of
mind
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
