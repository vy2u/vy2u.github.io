every so often there's just a guest that
sits in my chair not quite sure exactly
what they want so it's my job to try and
figure that out I haven't had a haircut
in over two years I just kind of don't
know what to do with it this hair is you
know it's a little wild and crazy
sometimes it's not curly or wavy it's
just blah like some weird things under
cuts there's bangs involved
I need professional help I work at a
salon in Los Angeles I am a national
educator for John Paul Mitchell Systems
let's help these ladies find their style
my hair and I usually have a good
relationship I'm pretty confident in my
hair styles but lately I feel like my
hair and I have gotten lost with Morgan
right out of the gate I could tell that
she was a little bit of a wild child
clearly I make bad choices about my hair
so I'm just gonna let Trent do whatever
he thinks is best so I knew that link
was kind of like an open option for her
this part of it I would love to make go
away he had quite a big undercut on the
underside and then also on the side
Vinita came in with her hair all just
one link
tell us about your hair it's just an
awful mess it's sometimes it's very flat
on the top that might just be the shape
of my head I don't really have a lot of
time I work out a lot and I just quickly
shower and get my day started I have a
99 cent comb just kind of she had some
thirsty ins all one link was not doing
her any justice so we kept it very soft
and romantic with mesial she came in
just bouncing off the wall she was happy
and bubbly and her hair was something
that wasn't really mirroring that image
I'm open to pretty much anything sip
bald she kind of opened the door when
she said I love big hair I'm from New
Jersey I didn't know what was going on I
just kept hearing those scissors so the
mirror is not in front of me so it was
like
all right Miz here we are all done go
ahead and pop up and take a look in the
mirror with Morgan what we did was we
started with that undercut on the side
kind of as a guide I wanted to give her
something that could work whether she
wants to keep it or grow it out like
this like somehow makes sense now Venita
a little bit of face coming around the
front and then nice like cascading
layers throughout the back there's and
it looks so healthy oh my god thank you
just by embracing her natural texture
and coming up a little bit shorter it
really gives her that hair that's kind
of bouncy and mirrors off of the emotion
that she portrays it's exactly 1 ha ha
ha ha I'm super happy with this every
time I get make me look beautiful it's a
surprise haircut you look good you feel
good and when you feel good I feel good
feel like it looks more glamorous it's
more attention to my face and I just
really like it I think I should get
haircuts more often</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
