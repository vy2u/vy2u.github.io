just looks like I've got my eyebrows are
you going thank you excited kind of
you're not need to tattoo so I guess
they're not going to be that different
it's very similar so what's the actual
procedure today so what we'll do is
we'll first numb you that takes about 10
to 15 minutes and then we'll clean them
up measure your brows in where they
should be and then we'll discuss shape
and color and once we've decided taken
one I'm pretty excited I'm a bit nervous
about the pain but wearing that bouquet
will be good I think it's pretty pretty
straight flat and down you down this
dude I'm excited let's get this brows on
that so what was the lead-up to coming
in and see me I'm really bad at makeup
and lazy I'd like to just wake up and
have a good eyebrows jalapeno nice
perfect and that's why I'm here I find
my browser like very blonde and so in
certain lights they look invisible we
want to frame your face frame those
beautiful eyes so I just hit up
Instagram for some inspiration for
prostration yes so I'm really digging
this shape okay let's do this
you trust me yeah I do glad okay so I'm
just going to do some markings for you
that's just going to give us some idea
of where you're Irish should start and
end and we will go from there well
making sure that the eyebrows start
where they should start as well as the
balance so this is the color that we're
going to
it's gonna be quite dark initially and
it would be basically something awesome
okay so you're ready we're going to
start how was that feel pretty good
it sort of feels like someone like
scratching sunburn and then scratching
it again some of painful is an actual
tattoo okay we're done okay you ready
help mini-date open your eyes oh wow
looks sick hey there thank you
you're very welcome it looks so good
take a look oh my god oh my god enough
it looks so divine which is something
that I struggle with there just look so
much better than I could've ever hoped
Illinois thank you so much attina
I'm so happy with it and I'm glad that
I'm on your level now I also thought
that it would be like really red and
full and stuff and it's not can you tell
what we've done like Amy actually loved
it
yeah they look so much more filled in
yeah good exactly I didn't really have
much around the sides and it looks so
good I'm feeling like Jada pinkett-smith
I think for sure like a strong
independent woman it's really
natural-looking I love it thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
