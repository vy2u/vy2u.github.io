hi Freddy
hi what up Shanti hi Soph
hi we've talked about different like
body insecurities and the past and stuff
and I remember you talking to me about
one when you were really really young do
you remember what you told me I always
wanted a but I always wanted to just be
thicker I always always always wanted
blue eyes boobs it was boobs within the
black community being thicker having a
but having you know thicker thighs and
just having that like hourglass shape is
what was sought after for young women
and that's what guys liked I was like
insecure about my body in general and
also thinking that my body looked
imbalanced I kind of felt boring these
other usual more pretty if you had blue
eyes yeah I always was like oh
everyone's so striking with blue eyes
and like dark features I am super
comfortable with who I am and what I
look like today and I also keep in mind
to just not comment on anyone's weight
or anything that they don't have control
over it I don't want people to think I
don't like Who I am but it's like
something worth trying I personally
don't want fake boobs at the moment but
maybe when I'm 60 so if I told you that
I got you butt pads yeah I have some
blue contacts for you a mega push-up bra
and like chicken cutlets would you want
to try them out
the day I've never put in contacts in my
life oh yeah
is it the bombshell is a bombshell bra I
have no problem trying out butt pads for
a day but just the experiment of seeing
if it changes the way that I feel about
my body and just seeing the way other
people react will be pretty cool is it
sad that my boobs are literally smaller
than the amount of padding that they
near it we easy right are you scared yes
let's see let's see how it looks they're
in they are in how do they feel if you
little dry they're almost like blue-gray
the way it reacted with the brown got
your boobs on I do have my boobs on look
how sad my old bra locks is this what
you feel like Shante every day I know
there's just a lot of breasts to deal
with it's definitely gonna make a
statement as I walk down the street
could you show oh my god it's kind of
big to the point where I could get cat
calls but
it's intense this is gonna be a day and
this is a really teary eyes because the
mind drop will back up so my pass has
created a ravine between the two cups
you can see the two separating like a
valley between two large mountains how
do you feel about my new butt oh damn it
looks really good and I'm not gonna lie
I saw you walking earlier and
ready guys I'm gonna be honest with you
these look pretty cool I love myself
you know everyone should but these are
pretty cool Kristen did you notice I did
not notice I only noticed when you were
grabbing your boobs that was like
something's up with those boobs it's
just different yeah it's new it's very
much good don't love but shake I know
there's a lot of contemplate with that
but there's a lot of things do you like
them I love them I want them I'm so
jealous right now but it's making the
whites of your eyes open
- I love it looks baby you like snapchat
filter so I changed my shirt into
something more revealing and I will say
these are legitimately a shelf this is
why boobs are called a rack I don't know
I don't think I like this I don't think
I like them I was like checking out your
butt and it was like it was it way it
was like it's bigger yeah yeah but I
still miss your old but honey thank you
I kind of miss it too okay I took my
boobs out to go to yoga
I am very comfortable I got like my
boobs the big butts been fun all the
banter around it has been fun but I'm
getting kind of tired of it just because
I feel so good that I've gotten so
comfortable with my body in the last
like 10 years or so so it kind of feels
like I'm taking a step back so Fred what
do you have there these are my butt pads
what a ride we've had how'd it go I will
be very honest and say I didn't like it
a lot it was really fun to just kind of
be someone else for a little bit even
though it was just my eyes so I went and
I changed into a tighter shirt because
my shirt was kind of like loose and
flowy and I was like so self-conscious
that someone would notice that I was
kind of walking around like this so I
didn't feel as self-conscious in them as
I thought I would I was actually having
a lot of fun with them what was the most
surprising thing that happened I think
people liked me better without the blue
eyes which was a nice lesson learned
as you sort of like get further and
further away from those awkward teenage
years you just become more comfortable
in your body I'm such a proponent of
like accepting your body and like
self-love and then just like wearing
these kind of felt like girl what are
you doing yeah didn't feel like you yeah
I think it's totally normal to want what
you can't have and when you actually get
it you don't feel like your true self it
made me feel proud of myself for being
way more comfortable in my body now than
I used to be there's not a problem with
like seeing what different things look
like and kind of looking at that but
like at the end of the day you are you
and you should be proud of it like I
should be proud of my brown eyes I'm
still insecure about some things but
like I feel like you sort of develop
tactics and techniques to accept it as
opposed to trying to like constantly
figure out ways to change it and of
course I'm not 100% mature or 100% a
functioning adult but it is cool to see
like
that you can just be more comfortable
and things do get better
