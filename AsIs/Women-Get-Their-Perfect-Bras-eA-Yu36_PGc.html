the time I am in a sports bra I'm so
used to just hiding my body because it's
been so hard finding anything that fits
I'm intrigued by this power that women
have that's all their own how sexy we
look at undergarments and I've never
been able to pull that off the whole
idea of a bra fitting is to find your
size find the brawl that works for you
so that you can walk out feeling like
it's just an extension of your body what
will be your dream well I like color I
like to be fun something that like lifts
these bad boys which I feel are just
hiding away all the time it is actually
functional at the same time I feel like
sometimes having like bigger boobs you
think maybe you'd get like an older
looking across turn lead oh yeah we're
gonna X the matronly bras and get you
all shape there I understand you don't
wear any bras I do now I wouldn't like
any wire no I don't want anything that
makes me feel encumbered like I sort of
still want to feel like I'm not wearing
anything I notice here that because of
this brawl you have like a little groove
and as a result of your bra moving up
and down up so we're gonna fix that are
you scared
yeah it's gonna be just as comfortable
as a sports bra promise you that
I would never put myself in that I know
you would but I really like it this is
so sexy I did I feel like this is just
like a crop top it feels comfortable it
is pretty it is oh my gosh it's not bad
that's like a shaping lace there it's
got a little stretch graphic there and
what's great about it is it allows for
you to have this plunge here when I'm
going out of the bra
these are actually bralette and braless
are simply just another form of a bra
without any wire we do have channeling
to kind of keep you lifted and do you
notice that this is all of your own
breasts yeah I did this yeah there's no
padding
there's no lining for that bounce this
one here is a 42 mm what size did I have
our 40 double D this is a common
technique with most stores that sell
brawls in addition to their clothing
they will take the largest cup size that
they have and they'll just keep sizing
your band up you know enough till they
can get it to cover at least a boob I
knew I was wearing the wrong damn sighs
yeah since you just did a bralette now
let's go to it underwire bra okay oh my
god who is this vixen first of all I
love this color I like it because it's
like cute and it's fun but it's like
also here are my boobs I love this one
great I've got tits you've had them the
whole time
this doesn't even feel like an underwire
like it feels like it's barely there and
I just love how this totally elevated my
boob game you go to certain stores and
they sell a lot of push-up
what kind of sends the message to the
woman that what you have is not enough
yeah but here you get that same rounded
molded shape now of all the extra
padding this has like a very very tiny
bit of foam molding there but it doesn't
have any padding so again this is all
kind of more like a bright oh it feels
so comfortable my other one I felt like
my boobs were on like a show this makes
me want to wear a low-cut top right I've
never ever wanted to do before what are
we doing this down I know
don't get scared don't get scared I'm
gonna slide this down here oh just shut
up that is so useful first of all it's
useful if you want a little bit of a
perk and for some women that have
heavier brisk take the weight off the
shoulder lose it right there
this feels so much better yeah I think
this is great I feel like I've learned a
lot about my body memories so I've been
wearing this bra for a couple of hours
now and it just feels like it's a part
of me I keep just wanting to do these
like flashes to people just things like
everyone should know usually when I wear
shirts like this my boobs
and today they're just sitting there so
happy it's the end of the day and I'm
shocked I'd forgotten I was even wearing
this bra so I think it goes to show that
if I have to wear bra I should wear one
that probably fits me do you notice
anything different about me at all
you're wearing a bra yes this experience
overall was very great I've had fittings
before other stores but it just wasn't
as like personable and as like genuine
is this fitting was I wish all bras
could keep in mind how different breast
shapes are I don't know if I'll start
wearing bras everyday but I definitely
think I will wear this bra like I'm
genuinely impressed that I feel so
comfortable it's so weird that for most
people with boobs they don't know what
to do with them like this is just taking
steps to like a more confident woman I
want to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
