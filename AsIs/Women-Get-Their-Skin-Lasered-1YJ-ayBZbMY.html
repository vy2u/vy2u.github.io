will be removed you may smell that today
we're gonna get our skin laser at skin
laundry I've never done anything to my
face that's my whole background I've
never been to any facial store I put a
lot of stuff on my face but I've never
done lasers here at skin laundry we
offer a 15-minute no downtime laser and
light facial that is going to deep clean
your skin it goes down into the dermal
layer vaporizes out dirt bacteria dead
skin cells toxins oil makeup and gives
your skin a really nice glow it also
targets pigments even the tone of your
skin and stimulates collagen and elastin
production to tighten and tone the skin
and anti-aging the inside out a lot of
people ask if the treatment hurts it
should not be painful the sensation is a
prickling feeling and also a little bit
of heat I'll be taking Sarah and Katie
back for their consultation and talk
them through the process and give them
beautiful glowing skin
because of your skin type we will be
including a second portion of the
treatment okay which is called IPL it
stands for intense pulsed light so this
part of the treatment will come after
the laser because you have more highly
pigmented skin we are going to skip the
IPL portion of the treatment this is
just a safety measure the IPL comes with
more risks because it treats the
epidermis outside of the skin whereas
the laser goes deeper down I'm thinking
like you begin
this pop-rock bro shocking doing great
it smells like burning plastic so that
is the good smell that you get when
everything's getting cleaned out of your
skin it smell of success
okay that's it I feel lasered yeah so
now we're gonna begin the second part of
your treatment the IPL intense pulsed
light is going to be just a really
bright flash they feel a little bit of
heat and this will treat the superficial
layer of your skin it's going to target
redness pigments and formation bacteria
on the outside and also like my skin
feel tighter naturally dewy that's
awesome I like I love it like honestly
and I do kind of like that intense
feeling that like you're gonna feel a
lot of your getting it done
so clean
oh no I'm very dirty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
