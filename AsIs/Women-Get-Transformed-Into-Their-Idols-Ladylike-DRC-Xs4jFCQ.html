our idols I think having a female role
models is extremely important for young
girls oh it's so powerful it's so
important being able to see yourself
represented honestly just opens up this
whole world of what you believe that you
can do you're one person right and you
look at yourself and you're like there's
no way I can do any of the things that I
want to do and then you see people that
you admire people that you relate to you
sort of say hey I can I can do that too
I can I think it's so so important to
give credit to our female role models
and the women who shaped us and inspired
us and remember them for how
awesome they were and still are and
we'll be so today I chose to be
transformed into Tracee Ellis Ross she's
so unapologetic in her whole aesthetic
and her personality and it's sort of
just like what you see is what you get
take it or leave it one of my favorite
quotes from Tracee Ellis Ross was in an
interview and she was talking about when
she's like auditioning for parts and
getting hired for certain roles and she
said if you hire me you hire my hair and
you hire my ass it's all coming with me
and she's just sort of like BAM Here I
am I'm amazing inside of my skin and
outside of my skin and take me as I am
once I actually was made aware of Selena
I was like oh my god she kind of looks
like me that's amazing
Selena fry me yes what's happening right
now seeing how unapologetically Mexican
she was was so empowering to me it's
crazy to me how bold she was able to be
at such a young age not only was she
bold and powerful in who she was her
identity but she was bold and powerful
with her fashion sense with her business
and just her talent avatar last
airbender is a show that means a lot to
me
I watched it when I was probably about
19 so I was a little bit older and I
really connected to it just because it's
like an amazing fantastic story with
really strong characters and it's all
they're all Asian which is just like
that's dope but the reason I love Toph
so much is because Toph is just like a
 badass and she's probably the
only like young girl character that I've
ever seen on TV that I actually really
related to I mean she's just kind of a
little brat like she's super-smart she's
super sarcastic she's just like she
doesn't take from anybody and she's
also incredibly strong she's like the
strongest fighter in that show as I grew
older Lucille Ball became someone whose
existence I was extremely thankful for I
mean she did it first Lucille Ball was
in every way just a trailblazer part of
the first interracial couple depicted on
television one of the first female
studio heads in Hollywood started her
own studio producer own show
I got a yielding an alien kind of I'm a
newborn fetus she was a beautiful
feminine fashion icon but also hilarious
it's just she's so freakin cool man I'm
so excited to get transformed into
Tracey she is a style icon and I
actually do my makeup to try and look
like her every day
I'm so excited are you kidding
me I am so excited to be tough I wanted
to be tough for so long I don't know how
it will look with orange hair but we're
just gonna go for it and do it I did
tell Sarah who's doing hair today that I
have some sideburns that need to be
covered up at first I was like I don't
want to wear a bustier I don't feel
comfortable doing up and I was like you
know what Celina did it I wanna do it
let's do it I'm so ready
thank you so I was in the makeup chair
for a while I mean I already feel great
all I want to do is just like runway
walk all the way around this this white
bag this is the most undressed I've been
while being clothed in front of people
in front of Internet it I can see like
my hair from my peripheral vision like I
get to see it poking out and looking
very Tracy asked so are you ready
yourself I mean technically I can't see
myself because Toph is blind but I'll
see myself this is crazy I don't even
look I look completely different oh my
god oh my god I a little bit look like
JLo looking like Selena but I'm still
fine with that I'll take that I look
crazy and powerful I just look totally
different what this have like look
composed like that arched eyebrow
you know the glamor shots ricky-ricky
I'm honestly speechless I don't yeah
this is the coolest thing I've ever worn
and I once wore a cape it's so crazy
because I just stalk Tracy's Instagram
all the time just watching all of her
glam red carpet looks and even just her
casual looks he just looks flawless kind
of crazy to see that I'm kind of like
recreating that and emulating her well
she was so glamorous I feel a super
powerful I feel like I could go out on
the street and like live my best life I
feel in awe I don't feel like I'm
looking at myself I feel like I'm
looking at her so I'm just kind of like
hey what's up I've always looked up to
her and now I'm just looking straight
ahead at me and seeing her Salina suits
me I will say that when I first watched
avatar like I didn't totally understand
why I loved it so much and then as I
older I thought about more and I loved
it because it was like just like
interesting to see like portrayals of
Asian women just like being badass and
being fighters granted it's a cartoon
but to me it was like the most powerful
thing I could have watched Tracy is just
so many things she's funny she's
positive she's beautiful her body's
amazing her hair is everything she wears
grills she wears Jordans and also just
spreads like awesome positive light
hearted energy all the time and I just
want to like float around and just bless
people with positivity now the biggest
lesson I always take away from Lucy is
that if there isn't someone who's done
it before that doesn't mean you can't do
it I mean it's gonna be hard but you
should just do it you should be the
first one you should be the Trailblazer
I have all these people to look up to
and I have all these people that
influenced me and inspired me and I'm
sure she also had female role models but
there wasn't really anyone in Hollywood
who had done this before her so she just
did it she was iconic you know and it's
weird looking at yourself and being like
oh I kind of I kind of look iconic too
just by looking like her just everyone
know this is oh this is out of character
for Toph she can't see anything she's
blind and a quote from the show what is
wrong with you people
I'm blind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
