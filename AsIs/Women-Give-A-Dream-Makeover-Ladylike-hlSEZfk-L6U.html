unnoticed women who selflessly pushed
through even when things get tough so
today for Breast Cancer Awareness Month
we want to highlight one special woman
who deserves to be spoiled
it's ladylike and today we're giving a
breast cancer survivor her dream
photoshoot I'm somebody that's never
sick probably haven't had any kind of
illness in 10 years so to find out just
from a simple exam that I had cancer
it's overwhelming it's scary I held it
to myself for about two weeks before I
told my family at all
I think breast cancer awareness month
also is probably a call for heightened
compassion and empathy towards people
that may be dealing with something that
you don't understand how could this be
happening to me how unfair it seemed and
I was a single parent I worked hard and
it was all about my kids and my family
and and life was good I never thought
about life because I had it the word
cancer just it just I mean it freaks me
out it's just scary I think there are so
many different levels and aspects of a
woman that are affected by breast cancer
most importantly survival and then aside
from that you know femininity and really
feeling like yourself and feeling good I
really never put much effort into makeup
because I never really had to a little
bit of lip gloss and maybe a little
mascara and a bronzer and I was out the
door and about four days before I knew
would start to come out or even get
patchy I let the kids cut my hair in the
garage and did like my hair was it lost
my six-year-old granddaughter kept in a
box she want to keep it figure I hope
that somebody can look at this and say
wow that person could do it I could
totally do it sometimes just by existing
and by using your voice you help people
feel less alone and you help people feel
that they can get through it your hair
doesn't define you
press don't define you find yourself I
think it's cool that people can go
through something so
and be strong want to talk about it was
July 6 was my last treatment and then I
was scheduled to have the surgery on
August 8 they had said of the 24 nodes
that were taken out from under my arm
and the breast tissue that I didn't have
any cancer at all and that came from
something where you could feel it from
the outside it kind of felt like a
child's square block in there and that
medicine shrunk it down to the size of a
pea and then to nothing
women are so resilient it's incredible
the things that we can endure and
continue to keep pushing and living life
I'm really excited to just go out there
and make Diana feel like a superstar and
that she can take on anything because
she's already proven that she can my
dream photoshoot would probably be
something bold but also subtle maybe a
little trendy because my hair is a
little trendy now something where I'm
just celebrating life bright colors
something outside jeans crop has
something where my shoulders are showing
because they do have nice shoulders I've
never done anything with my eyes really
and and I would love to to really have
somebody show me or to put I makeup on
me to something to make your eyes pop
I've only ever really done just done
like a lip gloss I've only ever owned
one and I got it after I got sick so I
was never really into lipstick or
anything but I think that would be nice
to bring out the feminine
to celebrate me pick it out like how big
we finished up our photo shoot part and
so now we actually have the photos to
show you so I can let you look at these
and then we'll leave you alone
there you go so good beautiful
zoomy I'm so grateful for all the time
and effort that everybody put into um
what you did for me today I feel like a
queen
this son helps others to see what they
can do to and where you can take control
and kind of empowering your own life
this is way overboard to what I thought
it would be just fabulous and everybody
was there to help I don't have pictures
of myself since this all happened I
gotta have pictures when I let my kids
cut my hair but I didn't take
photographs and I didn't want to be
photographed in anything I do have a
favorite channel just pretty it's pretty
no matter where you're at and whatever
stage of kind of cancer you have you're
still a whole person what something
outside really doesn't make too much
difference and to be able to see that
and let people love on you and what
people do for you and help you and don't
be afraid to be bold and step out can we
kind of give you a hug please
it was an honor and pleasure and I'm
messing up my makeup oh yes I got it
stop I mean amazing thank you really did
come here how I go out to my yeah can we
pick a favorite I know yeah it was nice
- great
there's really beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
