feel really nervous when I was 18 I was
diagnosed with alopecia and my hair
started to fall out seven months ago
I just got annoyed at all and I
completely shaved my head I shaved my
head a year ago because I wanted to
explore my confidence outside of my hair
so right now my hair is along is that
it's ever been my ultimate goal is to
make it as long as possible to where
just flows unprovoked unprovoked swaying
I always took pride in having decently
long hair about four years ago I did do
the big chop when that was a huge step
for me but it was all in efforts to get
my hair healthy again and to get it back
to where it used to be it wasn't like I
loved my hair every day and I wasn't
like thinking I had the best hair in the
world but I was so able to not even
think about it I could just get up and
go and it was incredibly easy to manage
and then when I got diagnosed that
pichia all of a sudden something that I
completely taken for granted became this
like huge thing every day
growing up there was never like a woman
that took charge and just shaved her
head because she wanted to I wanted to
like take that step and try to be that
person for some little girl or boy out
there to just like rock nothing and be
confident in that completely covering up
something that's such a big part of my
identity is really scary to me I would
love to sit here and say yeah I think I
could be confident without my hair and
my hair doesn't define me like I've had
short hair before it'll be fine but like
I think tomorrow is gonna definitely be
a wake-up call to just learning more
about myself and what makes me me and
what makes me feel good I see a lot of
people with shaved heads which is funny
like there's literally a girl who lives
down the street from me who just has a
shaved head because like she thinks it
looks badass and she loves Amber Rose I
recognize that it is a privilege that I
can even do this experiment just for a
day while there are people who don't
have a choice we're gonna do it I'm
gonna sit there for two hours and be
bald
Wow oh my god
yeah this is crazy oh wow wow I wasn't
expecting to let this bald so I'm about
to go with my life completely bald we'll
see how it goes we look fierce we do
look fear we look fierce I I will say
I'm not as I'm not as nervous anymore
now that I see we both have very cute I
went bald for a day and it was an
emotion I see it goes there damn girl
I'm mighty good let me touch it yeah
that's it yeah you have a great head
shading the main word that I could say
to describe how I was feeling is just
shock it really brings out your eyes and
eyebrows and like I don't know I just
feel like I'm seeing a whole new side of
you everyone was just complimenting it
sure oh my god that's beautiful
I was just taking all these external
complements in order to feel good with
myself I've never based my own
self-worth or how I view myself with how
other people see me this really opened
my eyes to the fact that I can be so
vulnerable to that I was expecting you
guys to be Coneheads I think that's why
I don't think about weird actually okay
Becky has given us three challenges
challenge number one is to wear our
favorite outfit and see if we feel as
confident in it without our hair I wore
a dress that is most quintessential
Chantelle I wore an outfit that I really
really like which was a cheetah craft
app overalls and my adidas normally when
I wear that I'll get remarks like oh you
look like this Grecian goddess when I
had my bald cap on people were saying
that it looked like I should be
meditating or sitting atop a mountain or
like farming goats you immediately look
like every person like a sci-fi movie
this is like very firmly like Avatar The
Last Airbender initially I felt
self-conscious I am not as confident as
I thought I would be I am trying to
channel Amber Rose but yeah I just I
can't get there I've put on soft
sunglasses and then I felt like a whole
new person shades on yep I'm doing it
amber I see you hey girl
it was kind of disappointing that I
needed an accessory to validate how
pretty I felt we were also challenged to
see if we still felt sexy or desirable
with no hair you look great it's very
smooth
it's like dr. evil I don't think I felt
super sexy with a bald head but then I
realized that I don't think I feel super
sexy just in life and I don't think it
has anything to do with a being oh I
think it'd look really cute I think this
could like be a look for you I didn't
really feel less feminine while wearing
the bald cap but I think that's because
I had compensated with other ways I made
sure to wear a very dramatic winged
eyeliner put on more mascara than usual
because I was like I'm not gonna have
anything else to do
our last challenge that Becky gave us
was to go into a public space and not
give any disclaimers about why we were
bald and this was so hard because we
went to a fast food restaurant right
across the street from a high school
right when school let out and it was
filled with high schoolers there was one
squad that stopped us and asked for a
picture and I think it took a lot out of
both Chantal and I did not give it as
claim
why we were bald that was a big
challenge but we held strong right
Shandy it was so harder so weird nothing
was said about us being bald and we
realized that we cared way more about us
being bald than anyone else did so it's
time to get my bald cap removed I don't
know that I'm excited to get it off I
was just kind of living with it and it
was fine but I'm curious to see if I
feel differently about my hair once it's
fully out and hitting my shoulders again
I don't think I can accurately judge
what it's like to be bald just from one
day so I don't know I wish I could
experience it for longer I got a really
really really tiny glimpse into what
it's like to be bald if I was by myself
the entire day I would have been so
scared there are quite a few people who
are bald because of forces beyond their
control that are often the only ones in
that situation and so you don't have a
buddy you don't have an ally that you
could be standing next to this was more
of an exercise for myself to see like
where my confidence lies and if I could
splay life without hair I do fully
realize that a big reason why I probably
wasn't scared was because I knew that I
still had all my hair underneath this
bald cap and would have it at the end of
the day in terms of confidence and
feeling unstoppable I had to dig super
deep within myself to grab that
confidence from somewhere else because I
didn't have my hair coming into this I
felt so so attached to my hair and now I
don't feel quite as attached to it this
was a really rewarding experience for a
really unexpected reason and I can't say
that I wouldn't shave my
