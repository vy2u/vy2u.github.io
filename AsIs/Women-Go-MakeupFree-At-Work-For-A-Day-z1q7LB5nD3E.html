least all the women in the office doing
this yeah
I recently went off birth control and
it's the first time I've ever
experienced acne I'm worried that I
don't know why I care what people think
but I guess I'm worried about what other
people are gonna think so I think there
is some professionalism related to how
you present yourself guys don't usually
wear makeup so why should girls there is
something about putting on makeup that
does make me just stand up a little
taller and like go at the world with a
little more confidence I don't look
tired because I'm not I'm not feeling
sick because I'm not I'm just not
wearing makeup right now this is
probably the first time that I haven't
at least put eyeliner on since like high
school normally I would do a very heavy
black eyeliner some mascara and I would
cover under my eyes so like it's not a
lot but it's enough that I feel very
different I'm on my way to work wearing
no makeup whatsoever when people are
wearing makeup their humanity kind of
like radiates through and I put a little
bit of cover-up on some of these spots
and scars here this is actually the
first time that I'm going bare face to
work I normally at least have some
foundation on or something that just
covers up my blemishes I'm really
excited about the prospect of just doing
this all day and not worrying about
smudging I'm not very confident I really
shouldn't be scared of showing my face
it's my natural face it doesn't feel
like the real me the real me feels like
me with makeup on which is also a
terrible big today no makeup with my ear
fine honestly I'm not really thinking
about it when I see myself I'm like oh
that's different
I can eat a messy lunch without worrying
about my lipstick so I took some selfies
and I was like oh it's actually not that
bad
no you look great you look great too
knowing that like there are other girls
with me like not wearing makeup
yeah it just like makes me feel like I'm
not tell anyone yeah and then you look
at them and they look great yeah and
then they tell you you look great so
it's just like this really wonderful
cycle of acceptance I've been told that
I look glowy and dewy like a glossier
beauty without any makeup on today
makeup in general I think it accentuates
a certain type of beauty button like no
makeup also accentuates different so
I've been feeling pretty good I wonder
if the guys are gonna notice
all right price question for you okay
have you noticed anything different
about me or a lot of the women in the
office today
oh have to do with makeup it does
okay have you noticed anything about all
the women at BuzzFeed today I actually
did not I feel really terrible was I
supposed to
I really don't see anything different
okay I'm not wearing makeup today oh you
know my thoughts on women wearing makeup
are like my thoughts on women doing most
things which is do your thing
you don't have lipstick on Wow okay none
of us are wearing makeup today oh really
oh you look as beautiful as always uh no
seriously though I I didn't notice that
for me it doesn't matter if you wear
makeup or not whatever you're happy
doing I posted a picture of my fresh ass
face you did on Instagram and you
commented that you had no idea that I
was wearing makeup today I didn't
realize that you weren't wearing makeup
you don't look like tired you know you
don't look sick like the normal comments
that women get when they don't wear
makeup you didn't notice that like most
of the women you've come across our
totally bare based no I'm like I'm like
trying to go back through all the all
the women I've seen today I still love
you mm-hmm thanks babe so it's the end
of the worth day I made it it wasn't
that bad actually
you know the camaraderie of all the
women at work also not wearing makeup
really made me feel more secure in it to
embrace all the flaws all the scars all
these thoughts you have in your head
just let him go and take it away with
makeup wipe and just
so
so as you may have noticed boldly is now
as is but don't worry you'll still get
