an illusion a beautiful illusion today
I'm going add a without makeup I've been
wearing makeup since middle school my
morning makeup routine normally consists
of finishing spray and powder I was
really insecure about high look without
makeup in high school I had one eyeliner
always in my locker it's hard to even
remember a day where I haven't like gone
out of the house without a little bit of
makeup on like if they see me without
makeup on well they think you know I'm
ugly I wanted to go makeup free for a
day at work to challenge my fear of
people seeing my acne scars I think it's
silly to feel anxious and nervous about
something that occurs naturally and to
hundreds of thousands of people and I
have a fancy dinner thing and I've never
not worn makeup to anything like that
I'm afraid that if I don't wear makeup
it'll look like I'm unprofessional
unless I'm sick I have makeup on time to
remove my makeup Oh Jigga on the Kiera
oh God
I'm nervous but excited I love a good
adventure and this is definitely going
to be an adventure for me I am still me
just not wearing makeup some reason I
just feel like no one will be able to
take me seriously now I just took all my
makeup off I'm heading to office now to
go show my co-worker is my fresh a face
sign that I look like garbage
I'm kind of nervous to go out and walk
around work I feel like I look really
different I'm just waiting for the first
person to say you look tired I was you
know thinking like yeah it's it's okay
like it's one event like I won't wear
makeup if I don't wear makeup do I look
like I don't care to be at this thing so
I don't know what I'm gonna go through
is you guys notice anything about me
today you have a piercing you're sick is
this real are you kidding hey don't
worry makeup Oh ding ding ding looks
like you're you look the same like very
normal all I'm actually shocked this is
the start of a new life for me I'm
telling you do you notice anything
different about no Lord um a very nice
dress I don't know I know I'm not
wearing makeup oh well make any of a
natural beauty oh my god
I honestly never understood why we wear
makeup I've always seen it's a personal
choice for personal artistic 20 site
that doesn't mean it's a requirement or
that not really he's a bad thing I
normally don't want to come to work bare
face because of like my acne I have a
lot of scars yeah it's so weird that you
like your dear ass give you this cuz it
was today that I was like I'm gonna
start wearing no makeup like to work wow
did you have any qualms about like I
don't want to look unprofessional at
work or like I'm trying hard no cuz I'm
doing it for me
I felt I had to put on makeup because of
somebody else's
feelings towards it that would be like
no no actually very surprised with the
response I've gotten one a ton of
compliments and a lot of people say that
they didn't realize I wasn't wearing
makeup which I find a little
unbelievable honestly I really don't see
a difference I don't think of you any
less professional than your do everyday
I'm already really unprofessional I
think as long as you do your work and
you have a great work ethic already then
that's all that matters to me babe what
do you think of the fact that I do our
makeup to work today do you want the
truth yeah I barely knows when you wear
makeup great whatever but I love you at
night too and you don't wear makeup then
so I just don't see it maybe I'm just
not paying attention to you so my friend
who was going with me to this event came
over a bit before and convinced me not
to wear makeup because he gassed me up
and was like you look amazing without it
so I was really set on not wearing it I
was like you're right
I see Alicia Keys do that on the red
carpet and I think she looks amazing but
then he mentioned that my crush was
going to be there and I was like let me
go get my makeup bag I want to look my
best for someone that I'm into okay I
know it was only one day but I think I
learned a lot I've been wearing makeup
for so long that it's become almost a
part of my identity probably more of a
security blanket for me I can say that I
actually feel comfortable going to work
without makeup and and I would do it
again so it was really beautiful to see
that transformation in myself even just
after a day the best thing about this
whole thing is that I'm falling asleep
and I don't have to get up to take my
makeup off
