life ever since I started my natural
hair journey a few years ago I still
feel like a bit of a novice I've dug
into blogs and blogs and forums and
learned a lot about black hair care but
I also run into a lot of weird terms and
acronyms and jargon that frankly do not
make any sense to me it got me wondering
do other black women know what these
terms are
I decided to go and find out I will
guess before curls can i phone a friend
bc is not before christ it is the big
chop
shrinkage shredding in knots shrinking
I'm so sad because the rest of them I
would ever get but this one I ain't got
it Senegalese short curls with a K like
the Kardashians here's why I cut my hair
you are so much to know I know what a
good pineapple is will you put your hair
in a ponytail yes like so and use a big
scrunchie like the one on my arm and you
put it down and you come up and then you
look like a pineapple is weave the W
teeny-weeny Afro I had a Twi X I was
bald I never said the word weenie in my
life oh yeah everybody knows good old
red ding ding ding I got em in my head
it's an acronym really lover of culture
lots of curls blather and wienie bitch
we ain't at a restaurant what is it I
should definitely have known that one
because that is basically what I've been
doing since I was 4 years old
my gut wants to say that you're not
supposed to do cream first this is what
anybody of God does this is what normal
people do speak this one sounds right
but I think this one is right yeah I
think it's the oil that locks in the
cream and the liquid I feel like I've
seen this before
it sounds like um what I say when like I
don't know how to answer a question like
right now
he he's gotta be one of these ages hot
iron hoes
ya know I don't know I don't know what
is it oh my god do I suffer from that or
do I suffer from that oh no my mama beat
that out of me when I was sick you
can run your hand through your curls all
day if you feel like it I do
I care about my hair but only so much I
think beauty bloggers who use this term
as shorthand but you guys really don't
need to worry about it if you know the
process if you've been through the
process you're good some people
definitely knew their stuff and knock
this quiz out of the park to China
clearly these are real turns and real
things and I need to get educated but
other people just as badly as I did the
first time I heard what these firms were
acronyms know acronyms expertise no
expertise do what feels right do what
feels best and always moisturize
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
