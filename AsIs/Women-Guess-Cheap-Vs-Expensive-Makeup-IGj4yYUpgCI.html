face we're gonna put a drugstore brand
makeup and on the other half it's going
to be high end and then we're gonna have
to try to figure out which is which cuz
we won't know this you're doing the left
one under the rail edition
oh god it's clumping maybe this is gonna
be a new look looking at her right now I
cannot tell a difference between either
side the left one I feel like is the
more expensive one right is the
drugstore one great the one on the left
is high-end the one on the right is the
high-end I'm always wrong with the stuff
this feels like a temporary chapstick
this feels like we're good for the night
yeah yeah nice
I need more oh it looks so similar to me
same pigment same consistency okay you
look at each other I like the one on the
left better I think it has more of like
the shimmer going drugstore expensive
high-grade yeah Oh
Oh the one on the right is the high-end
just because it's really pigmented I was
gonna say the same thing hey the
higher-end makeup is the one on the
right because it's less shiny than the
one on the left this is already so
difficult to do like in the morning I
can't do it in front of a camera crew
hmm the one on the right is very watery
putting it on doesn't feel as secure I
think in 10 minutes it's gonna be off my
face I think the one on the left is
nicer and the one on the right is the
drugstore one go L'Oreal I think that
the left is the high-end because it's
more pigmented I got a better little
flick of a wrist going on with the
little cat eye and I like it oh and we
were wrong
this guy is low-end it looks better I
think but I don't think it would last
very long yeah I agree
I don't know what to think anymore
either get on your chin uh I could get
on your chin moving on to the right eye
so I close my eyes really hard and open
them and then I saw which one ended up
above above my eye the left one did more
such is why I say you are drugstore and
you are more expensive I think that the
right one is the fancy one I'm gonna go
the opposite route and say the high-end
is the left one it blends nicely but
there's no amount of blending in the
world that can make this look like I
don't have a black eye high-end I like
it better low-end
don't like it hey I know my stuff uh I
learned that it can go both ways
lore'l shocked us and that's the
eyeliner I would choose but as far as
lipstick goes I'd want the higher end
because I think it's gonna last longer
it could be worth spending more it
really depends on the product but for a
lot of stuff it just doesn't make a
difference like I think I wasn't able to
identify what was high-end and low-end
pretty easily but that doesn't
necessarily mean that I like the
high-end better but yeah I think the
biggest thing I learned today is that I
should never ever wear smoky eye again
