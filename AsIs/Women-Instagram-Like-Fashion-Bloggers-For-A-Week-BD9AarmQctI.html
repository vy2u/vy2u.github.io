whenever I see one I like break out in a
rash because I'm just like oh why do
people do this I only use my Instagram
for like nature photos so a lot of the
people I follow on Instagram are like
landscape photographers I think that my
Instagram feed will hopefully become a
little more cohesive and less like oh my
god dog dog dog selfie dog a lot of
photos of stuff I do at work also my dog
shots and my friends and husband and I
hey everyone my name is Jen M and today
I'll be teaching the BuzzFeed ladies how
to post like an Instagram fashion and
lifestyle content creator
nice to meet you girls so these are my
five kind of tips on how I manage my
Instagram account it doesn't really
matter what device you're using to take
your photo definitely get a DSLR but
honestly I feel like just the camera
that comes with your phone works well so
if you're using an iPhone just find a
place that has shade somewhere that has
completely even lighting and you're just
going to get a beautiful creamy photo
once you've got your perfect photo it's
time to bust open those apps I'll run it
through Snapseed first and then I'll put
it on visco camp then I'll just like
throw a couple filters in and filters
you can just really play around with
whatever you prefer my personal favorite
filters are a six and a seven and then
s1 and s2
you could have separate like work with
life or it doesn't kind of mesh together
in the beginning it was a little
overwhelming for me because I just did
not know when to stop because when I
would go to a really beautiful location
I would feel this pressure to it okay I
need to document this it's when you
start seeing yourself like kind of
stressing over a moment that's supposed
to be enjoyable just stop yourself
because that's not healthy you need to
to learn to enjoy the moment and take it
in you know I think they definitely have
it under control as long as they keep
the five tips in mind they're gonna be
totally fine day one was fun because it
was like basically a professional shoot
I felt really pretty and really gorgeous
it was a lot more challenging than I
thought it would be my usual morning
routine is I pick up whatever's on the
floor that doesn't smell gross and I put
it on the selfie with a product or food
item was a little tricky at first
because I feel like when you see people
doing product photos on their Instagram
it's usually sponser I really wanted to
make sure that if I was gonna take a
photo with the product I wasn't
representing something I didn't stand
for you know how people are like oh my
god look at my legs while overlooking
this gorgeous scenic beach while eating
avocado tostadas not me so I decided to
just show what I was doing that night
which was watching Vanderpump rules yeah
the land to get better lighting this is
so ridiculous the mirror shot
was the hardest photo I took it was like
why am i standing in front of a mirror
and taking a photo because the camera is
a mirror how do you feel to be forced
into being my Instagram photographer for
the next week damn right it does I was
doing more things this week than I have
done in the past month this video forced
me to go out and do interesting things I
honestly felt a little bit uncomfortable
with the idea of doing a whole personal
photo shoot for me in my outfit I'm just
not used to drawing that much direct
attention to myself you're hung over
you're not eating like gourmet food like
microbiotic gluten-free sandwiches I got
my awesome Panda Express so I did a flat
lay of some chow mein and orange chicken
but you know what I was like let's
classy it up so I put a little dip tea
candle in there and I'm like I see this
on other people's instagrams they add a
candle and it makes everything classier
why can't it make my little styrofoam
box of Chinese food classier yeah it's
on a shoot we're doing black style
through history that was a civil rights
freedom fighter I never thought about
how just taking a photo of your outfit
could immortalize that day
I dug into my archives and found a
picture of all three of us looking
really nice a picture that my dad took
last Christmas I had you know my work
wife Jasmine here and she's just like so
fashionable and cool I feel like she
just makes any photo better so the
hardest part of this challenge has been
bamboozling unsuspecting friends into
taking photos of me so the most recent
person I bamboozled today was my friend
Alex
she took my sitting pretty photo really
vacation on that my posts have been
getting a lot more likes than usual the
two photos I got ton of likes where
I like moustache shaving acne cream one
and my Panda Express one I definitely
think that my followers commented a lot
more on these posts I think they were
excited to see me in my everyday
environment the talent in these kind of
Instagram bloggers is they make it look
like it's not a lot of hard work but a
lot of hard work goes into it I wouldn't
have been able to pull it off if I
didn't keep bringing pictures from that
I took before him and just posting them
having to have a presence in social
media today and maintain followers on
Instagram and Twitter and everything
else is like having to do work outside
of work
she just summed up everything I've been
feeling in the Instagram world you
should respond to people you should
comment on other people's things like I
definitely learned there's a lot of love
in that community it doesn't matter if
you only have a 40 people following and
they have a 90 thousand people following
if you compliment them that affects them
because they're human and I think I had
a reminder of how human we really are
and it doesn't matter how many followers
you have you can still create that human
connection
this somehow doesn't look as extensive
as I wanted it to look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
