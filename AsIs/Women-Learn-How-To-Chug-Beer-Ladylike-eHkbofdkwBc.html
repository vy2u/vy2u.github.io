just yoga we're doing yoga or yoga this
is therapy
summers here and what's summer without
drinking game
flooring summer none of us really know
how to chug but we know someone who does
hi I'm Ashley Perez and I have a secret
talent for chugging my mom is really
proud of me a lot of people think that
chugging is about being really
aggressive and tipping your head back
and spilling beer all over yourself but
actually it's about being patient
opening your mouth gross and then
enjoying your beer so today I'm going to
show these dudes how to drink like a
lady shut up I love beer I love drinking
games my favorite one is flip Cup the
most I've ever chugged is in flip Cup
which is about this much so I don't know
I'm excited to learn I don't have high
hopes because I have a small boat when I
was a kid I had to have major surgery
that required me to have a lot of
ultrasounds and to make my friends feel
better about the experience because they
were very scared for me I would race
them in water chugging contest now I've
never judged a beer I'm very hard liquor
that's just the way I go just straight
vodka with a little bit of soda
I heard it's all about like breathing
and really opening up your throat and
relaxing and I'm just a very tense
person so we'll see we're going to start
with still water move on to sparkling
water
chug a little bit of beer and then
they're gonna chug a full beer for the
championship Cup which I know you all
really want settle your nerves burgers
really nervous our nerves so it's kind
of breathe in and out like this just go
excellent that was great Candice in
Finnish kind of let it trickle down and
don't gulp so that your throat doesn't
close okay ready 1 2 3
great Kiki I think you're checking is
coming back here your world King Silas
College Kiki is that I actually think
this is the easiest one to chug cuz
there's fewer bubbles okay - the taste
okay ready good yes yes did I do it
okay ladies I think you're ready for the
ultimate beer chug off where each of you
will be drinking a can of beer we're
gonna see who can drink this the most
gracefully and the most quickly okay so
no spillage want breathing relaxing slow
sips I'm terrified I have got to go
standard one two three
she's squeaky clean well I think that's
the only thing ready you were really
close though I was for you I kinda get
it still drinking attempting to finish
this beer I've been interested that was
so impressive I want to compete against
you all right I was so impressed with
Kristen's drinking that I wanted to
challenge her just to see how fast she
can actually chug how do you feel about
that I feel very nervous I'm already
like one beer in me - I'm tipsy
it's 11:30 in the morning and we're
drunk one two three
Kristen and I are gonna go leave and go
to the bars and I'll Chuck some down no
you guys I feel great
have a good summer dream obviously I
love you you know what so ladies helping
ladies
it's ladylike and I'm okay with this I
almost ruined our friendship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
