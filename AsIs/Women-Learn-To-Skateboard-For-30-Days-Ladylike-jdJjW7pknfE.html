ever something you wish you could do for
me
it was game boarding we might not be
cool or athletic but for the next month
we will skateboard every day I drew
blood my leg kids
when I was a kid anyone I knew that
skateboarded was a boy there weren't any
girls around me who skated so I was like
hell no because I'm worried about not
being seen as tough enough I think that
it would be a really great like mind
exercise to just try and like psych
myself into doing things that I'm afraid
of I want to be fearless on the
skateboard
I'm doing this to fulfill a childhood
dream I hope I don't die
we're at Ellie's cave about to get our
boards pretty excited yeah I have to
choose from the type of boards you want
to like if you want to learn her own
probably the best choice for you was not
to go bigger than anything so he killed
eight seven seven five seven eight nine
and then 75 and 76 I think I'm into the
black and white stripes I'm gonna go
with baby day John to this Paisley you
got a bow yeah there's a lot of people
skateboarding out there that are really
good and we're gonna be better than them
just four short weeks yeah we're taking
our first game boarding lesson today at
the skate park
skateboarding is definitely something
like you know that you're gonna fall so
it's all about learning how to use your
paths everyone else is really good and
we're getting like driven around story
is embracing it his arms
you haven't like that any major Falls
yet Cory walk us through how to do a
nollie and pop our boards which we're
gonna practice after this lesson no
we're not no I'm not gonna practice that
for another couple weeks yeah well how
was your first lesson guys it was great
it was scary but it was less scary
anything that actually does yeah y'all
feel pretty good hotels bleeding but
like that's fine yeah I'm hardcore yeah
so hard stay to skating in the parking
lot behind BuzzFeed I would say that
we've gotten a little bit better already
jen is like already allying huh I'm just
learning how to ride a skateboard I did
difficult part is riding his skateboard
fontelle is learning how to tic-tac
right now Saturday
how about to skate it'll be a pretty
intense skate session today
Wow when I first got here today
I definitely felt still really unstable
but now I'm actually starting to be able
to go at cruising speeds I feel a lot
more comfortable popping my board up
every time I try to ollie though I just
completely it up I'm actually
really proud of myself for being able to
improve in a couple days I'm not
discouraged I don't know I just again
like I just want it so badly so I wanted
to happen
today we just gathered as many like
women skaters as we could around the
office and we went to an old parking lot
and we're just like trying to skate
together and have fun even if I haven't
gotten astronomically better I feel like
my confidence has completely surpassed
what I thought it could be
before is just like every second of it
was scary but now I'm starting to have
fun and forward forward see lost a loved
one to look the new way yes yeah that
was awesome
whoo today is our second lesson with
Corey our first lesson we were in the
baby pond so maybe try skating something
a little bit more adventurous I'm pretty
inconsistent like there's some days that
I'll have and just be like really
comfortable and really feeling it and
then the next day I'm falling all over
the place right now like big challenges
is getting more comfortable ollieing
it's been I've watched out a million
times the past two weeks of like falling
a shit-ton I'm looking forward to this
class to help me just really feel okay
and feel stable
the skatepark is full of really really
experienced guys that like know a lot
about skating and so there is I think
for all of us like a little bit of
self-consciousness any last words of
advice stick to it
persevere skating is a cool thing a lot
of camaraderie you know everyone's kind
of there to pump each other up what's up
we're starting a shred Posse atrocity oh
yeah today we are at the skate park with
some amazing lady skaters so empowering
so great love them all hello my name is
Tara Jepsen and I've been skating for
seven years I'm a 43 year old woman live
in Los Angeles California and that's my
friend ham I love skateboarding because
it's outdoors its freedom its
interpretation you know you got it yeah
yeah yeah nice everyone belongs here
every kind of person every ability level
how'd it go
I'm gonna chat again yeah I received my
first sticker several percent
skateboarder there's this tiny little
slope in this new parking lot that we
found it is the fastest that I've ever
gone by myself
we did we did
a on day one I was terrified I was just
so afraid of everything now I feel like
super comfortable just riding my
skateboard anywhere I feel really
comfortable turning I can ollie a little
bit it was more than just trying to
match the tricks
it was moreso proving to myself that I
could do certain things and just like
getting over my fears I feel like for
sure skating is something that's going
to be a part of my life
honestly I came a lot further than I
ever thought that I would</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
