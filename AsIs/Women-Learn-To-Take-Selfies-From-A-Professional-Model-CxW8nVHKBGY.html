selfie is either if there's someone else
in it or if I'm making a really dumb
face kind of like a I don't really like
selfies and I might silently judge
anyone who takes them I actually take a
lot of selfies it's just another form of
self-expression I would like to take a
selfie and be like okay I actually feel
good about that I'm going to attempt to
take a lying-down selfie while still
looking okay oh look human this is not a
flattering way to live this is terrible
I love it I'm gonna try to take a mirror
selfie like I just want to make it look
like hey guys I walk by and ooh feelin
this click keep on going right now I
don't even know like where to place my
camera feeling yourself selfies usually
like people are like mmm oh
I'm naturally very seductive that looked
fake I don't really take food selfies
we're gonna get this attract there's no
way to be cute like this oh my gosh so
I'm doing my undies peg I've never sent
many of these I think I just stand here
honestly this is something I would send
to my parents so I'm gonna try to take
an outdoor selfie I've never been good
at it that's squinty but if I go the
other way oh I turned it off I'm getting
some good palm trees from down here but
then I get a lot of chin okay
hi I'm Tess Holliday I'm a plus-size
model and a body-positive ambassador
today I'm going to be helping people
take their best selfies and have fun
this is a selfie I took of myself lying
down
I love the volume in your hair you look
like you're scared to death of the
cheese the common thing in all of the
photos has been the light when I'm
definitely feeling myself I don't use
overhead lighting like this I'll try and
find natural lighting the same problem I
do when you lay down your girls go this
way so if you have a pillow that it
helps kind of keep it up your missus
like this it needs to be like flicked
and then you're cut your fingers do you
just want to make sure that the Sun is
behind you behind me yeah when I like
glow like a little baby angel when I do
mirror selfies I'll put my hat on my
waist usually and then bend my legs I
automatically go into some like prom
things I'll put it like this or
sometimes I'll bring my hand up like
this so that you can see the shape of
your weight you're totally on the road
to perfection cool all right let's try
it
so we put the pillow underneath the
blanket your hair is already laying
magically you can put your hand on your
test if you want just to make it
actually really natural that's just what
you do when you're laying in the park
but then tilt your chin down cute your
smizing you need my help this is what I
would normally do I would just do
something like this and we like put that
hand on your waist a little bit higher
bring the sock and then you can do the
pose like I showed you where you bring
your feet more together it feels very
unnatural to get a natural photo and
then give a little smile maybe turn so
that your head to the side yeah there
you go and tilt it back my god or the
foam oh oh God look at the difference so
you could do a hand do a hand like bring
a hand like here but do like this like
like this yeah cute
hey girl and like before I was like you
don't have to put it in your mouth
okay shed you a few it you know I just
meant like if you want to be I'm feeling
this right now look how cute village
light behind my behind you so does that
mean like right behind my head oh okay I
see I might just change I like did just
to be hostage it's not all about how you
hold the phone
you're like precious moments hahaha I
think you nailed it okay Suzie oh do you
like how I got so don't have moral
support so I would turn like that and
then bring your leg a little bit higher
yes there you go and then okay and then
pop your mat no I'm no problem without
but taking a photo oh no no it was worth
it you were too busy filling yourself
this is an art okay thank you I love the
fact that I know how to hold my phone
properly will mean that the whole
process is much more enjoyable
maybe I wasn't liking selfies because I
wasn't taking good selfie I'm going to
take the whole put my hand down and
really like work my curves just being
able to take that mirror selfie it made
me feel a little more confident I don't
think it's bad to be proud of you know
if you're feeling your look one day I
think so these are a lot of fun I think
that we should stop giving people a hard
time for feeling good about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
