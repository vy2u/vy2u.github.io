it's ladylike and this week we're gonna
be making our own clothes I've never
done anything remotely close to this I
don't know how to sew don't know how to
thread a needle well my mom's kind of an
avid sower she always hems my garments
growing up I can thread a needle I can
fold over the fabric at the bottom that
you're supposed to him I love having a
whole sewing kit
I feel pretty comfortable with the
needle and thread in my hand not so much
with a sewing machine well I've never
used a sewing machine those things scare
me a lot I was 7th grade I was a
straight-a student except for the 1c
that I got in home economics she gave me
three tries to correct my pin cushion I
couldn't do it we're here today at
ashton her Oda's showroom his brain is
called ash and Michael he's like a
really really really good fashion
designer and somehow agreed to help us
make our own clothes
hi Ashton hi everybody morning welcome
to my studio
thank you it's you know cool in here ank
you thank you thank you for coming how
did you get started designing and sewing
I've been sewing since I was a child I
think my mother always kind of raised me
with a fun artistic outlet and my
father's mother sewed her sewing
machines actually the one in the front
from 1930s I'm also a very huge fan of
Project Runway I'm not saying that I
would be a good fashion designer but I
definitely have the desire we'll see
about how it turns out so do you
remember like the first piece of
clothing that you sewed by yourself I do
it was terrible it was a t-shirt and I
bought a patch from Michael
arts-and-crafts put it on the front it
was just a piece of suede nothing to it
I thought this is so amazing
sleeves were crooked nothing was right
but I was so proud I wore that shirt for
a good day until it fell apart I don't
have a goal my goal is just to make it
through this week with some sort of
fabric that can hang on my body what
piece of advice do you have for me I
don't know how to do any
be patient let's start with that I mean
I'll take care of you I promise I will
thread your needle for you would you say
it's like the hardest thing about
designing and constructing your own
clothes you gotta find out very soon I
think the hardest part is taking a
concept from a drawing to reality
because a lot of times that doesn't
translate the exact same whether it's
the shape of the body you're working
with or the fabric draping and properly
yeah my goal this week is to not poke
myself too many times I've learned over
the years that you can't fight it
there's always like we call them the
fashion God like if something's not
working it's not supposed to work like
just go with it change it and like a job
Aston's gonna take us to his favorite
fabric store he's gonna help us pick out
a pattern he's gonna help us do
everything so we are very lucky novices
I'm gonna take you guys to our local
spot Micah Libyans it's gonna have all
your fabric and ocean wonders we're
gonna just kind of play at that place
has buttons zippers and trim and
everything you can kind of creatively
imagine it very much feels like Joanne's
on crack yeah super stereo Joanne yeah
where do we begin what I'll do we're
gonna start with your fabric choices
okay pick a few options and then we're
gonna go get patterns on top of all of
the fabric sections you'll see what it
is
so like eco-friendly the knits the
woolen and then on the other side
there's denims knits swimwear Xuan lace
when you said eco-friendly my interest
piqued I do think about how I would want
certain garments to fit differently so I
do have a bigger chestal area I would
like for garments to be kind of you know
smaller in the torso but just to have
more room for the marshes especially for
using a knit we're gonna be able to have
a lot more freedom as far as fit goes
because it doesn't have to be as precise
I have a very particular style of dress
that I really enjoy
that is actually pretty hard to find I
really like mod style dresses that are
just straight down and short so I
definitely want a pattern clearly yes if
I had to describe the type of dress that
I want to make in three words it would
probably be 60s mod style I like this
one hey that's good you like this I like
this okay
this is really pretty though and I think
that it's gonna translate to the era
that you want but also it's gonna be
really comfortable I always think about
how I want things that I get from the
store to be slightly different I often
tell my boyfriend I'm like if only this
had a hood and he'd be like why would
you want that I'd be like I do I just
want like a Jedi hood at all times you
know is there one of these that is kind
of opaque because like I like this
feeling of it yeah but I would
definitely be like what what's this like
a Heather Jersey yeah really pretty
though it's still sort of sheer it is
not a shear but it's nice yeah also
let's really give you your vibe right
now and my sunglasses are working I
think if I had to describe the thing
that I want to make this week in three
words it would be hooded swirly cape so
on the move excuse me as I sweep about
how many is a dress that fits four words
that's what I want a dress that fit kind
of Spica an idea that you like
preferably one that has like the least
amount of like additional design lines
and seams and whatnot this week we are
going to be sewing mostly on our own
which will be an interesting situation I
think we're gonna do this one plus the
Jedi hood - the lace oh that's good
just go full Jedi with the row but
everything full commitment let's do it
I'm excited because I really do plan on
wearing his dress grocery store work
home the cat goes here so I'm doing
pattern be pretty simple mod cut mid
thigh long sleeves pockets it's all
girly so iam landed on this pattern and
then Ashton said that he's going to help
me do cold shoulder cutouts and then
adjusting the collar so that it's to my
liking
I don't want Ashton to be disappointed
in me we set up sewing stations around
the office mostly in meeting rooms I
think we should start with a sewing
tutorial first truthfully and oh my god
it's so tiny
it's also important that you lick the
thread if the thread will stop breaking
will be in such better shape so just
start already do I have to do this
you're gonna start and simultaneously
you're gonna go for a little bit and
push that and it's gonna do a little
back for you there you go there you go
like a pro do it
sounds like a coffee machine get into
the end okay
I found them truly learning something
new I felt that way actually in a little
bit in a little while okay
is that we only have one pattern out so
far I was also like petrified at this
tissue paper it's like oh my god
and we're gonna start by cutting out
along that indication line I have a
problem I didn't do what I'm realizing
it was cutting on the wrong line I think
the hard part is for me is just gonna
have patience I'm almost done cutting
out the single piece the single piece of
the wrong side and then in a week's time
Ashton will reunite with us and we'll
see our hopefully finished garments
hopefully Freddie harder group on the
table me on the table my cutting is
getting worse and worse as I'm going
usually things get better but I think
I'm just getting really nervous about
the sewing portion the pattern cutting
has been okay the fabric cutting has
been okay but I have no clue what these
are no idea no idea it's off said
something about maybe the collar area
it was my best guess Freddie's almost
done cutting her pieces out this is
three of ten for me so I think this is
kind of like the turtleneck part I was
going to adjust the pattern because
right now the dress is like folded over
nettle
oh so I'm wondering if I should just do
like half of it if the fashion gods are
pulling you that that direction then you
should just do it I'm watching youtube
videos right now to figure out how to
thread the machine by myself
I'm making some progress I'm trying to
figure out how to wind the bobbin
bobbins are a thing apparently oh that
was too fast things are happening but
they're happening very slow okay
Chantelle you got to make a cut at some
point and a pin okay okay I'm super
frustrated I just spent the last hour
and a half trying to thread the stupid
sewing machine and then as soon as I
started trying to do stay stitching and
it just like sucked my fabric down and
it was just like it's a frustrating
night but hopefully we'll be able to get
this done in time
you guys it's pretty early in the
morning and I came in early to try and
sew and I messed my fabric up so badly
last night and it's because I forgot to
put the foot down before I started
sewing I feel like such an idiot see
this anticipated scrap fabric and I
finally figured out how to sew a stay
stitch and this is my first step in my
pattern this is June she's our friend
she's going to help us because we need
Howey angel to
was going to be alright not knowing that
well June did say though that after all
of the YouTube that I watched I did
mostly thread this machine correctly so
I've learned something I was fumbling
trying to get the bobbin into his little
silver holder and my hands got to shake
it and then it fell the actual bobbin
fell on the ground and unraveled nothing
sadder than dropping a tray full of
bobbins on the ground this is the back
of my dress and then here is my first
seem empty cheese so the front starts
Freddie's needle has broken and we're
trying to get it out with pliers that's
how it's supposed to work yeah yep
that's it important thing happened it's
not going these pieces were supposed to
be together
not supposed to cut them all the fold so
gotta be cut June's heading out it's 7
p.m.
timmy Gracie sweetens dress nerdy so
beautiful what time is it goes 755 and
what are you doing we're so in a way how
long you been sewing and it's like 4:30
yeah since like 4:30 so you guys have
like a whole dress done I was sewing
from 8 a.m. to 11 and I want to get back
so bad I just want to finish this thing
I'm actually kind of close to finishing
the top part I'll be kind of like the
bottom was wonder this is our mannequin
Sasha she's wearing the pieces of my
dress that I need to sew together
Sasha's my new friend
oops we're very friendly very close keep
your eleven that I've had some pieces
wrong luckily this was a small piece
that I can correct but I need a
professional at all times
we're good to see action today thank God
okay I just finished recutting out the
sleeve doing okay
spirits are higher than they were last
time that's
you've returned me to Aston's we are
back you actually are way more far along
than I anticipated truthfully even
though the shows tomorrow you thought
we'd be worse off I kind of did show
only because the Battle of this is kind
of dissecting a whole new like craft so
we're gonna go with 22 inches is your
hood these pockets and then voila
they're gonna flip it inside out all
right you want to get positioned it nice
and square with the machine and as soon
as you go it's gonna pull that fabric
through so you don't want to like fight
it there you go oh well just upgraded
you to the big leagues
I accidentally sold a friend back of my
dress together oh my god plain clothes
get so far
okay Ashton's going to be here in like
ten minutes and we're just putting like
the final finishing touches on
everything so we really got to make this
work
I mean I've kind of just accepted the
fact that a lot of my visible scenes
look like the Rocky Mountains that's
great I think it's gonna go amazing I
have no doubt that these girls could
deliver they're all educated smart and
passionate and they all wanted to learn
so ultimately I think this is gonna be a
great job yes I think the show's gonna
be great you know working up to the last
minute but the girls did such an awesome
job I'm really proud of them I'm most
excited for them truthfully I think this
is such a wonderful moment of a new
craft and a new task for them to conquer
so I'm excited to support them but
ultimately to see the expression on
their face once they finish everything
I'm in your makeup smells good it does
yeah this week I learned how not to be
afraid of sewing machines
I also learned to pay really close
attention to pattern directions and if
not use Google attitude
come on pockets I would do this again I
really like a long skirt so I would
probably stick to the skirts arena there
no sleeves no collars it's kind of just
you know flow and go okay yeah yes I
learned everything
bodycon on I I had no idea how to do
anything it's so cute
and I now know how to sew I now know how
to choose fabrics a little bit better
like I think I could sew in create a
simple dress by myself which is crazy to
sakes I never thought that I would be
able to claim that we made something
which i think is really cool and I think
we don't do enough of it I don't think
we do enough of like making things with
our own hands I'm in love with my hood I
am glad that this week is over just
because the time frame was pretty
stressful but I'm also thankful or that
feeling of learning something new
lady tested lady would try again but
might not for a while Oh dad yes most
rewarding part was just to see Ashton's
face just seeing the shock and smile on
his face you know and that he was proud
I was like oh my god yeah I did this and
chicken stuff get it I will say I'm glad
it's over but I could see myself making
a skirt or two in the future well how do
we do fashion dad I'm gonna say amazing
but I'm gonna say how do you think you
did I'm gonna flip this on you it's a
little bit tighter than I originally
planned on but we're going with it I
thought that I was being cute in the
beginning when I was like oh I'll just
double layer the front and the skirt and
then put a cheer in the back and then
it'll be like a bodice and then we'll
add a hood but I did all the things I
said I was gonna do it didn't come out
exactly like I thought in my head but I
still liked it I love the hood the hood
is by far I just feel like you were
really trying to come from my look today
okay so Ashton was helping me cut the
length of my dress last night and he had
it like longer maybe here and I was like
let's make it a little shorter because
I'm trying to be out here in these
streets and then now I'm a little too
out here artistic expression just own
your mistakes and then sell it to
everybody they won't even know it's
beautiful and you should be happy you
can actually wear this this is what's
great is that you guys all have items
that you can wear it scuse me for one
second
these are for you fashion down you are
so busy you have really long days and
you took a lot of time out to how long
so each day when you let us use all of
your things

wonderful I loved the entire experience

people and as associates and just kind
of having fun with it
