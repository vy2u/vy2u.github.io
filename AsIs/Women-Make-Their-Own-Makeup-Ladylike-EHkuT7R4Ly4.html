lighter
we are finally doing DIY makeup today we
are applying our efforts to actually
making the makeup that we love so much
top and I found two recipes for a DOI
eyeliner and a DIY lipstick and we found
two different recipes for dontel and
Devyn we're each going to make a
lipstick and an eyeliner and then we're
gonna see how it turns out shall we
begin
so we need 1/2 teaspoon of this and this
one teaspoon of beeswax alright so this
is 1/2 a teaspoon I'll put two of these
bad boys
right now what I'm doing is I am just
cutting these little baby crayons - baby
pieces we're not gonna be eating this
but in anything involving like pans and
pots I do now I'm putting my mix of aloe
vera gel and coconut oil into the jar
and then we will double boil the jar
alright we're gonna pop this bad boy
gently into our water so there's many
things that we do that we have no idea
what we're doing until we're on camera
oh oh boy this is one of those things oh
ok so it is kind of melty our next step
is adding some beetroot powder we have
two beautiful shades of purple and rad
and we're just gonna put these bad boys
in there
once we've fully melted everything we
can like pour it into these things and
those would be little molds and then
we're gonna pop them in the fridge so
that they cool off and then we can apply
them to our lip
Oh
our lipstick is cooling so now we're
going to make our eyeliner when I cook I
don't follow recipes because I don't
like being told what to do normally what
happens when I cook someone else does it
and then I just kind of March around
what you do is you put an almond inside
of these tweezers you set that be on
fire and then with the char - of the
almond left behind you smash it up put
some coconut oil in there and then you
got yourself some eyeliner so this is
two teaspoons of coconut oil aloe vera
gel well then we have the charcoal I
guess we just let it burn whoa
this looks so cool that is black so we
have the burnt almond this is a really
good color black it is sexy some sultry
this is the charred remains of one
almond but luckily for us Jen had some
pre charred almonds
geremy arista show it off show it off
our next step is adding coconut oil just
let me know when I should stop giving a
hand job to this giant rolling pin
you're probably good eyeliner is just
about done so I guess we'll try it out
and see how it works
we are going to try our eyeliner in our
lipstick and we're gonna give you our
honest thoughts we have our funky
eyeliner it looks like this kind of
looks like a dirty water this is a
little rough a little watery it's taking
longer than normal eyeliner to get a
thicker and darker line it's confusing
because it does dry clear so when I go
in to be like oh I'm done I'm like wait
but this part that I just did has
disappeared I will say it's easy to wipe
off which also makes it very hard to put
on yeah this is as good as it's gonna
get I'm just gonna wipe off my eyeliner
brush and use it as a lip brush nothing
we might have put too many crap I'm
gonna try to break it up with this I'm
gonna be honest this is way more like a
lip scrub I would say this is almost
even acting a bit as a lip gloss if you
rub it really hard into your lips your
lips will get red color is coming off I
think you know hindsight we won't use as
much wax and then we'll actually be able
to apply it what happened is that we got
some pigment and then we got some oils
and we just kind of stuck them together
in hopes that they would fuse and I
think they didn't fuse I think you could
maybe attribute the ineffectiveness of
both of these products as user error
we don't look bad yeah I think we look
actually quite moisturized having this
be like the first time we've ever made
it and for it to turn out like this is
pretty cool because you know if we tried
it again we could probably just keep
getting like better and better honestly
given our skillsets I would've been more
surprised if we had come out with an
excellent product
I'm proud for what we did or didn't do
or Lia party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
