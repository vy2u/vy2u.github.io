modeling without makeup
I used makeup as a tool to hide part of
me I wore makeup every day to cover what
I felt like was the flaw makeup is
important to me because I was bullied
really really bad I was made fun of for
all of the freckles I have so I tried to
cover them up you can't ride the
sandpaper them off in sixth grade I
didn't want people to see me as natural
as I was with my spots I started wearing
makeup at age 12 as soon as I got to
middle school that is when people
started to let me know girl you are
different you look different imma treat
you different and you kind of leave I
have a port wine stain birthmark and it
covers half of my face head ear neck and
it's basically like a malformation of
the capillaries in the skin and I just
wanted to be normal and people thought I
was really scary
growing up I was so confused because I
was just covered and all these brown
little dots and I just wanted that
beautiful clear perfect skin that you
see everywhere I just tried to be
somebody that I thought everyone
wouldn't make fun of because it hurts so
bad I would love to see you know more
people like me with birthmarks on
magazine covers now I get to bear
everything that I'm self-conscious about
I think it'll be really liberating that
a Lego queen is not playing with y'all
she came this late so this is going away
I'm like breaking out so bad I am girl
you want me to take my eyeshadow off to
acne blemishes it's all part of like
being human we all deal with it and yet
it's like we don't want anybody to know
it took me three hours to do my makeup
you sure we can't leave the eyebrows
just the eyebrow
it's like I'm making it rain makeup
wipes feel naked and exposed okay taking
it off
all right y'all I'm ready for my
close-up
after looking at the photographs I
didn't know that I could be a superhero
I think I felt like a supermodel and it
felt good to see myself professionally
the photos are not really great I never
in a million years thought that I would
be doing a photo shoot like this I feel
very empowered and strong especially for
my five-year-old self seeing them in
these photos and how they kind of added
to me and they really pops against my
skin and brightened my eyes up it was
really cool to see the freckles so
taking this shoot today without any
makeup and filling almost completely
naked it was kind of liberating and even
when you've come to a point of like
acceptance and embracing you for who you
are there's still an experience and
challenge that can make you stronger
that can make you more comfortable and
we all come here with something it
doesn't matter what it is we have to
choose to be beautiful we have to choose
to fill that beauty we have to make a
choice to just say I accept me and if
you don't that's your problem but I'm
not going to not love me because you
have a problem with it if I was on the
cover of a magazine it will say that oh
I go clean shows everyone how to kiss
her ego different is the new normal I am
fun
I'm confident I think I might be pretty
and I've never let myself say that
before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
