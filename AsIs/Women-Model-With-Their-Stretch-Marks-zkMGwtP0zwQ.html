not gonna lie I feel like kind of
uncomfortable I guess I have no choice
but to go out there and see how these
pictures turn out I do have stretch
marks and I don't think it's a bad thing
I think stretch marks are completely
normal the majority of people have them
can't remember the first time I noticed
them probably in like high school mom
herself would constantly talk about her
stretch marks on her stomach she would
talk about how she wanted to please
remove them or whatever because the
media had put it into her head that they
were just not how your stomach should
look there's definitely a stigma about
stretch marks not being pretty like even
in magazines people full of shop their
stretch marks out which i think is kind
of unhealthy in like high school having
to change in the locker rooms I would
hear you know girls just kind of snicker
say you know like what are those marks
oh why does she have those and because
it's vilified in the media you just look
at it as something that's damaged and
it's not perfect anymore definitely hope
that this makes me a little more proud
of my own skin time to show these tiger
stripes to the world I get that to put
this on now changing getting ready to do
this photo shoot we're gonna do this
topless so we can show you these
beautiful ones my stretch marks are
stretchy
I guess this will be fun if you look at
it it's like really really high up I
don't know there's a lot of skin showing
a lot I feel really uncomfortable I
don't want to take this sweatshirt off
my waist so be taking my picture now
topless which is a little nerve-wracking
which will be different from the other
girls cuz I think I'm the only one who
won't be wearing anything if more people
start showing off their stretch marks
their flaws then it's something society
can normalize
I hope to gain more self-confidence at
the end of this I hope I look at that
picture and I think wow you actually
look fine I'm definitely excited to be
doing this photo shoot to hopefully help
girls that were in my position to show
them that you know they have nothing to
be ashamed of because I never actually
showed off my stretch marks wrapped up
the photo shoot it was a lot more
exposed than I thought it was very
interesting to step that far outside of
my comfort zone and I am very happy that
I did I'm excited to see the pictures
hopefully I'll learn to appreciate them
a little bit more I was kind of
uncomfortable during the photo shoot
because the focus is kind of on the
stretch marks that I have so I was like
well this is even more embarrassing I
don't usually wear stuff like that and
most of my stretch marks don't show and
now it's all gonna show during the photo
shoot I did feel a little awkward while
being topless around people that I
didn't know but then it felt pretty
comfortable oh dang you should have more
photos like this in like actual media in
magazines and articles wow that is
really that came out really nice
it definitely is a very no moving photo
a little emotional huh oh wow this is
actually kind of cool to see we're all
perfectly flawed there's really nothing
wrong with this and we shouldn't be so
critical of ourselves because like those
things kind of make us who we are as
cliche as that sounds the top part of
the photo this super model asked super
photoshoot and the bottom half is like
I'm a real person just go out there and
embrace yourself because like it's hard
it is but everyone else have the exact
same underlying problems I've never
really been deflected as like like the
standard beauty or anything like that
um so to see this photo it's it makes me
feel pretty badass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
