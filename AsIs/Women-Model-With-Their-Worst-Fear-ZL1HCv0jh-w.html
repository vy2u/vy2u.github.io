telling you right now I can't do this
I'm not kidding I can't do this take a
big breath today we're posing with our
fears I'm afraid of spiders I am I'm
deathly afraid of birds
I hate cockroaches who doesn't
I'm very very very afraid of
snakes they have too many legs they have
too many eyes some of them are free
feathers are gross when they're wet well
they're like hopping around
they have like long-ass antennas they
are like always in trash snakes they're
just one big muscle and I have it in my
head that it'll eat my face I don't like
how they can kill you and fly away and
they'll never get caught okay how did
they survive billions of years against
like dinosaurs every other thing
died yet cockroaches are still
here for some reason I'm walking down
the street and there's a pigeon I will
cross the street to avoid it me and my
family went on this huge hike a few
years ago and I heard there was a snake
from someone else and I made us turn
around and go home
cockroaches are the reason I left New
York City not to be dramatic but they
are one time I was carrying my laundry
down the street outside and a
flying cockroach flew by Linden on my
shoulder and I was like this is
it I'm out I'm done I don't they fly
this is up I guess that maybe
being so up close and personal with one
would maybe help me understand what
they're like I'm just hoping to be alive
by the end of today I hear you can die
affrights
the only thing that's getting me through
this day is that I'm going to have a
fierce ass photo and I'm gonna make sure
of it
my name is Isis King I'm best known for
being a two-time contestant on America's
Next Top Model and also most recently
for being one of the cast mates on the
oxygen show cause drive today I'm going
to mentor some nervous young ladies into
conferring their fares in front of the
camera hi guys are you all excited about
your photo shoot today no I never
thought that I would be able to be a
real model being someone who's
transgender so that in itself going on
set and everyone knowing and you still
having to do twice as good as everyone
else is something to get over in itself
this is your chance to really like own
it most people don't have the chance to
face their fears in a photo shoot you're
gonna have this image forever and it's
gonna be amazing because once you
conquer it you can conquer anything I'm
really excited that Isis is here because
I have like no modeling ability
whatsoever and we like not look dead
inside well Tyra always say smize so I
kind of took that with me it's just
bringing all the fierceness to your eyes
it's kind of like if you have a little
bit of tape pulling eyes back and you
just kind of squint into it I look crazy
no I look like I'm twitching
no but Isis has first-hand experience on
how to be put in these different
modeling challenges I'm hoping she can
like lead me through some like
meditation or something that I can just
cancel out everything around me I just
want to let you guys know that you're
here you all look fierce gonna rock it
out just breathe
you know just breathe and go there and
enjoy it because after you conquer this
you conquer your fear so what will be
holding you back looking like don't want
to do this let's do this I'm so excited
I can't wait jumping up and down good do
it go go
I'm Macy I'm a staff photographer at
BuzzFeed and today I'm shooting people
posing with their fears I'm also scared
of snakes and bugs
we'll see what happens here my overall
vision and the editorial with more color
so I think Vanity Fair but with
something off hi my name is Steve Marin
and I am from saving wildlife
international we're a non-profit
wildlife conservation organization based
in Southern California and we take in
displaced wild exotic animals and use
them in educational programs I think
when dealing with wild animal it's good
to have a healthy respect for the
animals I also think within our society
animals have been vilified we have an
African pied crow which is much like the
crows you would be familiar with around
North America in many parts of the world
but this guy has a beautiful white
breast a lot of misconceptions about
crows and people use them in a lot of
horror movies and they're they're kind
of seen as scary animals but they're
actually super super smart super social
and really really cool birds so um
Sheridan's about to go I can say for
maybe all of us that like the fears here
I think we got our makeup done and get
these cute outfits on but we really
 underestimated how actually
scary this is I mean the minute Sheridan
sat down in the chair she immediately
just started crying if she didn't see
the bird yet she knew it
just let me get it off her leading up to
it I was like I can do this and then
kind of as we got closer and closer uh
that's kind of half a nervous breakdown
started oh my gosh so cute
so we all have something you're
something is just bird walks out but I
don't like about birds is if you do any
like crazy movements or like freak out
and like flap the sound of like bird's
wings flapping haunt my nightmares you
not to touch him as I realized this was
actually going to happen a bird was
going to be touching me I kind of lost
my to have Atisha just know that
that he has the bird on a leash so
shouldn't fly towards you and honestly
he seems like he's in his own little
world eventually we got to a point where
the bird could be on the table because I
realized there was just no way I could
touch it I'm once he's up there he's
gonna that's like a nice high place for
him birds like to be up high that they
feel safe he's he was wanted state air
he's gonna want to come to me my heart
was still pounding even though I was
like a few feet away from it that's how
scared I was
fine three there you go yes
I am happy that I at least tried to get
out of my comfort zone and even though I
didn't get to be to the point where I
was holding the bird I don't know maybe
it's baby steps at the end the pictures
came out great and I think that it was
definitely a good step in the right
direction another animal from Madagascar
we have dew morels boa constrictors
which is I think one of the most
beautiful boa constrictors in the world
two snake that comes from a place that's
in a lot of trouble right now the forest
in Madagascar being cut down at a pretty
alarming rate and it's one of the
reasons we really think it's important
that people get to know these animals
and appreciate them because once they're
gone they're gonna be gone forever
my game plan is to honestly just look
fierce and not cry look fierce and not
cry I walked out to the setup and we
took some test shots and I was feeling
really good I didn't think I was gonna
cry and then he got the snake out and
like I lost it that was just too
close for comfort way too close
for comfort when most people are afraid
of snakes it's estimated that probably
less than two people a year die
worldwide from constrictors also freaked
out why because they look different
super super misunderstood have you ever
been misunderstood yeah there you go so
you guys have something in common right
there so then it took me like about 30
minutes to touch it oh my god did it
huge right there he wrapped one part of
the snake around my neck oh Jesus oh my
god
get it off me all right okay bring it
back I'm good
took opposing with a snake wasn't
terrible it's just moving
it's just moving I just literally was
sitting there and I was trying to like
stare straight at the camera and not
notice that there was a snake moving on
me if I had to pose with any snakes I'm
glad it was the one that I posed with
just because like I don't know it seems
nice afterwards for a minute we have
some wide horn Madagascar hissing
cockroaches they're one of the largest
species of cockroach in the world these
ones are commonly known because they
make a hissing sound I found out my
cockroaches yes I can never added
horrible thing to this situation my game
plan is to I don't know I really don't
know I'm I'm like nervous that
I'm gonna be on the shoot and like being
all fashioning and then like wanting to
puke because there's a cockroach on me
just thinking about it is freaking me
out and then he came out with the
cockroaches on okay look
oh my god
no I freaked out I started crying and
panicking and then I found out that that
was actually the smallest cockroach of
the three is that a small one home my
worst fear was that they would like
scurry
are you in so well right there and this
one like didn't scurry it kind of like
chilled in one spot which is who the
best that could have happened he's not
either doing yeah
so the posing was uh impossible I didn't
I didn't do it you're like trying to be
like oh I'm calm and cool but then
you're like trying to look down at it's
like check in on it yes even though it's
a bug and it's a cockroach they're
actually really beautiful once you get
to look at him it's really a matter of
perception meteorologists
animals you know like we're the ones
that are scared of that we're not doing
anything to us so I think it was cool to
come to terms with that and be like it's
just trying to chill chill cockroach I
don't know next animal is the Chilean
Rose hair tarantula you don't have a
whole lot of venom although all spiders
have been in this animal has less then
I'm gonna honey she'll just kind of
stick on wherever we put her and there's
a lot of fun so everybody else is gone
I'm about to go but I get freaked out I
just internalize stuff so I'll probably
just sit very still and just wait for it
to be over I should have said that I was
afraid of like kittens and they like
hosed me and that's where you learned
that they were gonna put it on my
shoulder it has free will to just like
run around all over me or she is okay
she chill pretty chill it's definitely
gonna be hard to look photogenic and
beautiful and model like especially with
a spider on top of me
like him you warned me beforehand he was
like oh it's she's gonna like a dig her
little feet in it has little tiny hooks
on its feet but that it tickles that's
all of it ah you ready I want to be able
to turn my comfort and my fear into
something beautiful and striking yes I
like you got it yeah you're gonna love
this photo night that's my fool for the
most part then they were like let's put
it on your head I mean our GU be
comfortable with it on your head I will
allow it to be on my head if it doesn't
touch my forehead skin it doesn't feel
nice there you go oh god it's oh girl
Nina
yu-er and I I survived everyone said my
photos are good but I think I can
definitely see like the fear and like a
tension in my face I definitely feel
proud of myself for like being brave I
allowed it to happen and I survived and
I didn't freak out so much perfect
I honestly think everyone did really
well I think we're being a little hard
on ourselves bare-bones modeling really
hard Molly with your phobia nearly
impossible but yet like I got one pick I
am excited to see my photos I hope that
they look cool and fierce or now I'm
just like so happy it's over I think
when we come back and look at these
pictures will be like oh that's why we
did this all in all they all did an
amazing job I can't wait to see which
shot is chosen for each one of the girls
then present it back to them hi guys hey
welcome back
how's everybody feeling never wrong
overall I think you ladies conquer what
you came here to conquer and I think
that you ladies when you see it you who
does only surprised that you did it stir
it and you shot with the crow how do you
think your picture came out I don't know
I'm just hoping that there are no tears
in it well Sheridan it's time to see
your best shot
weasel is fob touching it you look like
you own the bird I thought the picture
turned out pretty okay like I was in
control of the situation when that bird
was the one that was in control
and it could smell my fear you should be
proud of yourself because this is a work
of art yay jazz we shot with that
beautiful Nate how was it for you I was
terrified but I will say afterwards I
went into the restroom and there was a
cricket jumping around and I was not
afraid of that cricket since I just was
afraid of that snake I think conquering
fears left and right my first thoughts
when I saw my photo was like holy
like I couldn't believe that snake is
literally on me the hair the jacket
everything just really comes together
amazingly it was literally just like a
fear that I've had for forever and I
know that I can overcome that and with
the help of everybody around me I did it
was that thank you
so next Chrissy shot with a Madagascar
hissing cockroach I think you did a
great job when you breathe thin and and
gay face so look at your best shot you
look so cute it's crazy to think that I
had a second hissing cockroach on me and
I was like laughing about it like
hahahaha the folk might have been a
model it's been an actress and a big
part of being an actress is forgetting
everything that's going on around you
and given that emotion that you want to
be shown you are a great model because
of that going forward I should be more
mindful about animals that people kind
of villainize in the media and people
kind of villainize as just animals that
exists I feel better about it now that
I've I've stepped away from it and
looked back on it to be like wow this is
super cool that I overcame that fear so
Nina you also had the one that was
actually on your skin like it was on
your head it touched me it was on you
you handle it like a champ I'm a bit
nervous to see what it actually turned
out like cuz I think I just blacked out
for the whole thing look how beautiful
you are in this TV shot that is gorgeous
see I think that it turned out really
well like we were a good team I think me
and the tarantulas feel like you're
waiting for your husband to come home so
you can kill seeing that up close and
personal and realizing that I guess like
not that bad
made me feel like I can conquer anything
now these ladies can go back and look at
the shot and remember that they can
conquer any fear they have in life and
look fierce why they're doing it
unfortunately this is an elimination one
of you all are not in the running to be
America's Next Top BuzzFeed model is it
the cockroach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
