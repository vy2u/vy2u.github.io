arthur kid like these these people were
beautiful and they were beautiful black
women who were like Making Strides and
they're not really talked about it's
kind of like you know Marilyn Monroe is
the epitome of beauty and they're like
there are so many other women not even
just black who were beautiful and making
moves and doing great things during that
time and I kind of wish that they were
put at the forefront
we're at pinup-girl boutique today
located in beautiful Burbank California
so there's kind of this really unfair
almost whitewashed when it comes to
pinup where people really feel excluded
and that it's only specifically you know
very white Americana and that's what is
been the reality of it it was a
generation it was a time and that
includes the whole world so there's no
reason that women of color or as any
ethnicity anything at all that they
can't feel and look beautiful just like
a pin-up girl I haven't really seen a
lot of iconic photos of black pin-up
girls like you see a couple it's just so
cool to see that part of history I don't
think that I look like classic beauty
icons in general but I think I may look
a little bit more like the alternative
Beauty like Frida Kahlo she's really
beautiful for me but when I think of
pinup I don't really see myself growing
up without seeing myself or people who
look like me in the media was definitely
difficult there were times when I felt
ashamed of the color of my skin but now
I feel really thankful to be different I
think it'll be really cool to be able to
see myself as a pin-up girl honestly I
didn't really feel beautiful until
college growing up as a little black
girl was not easy you know it wasn't
only racial differences or cultural
differences it was also class
differences so I felt inadequate on many
different levels also just being brown
skinned our chocolate was different for
me it was hard feeling comfortable in my
skin and not only just being black but
also being the complexion that I was I
remember one of the things that I told
my mom I was in fifth grade and I asked
mother why I didn't have blonde hair and
why I wasn't pretty
my mom told me that I had brown hair and
that's really pretty but it was weird
thing because I remember asking my
mother that and it pisses me off now so
like that means that you were being
influenced at a super young age one of
my hosts for this transformation is to
like sort of maybe dive into that like
sexy side I guess like but modest but
like not modest like I don't know I I
dabble in between both worlds of like
cute like attempting sexy but like not
fully getting there
I like glamour for sexy I try to find it
in the dark
oh my god
Wow gee Wow oh my god I don't even oh
God whoa I don't look like myself whoa
beauty with the bootie hey just growing
up the 50s and 60s they portray in the
media is always girls who look one way
and to like see myself fit into that era
like just makes me feel like connected
to it in a way I've never felt before I
can't get over my butt right now
look how great it looks I want to like
clean like they do in the movies like oh
sorry
ideal beauty has gone through so many
phases throughout time and I think had I
seen you know more just like women like
this in history books or even just
pictures of women who look like this
outside of my grandmother would have
felt beautiful earlier than 18 years old
to put your body in a different decade
with different style I think can make
you one to appreciate it in a different
way you see that there is something that
you're into and you think that like no
one had a black woman can't do this or
something like that then you'd be the
first thing you try it out and you do it
you do it well very classy that's like I
should like go sing on top of a piano at
a bar talking sugar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
