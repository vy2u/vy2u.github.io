this I changed my hair literally maybe
every other week I think I'm a very
energetic person this hair definitely
has a life of its own
I love that I am enough and my hair is
made me believe that when I'm walking
down the street it just commands like
stairs and a present folks will be like
hey Queen hey says and I'm like I've
always been a queen what do you mean as
a woman that's blue easy and German an
Indian the cultural pressures that I've
received is to not wear my hair curly
because in my culture on curly hair has
not seemed as good hair as a dominican
woman I have definitely experienced many
pressures regarding my hair mostly to
relax it I remember growing up and you
would always hear like good hair bad
hair and there were these labels when I
was younger I would always get women
that would say like wait till you're 30
girl you'll get it when you're 30 in and
you'll understand yourself and love and
embrace yourself and I thought to myself
like why am I waiting 230 like why are
we waiting till this determined age to
feel amazing beautiful confident one
thing I wish that I would have known
when I was 15 is that hair grows back at
15 I wish I would have just known to own
it I would tell my 15 year old self to
understand that your hair
fragile I think it's very important for
my 15 year old self on any
fifteen-year-old girls out there to
understand that their hair is simply an
extension of themselves not who they are
completely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
