don't know what this app thinks it can
do so it's gonna be like skinny arm the
app it's funny because we all take
pictures to look in our best light but
the idea that then you could use an app
and completely change yourself is like
very scary let's use reshape and make me
skinnier it's funny how the reshape tool
the icon for it automatically goes like
this we can try to do the hourglass
shape more oh my god
oh but see this would be a celebrity
giveaway because you can already see
that the mirror is funky I don't think
it looks that different to be honest oh
that's not true look for Allison this is
trippy I'm gonna make me skinny look and
then we just push my boobs up a little
bit perfect do myself
a real big thigh gap let's get a Disney
Princess waistline horrified that looks
ridiculous those are not childbearing
hips now my heads she's way too big for
my body I don't think I've ever seen my
size that skinny oh this is giving me
self-esteem issues right now I feel like
really gross hitting this checkmark cuz
it's like I'm validating everything I've
just done like yep better this way I'm
gonna give myself some honkers busty
Alison is how to play it makes my chin
go away hey gotta make them even oh man
I have all these wrinkles in my forehead
because I'm scrunching my head so I'm
gonna smooth those away I'm gonna try
like it automatically just gets rid of
all these freckles like it's something
that like is a bad thing
whoa I might have just erased most of my
face there goes most of my nose cover-up
in last lines something has been
laughing too much as the daughter of a
dentist this is shocking how quickly you
can whiten your teeth ah
I was more affected by it than I thought
it would be I like the result I don't
like that I like the results this is not
a real person this is an alien we know
at least that magazines get Photoshop
but if you start seeing your friends do
something like this and you don't know
that they're doing it then you start to
think that real people look like this
and then all these girls are like what
do I have to do to look like that and
you're just like woo you have to buy a
five-dollar app when you look at the
things that are unsightly about yourself
they're things that everyone has if you
have blemishes if you have a waist
that's fine you're a person everybody
has them it's gratifying to see it in
the photo but then you look at yourself
in your real body and you would be
disappointed that you're not a Photoshop
the best thing about this entire app
though is the idea that Kim Kardashian
is like sitting around using this app in
the same way that I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
