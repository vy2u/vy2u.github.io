meeting right after my workout today
today we're recreating iconic fitness
magazine covers I'm recreating Shakira
from self magazine I play wheelchair
basketball I've been playing for 10
years participating in something like
being on a magazine cover is a good way
to show that a woman with a disability
can be a sexual person I'm recreating
Khloe Kardashian's health magazine cover
beauty comes in different forms and
sizes I love hiking I really haven't
seen a trans individual as a model for
the cover of any fitness magazine yet
I'm recreating Claressa Shields cover
from the ESPN Body Issue
I'm nowhere near this girl's level just
so strong so awesome but she's at the
top of her sport I'm recreating Karlie
Kloss from women's health I just
recently started my own fitness journey
I feel like I'm just now starting to
like my body I am feeling incredibly
anxious about comparing myself to Karlie
Kloss I'm worried that I'm gonna see it
and feel like I fell short I'm going to
be recreating Britney Spears shape
magazine cover and Britney Spears cover
she's wearing this really cool beautiful
white swimsuit and this was the best one
we could find I don't have Brittany sigh
gap I don't have Britney's boobs but
it'll be interesting to see someone like
me on a magazine cover so the picture
I'm recreating is Simone biles cover on
Teen Vogue I do get a lot of comments
about how my muscles are too big
it's very unfair of me to have the body
that I do I've never seen a woman
appreciated on a magazine cover for
strength and muscles the way Simone is
okay let's go get photographed basically
naked for contouring my outs right now
and I've never had makeup on any other
part of my body but my face is weird
before I talked a lot of talk but now I
got a walk walk I'm really nervous I
should have gotten a bikini wax for this
so I have a little loincloth until it's
go time this is ridiculous I took up
boxing a year ago and so now I boxed two
to three times a week it's such a
wonderful strong sport and I love to be
able to show that plus-sized women do
workout I had a hard time with my face
I'm generally not a very expressive
person I think my eyebrows are just like
constantly pants but then I think I just
kind of like loosened up a little bit I
tried to look less like I'm posing for a
cover and just was like be a nice person
Jordan and have a good time I've seen
amputees on fitness covers before but
they're really hot they don't have
amputations as high as mine they don't
have scars all over I'm also excited to
show a part of my body that I don't show
to anyone except for my wife and myself
once the fan hits me I feel just like
Shakira I feel stupid it was a lot of
fun but I felt really stiff so
what's a direct effect like how do you
think like I'm gonna just stick my
finger in my mouth but I think it's
gonna look good nothing was natural
about it
I love recreating Khloe Kardashian it's
quite flattering she's such an iconic
pop culture persona I feel great right
now oh I think I was a little bit more
nervous than I thought I would be I'm
doing it for Britney I have a lot more
respect for models who just take their
clothes off all the time and do this I
think it takes a lot of bravery no
matter what your body type is
I am nervous I'm excited I hope I just
like don't have fear in my eyes oh my
god that looks awesome
I'm totally not Shakira but I'm on the
cover of the magazine and my scars are
all out there and it's pretty cool it's
a venue to inspired people to empower
people like myself I'm very happy about
that
oh wow the first thing I noticed of
course was how shocking it is to see
myself on a cover but even more so the
text that goes around it Michelle at her
best 24 firm and fabulous makes me think
maybe I am okay
at my best oh wow what seeing my own
body on a magazine is really cool it's
really cool to be proud and think of
myself as glamorous and worthy of
highlighting oh my god I'm like shocked
oh my god
I am really Wow that is that is my butt
right there okay I never see bodies that
look like mine naked it's so different
for me oh shoot this is so good I really
like that you can see the development in
my shoulders and that my arms look
strong this whole experience has just
taught me to be more proud of my body
than I all
yeah magazine covers are something that
I always compared myself to when I was
young filled me with like a sense of
dread that I didn't look like the women
there's something really empowering
about just owning who you are and liking
it when I get comments or people telling
me things like oh but you'd be so pretty
it weren't for the muscles to kind of
take a step back and celebrate being
strong helps remind me that it doesn't
really matter what other people think
people are very critical with how we
look
it starts with accepting and loving
yourself I want to see more diverse
bodies on the covers of fitness
magazines I want to see women whose
thighs touch everyone looks step for it
that's what's cool I'm not hiding behind
anything it's kind of insane this is
really cool
