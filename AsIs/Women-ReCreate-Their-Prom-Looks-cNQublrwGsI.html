meets hooker my prom was great um I was
like very happy I had a long-term
boyfriend I had a boyfriend at the time
but I went with like all of my other
friends we got all dressed up I think
problem was always the time where
everybody could just dress completely up
get their makeup done be really fancy I
went with some friends to the mall and
just sat at whatever counter was free
and was like please do my pickup
I was not skilled in makeup at all I
asked my cousin to do it I didn't have a
lot of money to pull off my prom look so
I just was very DIY prom I did my own
makeup I like went to the drugstore I
looked up like makeup tutorials and
really tried to like pull it together
for myself as far as like recreating my
prom look I think hopefully I'll be able
to do it better just because I didn't
even have really anything to do with it
as far as makeup I'm confident I can
recreate it because I asked them for a
very natural look I do however remember
feeling like caked in makeup I think I'm
gonna do pretty well I think I've been
basically doing the same look my entire
life
alright let's do it so I assumed they
put foundation on me but I'm just gonna
use some BB cream see I can't even tell
brushes apart you put on eyeliner before
fake eyelashes mmm
you're like a mermaid I never know
really when to start so I just start
kind of like in the middle for some
reason I don't know if you put eyeliner
before after fake eyelashes so what I'm
gonna do do it before put the eyelash
and then just like add a little extra on
the top oh okay No
ah I did not use fake eyelashes in high
school because again I was a basic bitch
didn't know pretty rough on this I
mean life isn't perfect also keep in
mind for problem there are like 500
girls there who just like help you I did
remember I had a lot of blush on like I
was like whoa lady I look like a Barbie
slash hooker made me just go no make up
just kind of pinned all this I think I
had like a swoop like this I basically
just did my normal hair style I was
gonna advocate for everyone
spending money to get their makeup done
this picture glass wherever you guys it
kind of looks like this but like less
extreme you know what I realized
one of my friends probably did my makeup
it's not that bad I feel like my
eyelashes look a lot better but I think
it's pretty on point like it's pretty
accurate it's my picture I think I did a
pretty good job I think my eyes were a
little more gray and then I had a Pinker
blush but for a haphazard day I'm pretty
proud plus I got the flower on the right
side it was a really really great night
my friends did my makeup this is not
prom ready this is not this is not what
I did there my big advice for prom is
don't spend too much money like it's
just prom have fun wear something that
you feel comfortable in and then if you
want to put makeup on do it if you don't
do that - I think it's really about how
you feel most comfortable I don't feel
comfortable doing makeup so I'm not
gonna try to do it ever again thank you
