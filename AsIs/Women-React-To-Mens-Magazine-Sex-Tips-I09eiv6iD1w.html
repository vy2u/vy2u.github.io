penetrate her vagina let your penis rest
just inside of her
I think the penetration is the idea I
don't know why you would do that that's
like putting your tongue in someone's
mouth and then just sort of letting it
sit there okay it's just the tip this is
just the tip situation
no thank you you're not going to please
anybody with that by a half-inch camel
hair paintbrush at the art supply store
dip it in chocolate sauce and have our
paint numbers on her body find your way
in order to use your fingertips and
mouth hmm this seems really really
complex to me sounds messy yeah
chocolate is delicious
sexy time is fun camel hair unnecessary
I kind of like this one Samantha would
totally do this she only ever do it once
don't give your real name and never tell
your friends all right that's terrible
advice I've been cheated on and I'm not
sure that it helped our relationship so
much has made us break up okay this is
literally the worst advice I've ever
heard cheat in your mind take a swig of
champagne before going down and use your
tongue to throw the bubbles around her
clitoris well if this is true that
sounds kind of cool I'd like to know who
did the research on this in theory if
the science was correct this would be a
good idea but there are no leftover
bubbles on your tongue
I'll try champagne with anything really
I feel like these are all terrible ideas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
