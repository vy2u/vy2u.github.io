inside you but we choose to love it it's
a very strange thing that we do for
survival a woman's uterus can expand
about 500 times in size during a
pregnancy 500 times you're supposed to
be really small to start with god I hope
so
I thought my uterus was like already the
size of basketball so like 500
basketball does that make sense because
it's really the volume of it that had to
increase like crazy what else could you
fit up there that's like the wonders of
the female body in addition to her
uterus a woman's feet and heart could
increase in size during pregnancy it's
because we're filled with love her heart
gets bigger just enough room proofing
big feet big hug speedfit slogan for
pregnancy I knew about the feet though
I'm not excited about that I already
have big I mean I guess that makes sense
because you got to be stable because if
you're already like front heavy that
sucks because you have to buy new shoes
from the second trimester onwards babies
pee in the uterus then they drink it
then they pee again and they drink it Oh
gross so then they're just peeing and
breathing it in because babies are
basically like fish in the uterus this
confirms my theory that everyone was
once an alien he is sterile it's like
some survival man right there
babies are gross babies pee and poop in
people's faces like yep of course it's
peeing on me and drinking its own urine
sounds about right
babies getting bigger boobs getting
bigger I didn't need another pant sighs
why all of your organs get smushed how
do you breathe everything's just being
like pushed up is that this stabbing her
stomach goes horizontal any guesses so
it's do like reshape like spaghetti her
intestines are just gone this is why you
just poop and pee all the time it's just
extended comfortable
it seems very cool that we like Pat a
pregnant woman's belly like don't touch
them you know what's going on inside it
is Wars out in there thank your mother
for moving her organs out of the way so
that you could be inside of her this is
like a monster being created that's
gonna be the nose isn't it no that can't
be the nose so this is the mouth that's
the nose right nope but then it turns
into the eyes and there's a nose and
there's the mail what in the hell this
looks like something of a JJ Abrams we
look like will pigs at first right here
like that was like a little pigs now oh
my gosh now looks like et
very very cute and it looks like et per
second how does these come from they
shouldn't know these things
something should remain secret this is
like the miracle of life he looks weird
but it's cool
I still want kids I don't know why but I
do that's evolution for you I don't want
to do it women have been having babies
and living past having babies for like
the entirety of Homo sapiens existed I
like feel really good about my decisions
I'll have kids for another ten years I
just need more time I'm not ready I'm
sure at some point I'm gonna be that
girl like crying over brunch like my
chokes on a baby but right now I'm like
I give it up the pregnant woman like
it's so much big slob that's what that's
what pieces for this thanks Bob
pregnancy still freaks me out babies are
ugly out of the womb and inside sorry
about your ugly baby it's just so sad
what's happening over there oh yeah you
don't know the half of it hey watch
something were they some guy has to like
pass a kidney stone I hear that's the
closest they'll get to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
