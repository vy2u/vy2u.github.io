and they don't look like they're out of
control oh my god and nobody's doing
anything about it what did she do this
is too much I'm upset I mean I've seen
into my newsfeed all week and all my
friends talking about it she looked
about a hundred pails so I don't
understand like why he would even pin
her down to what he did nothing really
that you can hide in this bikini so if
anyone's in the bikini that makes him
even less of a threat she'd have a gun
she have a knife like if that happened
for me I was just like crying makes me
feel unsafe that's to say I'm this game
skin tone and it feels like that was me
I don't know I couldn't even go out
after that like I wouldn't even feel
safe like just walking outside think
about what them I wouldn't know how to
like be anywhere with cops around
they're clearly afraid of him anyway
because he's the police officer so
especially with a young woman you don't
have to use that much force try to talk
things out or have other ways of calming
a situation down other than just
slamming people's bodies down on the
ground because you don't feel like
you're in control she's naked they
treating her like she's nobody
throw her on the ground he believes that
he can toss her around and dehumanize
her they have so much power to do
whatever they want and nobody does
anything they demand to be respected and
if they don't they mean they react the
way they normally react
no matter your background or like even
if like you come from education or if
you all feel like if you're of color
then you're already considered a target
we're gonna keep seeing these incidents
happen now we're gonna keep getting
people's reactions and we're gonna keep
doing the same thing we've been doing
which is like oh my gosh another girl
gets you know attacked by police another
guy gets shot and killed by police
things like this are constantly
happening every day and people just like
I think it's okay look it's not it's
just it's just an epidemic to me at this
point
how will they feel if let's say it was
their daughter getting threatened and
tossed around is that what did she do to
deserve that
we probably would have jumped on and
joined in and helped her if that was a
what wasn't a police officer because we
don't mess with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
