today we're here today in Malibu we're
about to recreate some Sports
Illustrated covers as non models I'm
gonna have to untie my bathing suit on
one side my dad has access to the
Internet but whatever we all have bodies
it's going to be great it's going to be
beautiful
the songs get caught in my face through
my glasses and we're gonna get sand in
our butt I don't think there's any
representation of disability on Sports
Illustrated swimsuit covers but I think
it's also important to realize that all
bodies no matter their size their shape
their ability you know if you're healthy
and you're feeling good then you've got
nothing to hide usually Sports
Illustrated models they have same kind
of curvy bodies but still have abs it's
a one-piece so I don't think it'll be
terrible you're feeling pretty good
about this compared everybody else yeah
hey guys what's up just hangin home have
your left arm a little bit behind you
you have to have such a long torso to
make that pose work it's not possible my
hands aren't that long that was actually
really hard for me to like have hands
that were like both at my crotch and at
my knee
I've wide set tits so that's a problem
it was hard work than I expected because
I don't have stomach muscles I have to
pull up my upper body just using my
shoulder and my chest muscles it's just
holding the positions they look like
they're really easy yeah it's like oh my
god that's using every arm muscle I have
you're like this it was interesting I'm
not gonna lie putting my arms in those
positions wasn't something I was used to
and the amount of boobs I had I thought
I was about to get arrested
rebellion like pork was like moving my
legs moving my body and moving my arms
but then like looking directly into the
sunlight but trying to look sexy all the
same kind of arch length of art yeah
like it should be uncomfortable okay
shoulders hands is I've done that way my
ass was like on one side my shoulders
had to be straight and then the wind was
doing crazy things with my hair I like
that there's just like three people just
like I've been washed a lot of America's
Next Top Model so I hope I got the
smiles down but we'll see once it comes
back I'll photograph the day on the
beach was awesome fun the comradery with
the other girls right so the thought of
seeing myself in a bathing suit
with all the things that we try and hide
the parts of our body that we think are
the least Lateran I'm slightly nervous
seeing everything on show it's better
than I thought it was going to be but I
did feel like I was having more fun than
my face is conveying ah oh don't you
ever seen a picture of my body like this
and so it's definitely like something
that takes some getting used to like
when I look at it and it's just
like I feel pretty and it's just like
when you compare it to Tyra
like how can I ever look like Tyra I
want to frame this and put it in my
house for one of the first times in my
life I can say that I look good Oh
interesting my boobs actually look
really great in this and usually they're
very saggy so I am very proud with this
final result I've never looked like that
before I wish there was more Asian
representation I think it's important
for every young girl to see themselves
reflected in the media I think magazines
tell us that we're supposed to look sexy
but there's also this like hidden
message where you can't call yourself
sexy and I think the representation of
disability in media is still massively
lacking sexiness is diverse and could go
across like a multitude of body types
and skin colors we live in a society
where we're often told to not like
ourselves and I think it's time that we
start liking ourselves for real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
