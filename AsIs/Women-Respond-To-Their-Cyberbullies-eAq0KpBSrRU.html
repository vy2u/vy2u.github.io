cyberbullying don't discount how much
that affects you part of me wants to
tell them why my lips look this way but
the other part doesn't even care about
that the other part of me just wants
them to know that they shouldn't be mean
to people for something that they can't
even control it makes me feel violated
because they don't know who I am it
makes me remember a lot of the times
I've been called these names in person
the most hurtful comments I get are
about you know like you're not Muslim
like you're Haram you're doing this so
it was really hurtful to see when
someone points out the hair on my arms
yeah it does bother me but I've gotten
to a point where I just don't care
anymore and in fact I just feel sorry
for that person I don't know what I
would say if I saw them face to face
because I don't know if there's anything
I could say to convince them
there's pluralism beneath the Muslim
umbrella I love Who I am and I love the
way I look so that should be enough for
people I feel really sorry for you that
there's something going on in your life
that makes you feel the need to bring
other people down is the way I live my
life and who I am as a person so
detrimental to how you live yours
thousands of miles away on the internet
behind a screen every time somebody
bullies you it is usually for something
that makes you unique and different and
can often be your greatest strength I
know that these comments heard and
they can really damage you and you're
completely entitled to feel what you're
feeling but for me personally I think
it's so much easier when you can really
realize it's not your problem it's their
problem
don't use other people's approval to
judge how you feel about yourself it can
be hard to brush off some of the mean
comments but I promise you you'll be so
much happier if you do it's hard to say
it because I know I don't always ignore
it but you honestly you don't have to
ignore it but you have to keep going
you can't go back into hiding you can't
be scared of them because that's how
everything stays the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
