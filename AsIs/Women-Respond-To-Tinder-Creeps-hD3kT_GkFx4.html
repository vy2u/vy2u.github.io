because I have a really average-sized
bone I'd like you to inspect been so
long since it was in use that an
archaeologist has to look at it if I
were a watermelon would you spit or
swallow my seeds you were a watermelon
I'd cut you even if you weren't a
watermelon I would still cut you Reina
is that short for blowjobs Greg
is that short for unable to obtain
blowjobs you're hot
want to sit on my face can I fart on it
hey how many bones do you have in your
body 208 and no I don't need another one
especially one that's probably the size
of my pinky because only a guy who's
trying to overcompensate would use a
lame ass pick a boy in like that thanks
for playing
hey beautiful you know who you look like
Hillary Clinton I respect that but I was
going to say my next girlfriend no I
think it's closer to Hillary Clinton if
you had someone over who does anything
you say what would you make them do my
laundry there will only be seven planets
left after I destroy your anus um I feel
obligated to call the police happy steak
and blowjob day I like mine well-done
and my steak medium-rare I thought it
was blowjob steak day where I cut your
dick off flatten it cook it in your own
 force-feed it to you and laugh while
you choke on your own penis my mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
