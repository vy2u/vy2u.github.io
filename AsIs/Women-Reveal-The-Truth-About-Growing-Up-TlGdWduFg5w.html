sexy fun-loving ready to take on the
world woman 20s are for doing dumb stuff
the 30s are for figuring it out and the
40's are more about now taking all that
you've learned and kind of putting it
into action
I have no problem saying what my real
age is because in a way I feel like I've
earned my stripes you just kind of want
to tell her you want everything that
you've figured out and you can't really
do that but you can show by example I
decided a long time ago that I was not
going to let fear stop me from doing
anything and that took a lot of time
getting to that place I started trusting
my instincts virtually about everything
and my life couldn't be better when you
do your hair and you put something
pretty that you feel comfortable and it
feels like is you you project that I
have the guts to do what I wanted to do
now I came here with a business plan and
I have just been knocking it out I'm an
intrapreneur I left my career I've
started a new one but I never thought
that I could do something that I love
and make money off of it and do it on my
own
and she said mom I am so proud of you
you have not only shoved each one of us
out the door to chase our dreams you
went out that door to chase your dreams
some point in your 30s you stopped
caring about these milestones that you
think are so important to your life and
you start living your life the way you
want to live it my kids are raised and
I'm kind of free to really explore life
and be adventuresome I've been married
my entire life the kids are okay they're
great I'm now ready to think about
myself a little bit every time a
catalogue comes with the college courses
I'm opening it up and looking at it
because there's so much to learn I want
to focus more on songwriting it'll be
okay I do want to write a book when I
actually am old I have a great many
abilities to do a great many things and
I'm not defined just by the one dream
that I had when I was 15 we are women
and we can do whatever we want as women
we have so much power more power than a
lot of us even could begin to really
imagine you can do a lot more than you
think you can life is too short to not
be doing what you really love to be
doing everything is wide open right now
you're good enough you've got to keep
the child in you alive for ever it keeps
you young
don't worry about what people think
about you if he comes from your heart
it's good and when you smile smile on me
and know you're who you're meant to be
yeah oh my god bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
