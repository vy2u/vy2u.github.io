neither do teenagers so graphic tees are
are mostly impulsive buys I would say
and I don't trust my instinct on this
thank you
have a fun personality what better way
to show it than with a t-shirt they're
99% stupid but the fact is they're fun
he's got her falling in love kills
creativity that is the boat like the
biggest bold-faced lie I've ever heard
they just took like buzzwords it was
like love creativity channel skills put
it together BAM
yeah this is the shirt of a lyft driver
who's got a great screenplay you need to
read it's just I just don't get it like
it doesn't offend me I just don't really
understand it also case in point Taylor
Swift you're welcome
yes I'm an actual cat meow now please go
away
nothing happens make sense cats don't
wear t-shirts oh this I would wear are
you oh yeah these are the times when I
question my friendship with Gabby I mean
you're not an actual cat your child or a
woman like there's a hidden meaning
though like yes I'm an actual cat like
there's got to be something else there
yeah like drugs probably uh-huh is this
cuz is this like a response to
catcalling shirt because I might kind of
like it my commute is better I should
take this shirt cuz my commute is better
than everybody bragging what it's not
even a good jab it's such a bizarre
thing to brag about it's kind of like
saying like I have great water pressure
at my house it doesn't make any sense
you know who wears this someone riding a
bicycle
someone must have spelled this wrong or
like you know they tried to use this
with Soros to like get a good word it's
drugs my drugs don't live it any worse
you can commute as a drug stop following
me
okay get over yourself right I'm not
following you if I happen to be going in
the same way it's because maybe we want
the same food I know guys that when they
were teenagers would just make it a day
of it to just like follow girls by which
I don't is that weird like hang out at
the mall and if they see girls they know
they would follow them oh if I'm this
shirt is perfect for this yeah someone's
following you
IRL you need to not wear a t-shirt also
stalking isn't funny it's true I've been
told that by men people I do judge
people on their graphic tees I'm
realizing totally do we should not hang
out you want to wear a crop top that
says you're a cat and wear long sleeves
like go for it I think when it comes to
graphic tees less is more cuz you're
like the one with like just three words
and that was it I think that people
should be able to express themselves
however they want but not with t-shirts
with writing on them forever 21 could up
their game on the positivity level how
your us to write your t-shirts yeah I
would write t-shirts with sittin over 21
hire us to write your t-shirts
what's an idea for t-shirt right now um
I have nothing important to say and then
that's on the shirt yep so people don't
even bother to talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
