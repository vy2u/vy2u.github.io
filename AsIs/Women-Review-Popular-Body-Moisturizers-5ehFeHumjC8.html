the trash pollution is like water for me
I am the product Queen so I come to
bring my expertise I love my sense of
Victoria Secret if it doesn't have che
or Coco in the name I don't trust it I
got trust issues every day like I've got
a butter rub got it hit the elbows my
grandmother has this in her bathroom
smells like a hospital wait who is
smells it actually doesn't smell bad at
all I like how it makes your skin a
little bit slit so yours you can have
that one go ahead put that on your side
I just think that it's gonna evaporate
like by lunch and then we're gonna have
a problem an hour into my day literally
an hour I die will feel that's great
like there's nothing special about it
you know this is not rubbing in quite as
like easily as the Lubriderm I think
that means it'll last longer this I feel
like it's gonna do something oh this is
nice yeah it smells like earthy smell so
good hey does smell good I don't want to
walk outside and people say at least my
really nature II like I don't want this
oh yeah
what's the first ingredient now water
yes Palmer's cocoa butter uh you have
economies through some really rough
times like when I run out of raw cocoa
butter
Palmer's has a cocoa butter stick oh oh
okay every burn get that cocoa butter
set so water down this is gonna keep the
cab yashi in like an hour I'm not mad at
it I know that shea moisture isn't gonna
do me wrong yeah but I still prefer
cocoa butter Palmer's makes a better
version of this in a jar it's an offense
because the butter is so good why would
you ever buy the loose this is
definitely like breaking case of
emergency and like if you're on the road
at a hotel Acorah
that smells fancy this is definitely
more my speed
this would take you a while to put on in
the morning I just feel like it's just
making me look shiny you don't need much
so I didn't need an entire chunk on my
fingers
no that's what you gotta do look you got
usually now just scoop a little bit see
breaking it is the first issue but once
you get your finger in there yeah it has
a nice soft smell to it but is not
tropical enough
nidia yeah I've got Chris going this
looks like Crisco but that looks like
hair cream this might be a little too
thick for me it looks like it's gonna
get your whole body area this is that
cream that makes you look Beyonce
morning's like you look like you're
ready for tour it's not rubbing in like
really like rub it though people I don't
have time it has a little too much
fragrance for me
I'm not mad about it doesn't it smell
like when you go to a restaurant the
soap that you wash your hands with the
pump because it's the pink stuff like it
still has a nice light texture this is
kind of watery for me
this is cuddle quality like you know
when you have a special friend coming
over and you kind of want to seem like
you're expecting the vision but you kind
of want to be prepared it's one of those
that I would put inside of my purse and
just have to lotion up my hands in the
middle of the day this is not the butter
that you marry this is the butter that
you date homers pity I will always put
Palmer's cocoa butter first to the boy
Dharma is the one I will go for it would
definitely choose pakora
Shayne moisturizer the shea moisture one
I definitely would go with this one a
tie between the shea moisture and the
Carol's Daughter what may work for one
person doesn't always work for the other
we don't want to crack so I always say
go for something as for dry skin what
better way to take care of yourself than
to take care of your skin and you can't
do that if you don't like experiment a
little bit I do feel like I have two
types of lotion it's like my basic
lotion that like I'm like I just need to
get by and then I have my like more like
bujji lotion for like you know face
coming over water is not your friend do
not trust lotion that has the first
ingredient as water if all else fails
all skill mum for me will mom's be
knowing some are oily on their body that
yes see I told you I did it y'all having
