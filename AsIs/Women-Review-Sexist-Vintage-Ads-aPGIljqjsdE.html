white men like there's no other time for
anyone else to have a great time does
your husband look younger than you do
because that's a crime what if you have
to do with anything I don't care if he
looks younger than me or not
how many wife's look older than their
years and tragically all right probably
older than their husband getting older
is a tragedy if someone who's dating a
younger man I was sent that statement a
natural way
just like younger after 30 because after
30 years if your husband ever finds out
about not storing the freshest coffee
you sit gonna get a spanking yet a man
slipped me over like this unless it's in
the bedroom
I don't think so this was like an ad for
Fifty Shades of Grey
this just makes me realize everything on
Mad Men is not an exaggeration she's
gonna shoot herself because she's having
a bad hair day I can't think of a worse
message to young girl graze on what is
happening you could never get away with
this but you shouldn't be able to either
because like suicide shouldn't be a joke
or a marketing scheme women of the
future will make the moon a cleaner
place to live we're not done cleaning up
the earth for men we're gonna take it to
outer space huh sexism exists on the
moon we're women back then like okay
seeing this stuff for them to constantly
be printing this stuff means that like
the norm was supposed to be okay your
guy you're number one reason for my doll
who be they you knew like good to be
around any day of the month
my vagina can I totally thought this was
like your guy's gonna give you a
headache no take mine off no it's so you
cannot give him a heading hmm I being a
bitch I'm sorry if he's my reason to
take my doll like you need a better one
you're menstruating no it's up the
uterine lining is being ripped out of it
but she why's she cleaning it forever
Tyson cereal keep up with the house
while you keep down your way cereal this
isn't like even a cleaning product it's
also like these are the only two things
a woman could be doing this is what was
supposed to represent women's concerns
of the time oh what's happening here
they're just looking at her that's very
predatory absolutely it kind of feels
like I mean it feels like a gangbang to
me scary actually she's just like
literally sitting there as a thing
that's being used by these dudes now I'm
realizing we've kept similar sentiments
just taken away the words so it's just
more subtle but still it'll blow your
mind away and so we'll see it again but
wait a minute if the burger is gonna
blow your mind away wouldn't the burger
be giving you the blowjob there was no
need to make selling a hamburger sexual
this is what makes women self-conscious
to just eat a banana I don't like in
these sexual ads where the woman looks
like she doesn't want it this is one of
the simplest representations of
inequality between men and woman I would
be cool with this ad if this man was
also showing me his sexy six-pack and
posing like a sexy model this looks like
an everyday kind of situation this is
clearly a very specific situation it
looks like they boned and then they deem
got the shirt I don't even know how this
shirt is gonna look on me it's a unisex
shirt so they're trying to sell it to
men and women but both ads make it look
like they're selling it to men
I guess the sexism kind of morphed it
didn't go away or
is fairly good fat women are being put
down in the ads with in totally
different ways before it was like well
women are only good for cleaning hahaha
they're so dumb and now it's like well
if the real thing could intersect I
don't know which one is worse but I know
that they both suck it seems like the
ads are still geared towards men it also
makes me wonder how many women are
creating advertisements because my guess
is very few somebody hire me to make
more ads because I think I do better all
those people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
