I like the Puppy Bowl the Puppy Bowl I
can't even handle this it's just a this
naked lady walking around a farmers
market as one does on a Sunday that's a
fruit that looks like an ass obviously
every big pinches Tomatoes like they're
a but without like for a farmers market
natural body product or snacks is for
clothes oh that doesn't surprise me
Carl's jr. does not make me think of
farmers markets got some softcore porn
going on here
more sexy a bus skin on skin and this
one that Kim Kardashian she's had sex
with this guy apparently or had a
workout is it for a gym escort service
she could be selling body oil everyone
was very shiny could add her Skechers
she's really okay Skechers is upping
their sexy game i associated Skechers
with like those light-up tennis shoes
that were velcro that I wore in middle
school that one's not quite as
problematic it's still problematic and
of course he's looking at the bent over
woman is it's a seal on the back of her
neck and she's just making out with his
ear this is every nerdy man's wet dream
and she's gonna play with the phone
that's so sexy coffee no Starbucks
wouldn't do that it's for whipped cream
it's for yeah she turns it dude the
others also looks like she turns into a
car bars are not that sexy
who puts on tights with their mouths
open nobody wears those kind of stalking
you always think we're gonna look good
and then you try them on and you're like
no I just want the present I'm guessing
jewelry could be wearing jewelry she had
a nice dress on for jewelry it was a
flower delivery service because they
were self Wow okay I guess I could see
that yeah there were lots of flowers in
background she was so focused on my
underwear if I was in a room full of
like other people I'd be very
uncomfortable that comes on the big
screen I feel like I should be more
offended than I am but that's because
I've become so used to these kind of ads
not only show diversity of race but also
diversity of body type your body is
wonderful and something to be proud of
whatever but you don't need to use it to
sell things do I have to keep washing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
