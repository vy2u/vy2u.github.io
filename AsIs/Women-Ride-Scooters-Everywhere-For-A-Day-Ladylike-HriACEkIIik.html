few trends that were hard to avoid
choker necklaces Doc Martens Jenko Jean
and razor scooters they were sleek they
were cool and they were easier to use
than skateboards and still are can you
relive our glory days and ride off into
the sunset
it's ladylike and today we're riding
razor scooters I grew up in the suburbs
razor scooters were all the raids when I
was growing up my razor scooter was one
of Milo's prized possessions thank you I
remember like the glee of the wind
blowing past my face ah a bully forms
gunner I never actually had a razor
scooter of my own my older sisters had
razor scooters and I would always like
take into the garage and steal them and
just ride around my block excellent yeah
all right let's see if I still know how
to stand up on this thing originally we
weren't going to wear helmets but I had
an incident in the elevator and now
we're wearing helmets
I've already injured my ankle once yeah
ankles and shins are it's a perilous
game we're playing the point is like we
just have to get like a little bit
comfortable now my goal today is try to
get everywhere with ultimate speed so

got a turbo and Deborah we're gonna
scoot about I don't feel about this I
mean I don't know it was pretty
ridiculous very ridiculous but they look
like they're having fun
whenever you appearance to run these
scooters are so convenient like when
we're actually in the office being in
the hallway is kind of a disadvantage
because I think we get in people's ways
now I'm gonna go up scooter my way on
down to the bank and get some big stuff
taken care of take enough for tables
here with our school equipment in our
body got it about four o'clock usually
around this time I go for an afternoon
pick-me-up and right now I'm gonna go to
Starbucks and get a sweet treat I'm
about to go run an errand to the
drugstore right now because I need to
buy some clinical strength do rent I
like riding around on the street like
each I'm like okay up I'm just gonna
stroll but then the second I set my foot
down and like I need to go as fast as I
can when I was paying for this the woman
was like would you like a bag and I was
like yeah sure
and she's like okay here you go it's
good for your handlebars I'm holding
onto my tea
for dear life oh I just tripped in the
handlebars went into my vagina so
there's that she's felt like I just ten
year old have a credit card my arm is so
tired if using a lot of muscles to hold
on to the drink and steam
pretty tiring day and be honest yeah

think I'm gonna come out one beefy leg
