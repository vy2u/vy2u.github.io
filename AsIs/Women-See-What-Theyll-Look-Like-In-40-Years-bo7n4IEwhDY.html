day it's exciting because who doesn't
want to look into the future I'd love to
see even if it's just an estimate what I
look like
people think I'm younger than I actually
a.m. so I'm curious to see sort of how
the software interprets that getting old
is sort of just this impending thing
that happens to everybody
and I try not to think about it and it's
it's going to be really scary to like
face it along today I don't work out I
don't drink water
I don't eat healthy I don't I eat like
crabby snacks for all my meals I don't
take care of myself at all so this
should be interesting
I look better at 34 than they do it 24 I
look great at 34 yeah I look exactly the
same
my skin just looks a little more capable
wrinkles here sort of getting more
defined which is really interesting a
little bit of hard-working feminist mom
44 and I'm starting to get some wrinkles
around here like I know I smile all the
time so I knew that I know when I'm
older I'm crazy crow's feet and wrinkles
right here because I already kind of
have them the biggest thing is like sort
of in here it just seems like it's got
more wrinkles than usual but I'm not no
wrinkles really here no wrinkles like
anywhere else so like I've Farrell it
seems like I'm fairly wrinkle free which
is good news whoa 50 okay 54
my hair is getting gray ah and okay 54
ah not gray but like it's coming
whoa what just happened something just
happened and I do I turned gray like my
skin changed colors
yeah these lines here they just get more
and more defined I'm turning into
someone's grandmother oh my god
that really feeling wrinkles here not
really wrinkles here so I'm feeling
pretty good about this actually I look
like I'm a hundred and fifty I don't
look like my mom or dad or my
grandparents I look like their
great-grandparents oh my god kind of
reminds me of my grandma little I need
to start using this moisturizer and I
need to start drinking water because my
skin is not good if you just like try to
be stress-free it looks like it might
help I think the one thing that didn't
really change are my eyes and it's kind
of nice to think that like I can still
see the world as my 23 year old self
even when I'm gonna be 64
