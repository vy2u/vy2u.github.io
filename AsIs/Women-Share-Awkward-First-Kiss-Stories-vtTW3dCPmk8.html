and I was like I don't think this is how
it's supposed to be this very small man
came over and what it's a dance of me
you know you sit around in a circle like
that so it was like this little like
turtle creature coming towards me
and it was literally like a washing
machine the tongue encircles inside my
mouth and around the outside and I ran
back to my friends I went like this I
had to be cool basically is this dude
who I went to Shakespeare camp with and
I've been plotting to make out with him
and we like met up the whole time like
putting my face really close to his
finally he like leans in it felt like a
little chicken was just like giving me a
little like had a snack but I was so
happy so we went to the cinema his mom
actually Shep around us a kissing scene
came on in the movie and we were like
Jonna it just felt like to warm slugs
kind of battling it out I was like this
is it I was a super practice this crater
I had this planned out with my
girlfriends and so like the four of us
sitting on the couch and I just like
leaned over and like go around his face
and just kiss him she became the first
couple in fifth grade that was making
out we were doing high school musical
the musical we were in our stage makeup
and then he's just kind of like going in
and then I moved his head like right up
against the locker it kind of hurt
himself and then I just kind of ran away
and said my mom needed to see I think I
was three months away from being 21 so
we had just come back from salsa dancing
I just like lingered there for a second
and that for him to just like start
kissing me and in my head I was like
yeah
am i dominating reaction was just this
is really salty and cold and then I went
back to my apartment and wrote like a
three page long journal entry about it I
just decided like hey this is the day I
was on top of the picnic table like
dancing and doing something silly I just
like fall off the table like very
dramatically and my friend Lee seola she
knows what I'm gonna do she knows and
she's like he'll then fix it like you
know like
- mouth or something and then like he's
like no and then he starts to choke with
me and I wake up but I figured it out
now I'm like eh + gizzard
it felt like you here's like the driest
tiniest like most looking beak like lips
since then still I think that one's
pissed on top of a car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
