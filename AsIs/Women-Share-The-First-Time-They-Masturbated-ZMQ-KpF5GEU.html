tell me that they had boners when they
were six I mean if it's okay for them to
talk about it why isn't it okay for us
to talk about it
I've been doing it for as long as I can
remember feel like I was probably like
10 like 10 or 12 I would say pretty late
in the game I didn't really know girls
masturbated until college a film I
watched in college sophomore year I just
figured it out on my own I remember
distinctly the movie was Mulholland
Drive
I couldn't sleep one night though I read
sex for dummies and that's how I learned
all about the joys of masturbation I was
like sitting in the class with all the
students grabbed me and I was like what
is she doing that's so oh maybe she's oh
I never thought of that I've assumed
high school once the movie Titanic came
out and Leonardo DiCaprio
I had a vibrating hairbrush I was
watching Cruel Intentions and it's a
very odd like Justin Timberlake I mean
the battery died in months in mere
months it was just like erotic I think
it was pretty embarrassing it may or may
not have been fanfiction okay it
definitely was I finally was able to do
it because I started reading erotic
fiction I really set my mind to it this
past October and succeeded it didn't
feel like an explosion to me it felt
like it just felt like endorphins
flooding my body that like everybody
does it and it's not that big of a deal
I think the weirdest thing about
starting learning how to master it was
just the amount of shame I'd feel and I
think that was just because it was just
I'm here all the cultural judgments just
knowing that you shouldn't feel guilty
about it like that's why do we
talk about guys waiting your dicks
around and we can't talk about women
doing something that is healthy and
normal for themselves
yeah after I masturbated for the first
time I was kind of like what is this
secret like why didn't anyone else let
me in on it yeah I just want everyone
watching this know it's like 100% normal
so there was a neck pillow that like
people use
airplanes and it vibrated and so I would
like use the neck pillow so whenever the
batteries would just run out I was like
mom I understand Antonio this weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
