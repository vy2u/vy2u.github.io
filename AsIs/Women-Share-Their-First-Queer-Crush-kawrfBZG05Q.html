was a girl that I went to middle school
with my first girl crush was one of my
best friends my freshman year of high
school I was 6 years old
I was 7 years old I was 14 my first
crush was on a boy named Tony who is now
also very gay like myself we had fun
spending time together she made me laugh
a lot there was chemistry and also I
found out that she liked me it was in
kindergarten and he was the like cool
kid that had style now we know why oh
man like she's so smart she goes to
advanced math she's got really long hair
she's got freckle she's so pretty and I
just really wanted to be around her all
the time she was a year older than me
and we were both cast in Fiddler on the
Roof when I was in ninth grade and I
literally was hoping to get cast just so
I could breathe the air she breathed
she's like that girl in the movie that
you always see like walk by in slow
motion behind the mean girls that's like
she's like doing this but she's like
actually looking at you like she's look
at me I did I knew that I wanted her to
be special to me and I wanted to be
special to her and I didn't know what's
special necessarily meant oh she had
like that sexy raspy voice and I would
just be like hmm like that you know it's
like I mean kids you know but I remember
that any time we talked or hung out I
always was really like happy and I felt
like I was creating this bond that was
like only ours once we kiss we just kind
of had this unspoken bond if I had to
get married to a man he told me you have
so many crushes in high school at all
the crushes and all the crushes had me
ah that's great
