mastered having a period yes I'm like
something it's a period horror story
every time I'm on my period the first
time um I was uh hooking up with this
guy everything was great and I spent the
night and then the next morning I
realized I'd gotten my period and it
completely surprised me it was a mess
and I just hid in the bathroom for a
half hour after I woke up cuz I didn't
know how to face him or how to talk
about it and I did finally come out of
the bathroom he was totally cool with it
he didn't care it was fine went out for
breakfast and then three years later I
married him so it all worked out most
recently I went to Virginia to meet my
boyfriend's parents and I fell asleep on
the train because it's in the middle of
the night and then I woke up
it's like sat up something went wrong
did I have to make some crazy excuse for
like putting something on my seat and
then going into my bag and having to put
on different jeans and then just having
like three weeks ago so you think I
would have had stuff together by now and
been just better at this entire thing
but I'm not I was changing my tampon and
about to put a new one in then I saw a
string already hanging out and I pulled
out one tampon and I pulled out a second
one and I was like oh my gosh there's
already a tampon in there so I had been
wearing two too like there were two
inside of me for I don't know how long
what's up so I was at work and
you know how when you're at work you
like hide your tampon in your sleeve I
wasn't wearing sleeves that day it was a
hot day and I put the tampon in my bra
as you do and started walking down the
hallway and kind of got distracted
talking to people like just making my
way down the hall and I get to the
bathroom and I realized that my tampon
had been sticking out of my bra the
entire time okay um so in high school
and math class I just like bled through
everything and I could tell and I was
like really scared because I couldn't it
was like past the point of like getting
up and going to the bathroom and like
doing something about it
I just didn't do anything about it I
just left the scene of the crime I tried
to use a tampon for the first time and I
went swimming and hung out at the beach
all day with the plastic applicator
still on and like stew inside and I was
just like this is really painful I don't
know why I'm just see what like that
happens to me all the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
