look at her
so today we're gonna style Barbie doll I
love Barbie when I was a kid I
definitely remember dressing them up and
making them like have real lives that I
didn't have yet I honestly am terrified
of Barbie dolls doo doo doo
I was scared that they would come to
life and they would eat me I don't know
why I used to play with Barbies all the
time oh I was a tall girl oh I would
shave their head and then I would like
to give them like but that's not okay
you think this I'm very seriously it's
really fun to see that they have like
hair colors and ethnicities the hair is
different I love this Barbie this Barbie
is me they're their body type is
different this is not this doesn't have
like traditional Barbie measurements I
don't look a little creepy can they be
in a girl band we've been wanting to
start a girl fans yes actually we can't
do it in real life we'll do it for her I
want to dress mine like the cool girl I
never was oh you are cool you got your
cute little glasses and you're like hip
and a funky fresh she's very nice mine
feels like she's ready to like go to a
rock concert so I think I'm gonna prep
her for like a fun concert there are no
pants option Oh what the some
skirts and dresses has to be done oh no
we don't want that what is this this is
like really see-through but I like it
scandi I want these clothes life-size
for myself well yeah these are good mood
these are cute outfits I totally wear
this like I love that it honestly all
right I'm like so we have the dress on
looks kind of like a nightgown though oh
my god they can stand her arms aren't
frickin impossible to get a bathing suit
on this matches your hair how cute is
she
we're going to Hello Kitty room this
shirt reminds me of a boy that I think
is cute I wish we had boy dolls
oh my
job can make them kiss I'm basically
just dressing her like I dress oh oh
they're Nicks she can move her head
their faces are squishy oh this is
high-quality Barbie outfit it's real
leather
yeah real pleather look at that real
fake what do we think the skirt I'm
really into it
do you see what I'm having to do to get
this on you have to break her damn arm
is it just more like jean skirt yeah
that's it besides this it's long I can
cut the skirt yes can I cut her hair oh
my god so much better this is probably
like $300 worth of clothing yeah plus
the hair we're talking about yes Queen
literally some an outfit Megan would
wear
let's be friends no bitch give me your
bag and now presenting princess the
necklace is that oh that's embarrassing
take two for the space buns and um we're
gonna name her Claire ban trap I feel
like her name is like our Aurora or
something like that
- Gloria I'm not even surprised at how
much fun I have because I knew I would
have fun doing this it's surprising
because I did not like Barbies do
believe that not by I mean like this is
something where I had a lot of fun
dressing her today it definitely
inspired me to dress this is already
pretty close to how I dress but like you
know it still inspired me honestly I was
petrified of Barbie dolls and this
actually became therapeutic for me and I
felt like I was like really into it
actually no today I'm still upset about
what bitches don't have pockets they
still have always to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
