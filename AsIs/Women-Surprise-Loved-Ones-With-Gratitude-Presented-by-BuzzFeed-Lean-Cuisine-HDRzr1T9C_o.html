influence in my life and the absence of
parents she has taken the end when she
didn't have to she means everything
means everything to me it reminds me of
my relationship with my mother
Jolene has a very good daughter she gets
whatever I need I always sang Jolie
I met Samantha at Burke and it is very
unusual to go to work and then find a
daughter
we've had our relationship for 15 years
she's always doing for others so I
thought it would be excellent to
surprise her and do something for her ie
when I surprise my sister she's helped
me in more ways than wine especially
this year she doesn't let anything get
her down if anything she uses it as
motivation and that's one thing that I
am I about her hi how are you my sister
told me that we're gonna be talking
about beauty products I thought it was
funny because I think she was a beauty
expert so learning how to put on makeup
I told you lean we would get makeovers I
was told it was like a self Beauty
makeover but there's something amok oh
you do look beautiful already okay
I really brought you here because I
wanted to tell you how much I love you
and how grateful I am for everything
you've ever done for me
thank you for everything you do for me
honestly I want to tell you what you
mean to me and I want you to know that I
love you so if it weren't for you I
don't know what I would do and without
you I don't know where I would be so
thank you very much
I love you really nice I don't know what
to say is that this is it oh my god
she's the best that you could have if I
didn't want children and I ended up with
one that was perfect
I'm so happy that I have a daughter I
didn't carry you here but I certainly
carry you here in my heart I never asked
anything of Shinae the fact that she's
so appreciative of me it was kind of God
who would have thought I would be in
this position to meet my daughter's help
in there she is
yeah what am I gonna do I have two boys
she's special because of you you made me
the woman I am today
my eyelashes are coming off okay maybe
we can get some tips on how to do the
eyelashes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
