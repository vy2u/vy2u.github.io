direct reflection of how I feel you know
when you grow up hearing you should
straighten your hair your hair milk
really pretty straight what I always
heard was you would look better with
straight hair you would fit in better
with straight hair growing up I really
didn't like my hair so all throughout
middle school I kept my hair up in a
ponytail because I had no idea what to
do with it fifth grade I permed my hair
and for me it was like I don't waken
first I tried Sonnen then I try to
cellophane I school the way that I
changed my hair was just hairspray that
was really good dark plum purple you
spray that down so that when you go like
this it just doesn't move hair foils I
started straining it in college I would
straighten it and then curl it which was
never really me if I have to expose my
forehead for any reason I am going to be
unhappy you will not be seeing my
forehead in this video this is my hair
care routine you flip your hair upside
down you wet it
you're gonna shampoo in your color ooh
then you applies to wash that down rinse
to rinse still upside down when do I
lose consciousness a pair should feel
like silky seaweed like spaghetti no
what is your hair routine what am I
getting myself into
wash middle of the day air dry I
straighten my bangs sometimes I just
clip them back I feel like you're gonna
have to do one day bang straight one day
bangs back I couldn't cry I mean you're
gonna have to brush her hair so that's I
don't own a brush metal own a comb
because it will grow like the Grinch's
heart five times the size it began
yeah I am too this routine situation
that I'm being asked to maintain explain
I really like those like tangle-free
brushes and a brush you're gonna have to
get yourself one on wash days it starts
with rushing okay here I go
wet shampoo root I mean this is oral Wow
oh ow
she brush it dry alright I think I'm
done this is inefficient I'm just gonna
go on everything alright I did it felt
unnecessary but I did it I was just in
bed thinking about how excited I was
that I get to wash my hair tomorrow
morning and then I remembered when
Morgan told me about the specific time
that she has to wash her hair wash
middle of the day air dry without
control over my hair I feel like I need
my outfit to express me in a way that I
have not really relied on fashion for my
curly hair has always been labeled as
messy I used to grow up watching novelas
with my grandma and all of the girls had
just had pinned straight black hair when
I met other Latinas who had hair like
mine who had that kind of texture I was
like oh my god you exist just like me
you look like a dry beautiful you love
this effortlessly cool this is what
they're looking at so for some reason
after talking to Maya I just like feel
less afraid to go shower and just let it
air dry and not give a about how it
looks not quite as we were getting naked
at work as I thought it would be I think
I'm learning that there isn't just one
good way to have your hair be curly /
surprisingly complimentary about about
the mushroom which is shocking to be
honest I think today might be the day
that I have to put my bangs back
I don't think of myself as actually like
high maintenance or vain in any way but
this sucks man today I was surprisingly
comfortable having my bangs pinned back
that being said I mean Megan get serious
what my hair looks like no fresh it what
can I wear a hat it's been a long week
paying a lot of attention to my hair I'm
ready to shave my head it's pretty crazy
the hold that my hair has over me and
the way that I think I looked our last
day I saved off the messy bun but I
needed it this week I swapped hair
routines with someone who does a very
differently than I do and it made me
just as uncomfortable as I thought it
would I'm surprised that I haven't
passed out from hypertension like with
all of the like head flipping this week
I always sort of thought that my
philosophy was like now it's just hair
whatever but I still sort of have always
thought that my willingness to just like
sort of try whatever has come from a
place of not caring but really it comes
from like a very intense emotional place
I think that something that I realized I
need to work on is feeling beautiful
regardless of how my hair looks and
regardless of how I think other people
think my hair looks you guys I brought a
rubber band
I brought a headband and they're getting
a haircut this afternoon you're all week
and a hair clip I brought a hair clip
where is it I'm gonna put it on right
now get out of my face bangs get right
out of my face fu oh so good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
