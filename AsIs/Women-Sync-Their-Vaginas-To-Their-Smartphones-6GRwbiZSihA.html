here to try these elby's in which we
will be testing our vaginal strength
over the span of a week you know I'm not
exactly sure what kegels are but I think
that it's when you are exercising that
muscle inside your vagina the one that's
like hey what is that noise
well I am on the first exercise and all
it says is try moving the gem and that
word try is a little tip to me that this
is going to be difficult
I have pelvic floor dysfunction pretty
much nothing can go in my vagina it
hurts too much and you know my periods
are hell on earth I feel like I lost
control of my vagina somewhere in
between pregnancy and childbirth but I'm
gonna do something for me and take back
control I do not think about my vagina a
lot maybe this will be my chance to get
to know my vagina I think that my vagina
is a bad bitch and I can't wait to see
how bad she actually can become I didn't
three rounds I have to say that I've
never felt more like a bad ass bitch my
husband isn't laughs like I'm doing this
Bobby cheeto I just woke up and today's
not the greatest day for pain okay she
then we'll see how it goes I can get
myself to oh I'm trying not to make a
face while doing this you'll haven't
done them they say that starting is the
hardest part I think I don't know if
anyone actually says that but they
should because I'll just get up and make
myself do it so I'm feeling like pretty
good like I feel like I can really amp
it up and I can't wait to see what my
badge can do for me
I went to in hard yesterday and I know
that because I woke up this morning and
I have a pain in my stomach that I have
never felt before
it's kind of frustrating because I can't
get it to move I'm like all the way up
at the table and I can't get it to go
down I just tried to put it in and it
really really hurt so that's no bueno
yesterday I was talking to some of the
other girls their scores was so much
higher than mine in it it just made me
feel embarrassed like I think that's a
constant feeling of mine it feels like
someone punched me a thousand times up
in there but these games aren't working
for me and they're not fun it's like
trying to get it up there and I was just
like this is not happening I guess I
didn't think going in that this would be
like the way that normal exercising is
when you go really hard and you put all
this effort in your muscles are going to
be sore the next day of course I think
my vagina to myself early and it was
weird as I think it is cool the
idea of having all this information
about your vagina right at your
fingertips what was so weird was that
I'm not really conscious of my vagina so
suddenly I was thinking about it all the
damn time it's basically like forcing
yourself to go to the gym everyday and
work out a muscle that you are not that
familiar with just the fact that I was
losing Bluetooth connection was freaking
me out did not make me feel any stronger
physically but mentally I felt stronger
like hey I did this thing I might not
have had the highest score but like I
put this thing in my vagina which two
years ago I never could have done I
think for a while now I'm gonna really
be thinking about my vagina and just
what I can do and the power it holds
when previously I just ignored it I just
want to say that I am living proof that
you don't have to go to the gym to be a
goddamn Olympian okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
