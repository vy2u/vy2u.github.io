of home making but what does it actually
mean can we pass a home act test from
1954 yes I don't know maybe hmm
probably not it's ladylike and today
we're taking a home economics test from
1954 I took home Eck in eighth grade
there was a class I was in a kitchen I
think we learned things top I'm mrs.
Burton in eighth grade I didn't take
home economics we called it home
management I have only very recently
overcome my fear of ovens I remember
trying to learn how to make a pin
cushion never quite pulled through
within the first week I broke her sewing
machine I am not the person who cooks
burnt cookies unto a cookie tray I do
not do the laundry and generally just
made her question her decision to become
a teacher I'm the person you call when
you have a flat tire you don't know what
to do
there's like oh I guess this is not a
thing let's get schooled by the past
could you pass a 1954 home economics
class what's the first thing you should
do when you wake up in the morning make
your bed
open your window put on your robe or
brush your teeth why is this one why is
this relevant to home economics put on
your robe cuz you need to be classy I
mean I have a robe it's luxurious
feeling on my skin why does there need
to be an order also open your window why
I'm coming back to this one I don't I'm
very uh thrown off I'm very thrown off
maybe it's make your bed
nope not correct nope it's open your
window so like your boyfriend can like
four rocks through the window I don't
why do you want to open your window
before you go to breakfast open your
window if you close it when you got up
pull the covers back over the foot of
the bed so they may air why do they need
to air out as if they're not exposed to
air the entire time you're asleep I'm
already tired I'm already so tired too
how often should you wash your stockings
don't know where where song ends every
day when you take them off every two to
three where is once per week once per
month every two to three wears seems
about right same rule of thumb with
jeans I feel like the answer is probably
you should wash them every day every two
to three wears I'm gonna say every day
when you take them off okay that seems
like a reasonable instruction one of
those instructions that you might not
listen to if it goes on your feet it
goes in the wash or afterwards also why
do they understand our socks work they
don't understand how sheets work often
should you wash your hair whew fun
question once a day every other day once
a week twice a month this one I know is
gonna be wrong I think this is the time
where women would go to the beauty
parlor get their hair done and that was
kind of it so I feel like they just go
to the parlor once a week and that's
that I wash my hair every other day I
bet it's something ridiculous like once
a day nope
twice a month the hair should be
shampooed regularly at least every two
weeks or more often if it gets dirty I
have oily hair you guys if I waited two
weeks I would look like young severus
snape just like strings which of the
following foods should always be washed
before you prepare it steak chicken eggs
fish I've heard about people washing
chicken I think I don't think you washed
chicken
do you can't mine your book chicks
chicken wrong eggs
eggy's are beautiful they don't need to
be washed maybe if you like literally
have a chicken in your backyard who's
like vagina you just pulled it out of
then you should wash it if I was washing
an egg under a sink I know that I would
drop that egg maybe it was a rougher
time for eggs the ideal family structure
is a blank patriarchy democracy oh my
god god I hope it's not patriarchy I
hope it's not Paige here I get hope it's
not patriarchy please let it be
democracy I'm gonna say patriarchy but
like democracy Hey
oh it's democracy oh it isn't democracy
oh really that doesn't make sense
why should the kids have an equal vote
to the parents according to our authors
the children in the patriarchal family
end up struggling because they had
little opportunity to make decisions for
themselves and were poorly prepared for
adult life in a democracy I mean a
patriarchal family not only hurts the
kids but it would hurt the woman
involved too
I hate to tell you a 1950s book uh we
still aren't pretty good at being adult
like that doesn't change you got seven
out of 19 right a 5 out of 19 I got 4
out of 19 right 5 out of 19 that was
exhausting man I feel bad if I was
better at cooking I still would have
gotten 4 out of 19 right so I don't feel
too bad about this pretty sure none of
these rules existed until someone needed
a job and they got they they've
succeeded they wrote a book and they
sold it to a lot of people this was an
actual textbook this is something that
you were taught in school what happens
if you don't learn these rules do you
just like not have a future it just
feels like if it's your house you should
be able to do what you want in it
choosing to stay at home is a very noble
and hard job there's enough things that
I do badly I don't need to add to that
list I just know that if you're coming
over to my house you're probably getting
instant rice and chicken fingers you're
probably gonna be happy
I'm so
sorry mrs. Burton I didn't mean to break
your sewing machine I hope you got that
fixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
