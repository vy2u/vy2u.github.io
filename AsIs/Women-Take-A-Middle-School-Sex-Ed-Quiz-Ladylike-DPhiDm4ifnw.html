learn you know through experience and
then just a lot through through BuzzFeed
I went to a Christian private school my
sex education was put the boys in one
room and the girls in the other room and
tell the girls about their period and
the boys about whatever a boner is I did
have formal abstinence education where a
guy came with a Velcro mitt and was just
like when you have sex with someone it
sounds like this in your heart when you
don't love them anymore like he ripped a
few myths apart there was sex head that
I thought like covered some good topics
but it was mostly on straight sex I
wouldn't call it comprehensive I would
call it like here's a video and here's a
permission slip to have your parents
sign and that's all that we're gonna say
about it where in the body do the eggs
get fertilized by the sperm I think I'm
pretty sure it's ovary
it could be ovum I think it's something
I know ovary no ovaries fallopian
tube I don't care where it goes I care
that it's going there that's the thing
it is recommended that you wash your
face this amount of times during puberty
what does this have to do with sex
this doesn't have to do I wash my face
twice a day so I'm gonna say you should
wash your face twice a day had acne no
that one's I mean that definitely keeps
me protect you from STDs and pregnancy
so very helpful for sex education Oh
ease in puberty typically experienced
the following besides just perpetual
awkwardness they get smelly they get
horny and they get rude wet dreams and
spontaneous erections yep and that's
what I'm unlike yo laughs I never really
saw like a boner that I wasn't supposed
to see in high school but I feel like if
someone gotten us
direction in class I like would have
been right which of these will
absolutely not get you pregnant
unprotected sexual intercourse or not
having sex it's sort of like it's
leaving you to be like what's the only
thing that will keep you not pregnant
not having sex that's a way that you
could probably not get pregnant this
hormone is released by males and females
at the beginning of puberty progesterone
progesterone I don't know that it sounds
like the sweetener and diet coke
Oh Sofia ha ha I think it's progesterone
maybe maybe what if it is the gonad one
of those funny yeah I'm gonna go with
Rajesh Khanna is it D yay the sperm gets
transported from the epididymis to the
ejaculatory ducts via the blank okay so
we're gonna like get it ready to get out
of here I'm gonna say the vas deferens
because vasectomy seminal vesicle notice
vas deferens nice what is sexual
intercourse whatever you want it to be
no um penis is from the vagina the
vagina is put in okay theoretically
according to this like sex can't happen
unless like penises and vagina
correct there's only one valid sex its
penis and vagina there's a lot of ways
to have sex like even if you are
straight sex is not always gonna be just
a penis in a vagina I think I think it's
important to know like what the parts of
your body are called
but it could be a nice supplement to
just be like okay so here's a scientific
version of it and then here's just
colloquially how it happens
I would hope in a sex ed class they're
also learning everything from like the
emotions that run through like having
sex with someone - like STD knowledge
and contraception I think that schools
think that sex education is like an
advertisement for sex
when really it's just a helpful guide
map for later down the road we got years
we got little armpits and they're not
saying
I'm doing I'm just saying like their
option you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
