and I look like I when I murder
everybody so it's fine
hi I'm Abby Macbeth I'm here from the
oldest information technology ten years
ago my company released into the world
of face reader software which
automatically analyzes facial emotions
we started with celebrities of people
who are known to have RBF and ran them
through our face reader software to see
is there something common ah I don't
think I don't think he is resting
bitchface
I don't I think you gene his eyebrows
are a little intimidating he's adorable
just on first look like if I were to see
him walking down the street with his
face an eight or nine on the RBF scale
I'm sorry case to your ten this is like
I'm bonafide RBF I've literally don't
even know what her teeth look like she
has
Frode eyebrows and absolutely no warmth
in her face whatsoever you have this
instinct especially being a girl when
you see another girl that looks very
like strong you like get super
competitive about her when a man has
resting bitchface it's a little bit
attractive so I think society has
conditioned us to just believe that like
men usually just like have a stern look
on their face all the time and it's fine
people who are known to have RBF have
contempt on their face that we don't see
in non RBF faces
okay fell off hand if someone has one or
no we're gonna see if our software I can
tell on you this is our facial
expression analysis software called face
reader so it's going to look at about
500 points on your face and compare
those to a neural network of coded
images I'm gonna have you just kind of
push your hair back from your face a
little bit and what I want you to do
because RBF is all about your neutral
look at the computer for about five
seconds we're just going to capture a
short clip of video okay well Alex I
will tell you that you have got no RBF I
which I would have expected so what
we're seeing here is that you do have
the contempt spike that is a hallmark of
RBF well Candice I am happy to tell you
that you have even less contempt it's
getting a little bit of sad although
it's seeing that your natural face looks
a little looks a little sad contempt is
very like intense right actually there's
an element in that of I think I'm better
than you I don't think it's necessarily
a bad thing for two reasons right
so one is that when you catch your nice
neutral expression right we saw this
spike in contempt but when you started
laughing it went away completely you're
not showing this in your kind of
every day of what you're putting out
there you may have some sadness in your
face
you might not be showing joy and
happiness all the time
and you have no contempt but because you
are female and we expect women to have
joy in their faces
people are gonna sign you with RBF
before they would have man this is what
happens the second reason why it's not a
bad thing is that I think there can be
some adaptations that are good for women
you put that out like a don't with
me but right yeah
and though I'm gonna take me seriously
ever I thought maybe I would get a
little bit
do you really go yeah like I have no
edge that's okay again there's nothing
wrong with having it nothing wrong with
not having it - yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
