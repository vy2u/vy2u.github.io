what's your center here why do steps
yeah
being a woman is awesome but sometimes
life can be scary so we're gonna learn
to kick some ass
it's ladylike and we're taking a
self-defense class
my mom has taught me to be very hyper
aware so even if you're like this tiny
little baby Pomeranian coming towards me
I don't trust you I'm not the type of
person that really gets really afraid at
night walking I try to play it safe I
don't listen to music at night or at
least I always walk along busy streets
but I definitely do still go out in the
evening because I'm a person living in
the world
I've lived in cities my whole life so I
definitely do have kind of a walking
face but I wouldn't say that I know how
to defend myself the thing I know about
self-defense that you want to hit
someone in the nose or in the balls or
in the eyes before I went to college my
dad made me take Krav Maga I hated
having to learn how to fight people but
I understood why he was making me take
it my name is Nelson I started out I
start out this work about twelve years
ago and a friend of my coworker was
attacked in Costa Mesa so after that
incident I did a lot of research on the
internet and when I found out that every
three minutes a woman is sexually
assaulted in this country alone I
started putting together self-defense
training specific for women against
sexual assault so first thing you need
to learn it's your weapon and what are
your natural weapon when I come up do
you like that what do you use your hands
No
elbows are very powerful what a feat big
deaths but before we use any of this
just one weapon we always use first
fucking screams screams okay yell it out
from your abdomen to your mouth to your
opponent it's an actual weapon you throw
out nice okay you guys ready all right
let's get up extend your arm two arms
lame this is your safety zone outside of
here
I have to step to grab her you just
slightly widen up your feet by Nene
cause your Center so from here any
impact any force you feel from forward
you just step back and sing from here
boom now five Russian I want you to lock
me up super here step back lock me up
with your elbows first so I can't come
in any mail okay this is your shield
if I push really hard slide it up to my
neck as you pull your top four nice sit
no time difference yeah and like this
okay okay as you hit boom in yes
whenever you have bean graph like this
grab my wrist wrap it down as hard as
you can see how she's using the bending
forward and dropping her body weight
down why don't you grab my hand why do
you get my risk so you have more
more control and also if you grab the
hand you're scratching your own face
I'll take your face yeah you fighting on
the ground your main weapon are you guys
one foot close to back and push now find
this for them so when they slip down and
left architects yeah
whenever you flip them sideways always
step all over it boom boom boom you step
up to maneuver your body that's the
first thing you do is borrow my neck
see how high this if she still has my
hand on her chest and she pop like that
that's gonna make so all the techniques
that we've learned today it's all core
driven and you know you never go out
flail around like this it's always
reporter your hair grabs your grab from
behind you lock it in first to your core
you only do it once it's very difficult
for you to do it but you at least you
have some frame of reference on how to
respond okay good yeah
that was crazy was a really good class I
felt like I learned a lot it was great
there are a lot of price paid where it
was just like really freaky I'm a little
more shaken up than I thought I would be
I feel like I learned that there is a
lot more to this than just dick punching
self-defense is the thinking woman's
dick punch like I said before I don't
usually walk around at night super
scared or hyper aware being made aware
today of all of the possible scenario
that could happen to me really just sort
of like brought me back down to earth
and realizing that like people are crazy
and it's important to be ready for that
the beginning of the class felt pretty
easy I felt kind of like a waterbender
and then as we got into the getting
attacked from behind scenarios fending
off someone who's on top few scenarios I
felt myself getting more and more
anxious you know we were laughing it was
it's it's really hard to really think
about something like this happening even
though it was a class and even though
Nelson's like the nicest guy ever I felt
myself like building up this weird
stress inside the thing I really feel
like I'm gonna take away from this it's
just the realization that like if
someone attack you it's like how fucking
dare you
like how fucking dare you come at me
like and then that's just like what will
carry you into like fighting back and
hopefully getting out of there safely I
didn't anticipate myself being able to
tap into that aggression and really go
for it but for some reason I was able to
so that was good it's good to know about
myself that like if I'm in that
situation I'll probably be able to go
for it
a thing that women should be doing
learning to defend themselves it's scary
because you're not gonna know how you're
gonna react until something like this
happens like god forbid if it ever
happened but I think every single woman
should do this
