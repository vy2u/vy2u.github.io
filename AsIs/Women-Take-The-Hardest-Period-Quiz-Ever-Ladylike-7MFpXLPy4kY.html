trip and I was like mom I got my period
and I opened the door and she slapped me
across the face I got my period the very
end of seventh grade pink I got my
period when I was like 12 or something
it was a warm summer day I got my first
period when I was 12
you think I learned about my period
through that American Girl doll book
that was like your changing body
my mom had talked me about getting my
period like five days before so she must
have had some sort of mom radar
intuition like oh now's the time
I definitely like left hints to boys I
like to be like yes who's a woman now
r.i.p every item of clothing I owned
even the shirts even the shirts they
don't really so much get excited when it
turns out you can have babies I didn't
really know any bodily implications
besides the fact that blood was gonna
come out of the old vagine I knew about
periods I did however think they came
once a year I finally realized it was
once a month I was like that's so often
I would say I know a fair amount about
periods I mean I certainly get one every
one hopefully I think I'll probably pass
this test I'll pass it oh yeah I'm gonna
pass the test at least is not like it's
a DMV where if you fail the test you
don't get to drive the car anymore
although to be honest that might be nice
question number one what is shed during
a menstrual period
ovarian lining endometrium vaginal
tissue corpus carbonate differ do that
sounds like a rock formation it's not
endometrium oh maybe it is
I think it's endometrium because it's
the endometrial lining
I think endometrium is the uterine
lining so I'm gonna guess endometrium
hey correct
maybe I am allowed to drive this uterus
car after all which of these hormones is
not involved in the menstrual cycle
luteinizing hormone I hope I pronounced
that right follicle stimulating hormone
progesterone oxytocin
Oxygen's aussie Tosun oxy is i this is
gonna be a rough quiz guys oxytocin I
think is like a happy hormone so that is
definitely not associated with my period
but maybe it like withdraws the oxytocin
out it's like me now you're sad when I'm
on my period
don't touch me I'm gonna come back to
that one because I have no idea so I'm
gonna say oxytocin yes I'm also right
correct - Atta - what does dark or brown
period blood mean a co-occurred yeast
infection ouch but I don't think so
pregnancy old blood menopause when I was
little I thought it meant that I pooped
my pants
- I think it's just old block it is old
blood darker brown peri blood has just
been sitting in the vagina for a while
and it's old how long has it been there
what is it doing there the more you know
way what actually causes cramps I see
that mean people isn't an answer choice
here so I think all of these are wrong
pedestrian pass posted gland instant
estrogen and the luteinizing hormone
Pruss prostaglandins that sounds like a
very fancy way to cheer someone
prostaglandins feel like estrogen is
usually like good I'm gonna say
progesterone just because I don't we're
here why not say progesterone
let's just go forth progesterone I'm
gonna say prostaglandins
Oh what goes right okay that was that
was a freebie there group of lipids
released during your period which can
trigger the contraction of uterine
muscles hosta glandon's are a thing
you've never heard of that ruin your
life every month can you get pregnant if
you have sex while on your period so
being having sex with a man yes it's
difficult but yes because spermies are
little I feel like we
should get a freebie maybe no rest for
the wicked no rest for the uteri
I don't know the poor over your uterus
as you dry but it feels like it should
be you got 14 out of 17 raped I got 12
out of 17 I got 16 out of 17 right I got
50 out of 17 Rights this is like good to
know what's going on in your body that
way if something doesn't feel right you
can kind of like know that something
isn't feeling right because you know
what it's supposed to feel like
reminding yourself that the period is a
bizarre strange animal from the planet
 you would help people feel a lot
better about like the strange things
that their bodies do thank you so much
