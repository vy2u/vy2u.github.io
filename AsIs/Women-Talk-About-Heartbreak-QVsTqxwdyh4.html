times well often times I have never been
broken up with I have been broken up
with I have been broken up with no yeah
I've been totally I've been totally
broken up with I think most of the times
I've done the breaking up but this last
one I got broken up with and it was
really devastating I was pretty
convinced this guy and I were dating and
then he told a mutual friend of ours
that we were just friends and he was
sorry I misunderstood the situation and
he never talked to me about that so he
was driving from New York like preparing
to break up with me and I was like
lighting candles in the hotel room and
like you know filling the tub with
bubble bath and buying his favorite beer
so we both had very different ideas of
how that night was gonna end and we both
had to stay in that hotel that night
after he broke up with me we were
together for four and a half years and
he broke up with me over the phone the
shittiest way someone has broken up with
me is by showing up on a red carpet with
another girl yep
I didn't make it clear that I was
breaking up with him so I told him that
I wanted to slow down and to take a step
back to being friends and I thought that
he knew what that meant and then lo a
week or two later he he was like you you
you want to be done dating I wish you
just said that and it was really bad
this one time I was talking on the phone
with a boyfriend and he was telling me
he just got a power drill and he kept
like whirring it in the background and
at some point I said if you do that one
more time I'm hanging up and I'm never
speaking to you again and he did it and
I hung up and that was I break up I
never I refused to talk to him ever
again I basically like was running after
him and he thought that I wanted to get
back with him and instead I broke up
with him and I took my the keys to my
apartment from him and it was it was
really bad I think like he was in a bad
situation in his life and I dumped him
at his worst and I think for him it was
like everything was crumbling and the
last thing that was going to fall with
me you know and I know that not all
situations when things are going bad can
you laugh at but I think that it's a
sign when instead of finding a way to
kind of bond together against whatever
the bad thing is that happened
you turn on each other you stop getting
excited to see them and that's kind of
when you know you're really not
interested so it's very intangible but
yeah when somebody just doesn't like you
for you and
or it's over and I think it's really
hard I mean you just see a person that
you're really close to and you probably
and you love and you try to overlook a
lot of things all the time and I don't
really know I really know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
