thing which I've now coined as the
Holden skull which is like after we had
sex
we were like cuddling and he literally
said to me you know if you're like
looking to date someone seriously like
maybe you shouldn't have sex with them
so fast even though he also engaged in
the sex act but managed to remain a
really respectable person definitely had
sex on the first date definitely had sex
before the first date I have not I have
had situations where I had sex before a
first date and then never had the first
date I don't think I've had like sex on
a first date I definitely hooked up on
first date I've never had sex on the
first date I do like to know the person
better I think that people should do
what they want I am not the average I
don't think I want to get it on when I
want to get it on I'm gonna do that I'm
not like lot or like easy it's just like
my choice sex is a very important part
of relationship isn't it like sex money
and kids the 3 most important things to
decide on but when you're in a
relationship so much I think that
there's a lot of hesitation to have sex
on the first date I've had guys feel
like I wouldn't take her seriously
because she banged on the first date and
I lost my respect for that I have like a
closer group of girlfriends that I feel
like you know there's no judgments but
if I have sex on the first day it's
definitely not something that I would
mention casually to friends that I'm not
super close to you I've definitely felt
self-conscious like telling my friends
about it this goes like I don't want to
be judges I think maybe when I was
younger I felt self-conscious just
because I went to like public school
where rumors spread really quickly but
as soon as I started owning it and kind
of making it my story and me saying it
it was so much better
I mean I think they're the same as love
another birthday but yeah I mean guys
they're always encouraged to have sex on
the first date I think they get more
props for it when I was younger
hearing guys talk about it it just was
like why are you allowed to and I can't
I mean it takes two to tango sometimes
guys get away with stuff that girls are
crucified for which is really horrible I
think it's easy to envy men because of
that sort of idea that it's okay for
them to have sex on the first date but I
also feel at the same time they're sort
of pressured to score and if that's not
the type of person they are that's kind
of an awful place to be too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
