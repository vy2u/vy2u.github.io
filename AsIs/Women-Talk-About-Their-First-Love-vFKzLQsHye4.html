fondest memory of you is how you always
smelt really good so I was 16 I was like
Facebook stalking people I had mutual
friends looked to see if I wanted to
date them his mom wasn't home that much
and that was like perfect I was feeding
him sushi I like picked it up with my
mouth and I was like put it in his mouth
he would like swallowed a whole piece of
sushi in his hour I love you and I was
like what I remember he was like sitting
on the edge of my bed we were having
some kind of meaningful conversation and
I was like I love you and then my door
opened up my mom walked in and I just
like turned around I think my face just
got so red because I like he was gonna
give a response and then she left and I
think I just kind of turned back around
and was looking at him and I was like so
kind of looks like steve-o from jackass
and knew a lot about computers so it was
like 11 p.m. and he called me on my flip
phone I was saying goodbye and he said I
love you like super quick and then I
said it back and then I heard both of
his friends start cracking up and then
he was like okay bye and hung up her
phone
he was really charismatic and funny sort
of like it he was like a big pothead
I was just like completely in love with
him like head over heels we were making
out and I was like on top of it I think
like he made a joke and I was like oh my
god I love you and then I was
embarrassed so I was like oh just joking
it was a very like tumultuous very
dramatic like Romeo and Juliet
esque relationship he could not dance I
love dancing with someone else cuz it
pissed me off and then like he Kewell
for a dance with me and I was like oh no
I was dancing with this guy he just gets
furious oh why are you being such a head
he was like I love you and I was
like I love you too with sub-unit head
every girl loves that one soul he's just
your pull pull</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
