don't know you can be best buddies I
think when it comes to being friends of
someone you've broken up with it all
depends on how long you've been together
I think you can be friends with someone
after you've broken up I don't think you
can still be friends of course depends
on the circumstances if they were a nice
person and you've just you know mutually
fallen out of love with one another then
why not be friends if I sold my ex on
the street I'd be happy enough to go up
and say hi and have a chat but I
wouldn't exactly say you could be like
friends that hang out and do heaps of
fun dance together cuz that would be a
little bit weird I've had a like a
friend of mine now who I dated for I
think about a year and a half and when
we broke up it was ridiculously amicable
our friends were like this is the
friendliest breakup you see people where
it's so obvious that one person still
has feelings and the other one you know
doesn't have those feelings but that
person's still letting the person they
know like then be friends with them I
just you know no one's going to get over
someone that they're still friends with
I think it needs some time and space
before they can actually be kind of a
true friendship they're ideally of
course of course be friends why not I
think that people should put anger
behind them and move forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
