friend Hannah here and we're gonna eat
make up what are we eating baby food
we're meeting make up again I didn't do
this the first time ladylike has done
this before in the past okay and full
disclosure it was not very tasty okay on
a scale of like here to the floor my
expectations are look at my shoes and my
past experiences with makeup I found it
it does do its best job on my face not
necessarily in my face I am having one
of those days where I could literally
eat anything that's in front of me
why make edible makeup at all here's
another full disclosure moment it's not
edible
it just won't kill you if you eat it
what I take my bra we just always lived
in it
no this isn't like purposefully branded
edible makeup let's get started
bite Beauty whipped cherry fruit scrub
just gagged a little bit I haven't
started well it's made in Canada okay
the texture whew okay smells like lip
smackers I'm not mad almost the ice
cream like it smells like childhood I'm
actually gonna just pretend that this is
yogurt oh your God bless cheers hand
Cheers
I gotta ask why are we doing that's not
bad
dish creamy I bet this will be really
good to taste and then not swallow
insert fraternity joke here
yeah mmm I don't mind the taste yeah
it's kind of like a fine cran I feel
like we're eating like a tub of Barbie
frosting right now are you going in for
a second round
kichaka let's have lunch okay you don't
need to do this man
Oh rahzar a bronzer
another thing never meant to be eaten
called Buriti nut bronzer oh so it's
close to burrito
did you use bronzer a lot I do a little
bronzer right here you ever do into a
job you've got a soft chin mm-hmm try to
bring that over to the line of the yarn
hey never need to be abyss it looks a
little doesn't it I feel like I
just ate a glue it tastes like my
grandma's old lipstick that's been
sitting in her drawer untouched for 20
years I had some notes of post-it wax
eNOS that that coats the tongue yeah
really denying any flavor
the flavors are four dimensional and
that you yeah it's done but it just
continues oh my god
oh my god I just licked my tongue and a
swatch of it came out
whoa lip gloss
see carton four ingredients but the
ingredients are not eat me this can't be
that bad it's made for your lips so it
should be okay right well it is made to
live outside of your lips a little burp
I burped up bronzer okay let's open this
little tube in the ears what does it do
well when I was like 12
my first lipgloss was a little
paintbrush like this and it was a hot
pink it was called Bahama Mama oh oh you
can see it open up oh it's it's goopy
smells like passionfruit in a condom
promise mm-hmm
what is it what is it promising you it
keeps reminding me of a cran you know
it's like black sea heavy not meant for
human consumption that's not bad a fat
that's a good that's pretty good one I'm
not bum I don't know I still eat it
there's a hint of sweetness at the very
beginning yeah that makes you think it's
gonna be good but it's not you have been
to seeing there's no kind of stuff where
if I'm really hungry I like my lips and
feel sad for all of it though I did
really yeah I didn't say I had a
dignified palate I just shade as a lip
gloss oh yeah
yeah how's it look yeah you look pretty
oh okay this is why I came
what how is this a sharpie are we just
gonna eat a Sharpie now don't know if
it's bronzer eyeshadow lip gloss or all
the above
wow this is actually like well pigments
really nicely so that's nice Cheers
thank you for having me thank you for
being here hands thanks for being a good
sport mm-hmm here's a little thing for
you doesn't taste like chocolate this
tastes like the inside of a can I think
I'm actually gonna criticize this one I
didn't get any kind of robust waxy
feeling no lingering sense of crayon or
plaster in my mouth which I've grown
accustomed to this wasn't as bad as the
first time if someone could put all the
gun to my head so I'd eat this I would
be like all right fine well yeah be like
joke's on you I already have
so what's BuzzFeed lady like what he has
is meetings like you're just like oh you
don't want to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
