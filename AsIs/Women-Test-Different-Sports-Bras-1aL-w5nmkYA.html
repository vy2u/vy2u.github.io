gonna try four different brands of
sports bras to see what fits on our body
types best we'll be grading the bras on
a series of tests style comfort and
gravity defying abilities my biggest pet
peeves with sports bras are definitely
ones that are ill-fitting so it's
challenging to find ones that don't cut
in in all the wrong places but that also
offer a lot of support I would love a
sports bra that is supportive that
doesn't hurt me and also when you have
such big boobs you want lift but you
don't want them to like be in your neck
and choke you because I have really
small boobs I'm really fortunate in that
it's easy for me to find something that
supports them however it's really
difficult to find something that also
makes me feel sexy so when I look for
sports for us I'm usually trying to find
like the nice figure creating kind it's
kind of hard to find one that's cute and
actually functions well all right let's
get sporty I think the look is generally
okay
like minimizes my boss in a way it does
give me a little bit of curve which is
nice I am NOT a fan of sports rods with
the clasp in the back it's a little
tight up here around my neck but I mean
I'm used to that it feels a little bit
stiff the one thing that I'm feeling
particularly right now is this cutting
in quite a bit it's doing well on the
bounce
test my boobs are staying in place
usually trying to do that downward dog
position
my boobs would like be in my mouth and
that did not happen
I felt stable not like I was going
anywhere
I'm not gonna lie it's machine my boobs
show together I just have one boob right
now so I love the way this looks
I was actually very surprised because I
normally don't go for bras that are so
simple I can kind of tell already that
this is meant to do the job more than it
is to feel super sexy or curvy while
you're doing it is actually really
really comfortable it's a super soft
material no tugging baseline feels nice
and tight but not too tight I have a
feeling this is gonna be terrible so
let's just try it yeah do you see my
boobs I'm bout to choke on my own boobs
if it was something just like a
weightlifting workout or just a
gymnastics workout it would feel great
but the high intensity might get a
little bit sketchy I'm not bouncing so
that's good
my boobs are staying in place right off
the bat this bra is achieving my goal
today of feeling sexier while working
out I feel ridiculous in this I feel
like I'm wearing a push-up bra and not a
sports bra putting this bra on however
was like strapping into a jet pack you
took clip and zip feels very supportive
underneath the straps I love that
they're adjustable oh good that was
weird
I do not want to do that again it feels
like body armor so I really feel locked
and loaded is it's bad boy this bra is a
structured cup versus compression
material so anytime you like come away
from the cups there's definitely some
so I like the style of this bra I think
it is a good job of being a cute bra
while staying in the realm of being
athletic where this is just like wow why
are my boobs doing this I really
appreciate the creative braided design
of the bass I don't know how often you
see him but I mean you can't deny that
it's a cool look the fabric feels really
nice and really soft I know these things
are like mad expensive so better feel
like velvet rubbing against my
nipples I will say I wish it were a
little bit more snug I was concerned
that the braids would kind of be moving
around as I was bouncing and I couldn't
feel them at all so I was really nice oh
my god
yep my nipple actually popped out there
a little bit but it's probably wasn't
the best thing to go upside down in
there's a little bit of movement but
like not so much that it bothers me my
favorite bra out of all of the ones we
tried today was Lululemon the Nike bra
the Victoria's Secret bra the champion
bra and I keyed for me was the most
comfortable and the most functional
which are really the two things that I'm
looking for most in a sports bra with a
lumen lumen bra I feel a little bit of
curves but also very supportive without
the space in between situation that I
was having with both champion systems
and Victoria's Secret this bra hit
probably probably all the things on my
checklist in terms of style comfort and
just overall function of the bra I am
very surprised that the cheapest bra is
my favourite bra I am used to spending a
little bit extra for you know support
and comfort but this is really doing it
for me as we've shown today it depends
on your body type what kind of bra
you're going to be into so definitely
put in the effort to find the right one
for you it's out there and then we can
all do all the fun stuff and our boobs
don't have to stop us like if I were a
yogi I think that is what they call
themselves
I wouldn't know they would want this to
like show off in the back like oh look
how cute my downward dog is oh my god
look I can put my ankle behind my head
let's grab green teas after
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
