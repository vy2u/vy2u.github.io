going to be trying some facial hair
removal products we're gonna see if
these products really work and if
they're actually pain free I'm skeptical
removing facial hair sucks
growing up I had like a lot of it I had
like a full-on mustache I'll get some
straight hairs just random ones I just
wanna like party by themselves that all
tweets out Hecky I'm nervous I mean your
face it's kind of like you can't mess
that up I have a pretty high pain
tolerance I think it's all very painful
the first thing I thought of I saw this
is it looks like a vibrator looks like a
flashlight okay this looks scary
so this is whoa let's try it on a really
hairy part oh it tickles a little bit
wait this is cool it doesn't feel
painful at all this is it good I caught
I like this this leaves a little bit of
stubble did I just remove a bunch of my
arm here without realizing it I did he's
pretty effective oh that's gonna be
weird when it grows back this is
definitely meant to rip out hair this
one looks like it's gonna be painful I
think you get your hair trapped in the
spring and they clamp it down so you
bend it and then do this with it okay
this one kind of hurts it like pinches
this isn't working
it's making me frustrated Oh
oh my god no I wonder if I can get those
little that cares nope
I wouldn't use this for my entire face I
feel like maybe it would be good for a
mustache
I'm gonna keep my little fuzzies this
one's a bit more intimidating this might
actually work I'm like honestly scared
to try this because it looks like it's
gonna hurt put it on your face and do
you open it first it has these little
coils ah no I don't want to do it I
don't want to do it and I'll undo it Wow
oh my god it grabbed so much of this
hair ah no like your hair is literally
being ripped out about wow that felt
worse than like a wax show coming off a
little bit oh this is cool just like
when you get your eyebrows ready right
before I got laser I would literally
thread my face like every morning Oh
oh it works oh no my skin got in it no
out nerd an app DUP nope I think I broke
it as a brown person I don't think this
is a good way to thread I would learn it
myself if I were hanging at home also I
feel like thread is just like thank you
by thread it's just thread like you
don't need an extra thing this works it
just hurts it hurts a little bit
pain is beating intense pain sometimes
if you can figure out how to use some of
these like all the power to you a lot of
hair removal gadgets are geared towards
women's insecurities I'm down until I
tried weird Beauty things but they need
to do what they say they're gonna do if
they say pain free I'm expecting pain
free I want the people who invented
these products to use it on themselves
and then give me a call and tell me that
it's pain free I feel like I need to do
my entire arm though so have this bald
patch this patch of my arm
very smooth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
