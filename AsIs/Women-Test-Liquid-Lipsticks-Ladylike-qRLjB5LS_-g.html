me my butthole looks nice it's been one
year since we tried long-wear lipsticks
and since then we have lady tested a lot
of things but it turns out there are
more lipsticks to try there are always
more lipsticks to try its ladylike and
we're testing liquid lipsticks again
test one drink some damn bubble tea
test to kiss a hottie aka a picture of
an old celebrity crush test 3 eat a damn
piece of pizza it's been one year of
lady lichen lady testing and labia
proven it feels like it's been in the
light years since we've tried along wear
lipsticks we've we've come a long way
I remember the shoot a year ago and it
was a crazy ass shoe I think today will
go business no I think I was a test
friend last year I'm super excited to
get back into lipstick Olympics it was
our first Olympics ever is our first
ladylike video ever let's do this I have
NYX lingerie color exotic um my lips
feel really dry already I think it has
to dry a little bit for the color to
really set in I'll tell it kind of
making my lips look wrinkly I feel like
there's a lot of wrinkles on my lips but
I think it'll last a day I have Kat Von
D Lolita lipstick
I can't apply it as gracefully as others
can but I tried my best
I like straight up girl if I ever put
this on no detectable smell kind of feel
like a picture bride all made up nowhere
to go see look this is Jen's first
liquid lipstick experience and we're all
here with her
I have colour-pop ultra matte lip in
beeper I will say that it's not
completely dried down which means it's
kind of comfortable but that makes me
nervous about its chances later on
because it hasn't fully clung to every
little bit of my lip it's you can see a
little on teeth the pizza might take it
down so I have
Kyleigh liquid lipstick in candy k it
looks on my lips pretty similar to how
it looks on the tube which is kind of
nice application was really smooth
Kylie's colors are notorious for staying
on the entire day I'm gonna put that to
the test I like how it looks right now a
lot we'll see how it looks at the end of
the day this is gonna be a hard one I'm
excited test number one drink some damn
bubble tea we chose Bo but because the
straws are usually quite fat if you need
to drink some boba you got to get around
it alright ready okay let's take a look
at my rim yes before I start
okay I'm gonna zoom in yeah so it's a
it's there it's there but I wouldn't say
it's bad Oh looks clean to me from
Belize oh you see crumble ease
are there crumbles oh yeah you can see
the one right here I don't feel hopeless
just yet but there are crumbles and
there are crumbles this is next I'm not
quite dry down which makes it feel nice
but that makes me almost sure that
you'll have a full ring around this bad
boy there we go yeah I kind of want to
lip it a little bit more I will say it's
a little more than Freddie's totally
yeah and it's because I'm a little
wetter than Freddie what okay I have an
iced green tea with boba a patented
favorite I can't be at the bobe's keep
sucking Shanti keep sucking do not stop
whoa
anything a little something there's just
a teeny tiny part just a tinge of dusty
rose my mouth feels okay how how are the
triple lips though I feel a little
wrinkles your bubble looks pretty nice
though oh yeah got a nice button turns
out I got red boba I got I think it's
Tyra it's what it's down the money yes I
don't actually know what that means I
think there's like no it's it's smudge
you can see there's like a little bit
it's very hard to tell even with the
naked eye how does your Buffalo feel let
me tell you I have a terrible diet
I think it's staying on pretty well my
mouth doesn't feel that dry how's the
boba it's really good yeah
your lips do look nice though here's a
really nice very dignified classy thank
you great color test number two kiss a
hottie on the lips
bye hottie I mean I printed out a few
pictures of our early childhood crushes
my childhood crush was none other than
Simba himself my celebrity crush was
Norah Jones circa 2008 of One Tree Hill
Fame mr. Chad Michael Murray JC shows a
was a long lasting one let's say I was
always an NSYNC girl and a JC was number
one in my heart even though JT may be
number one on the charts sea as a child
I definitely was into young Simba
because we were kind of on the same
playing field but a little looking at it
grown man Simba mm-hmm I saw her in an
episode of 30 rock when they were doing
a parody if we are the world
she is the singer that says and only
some of us are drunk I remember her line
oh this is so weird this is about the
size of the poster that I had because I
just ripped it out of a magazine and
then put it on my wall let's see what
the transfer is looking like I thought
this would be less awkward than kissing
a real person but somehow this is way
more awkward hold the back of his head
gently okay
oh I mean yes I've left him a little oh
well a few crumblies but not a ton like
I could definitely like kiss a real
person and it wouldn't be that bad
I've actually somehow placed it
perfectly so that my little bits of
crumbles have ended up where his
mustaches if you tilt it just right and
certain lights you can see the outline
of it but it's it's so very faint um no
I don't see wow
I kissed Norah Jones and no one would
know we hadn't caught it on film there's
no marks nothing Kat Von D stayed on
tight test3 eat some damn pizza the most
delicious of tests it is truly is it
looks fun there's an Olive online
there's also all of our mine and a
mushroom I don't guess you want my
mushroom it's oily it's a
delicious-looking oh it smells so good
shrewd Evan yeah okay Cheers the number
one rule of liquid lipsticks is to avoid
oily foods mm-hmm
sometimes you can't avoid all the food
so we're not gonna stop my life I don't
know about you but I meet I'm surprised
that still lipstick on here I've been
licking my mouth a lot and the pizza
feels like just like our big greasy old
napkin and I didn't realize how dry my
lips felt until oil touched them and it
was just like ah sweet relief sweetly
stir I don't see any transfer though
look see on the paper towels should I
try
old old dab mmm oh yeah yeah more and
more came often in mine than yours
I feel like yours doesn't even look like
it ever got wiped away oh that's too bad
not too shabby but you can see the
entirety of my mouth yes um you know
doing pretty well I just see the inner
yeah it looks like inner rim to me
mm-hmm I learned that in psych 101 at
the end of every study you have to
declare more research is always needed
and so I'm going to follow that
psychological principle my senior year a
psych teacher said that she could always
tell when students had a crush on them
and then she looked directly at me you
okay fire yeah I gave you my mushroom
you didn't even eat it oh well I'm
taking this back where you took it I
wasn't done with my play funk what are
the sad little thing she gave me
trifling I mean did I win let's take a
look see how we did all right let's see
the damage oh it's not bad yes faded
let's biggest the dryness is
definitely quite prominent butthole lip
is it feels super super dry and I feel
like it looks very wrinkly and dry but I
don't I think if you were to just see me
walking on the street you wouldn't say
ooh that girl has dry lips you better
figure it out it looks a little moist
maybe that's the pizza oil I would say
good job on the butt hole factor minimal
minimal butt hole factor I'm impressed
but I did come dead last one every
single test so take that as you will I
want most of the competitions but as
external factors that brought me down
and yen I'm not used to wearing lipstick
I look at my lips a lot I caught myself
kind of like absent minding me biting my
nails at one point - they're just like
lipstick stain on my nails I think at
this point in the day I would have
wanted to reapply just because it feels
a little bit like it's fading a bit but
it's not terrible I'm not mad about it
Nixie did a good job you know I really
think it was a thing was the pizza that
did me and so last year in our inaugural
ladylike video which was testing
lipsticks as well I won today I have to
respectfully death row in myself and
pass along the crown our lips are dry
but our hearts are full and our bellies
are falling yeah oh my absolutely sit in
there like a lump of bricks
despite Jen winning the battles but
losing the war I think we have a clear
winner in Saab yes
with look the best they do they look
quite nice they look very freshly
applied but I came in dead last past I'm
very happy to be the winner but I'm even
happier to have spent one year of all
these gals oh one year show you through
plug it yeah happy one-year anniversary
for one years old oh we have the motor
skills and the potty training of a
one-year-old like a fine cheese we just
get better with time
imagine me by a fireside I'm Ron Swanson
swilling a glass of whiskey with a few
ice cubes in it happy one-year
anniversary ladylike thank you so much
