middle work so the way that it's going
down is that we're gonna try five
different polishes on five different
nails and then we're gonna put them to
the test
all right let's do this let's do it
we're off we're off I call this one what
okay I know this one is really cute
though I like that one like it's kinda
like periwinkle what's the code really
good on your skin tone - oh I'm a pop oh
that's why this looks so nice it's
called irresistible that looks so good
so I really really hope this holds a
because this is cute this is peach
daiquiri did you have a couple of those
last night not to be rude peach daiquiri
but this is definitely a color that my
grandma wears every like she's the type
of visit on her nails her toenails and
her lips also this is like a whole
science experiment what is that well it
comes with a syringe what is this about
to do it looks like it makes the process
easier you like you just no unnecessary
I really like that color
this looks really cute I would wear this
all the time I have good feelings about
flush that looks like a nice brush okay
at first I thought I was gonna hate this
color but I really like this now
it's thick what I like about this is the
brush size this covers a lot of ground
this takes four years to paint I have
never used quick trying nail polish
before I didn't know it was a thing so
I'm like really excited that I found out
about this I haven't used it because I'm
very skeptical of it like nothing is
really quick I usually have my nails
done professionally with gel but once
they chip I do them extremely
unprofessionally by myself and I don't
do what she does which is smart which is
using a these put dry things I just
weigh it every single time
so first test we're gonna do is the
sheet test to see if this will hold up
for like a midnight manicure I already
went a little spurt and you want to feel
I want to give it a little spoon never
snuggle looking before I know first
thing you don't like to do with your
work honestly I don't put anything past
you people anymore ah you want to be a
little spoon no no I just sleep like a
little princess
ah your big spooning with the guy and he
goes like grab your hand let's see if
that works
oh how do you grab it what is that
irresistible is the only one that's most
to me ears this one got rocked about
that the SC quoted or not pass our first
test
mm-hmm now we're gonna try to eat a
crummy bag of chips and we go my hand
all the way just fist it get the right
kick you know oh this is it not pretty
oh this Bad News Bears messy amazing SC
is out of the race or the washing is out
a long time ago
okay well this purple one also peeled
off so what is ya know I'm impressed
though I actually can't really believe
it normally I don't do after I
paint my nails for like an hour and this
is way better
the winner for this Revlon Revlon and
light pink okay for the final test we're
going to try to put our hair up in a
ponytail without pissing up our nails
now this is a big test because it never
works
it never try
yes give it a side turn yeah like whoa
whoo we look to my nails are like I can
do literally anything I've got other
 they're fine I mean the same ones
are fine these two honey kill in it I'm
a huge fan of the Revlon great job this
one is my favorite it's awesome and it's
only thumbs up my favorites on my thumb
toe nails to Nick's gel effect I love
this one ever heard of that I haven't
either but pretty pink and it was so
easy to apply and that's probably my
favorite part it was so easy to apply
and then it got through all the tests it
scored a hundred percent a plus number
one for sure I'd say uh see this was
like that one yeah this did really well
it held up all the tests right away
there's not a single mark on line I
would say Sally Hansen is my favorite
youtube brush size and durability and
despite the small brush and se size
doesn't always matter it still did the
trick it was quick and it's dry it's not
the size is what you do with it so we
went pretty hard on these tests we
definitely exaggerated everything so I'm
sure if we were just to do this normally
without the extreme test they'd all be
perfect I'm like baffled we've literally
only waited 60 seconds that was amazing
I will be getting all fine and polishes
from now on well a hundred percent be
quick dry that's how I Drive my name is
not anymore though we don't have to do
this anymore
we don't have to know this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
