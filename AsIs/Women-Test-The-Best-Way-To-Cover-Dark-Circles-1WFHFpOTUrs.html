had like perfect skin and she didn't
have any hundred icicles I kind of
expected that that would be me too but
unfortunately as I got older I realized
that I was blessed with a bigger range
of genetics and that included under-eye
circles I started noticing my dark
circles like a couple years ago and
started getting like kind of
self-conscious about them I think there
was maybe a time when I was like a
blossoming youth that I didn't have them
and then I think I woke up at like 17
and was like oh I have dark circles it's
just hereditary I wouldn't say I have
major insecurities about my under-eye
circles but it would definitely be great
if they didn't say
this is dermablend I don't think I've
ever used anything dermablend it's got
its shiny silver Dee on it quickfix
concealer full coverage for moderate to
intense skin conditions scars blemishes
age spots dark under-eye circles this is
definitely thicker than what I normally
use but it doesn't feel crazy thick I
like to do one eye first so we can see
how it compares for the people who like
got their concealer it's really hard to
do it with like this type of stick like
this is meant to draw I can't really
feel it on my face it actually it feels
it feels totally fine like I kind of
like it
you're not does it put a lot of pressure
under eye so already if I have to use a
lot of pressure to blend it like maybe
this is the right thing I'm drawing it
on pretty thickly but I don't feel like
I'm using a ton of product every time I
have to say actually pretty like that I
would probably use this it's about
double what I would spend on a drugstore
under-eye concealer I don't know if
that's worth that I think it definitely
covered them up to a natural degree I
like that it kind of blends into the
rest of my skin and it looks pretty
natural
Smashbox color correcting stick does
look less tired very directed what it's
planning to do some system put this on
first and then my foundation over it
glides on which is nice let's do one of
these with people sometimes do it's not
blending great maybe that's why it's
just to put your foundation over it it
definitely feels a little bit harder to
blend out a little crazy there I think
it is doing something actually a little
bit more than I was maybe expecting it's
doing like a really good job of coverage
for sure but it does feel like I'm
wearing a lot I feel like it's like I'm
wearing the color correcting stick does
blend away the circles a little bit more
than my regular routine I wouldn't say
it does a lot I think it did about the
same as like the dermablend let's say
but it's like a two-step process because
you have to put something over it to me
that makes it less intriguing
professional makeup will wonder pencil
it labels itself as concealer eye
brightener reverse lipliner in one
Wow whoo I love trying this because I've
never tried a nude eyeliner this to me
if it has any sort of brightening effect
is actually probably the kind of thing
I'm looking for it I'm just gonna line
my bottom waterline
it is totally super clumping up into my
eyelashes I feel like we've got problems
I mean I can tell that it's going
somewhere right the color is like
between my eyeball color a gay white and
my skin it might be a placebo effect I
don't know I like maybe it's all mental
anyways you know makes me feel like it
was more awake and that's maybe half of
that I would say it doesn't really look
very different from my face without any
makeup on it anyway now that I look at
it more I feel like it does kind of
emphasize the dark circle more I don't
trust this I'm gonna go ahead and put my
money on the line and say it has a
writing effect I think probably when
used in conjunction with a very light
under eye concealer this is the trick
number seven this looks a lot like yeah
okay so this is lipstick oh this
oh no this is that trick oh you don't
trust it at all oh I've seen this trick
on the internet before and this looks
unlike anything I've ever hate this so
much
it goes against everything I know so I'm
gonna blend this in a little bit with
with a brush although it's lipsticks
it's not really doing the blending still
doing this still hate it
I like this lipstick though you like it
please they're mad 90s rave vibe I've
put kind of more on than I think I
normally would but I feel like I have to
it's just like I'm asking this to do
more work all those ads a lot of time
you're making everything more concealer
to conceal we've definitely made a mess
more makeup than I would want do I think
it did a better job than me just
throwing on my regular foundation yeah
if I slept for hours and I had you know
interview with Barbara Walters the next
day sit down and all America's watching
would I use this trick I probably would
this technique is not really work for me
I don't think that this was the best
option in terms of what that did versus
the other regular concealers this is
like about the same the first was
actually my favorite I think I would
choose this one for a lot of reasons for
bucks I think it brightened the eyes
overall I would definitely use the
dermablend just because it seemed like
the product that gave you the most bang
for its buck like you can just put on
the dermablend be concealed and go about
your business
I do think from this exercise I am just
reminded that I am much harsher on
myself than anybody is and really all of
these products are just sort of to make
you look like less tired so maybe just
getting eight hours of sleep is better
than any</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
