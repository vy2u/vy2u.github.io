fine when you're standing still but when
you're in motion it's a completely
different thing I'm a cyclist so I spend
a lot of time on my bike in the gym I'm
really excited about this because sports
rods are like basically my favorite type
of bra I do yoga so I just hope my
nipples don't fall out I have really
high expectations for this this one
looks like lingerie it's like squeezing
me in an effort to push my boobs up I
like this bra it's soft pretty good
support though really like it didn't
really hurt it's like a bra bra not like
a sports bra I feel like we're at
capacity like if the fire marshal came
you probably would kick a few people out
this prana feels like it doesn't even
need me like it's already good to go I'm
literally shocked this bra is awesome
just because I'm wearing Victoria's
Secrets automatically sexier this one's
like a joke when I'm moving around it
all moves together then it has a clasp
like a real bra which is like who wants
to deal with that when I looked at it I
was like oh hell no then I put it on and
I was pleasantly surprised this is not
what I was expecting from this rock
this bra is beautiful but I feel like
it's not something that you could really
wear when you're working out like I
wouldn't want to sweat in it he's a
gorgeous this kind of looks like cat's
cradle
this is the MVP I would buy outfits just
to match this bro
no I actually like the Victoria's Secret
bra better which is a sentence I
literally never thought I would ever say
whoever thought of this must also be
like an engineer it's amazing
this is a mess this is like a Rubik's
Cube it doesn't feel as secure I don't
know I maybe I'm biased cuz it's so cute
I get it like this is the good old
fashioned squish down your boobs and
like pray for the best
but this sucks my boobs look so sad
right now with the slightest movement
I'm like oh it's cute though I think the
shape is cute I like how low the back is
either that's nice I feel very exposed
trading up also if I get cold at all
everyone will know this is pretty nipply
I like ones that have like a funky back
like the Lululemon one my favorite one
was the Nike one because I love the
black but it was also super practical
and kept me together if you had told me
30 minutes ago that my favorite bra was
going to be a Victoria's Secret bra I
would have said you were full of baloney
there are a lot of different kinds of
sports bras and you don't always have to
just pick one out at Target and pay $15
for it I would also just buy that target
seven dollar one the thing I take away
from this is that even if you have some
sort of prejudice against the brand you
should just try it on
[Laughter]
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah you don't know the half of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
