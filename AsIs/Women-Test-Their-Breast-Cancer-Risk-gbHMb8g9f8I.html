genomic test to find out if I have a
gene that links me to increase risk of
breast cancer my maternal grandmother
had breast cancer several people on both
my father's side and my mother's side
have had different cancers and most have
survived from them my mom's side of the
family mostly my grandmother she had
breast cancer and then my cousin had a
cancer scare and she got both of her
breasts removed and it's always been a
fear of mine of like who's next my mom
actually had several types of cancer she
had metastasized breast cancer in the
lungs and then brain cancer primary
brain cancer so I just feel like if you
can test for something like this and
know and maybe just being on top of it
why not
my mom had premenopausal breast cancer
she passed away in 2002 so given my
family history I probably am at
increased risk for breast cancer anyways
so this I guess would just sort of
confirm that even more
a month ago my mom was diagnosed with
stage 1 ovarian cancer but they only
caught it because my grandma forced her
to get a colonoscopy just makes me think
like always go to the doctor always get
the test I worry about getting cancer
getting sick just like anyone but I
think especially because I've lived and
seen it happened to someone and it's
scary for sure but we know more than
we've ever known as well and I don't
know if this is like a Latino thing but
like we hate going to the doctor if I
have the opportunity to do this and this
important information they give to my
family then I'm happy to do it and
taking the tests for my own like
personal health and safety and peace of
mind I know like treatments have gotten
a lot better now and it's not as it's
really a death sentence but still scares
the out of me color is a
personalized health service that helps
analyze an individual's risk for the
eight most common types of hereditary
cancer so this is the test fill this up
with saliva oh so the test itself
analyzes 30 different genes or DNA if
someone has a change or a what we call a
mutation it can really impact a person's
cancer risk and hopefully help us
identify those cancers at a very early
treatable stage or even help prevent
those cancers from happening for science
having a mutation does not mean that an
individual has cancer or will get cancer
it just means that their risk for
certain cancers are increased about 12%
of all women will develop breast cancer
over their lifetime so taking the color
test can really impact a woman's breast
cancer risk and how that woman is
screened and treated over time so now
this gets shipped off and in a few easy
weeks
I'll get my results back good luck
all right as they said your results were
negative meaning we didn't find any
mutations or changes and any of the 30
genes that we tested for that's great oh
yeah yeah I'm really I'm really pleased
my mom recently had a scare with ovarian
cancer which I didn't know how rare it
was until we talked about that today
yeah so just because you tested negative
for these gene mutations that doesn't
mean that your mom can't have a mutation
in one of those genes that you just did
not inherit from her still important for
her to get tested and to learn about her
risk yeah but it's good that this yeah
this is good your results came back with
no mutations identified in any of the 30
genes that we tested for cool I was
really nervous but um this is nice to
know my mom didn't have the breast
cancer gene either but she still got
breast cancer so for me I think you know
I wouldn't start the mammograms at 40 it
would I would start a little earlier
than that your color test came back
showing no mutations in any of the 30
genes so it's still possible that say
your mom or cousin or grandmother could
have a mutation that increased their
risk definitely going to be a
conversation to have with them so Katie
when we did the color test on your
sample we did not find any mutations
identified in any of the 30 genes it's
really good news my mom had
premenopausal breast cancer um so I
think I was a particularly worried that
I might test positive in a weird way
maybe I wasn't going to be that upset if
I did because I would have like learned
something about her you know getting
able to like link it to something
might've been good so given your
mother's history we talked about that
your risk of breast cancer may be
slightly increased and you were talking
about starting cancer screening at an
earlier age which i think is something
that's a good option for you and to talk
to your doctor about for sure
I was surprised by this experience it's
amazing like how far we've come and how
much that they can tell I was really
happy to find out that my tests were not
positive it's actually a big relief I'm
really glad I did this it's just good to
know for peace of mind I don't have it
kind of looming over a big question mark
this process was good I think it helped
me think a lot more critically about my
health it wasn't as scary as I thought
it could have been I think because I
didn't realize really the gravity of
what I was doing so I'm not very close
with my grandma so I kind of got inside
of her head and it made me want to reach
out to her more because I don't really
talk to her I think it's important for
like anyone to take the test just to be
informed you don't want to have to treat
the problem you want to be able to make
sure it doesn't happen in the first
place so this is a really good start I
think
