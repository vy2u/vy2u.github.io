know this is really good coverage oh
I've had pretty bad acne for a very long
time I feel like I have uneven skin just
because of where I'm from in terms of my
dark circles I'm a mom
I started getting vitiligo around 1415
I've never really found anything that
like fully covers all my acne all my
scars it makes me feel like really
confident throughout the entire day I
actually don't do anything for my dark
circles I am very proud of them I've
tried literally every single concealer
you can think of every shade that they
have oh that's interesting I feel like
I'm in fourth grade and I have those
colored pins and I'm annoying my teacher
yes yeah yeah this straight-up smells
like I'm going to Cabo
I figured that okay not bad really good
coverage though overall not terrible it
doesn't smell good but the results are
in bed so I'm not mad I might use it
again they put some shiny stuff in here
to make it deflect the light from these
dark areas doesn't have any like colored
spheres it doesn't feel heavy it's very
lightweight I can say I've heard this
one's pretty heavy-duty this applicators
like a lipstick I've used dermablend
before I've used it when I was younger
when I first started doing makeup and I
hated it so women of color I have
extremely oily skin and I never knew how
to put it on correctly I will put on in
the morning by like 12 an afternoon my
face will be like coal oil pad I'm not
the fry some chicken on my face this
one's pretty thick it's not as like
gooey as the other ones never been has
the undertone of red so right now I'm
not oh yeah this cover is really well
but it might make me break out
I'd have to test this out for a week or
so to make sure didn't cause any
breakouts but if it didn't this would
work really well I don't know I feel
like I still have dark circles I think
it makes me look sleepy actually it's
heavy it feels like I already have on
foundation so the coverage is like a lot
it's a no finish on tape sashay away
that you can't be
super excited about things because
they're like knives got a lot of stuff
to cover up okay this is definitely my
color feels very light which I like well
I have vitiligo of course but you
shouldn't let everybody know that you
can't do makeup couldn't have vitiligo
it's very sheer and it's super light if
I put like a layer of foundation over it
it would look better but just the
concealer alone isn't doing much it's
definitely illuminating it also felt
like I could probably just go with this
alone it is full coverage but take
longer to dry again my life the bottle
it's very fancy it seems like they're
applicators a little bit more intuitive
oh definitely full coverage this almost
feels more like a foundation it's a lot
thicker than the other ones oh my god it
smells amazing smells like flowers
this color is popping like a cardi B
will face this covers really well I
actually really like this I think cuz
it's a little thicker and I need
something that's a little thicker
look this is like a lot easier to do I
feel good with this one there's like
highlights in it that kind of deflect
the light everywhere else okay this is
the best so far tart I underestimated
you before and you don't even see a
fertilizer this is really good coverage
I'm gonna have to go with the tart feels
a little bit lighter I got really good
coverage this is the one I would keep in
my makeup bag you go over there my
favorite was the NARS radiant creamy
concealer it was just really really easy
to apply I just felt like five years
younger maybe ten I love it the cover
food is like totally awesome and it
covered by little I go even though I
love other than I go but you know I got
a look you want to speak so tart you one
for me honey
I'm really the only person who notices
my skin that's not what anyone's ever
thinking about when they're looking at
me and so makeup helps me feel more
confident about it but I don't actually
need it I always tell people you don't
have to wear makeup I love the skin I'm
in I never wear makeup on a regular day
unless I'm going out I just enhance some
do because I'm cute I'm gonna do eye
makeup tomorrow just cuz I like tart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
