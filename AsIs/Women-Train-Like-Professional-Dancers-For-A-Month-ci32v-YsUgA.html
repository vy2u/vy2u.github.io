long haired dancer and I do not emulate
that at all big ideas are so hard you
want over a million people to see you
what you just do is that ready but I
want you to get excited these ladies
have trained for an entire month just to
perform for you right now so give it up
and let's hear it
the next month we're going to learn how
to dance like a professional dance crew
I'm so nervous already and it hasn't
even started yet why did you get me into
this we'll be training three times a
week leading up to a huge final
performance in front of our whole office
when I think of the professional dancers
you see on shows like So You Think You
Can Dance
or America's Best Dance Crew I think
perfection empowered flawless we are not
going to be as perfect or as beautiful
we're gonna try I am not good at dancing
but because of my athletic background I
do have a fair amount of body awareness
growing up dance was my entire life to
get even as percentage of what I used to
be able to do back would be really fun
I've always wanted to take dance classes
but I've been super nervous because
everybody in these classes looks like
they know what the hell they're doing I
want to learn how to have the artfulness
and confidence of a dancer with my own
body
I could barely just do a presentation at
work let alone get in front of all my
co-workers and dance in front of it
we're coming I hear them I just want to
be able to just get out there and be
awesome and be confident let's dance
on the first day we get to the studio
and I really really excited hey guys I'm
Robert I used to be a former dancer in
the industry Roberts a great teacher
he's no-nonsense which reminds me of all
of the dance teachers I've ever had
today is a little bit orientation kind
of like a consultation great so you're
just trying to figure out if we suck or
not these girls coming from javi against
a Crown Vic you look nervous
might not retain quarter feet as fast as
needed since you miss Kelsey said you
are very confident and your skills you
start the dance left
want a step boom and then you're like
bring it down our group seems like we're
picking it up fast so I'm really happy
switch switch up right left hit down Oh
first dance practice down he did it I
was scared that I was gonna walk away
from this being like what the hell did I
get myself into but honestly I think it
was gonna be a blast today just got so
real learning the moves is one thing and
the cleaning day is a completely
different story we are going to run to
the dance I want to see the practice
there's smaller bodies than mine their
bodies and how they move compared to my
body and how it moves like it's not the
same Robert is constantly saying be sexy
in the face make it believable energy
the performance just because you're
doing a dance doesn't mean you're
executing it well look how I am look how
high you guys are stop being babies I'm
skeptical Robert is asking us to do a
lot of things with our bodies that I
don't know that my body could do we all
were struggling with it we all felt
really insecure about it when you see
like we offers backup dancers do this
they're hard to shake our essence like
that they look great
hopefully that comes with time but I
don't know that it will your
shortchanging yourself you need to be
confident in what you're doing
I really don't think my body can move in
the way they want me to go to rehearsal
situation wise hump it up I thought it
was just me one dance one song that's it
Robert brings out the chairs and I
already know it's coming it's very
sensual it's very intimate you know just
I am worried that I will come off as too
 I want to be sexy but my body is
not doing that be sexy I don't even know
what that looks like yeah I really like
the beginning I can see you're more
confident with that to them as opposed
to the chair stuff to try to carry that
confidence throughout just keep it you
know constant like high level the whole
time we're starting a new dance next
week you guys need to come Monday
knowing a I don't need to keep
repeating myself anymore when you're
training for a show or you're on tour
you don't get to take days off so we
don't get to take days off either time
is of the essence we three we learned
the third part of the dance little did I
know what was the core the movements are
fast they are specific at this point I'm
wondering if I will ever be able to do
the dance moves and remember them and be
clean
all at once hey guys so it's and the
week three next week we do perform
Robert brings in Jamil who has actually
shared the stage with Beyonce and it was
probably the most nerve-wracking thing
I've done I'm currently the dance
captain for Backstreet Boys Las Vegas
show damn I've also worked with jaquail
night Chuck Maldonado Anthony Burrell
it's not fun for any dancer to come and
critique us let alone someone with this
much experience let's see what you all
got he sits in the chair and watches us
perform
honestly I feel like we had to look like
 you want over a million people to
see you what'd you just do is that ready
immediately he knows where all of our
insecurities are there's a difference
between sexy and it's there
you know so just take it back a little
bit I did love dance and I still do but
it is hard having your body critiqued
constantly I have found a problem I did
not think would be a problem and that's
my face Jordan you have really really
distinguishable eyebrows so just watch
your face a little bit you're a
different body type you have to go
harder because people are looking at you
everybody to me it looks like beautiful
long haired dancers like how you're
supposed to look and I do not emulate
that at all
halfway through her cyl I went to the
bathroom and just bawled my eyes out he
gets to me and he says you are so pretty
but I was expecting more I'm looking at
her but I want her to do something to
keep me looking at her I want you to be
a little bit more risky I think my key
is not to just try to make myself more
confident but be another version of
myself that honestly has not existed up
until this point you need to immediately
be like you can't be this person
whatever it is that's holding you back
let it go so this past weekend we all
went out dancing and then we all realize
I think oh whoa we actually can move you
know we actually can't have fun while
we're dancing it doesn't have to be
super serious it was just really great
because it reminded me why I like
dancing I could
be more proud to share this stage with
all these really incredible women and to
be one of them is just going to be such
an honor I'm at work right now and I
just realized that we're performing this
week it just hit me right now
before we go up I sit and tell myself
Jasmine you've got this to know that
people are going to watch me and compare
me and judge me it's just terrifying
what are you excited to see today I want
to see a lot of heart and I want to see
a lot of sex the bootys got to be on
point honestly I'm looking for facial
expressions it's all in the face people
are in the upstairs portion or going up
the stairs is on to the balcony where -
I'm gonna throw up at this point we've
been through the trenches together we
know we're gonna make it to the other
side together give it up
I go on stage and immediately the crowd
starts making noises and I like zero in
and I'm feeling for you here people were
loving it they didn't know from this up
or not that energy was so contagious
I have a hard time accessing sexiness
because I'm from a really conservative
family just putting on the costume makes
me feel okay just maybe I can pull this
off dancing with a crowd in front of me
is nerve-wracking but at the same time
like at least I'm not looking at myself
in front of those mirrors you're like
judging yourself you're looking at
yourself
I've run these people I was like honey
I'm about to work it it's just very
gratifying to show off your hard work -
you may be right
it's amazing catharsis of hard work
passion in teamwork community
nice
I've always had respect for dancers and
the commitment but I forgot the mental
game the toll is not just on your body
it's emotional too I kind of found my
sexy empowered alter-ego I went into
this challenge wanting to feel more
comfortable with my sexuality and I
definitely came out on the other side
learning a lot about Who I am and the
limits that I impose on myself this
whole month was just a big learning
experience about just myself and my body
and comparing it to others is not ever
like ever the way to go about things I
wanted to come out of this challenge
feeling like a more confident person and
there's a lot of self-doubt when you're
doing it but then it's all worth it in
the end
