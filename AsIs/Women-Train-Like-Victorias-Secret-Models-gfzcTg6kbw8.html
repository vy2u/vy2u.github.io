when I was younger I always wanted the
body of a Victoria's Secret model when I
think of a Victoria's Secret models body
I think long lean toned I haven't really
watched the runway show too many times
mainly because when I watch it it makes
me feel a little bit uncomfortable about
my own body for the next week we're
going to be training like Victoria's
Secret Angels to get an experience as
close to the models as possible we will
attend a full week of workouts with
model trainer Steve zoom post one
workout exercise on Instagram every day
to keep us accountable to all of the
workouts as a team together just like
the models do hi I'm Steve zoom I crane
models from a reclaimed glamour Elle
Cosmo Vogue and the Victoria's Secret
runway show this we're gonna train for a
look this is not really about function
this is about looking awesome so the
first day that we met with Steve it was
right after Thanksgiving so I had not
been working out and I hadn't been
eating right it really took a toll on me
I feel like I've been some kind of Fifty
Shades of Grey situation
look
even though in the past I've trained for
function this time we were working a lot
lengthening and defining very specific
muscles shows that model behavior
workouts were totally effective
ho-hold now come in go open I was really
really sore all week it's 7:00 at night
we're gonna be here till 9:00 it's so
hard to be back it must be so different
for the models when this is their
full-time job I just realized I have to
Instagram photos of me and my workout
clothes like for a week but I only have
a certain amount of workout clothes
I wonder Victoria Secret models just
have endless workout clothes that they
never have to like repeat outfits and
photos Kelsey and I recreated this one
photo and when I looked at it I couldn't
help but notice all the things that I
don't like about my legs it's so
frustrating because these models post on
their instagrams
and they look perfect because that's
their job to look perfect usually when
I'm training I have this specific goal
in mind um oh if I do this it'll make me
faster when I run or stronger it feels
weird to have a goal of if I do this
I'll look better I don't use very heavy
weights because heavy weights tend to
bulk the muscle you want a nice lean
long look like today we spent 20 minutes
just working on posture alone for a
runway walk or everybody goes out in the
runway I teach in this one trip right
now I feel a new level of awareness for
my posture standing here even right now
I'm just like trying to keep my
shoulders together now
walk for
whoa your bathroom I'm getting it stuck
yeah calling you back
midway through the week got easier and
harder I just want to go eat but instead
I'm gonna go work out it was easier
because I was already starting to get in
a habit of coming and working out which
was nice it was super super nice to work
out with a friend how do you feel a
shell because you had someone to root
for you and you had someone to you know
look over and commiserate with we
definitely ramped it up you don't let up
on us Steve oh no I feel like we're
completely different people right now
feel better I feel better than we came
here awake and happier if you'd asked me
how I felt yesterday about the week I
would tell you that I was exhausted and
really happy for it to be over but now
that it is over I really wanted to it
again it was actually really nice for
both me and my body I feel healthier I
feel happier by the end of the week I
was really surprised with the results
even though we only did this challenge
for seven days
I could totally feel more definition
throughout my body I was feeling excited
to go to the gym going into this
challenge I had this perspective that
models are born the way they are and in
some ways they are I can't change how
tall I am no matter how much I workout
however I do have a lot more respect for
them and the work that they put in the
gym to perform on a runway I just have a
lot more respect for all the hard work
that goes into sculpting their body
being positive about your own body
there's nothing wrong with that keeping
yourself accountable using Instagram or
social media or friends or however is a
great thing so if you find yourself
comparing yourself to these mom
know that it's an unfair comparison
there are lots of different body types
and all of them are beautiful for their
different reasons
