Sir John I'm celebrity makeup artist for
L'Oreal Paris and we're gonna go into
the 1950s Dorothy Dandridge
so the 1950s were all about a cool
naturalness and there was just
sophisticated vibe that Dorothy
Dandridge and Marilyn Monroe sort of
embodied or encompass it was all about
being an aristocrat or pulling away from
such made-up costumes as the 1920s and
30s
one thing that was cool about Dorothy
Dandridge is the fact that she was a
beautiful woman in that time pair you
don't need a lot of makeup there were
the beginning of the woke up like this
brows are really expressive and a lot of
people don't think that they can use
brows as a statement for brows are just
as much of a statement as a red lip when
you want to appear a bit more youthful
and do some of that those retro vibes
and give yourself a bit a bigger brow
and then we're gonna give her this
beautifully big red fifties red lip for
the nineteen fifties to what you want to
make sure that you do is embrace the
orange base reds all about the lip is
about soft eye and the focus is also on
a very voluptuous problem
so the 70s were all about tons of
glamour there was a social revolution
happening that was indicative of what
was happening also it plays directly
into fashion and beauty you know when
we're burning the bras I didn't want to
have to necessarily feel constricted at
60 in the 50s and it cascaded down to
the late seventies which happened to be
all about glamour you know there was a
lot of money there was a lot of access I
only had a few big huge dough Bambi eyes
so we want to make her individual lashes
almost look like they're on steroids and
we're gonna go and give her massive
amounts of mascara if you want to
imitate a doe-eyed beauty like Diana you
do more mascara or individual lashes in
the center of your eye and that makes
your eyes appear brighter and bigger
lavender it was usually a color that was
worn by old women purple was a big huge
color in sevens and it looks great on
women of color it was screams nighttime
just going out is sort of screams disco
it's really cool about this look is the
fact that monochromatic makeup is all
about a scale so making sure that you
have all shades of brown all shades of
taupe or whatever color you're gonna use
making sure you have a variation in that
tone so we did smokey eyes and a warm
brown I'm Matt warm lip use the same
color as the lips on her eyes and this
has been very a la Lauren hip for women
of color it were Naomi Campbell for sure
Lauren Hill baby bury me alone oh those
are the 298 girls we're gonna contour up
a bit more and then give you a little
bit of 95 which the contour we're not
gonna do a lot of blush 90 wasn't about
a lot of blush it was so minimal it was
just really about embracing your the
beauty you were born with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
