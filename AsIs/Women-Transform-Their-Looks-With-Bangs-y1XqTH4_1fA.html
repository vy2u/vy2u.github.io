hipsters and like right and yeah I kind
of want to be that I generally avoid
getting bangs because I already have a
young face and bangs tend to make you
look younger
mostly shrinkage has prevented me from
getting bangs knowing that the bang that
is mostly going to be longer when it
straight is going to be half the size
when it's curly worried about that a
little bit I hope that was getting bangs
I kind of am pushing myself out of my
style comfort zone and doing something
different I'm Tiffany Lee and I'm a slow
reader stylist I think many women are
afraid of getting bangs because they
feel that there's a certain type of
person that could wear bangs but really
the great part about this whole
transformation is that they get to see
that it really can be worn on them as
well either you see like really bad
bangs or you see someone that just looks
like so badass and cool with them and I
kind of feel like I'm in-between that I
think I just need to like have that
confidence in myself I would say that I
wear my hair half curly half straight at
the time I'm really looking for side
bangs I've always been sort of
self-conscious and hoping that I get
things that sort of reflect my age and
look mature I don't know if I can pull
this off
but I'm really excited to see how it
turns out I got butterflies in my
stomach I'm ready to see your new
transformation oh oh my god I love it oh
wow it shapes my face differently and
I'm excited it's exactly what I wanted I
look playful without looking too young
and I'll be enough it really feels right
on me I think that my new haircut says
that I am very excited and willing and
open to take on la I wanted to like
challenge myself
style wise and have a little confidence
boost and definitely feel like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
