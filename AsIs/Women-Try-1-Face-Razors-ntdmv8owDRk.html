look like Santa Claus right now I have
like very dark hair and I have a lot of
it because I'm South Asian and we're
hairy people my mom used to make me wax
my mustache all through middle school in
high school but then I decided that as
an adult I like to save money
I usually go threading and I do it every
month I just dislike the pain because
like press down your skin and I get like
this red rash when I thread I use razors
on my face I use a Venus razor for my
legs and my hair grows back very very
fast so I shave every day I do use one
shaver and it's a small thin one that I
get at CVS and I use it to like shave my
moustache hairs or sometimes like my
eyebrows my list of priorities are
definitely price effectiveness and
comfort if it doesn't leave me a rash
that's great because my skin tends to be
really sensitive
I definitely look for convenience way
more than the price trimmers eyebrow and
bikini line why I don't know you could
shave your bikini with these things hmm
this looks interesting
I mean I like that there's three because
you're not supposed to use the same one
ton it's so as you can do with absolute
precision place trimmer evenly do not
press too hard and shave against the
direction of the hair growth
I've always wondered like do you shave
with or against because there are
opposite people telling the opposite
faces
okay here we go bye-bye arm hair mmm
feel like I'm doing a science experiment
coming off you got to do like a couple
strokes to get in there but getting the
job done even my longer hairs are coming
off oh look look at that look at all
that hair she's disappearing clearing
the forest and there's no redness it's
just slowly coming off
I can see little hairs all right that's
like pretty good okay I just shaped like
a big hole in my arm there's definitely
a difference in the skin color on my arm
but it's doing a really great job it's
like a lot of hair there
you guys can save that for later make a
coat never have a felt more attractive
than right now coming out I see the
little hairs I'm not gonna use shaving
cream I put lotion on this morning
that's good enough
oh yeah comes off real nice mm-hmm feel
like a barber it's nice because it's
like the exact length of like the space
between my eyebrows I can hear the hair
is slowly coming out as I shave this
down now the stache it's so hard because
your mouth is such a weird shape you
know it's not like a leg or it's just
like one angle the whole time it seems
to have worked my skin feels pretty
smooth right now oh yeah it works pretty
nicely over here I like that you know
it's really smooth and easy and it's
like my skin isn't even red right now
look at all that hair
disappearing yeah that's like a pretty
good difference I think I'm a new woman
looks clean Carol is she look it just
makes it really weird like sound it's
just like but it's very satisfying
because you're like I'm getting rid of
shit I think I definitely like this
better than the other like face raisers
that I've used in the past because it
has a shorter blade it makes it easier
to use on certain parts of your face
like getting in little nooks and
crannies my skin feels very soft it's
not red not even a dollar it's just
$0.99 if three are 99 cents that's great
I bought toothbrushes that are like five
dollars I think it's just nice that
stuff like this exists
I remember being 12 and like taking a
leg razor to my face because I was so
self-conscious about my hair and it's
nice to like there's something safe and
very affordable to use nowadays
