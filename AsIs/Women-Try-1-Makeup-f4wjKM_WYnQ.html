god this is good makeup JK it's not I'm
embarrassed to say how much rice five
dog makeup pretty much a makeup hoe I
will put out for like any kind of
product the dollar store is legit the
dollar store is the place to be
I'm excited but I feel like we're gonna
look real changes best-case scenario we
find stuff that we'd actually gonna use
in our real life but I'm not counting on
it
I want to take back everything I said
about the dollar because I had no
 clue they had makeup like this
this was legit I'm immediately
impressed by the packaging for some
reason I thought I was gonna be like
Barbie Kid kits all of this just three
dollars is insane apparently we got the
two darkest foundations and these aren't
super dark on the scale of darkness of
people of color like I'm not even that
dark so that this is like what the
darkest like that actually might be
better on me I'm gonna be looking a
little bit pale but you know what we
can't win them all we're gonna make this
work
it's not even blending oh my god wait
like what I'm so shiny I feel so shy
don't talk to me I really like this
palette the colors are really pretty I
like more cream based eyeshadows but is
for powder this is good I'm impressed
you know it's legit when it comes with
these like plenty I thought we graduated
I'm most genius about this eyebrow
pencil we'll see oh my god I don't hate
it I can make this work I'm gonna be
such a more bad time than you I'm really
in love with this eyebrow pencil
actually it's easy to put on this won't
retract so this is now all this is this
eyeliner is my favorite thing so far
maybe it won't stay on but you know what
I'm diggin it this is the mineral blush
oh it's not bad okay I don't think
that's nice
wanna set this and then I'm gonna hold
out my last hope on the lips I just
smelled plastics
it's like alcohol yeah ah how do you
feel do you feel sick no I feel wet cool
and not in the good way
keep out of eyes and mouth well I didn't
have a choice hmm this literally feels
like I'm painting my lips with a colors
marker now looks nice though
you know what the lip actually has quite
a good me to it after all that terror I
just went through it was kind of worth
it to discover this lip that's not great
I think you look expensive
I would not guess that you have a dollar
store makeup on there were some really
good things here I have this bronzer I
let I love and it's like 60 bucks and
it's pretty much the same so like
that how do we look I think internet I
think we like you
your eyes look amazing Thanks and the
highlight doesn't look bad either
you look like decent why do I look like
a monster on a set myself be careful I'm
getting your eyes mouth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
