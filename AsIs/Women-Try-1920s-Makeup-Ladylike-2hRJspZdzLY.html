okay first of all what is this accent
you kind of he's a transatlantic accent
1920s actresses I'm not gonna be able to
keep it up just let me have it for the
pre interviews we're a trying 19 toys
makeup and we are also going to be
living like when the 1920s Janice the
1920s cell phones were invented yet
Darren well you know what I walked in
and I said oh I didn't know we're
supposed to bring wardrobe in sauces we
were love his look would wear this look
very thin brows yeah sort of like the
thin sort of equal thickness brow I feel
like she might suffer from RBF as do i
RBF is resting bitchface okay I'm not
mad it's just my face she's got a very
like sort of pronounced Cupid's bow it's
kind of like the bum bum I don't have a
Cupid's bow just like I don't have you
are wrong they may not be this shape but
you have them this is my Cupid's bow I'm
done with you before looking at these
lovely photos I don't really know much
about 1920s makeup trends to think that
back in the 1920s before animals existed
but they had makeup what are the odds
what is this this is so cool it should
be called a mascara chocolate cuz that's
what I looks like looks like a block of
charcoal with which used to brush your
teeth back in the olden days you are
just a history fact machine today I give
I'm here so I'm gonna take my brush dip
it in the water and then scrape it
against this little cake wait how am I
already making a mess the problem is
just that you have to dip it in water
first and so it's like watercolor paint
yeah you know how like the little like
paint-by-numbers thing you definitely
have to find a balance between the right
amount of
cuz it's so watery yeah it's just
separating my lashes and making them a
little bit darker and I think this is my
favorite mascara I might have ever tried
in my whole life talked a lot of crap
about 37 seconds ago but now I think I'm
in it's so lightweight and dainty and
pretty this is a modern brow pencil I'm
gonna use it though to try and emulate
the not so modern very thin brow look
listen I'm pretty far down this rabbit
hole being in character already so I'm
gonna use my real new timey concealer
and try and carve out some brows even
though I'm not very good at this part
yeah but this doesn't look good at all
that's you've got the look Jen I've got
the look translucent blush translucent
excuse you that's interesting this looks
like a sundial see um
please twist oh I didn't say anything
Freddie don't look at me it's like a
clue that you would find a national
treasure there like with these key oh
wow it's very fallout II that'll fall
that's a Fall Out Boy okay shall we
mm-hm
we also do children's birthday parties
graduations tyrant parties anything okay
so this is the thing yeah I want you to
wear this time why I want you to venture
into a bright-red whenever it's a fresh
lipstick don't you just want to bite it
off though yeah well what did the Jen do
that agenda this is Jen you want to get
the most coverage as possible so you do
really wide strokes so I don't have a
Cupid's bow so I'll just be drawing on a
qisas oh you have a Cupid's bow Freddie
something like that carnie should wear
bright red marker
hush Devin I'm really going for that
whole jinx the Pokemon look I think he
did it I think that if I was able to do
my normal cat eye I would like this red
lipstick it's kind of like soft pink
skinny eyebrow red lip pink one thing
that they haven't changed is just that
they still got to be perfect you know
like her pictures and her headshots her
makeup was perfect much like Aunt Peggy
here I'm pretty surprised about how easy
some of these things were to use like I
was anticipating this lump of coal to be
difficult to you know making some
mascara or eyeliner but was actually
pretty simple I think I did an amazing
job here I think that Gloria Swanson
would have been entirely forgotten once
I made my way onto that's great I feel
like we're about to go to a murder
mystery parties and it's super fun yeah
exactly it's a very fun thing that we're
doing would I in earnest walk around
like this probably not no but you know
it wouldn't be the worst thing I've ever
done and Peggy self-esteem history I
have so many gentleman callers and I do
not have any polio if you can believe
that in this day and age lots of
gentleman callers know polio hey y'all
click on that put us over there see more
videos from our channel some of our
favorites are in there and some we like
just okay but watch anyway because he
loved you
yeah completely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
