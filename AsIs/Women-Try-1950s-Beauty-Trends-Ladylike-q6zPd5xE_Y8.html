you reflect about my past my present
what's going on over there huh today
we're trying skincare from the 1950s
feel like skincare has gotten so like
overwhelming as the time goes back then
they probably kept it pretty oh gee kept
it pretty simple I feel like in the
fifties it was either don't get wrinkles
or don't get acne is it what is the
phrase cleanliness is godliness yes I
grab scrub down their face scrub it same
principles probably exist people just
wanting to look their best but I think
I've just gotten a lot more fussy about
it the only thing I think of when I
think of the nineteen fifties is cold
cream which I do use to this day
cold cream I love cold cream I use cold
cream every single night it's a very
grandma thing to do but that's a type of
person I am so I know from my mom that
she used to use like olive oil to take
her eye makeup off but again I think
that might just be Sharon Lydell thing
and not like in 1950s thing yeah there
probably was a mom who was just like
well I use jello to get my makeup okay
another mom was just like you probably
should use cold cream instead and I was
like I bathe in milk yeah instead of
taking off just our eye makeup
apparently we have to take off
everything that's cold cream okay I've
done that you have yeah I've dabbled in
just putting it everywhere just to speed
up the process you know whenever I see
people in movies putting on cold cream
I'm always just like girl your t-zone
hates you okay so I have a theory that
cold cream doesn't actually take off all
your makeup I already see it working
what I see it at work how do you see
because it's spreading around the
foundation ruler yeah it's at work how
did our mothers do it though there's
still a fair amount of makeup coming off
my face I'm not gonna look at that way
okay so our first skincare tips from
Audrey Hepburn ooh
she used to steam her face deme her face
to open up her pores sorry so we're just
gonna hide under here for a while I mean
Audrey Hepburn sistine your face you
seen your damn face I wish I was just
kind of like steamed and naked right now
I just wish I was naked right now
I do feel great though the next skincare
tip from the 1950s is to actually
submerge your face in hot water you have
a shallow camp Marilyn Monroe was the
person who came up with this fat boy tip
I understood steaming your pores I
really don't understand putting your
face in hot water other than a torture
tactic we just differ a whole little
faces in there that's too hot too hot I
can't do it I don't know it's so hard
for me I'm taking baths before I've
taken showers I've sweated oh why all of
a sudden unable to my face I wanted
babies I do feel like this is some kind
of weird baptism of new skin we're going
to now wash our faces with bar soap
because that's what they did in the 50s
and this is the brand that Jackie
Onassis used I'm on board with that
classy lady
$45 of soap man yeah you got to be
precious with that I haven't used a bar
soap since I was five
like my grandma want to look at this and
been like my soap with eight soaps press
together yeah terrible idea
nice to splash my face 20 times 20 times
not 19 splash yourself in the face 20
times until you go and say 100 K well I
definitely feel pleased Devon keep
shining eyes are doing it to detox
well I think I feel clean well I feel
good yeah Devon you still have ten more
times ago I don't want to do it look at
my skin isn't felt this clean and a long
time my entire body is covered in water
but my skin is doing fantastic we are
rounding out this whole regiment with
this eight hour cream soothe dry hands
and smooth cuticles and mail this is
like basically the Windex of
moisturizers yeah it feels like we're
about to be rubbing blisters all over
our skin it feels like lip gloss all
over your face mm-hmm it's the best way
to describe it it's quite greasy it's
quite oily it smells like something that
your mom would slap on your chest when
you have a cold yeah then again they
smoke cigarettes a lot better definitely
not something I would do every day I
would do it on like a cold winter's
night the 50s man crazy times crazy
times to be alive yeah there are a lot
of steps but I feel good like I think my
face feels like it was worth all the
effort I feel refreshed yeah I feel
revitalized so 1950 skincare lady tested
lady approves lady approved what they
also did back then
get this was to put cold cream on as a
primer that note got online somewhere
I'm done with that thank you so much for
