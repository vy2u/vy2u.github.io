we're gonna try a posture improving bra
I'm looking to alleviate some lower back
pain
I have degeneration of basically my
whole back so my bones and my ligaments
are just kind of slowly but surely
grinding away and wearing at a faster
rate than other people so I don't have
that for me I don't really have an
excuse for my posture so I really should
just be doing this this is the standard
if you want let's do it again I feel
like it's gonna be like Regina George's
like headpiece these are like sports
bras wait how is this don't work I don't
feel any wires it allows you to use the
natural strength of your back to support
your front so you can stand tall I don't
have any strength in my back that's why
I'm here yes let's do it
activated and ready to go so it's day
one with the bra it's all activated I'm
feeling pretty good one problem I'm
running into right now is that I don't
have much outfits that go all the way up
here today I am choosing to pair my
intelliscan bra with a crewneck
sweatshirt because that's all I can
manage all right Regina how do you feel
this prong keeps writing up every five
minutes I call my shoulders just pushy
do
maybe we didn't activate it right no I
activated honey I activated annoying is
such a chore to do this right now it's
here and it should be here yeah
so if we're talking about it being
practical
I'm a check I've known that box but I
will say that it has made me think a lot
about my posture yeah I keep having to
readjust my shoulders check up on me
I'll check it when he you not check up
on me I got you okay we got each other I
saw her a couple seconds ago and she has
actually and then right when I press
record she was like that is a damn lie
what kind of push through this is like a
cool but you're posh look at the shape
of your body does my posture look good
yeah it's really good it really does
stand up straight sweetie yeah I'm not
used to that training bra
this is what happens every 10 minutes so
if I can literally have to activate
every 10 minutes so inconvenient you
know I like to spice up my life I like
to wear cute stuff new stuff venture out
but button up it is so I'm in there
and actually hurts my back to snow so
I've been like working with this
I hope it's a good sign I think it is
it's off finally freaking off you can
stay there I don't want you anymore I
don't know if it's because I've been
more aware or insistence brah I'm gonna
say it's a little bit of both but I have
had less pain than I have in the last
one six months I don't think I'd wear
this bra every day but on the days where
my back's hurting a little bit and I
need a little bit of relief I'll
definitely put the bra so if you're
really committed to making that change
miss pross for you I'm like Dean she was
pretty lazy
first of all Regina in a pot upside down
support me while I act it out this is
you this is Regina is this someone who's
serious about their posture I think not
don't lie to these people we both had a
hard time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
