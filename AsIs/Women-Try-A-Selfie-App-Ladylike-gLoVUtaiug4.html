hard to resist the allure of a good
selfie especially if your makeups on
point
but sometimes you just don't have the
time to perfect that cat eye or contour
those cheeks in those situations would
it be worth it to digitally powder your
nose its ladylike and today we're trying
makeup plus a photo editing app I
understand why someone would use a photo
editing app I think especially for
celebrities on Instagram or if regular
people - you want to like put your best
appearance forward whoa
so when you first open it it says you
look better with makeup so first I'll
start with foundation they have quite an
array of color yeah actually they could
have a few more options oh no I think
I'm between colors oh this is the story
of my life is it supposed to look
realistic I'll just do maybe like a
night out like I'll do a Friday night
Friday night eyes I usually don't have
time for eyeshadow in my life but this
is fun it's not a bad app to just try
out a crazy makeup look on brows it
looks like they're actually giving you
an eyebrow if I had never plucked our
wax from age 13 they would be like this
ooh these blushes are pretty makes me
look like a little doll now for blushes
I usually like to choose something a
little bit deeper I'm not really into
pink blushes lipstick today black no
David - all I wanted was a black lip I
guess I'll just do red since this is my
night out on town look since this is
Friday Chantelle I chose sort of like a
light
like peaches orange which sounds weird
but on the app it looks kind of cute
okay contacts oh this is dangerous I
look a little crazy with blue eyes oh my
gosh I've always wanted to see what I
look like with different color eyes whoa
the light brown eyes made me look like a
wolf I look very summery like the look
that I chose makes me look very summery
like I'm ready to like go to Laguna
Beach and need someone for coffee I now
look like I walked out of Twilight but
still I think it's okay I think it's
kind of cool if I posted this to
Instagram people would be like are you
okay do you do you need help
I think it's a fun app if you're just
looking at it to see what you might
appear eyes with something Rocky I think
maybe with it with the upgraded version
of the make up app it could have a few
more options in terms of like colors and
tone use it for fun if you want but
don't think that you need it in your
life to look good or whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
