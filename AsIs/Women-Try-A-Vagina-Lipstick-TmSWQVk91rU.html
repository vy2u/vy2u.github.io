when you're on the plane and you're like
wow my vagina should be way softer right
now
this will be interesting because
apparently it helps making hair a little
silk here and I have very coarse hair so
I'm wondering if all aside I'm gonna
have like very soft Rapunzel hair coming
out of my badge if this helps with
ingrown hairs I could definitely use it
for that so I have VBS which is a
condition which makes my outer vagina
area very very sensitive I heard that it
can potentially help with that and I try
to not get my hopes up I'm excited about
it helping with burning I have
vulvodynia I pat it on and off for like
five years now which basically means
that my vagina burns a lot so I usually
just put like an Ice Cube on it but if I
can go into the bathroom at work and
take this chapstick and rub it on my
vagina and make it stop burning that
would be amazing
to be like the least sexy striptease
ever you get none of the payoff my gosh
it's so slippery you glide very easily
it feels really nice so far I mean it
definitely feels like chapstick like
kind of feels like I just took my
smokers out of my pocket and that feels
pretty soothing it's very soft it feels
like coconut oil like how it melts into
your skin really really easily with your
body temperature a lot comes off very
quickly it's very easy to quickly
lubricate your vagina 110 percent I love
this honestly I just want to like leave
my pants off and just lay in front of a
fan and just like let it envelop me I
feel Swift like a beautiful ballerina
can imagine this feeling pretty
great before hooking up
very soft like I see how it helps with
your hair down there because that
was silky as a woman with sensitive skin
this is a huge issue with trying to find
products that don't irritate you and so
it may seem like a small compliment but
it's nothing small to say like thank you
for being boring and not having a
perfume inside you I like it
I would love to use it more and see if
it really does help with ingrown hairs
that would be incredible to me the best
part of this product is that it exists
and that means that people are talking
about vaginas and the problems that can
come with them a que burning pubic hair
that hurts you because that stuff
happens and we should be talking about
it and there should be more products
like this available so yeh you know
anything that kind of helps clean up
that mangled mess down there I know I
should put this all on like a tinder
profile because people would be lining
up to date me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
