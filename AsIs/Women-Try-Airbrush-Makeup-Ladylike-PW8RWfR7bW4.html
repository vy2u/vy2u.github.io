bag or something and you're going
through security and something touched
it was just like and everyone's like wow
that girl has a massive vibrator her bag
all right what are we doing today I
don't know we are trying airbrush makeup
today this is a machine that will
airbrush blow makeup onto your face when
I was in high school they were selling
this at Sephora and I would see it and
be like wow that looks like it's for
fancy people
turns out I'm fulfilling my dream today
by getting to do it so what a time to be
alive I don't really know what to expect
I didn't know this product existed until
10 minutes ago
I think airbrush makeup is a cool
concept I think we should be leaving it
to professionals but it's ladylike where
we do things that professionals should
be doing I'm so pumped I think this is
gonna be great I do feel like they have
a pretty good spectrum in terms of the
options of foundation that they give you
which is pretty cool I like to say I'm
the color of aged parchment well before
the swatching I have to put this
together okay I primed it the black
thing pull the entire thing out press
down on the release button and slide the
air pod window side up and now I just
stick it in hell all right so this is
the foundation hold down on the power
button for two seconds to turn on the
temp to air whoo
oh I know that sound oh wow
I mean I'm not doing it I'm just having
fun nice little breeze four fingers from
the face the four fingers away from your
face ready I'm nervous oh okay well no
it's just very yellow ah well I
definitely got that in my eye
I see coming out but how the do you
get full coverage I'm turning up the
heat I don't have time for this
well I got so much in my eye there's
like a little film on my contacts it
feels great
smells good too
dozens and so on yeah there really is a
lot in my eye I mean I got some up my
nose my eyes I'm crying hey what do we
think I feel Dooley
looks like I'm sweating on my mustache
do I wait for it to dry I will
definitely have to blend this can you
are you supposed to blend it cuz it's
like right now it's just wet on my face
there's a Beauty Blender that I don't
want you guys to see in my hand because
it's dirty but I swear I wash it and
some scenes don't come out I'm very
impressed with the fact that this
matches my skin tone now I'm not really
blending as far as wiping it off to me I
don't know if I have the skill and the
precision to use this alright what do we
do next
ah Oh probably for blush we probably
don't want it on full blast huh okay
it's not terrible oh now I look scary oh
then it does look quite natural actually
all right kids time for the highlighter
I'm gonna frost myself I might do the
gold one that Freddie used I'm gonna do
my brows and then highlight underneath
my brow to see just how precise it can
get oh that's all that I needed okay
okay tip 2 err I think that this is a
nice amount of coverage I'm pretty
pleased
it was much wetter than I thought it
would be sometimes you're what I
probably could have done without the
blush but I like the highlighter portion
can I do it on the table you know now as
I'm doing it I realize if it doesn't
come off I'm the only person here named
Jen I wouldn't use this again
absolutely the only reason I wouldn't
swap it out for my normal foundation
it's just because I couldn't really
carry this on the girl when it comes to
makeup I just like to throw what I know
to avoid any mishaps so I probably
wouldn't use this but I didn't hate it
but I mean I wouldn't be opposed just
having this at the crib if we were
having a sleepover
I'd be like party time that's art
springface you Justin like that it's wet
yeah it felt like it was licking me I
was like I'm not I don't need this right
now I'm not on Wednesday I almost ruined
our friendship
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
