we're going to go out we're gonna party
hard we're to make out with people we're
gonna get sloppy drunk you can you tell
it get invited to a lot of parties in
college tonight we're going to be trying
all-nighter makeup from Urban Decay see
if we can pull an all-nighter with our
all-nighter makeup all night long I'm
hoping I can catch some naps in between
location changes remember no naps
allowed I think that it might be a
little bit heavy to be all night right
an all-nighter makeup it's got to be
like I definitely feel like this product
is thicker than what I usually use even
with just these small swipes it's taking
away every blemish including my mustache
I cannot do anything but the simplest
makeup without a tutorial so it's going
to be a half-chub at best it's going to
be somewhat lit but not that lit I'm
into it and I don't do Sparkle
I'm feeling very 70s today you can't see
but I'm wearing bell-bottoms so I'm kind
of into this disco situation
Oh tickle it's so skinny that it tickles
oh god I like just like this came and
like poked myself in the eye yeah I'm
about to finish my makeup and then we're
gonna go out to go feed Freddie's cat
and then go out
hey all Devin here and I coordinated
tonight so while the girls are at
Freddie's house let me tell you what's
going on we're gonna go to a Mexican
restaurant a dance club and a Korean spa
so we're really gonna turn the heat up
on this makeup Shawntel is gonna join us
for funsies and we may pick up a few
friends along the way
who knows let's see what happens your
reservations weren't until 9:00 p.m. so
we had some time to sort of just like
dilly-dally and act a fool we did a very
unsafe chair race which I'm still upset
about because it was very upsetting this
is a terrible chair oh it was unsafe it
was unsafe I'm pretty sure I won so
Devin says okay girls like our ride is
here come downstairs and lo and behold I
get downstairs and there is a damn limo
waiting for us
felt like prom I honestly kind of wanted
to cry I have not been at home I was
shocked just like up because I realize
the crash that's great like I don't know
how you pulled that up we went to dinner
which was fun but I think I got like
shrimp tacos or something and then I was
like this is a weird choice to do right
before dancing but wasn't it was maybe
about 9:30 by the time we got to the
Mexican restaurant and I was starting to
fade the night was so young then I was
so yeah Jen no you can't you can't get
tired Jen if you get the right song we
can do it and I'm confident I can get
maybe one of these day needed a boost I
need coffee need to buy this because of
all the party
I had a few steak tacos had some like
shrimp gasps a Bruin and then we stopped
and picked up Quinta because why not
so basically what happened is that
Chantal and Freddie convinced Quinta to
come out with us so we're gonna go get
Quinta from her apartment yeah we made
Quinta get out of bed and come with us
the rest of the night so it was like
okay we have to turn up you're in this
you are in ways
it's a 1116 all night it's been about
five hours but I am getting shining we
went to the Abbey which is a very
popular gay bar in West Hollywood I
think I was expecting for the eyeshadow
because it was so glittery for the
glitter to eventually be all over my
face but everything stayed super tight
in place it was really really impressive
we found some of my sorority sisters at
the Abbey who told me that my makeup
look nice which was very sweet of them
it looks amazing clapping all night your
skin is going you're looking at my
letter no one know so we leave the Abbey
then we drop off Quinta and I wanted to
get out of the car and go with Quinta
ladies would not let me stayed in car
hey Jen
um I think you're gonna get sleepier the
more that you map I'm sleepy Chantell
who was not in this video but then was
in this video we had to drop her off so
I wish you all the best
Jen wake up or don't and everyone else
enjoy the rest of your night I will be
home sleeping ready to tuck it the
is ready
we need to commit to this video and you
are dropping out right now I'm tired so
then there's one surprise activity and
none of us know what that is but at this
point is maybe like 2:00 a.m. and it's
like whoa it's LA things generally shut
down at 2:00 a.m. so I couldn't even
imagine what executable store looks like
the hotel so good against leash what do
you think there is your Korean spying on
this place I don't totally know the
history of Korean spas but I do know
that they are awesome
now what a lovely way to in the night
I've never been to the Korean spa have
always wanted oh and this is the perfect
opportunity we're in Busan good James on
and smells great
this is so cool I've never experienced
anything like this but there are bees
which is where the salt is also oh oh
it's a it does smell really nice in here
but it is not helping with the energy
level this heat is making me sleepy we
were up for a little bit like completely
naked rolling
a little cold pools and hot pools like
after an hour
freddie was like I could just lie down
over there just for a little and Jen was
like good just sounds pretty this is
also my problem I'm always the last one
to fall asleep at sleepovers all right
we're done with the spa we're over the
spa it's like 5:30 waiting for that Sun
to come up man it's gonna be awesome
we're going to pull the real big girl
night or write Freddie
we're done haha it's all over
wasn't filming now I am we stayed up all
day and night to see if this makeup last
the Urban Decay makeup lasted way longer
than I lasted I think the makeup did
hold up pretty well if I had to say the
one thing that didn't fold up as well it
was just the mattifying element like I
was oily and sweaty the eyeshadow stayed
on really really well and that's
impressive because we were in those
saunas and those hot tubs so it was just
so hot so much potential for there to be
sweat I still felt pretty flawless as it
say in my face held up pretty well
makeup did better than I did anything
inanimate is gonna do better than I do
