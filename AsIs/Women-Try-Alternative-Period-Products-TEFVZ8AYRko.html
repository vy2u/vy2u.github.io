actually really excited for my period
because I just wanted boobs so bad and
like I dread that like after you get
your period you get boobs I usually rely
pretty heavily on tampons and the
occasional pad overnight kind of I've
always worn a combination of tampons and
pads tampons like they super convenient
but also they hurt they're uncomfortable
it's just that they're much easier than
pads pads are really bulky and loud and
it feels like you're wearing this soggy
cloud in your underwear
about two years ago I switched to using
only organic tampons because I found out
that a lot of the normal tampons have
been bleached white so when you put that
tampon inside of you you're unknowingly
absorbing bleach into your vagina
I hate thinking about the waste that's
created by tampons and knowing that I'm
literally personally contributing to
that on the other hands there's not a
lot of options for women who are just
bleeding like I can't just go to work
and freely if you like periods are sort
of shrouded in secrecy like when you
start your period it's sort of like
you're starting up here and that is
still really confusing to me because I
think that's why we don't really have a
lot of alternatives because we're not
having a lot of conversations about
periods and like just the vagina and the
vulva in general
I don't know how this is gonna work like
why is this so short like I'm worried
that's just gonna be up there it gets
stuck forever I'm like I have to pull
this or anyway I don't know guys I feel
like you have to like know origami to
put it in your vagina take a shower and
then I'll stick it in while I'm in the
shower and I'll you guys know how it
feels
there's just something about it like it
you could touch it I just hope it's not
icky I use the sponge and they basically
went to the bottom of the Great Barrier
Reef and I cranked it off of a coral
wall just have the panties doing an
unboxing there beep you I feel like they
look like normal underwear like just
cute ass highways that was very thin
which I appreciate because I was really
worried it would be like super funky
which I'm not into so so far so good I'm
in the bathroom about to attempt to put
this on successfully it's a tiny bit
confusing I don't know if the why not
goes inside the actual pad this is no
joke
it's not in my vagina in case you're
wondering 15 minutes later still can't
be full of poop their hands I folded it
I tried to put it in I got halfway in
and then it fast open I really
wanna keep doing it it seems like so
much work for something that I'm gonna
have to empty out in 30 minutes cuz
there's no way that baby's holding all
the blood that's gonna come out of my
vagina
today the sponge is in I just realized
as I was putting it in I was like I hope
this doesn't get lost in my vagina
because I use the deeper cut but the
Diva Cup has a little knobby thing at
the bottom that helps you be able to
like pull it out I'm really scared of
pushing it so far back that it's hard
for me to like grab it like sputtering
no there goes through tears got a reach
up
yeah no there's no it's bleep it's just
just a sponge so they give to pinch it
out ooh
so my first thoughts are they're really
comfortable they feel really soothing
and comforting there's something to be
said I pulled out my tampon to put them
on and it was nice like taking out
something and I'm just like letting it
all live it's on now and so far I can
feel it's there but it's pretty
comfortable it's like a little badge
cushion I'm not complaining so that
sounds pretty apprehensive because the
same thing I'm like pads and they're not
sexy then wow they get dirty really
quickly but it was the best thing it
literally felt like a pillow for my
vagina so I've had the cup in for less
than 10 minutes now and I'm sitting down
and they can definitely feel it I also
don't feel like it's doing what I need
it to do and it's really uncomfortable
and giving myself five more minutes
before I go inside and rip this thing
out of me once it was in I don't think I
inserted it correctly because I could
feel it and I don't think you're
supposed to be able to feel it you're
supposed to just live your life I was
actually really joking about the itching
it's not like oh my gosh my pratik on
fire
a little bit you know and I want to go
scratch it if I might have it a little
bit too low I might just push it up a
little bit more it would kind of almost
fly down my vagina sometime so like it
would just be like it's just like
painting it's like peeking
so we're two hours into wearing white
while wearing the thanks and I don't
think I'm ever going back to anything
else it just feels so good to not have
anything inside of you I think you're
still gonna kind of need like a backup
when you're heavy but as far as like
medium to moderate these puppies are
good to go about to have a shower and
then try the Luna pods for the night as
you can see white shapes so this is
gonna be the ultimate test
it's the deal breaker time to shine Luna
did you feel like you were worried about
like stowage I was okay oh no I just
really nice yes okay I'm currently the
only person in this two-person install
but I'm just wondering how the I'm
supposed to gain like cut out in this
thing it's someone wants them no I just
stood up nothing happened like I keep
living in fear but like I'm protected
like if they develop the things that
there's like five tampons worth their
blood like that you could literally just
wear all day okay yeah hundred I'm
always friends yeah really so worth the
investment there were no legs on the bed
I just could not to get in the bathroom
I'm gonna check out what's going down
everything's falling into the right
place is my mess I was kind of worried
that it like would maybe have child out
on to my thighs at all but the one
downside is that it's like from not sexy
at all yeah that should be a number one
but like when I went to bed I
I'm kind of wearing this like my
apprentice woke up and I feel like
thinks I so made for sleep in my I may
appear yeah it was awesome like I'll
throughout the night not having to worry
about whether or not I had a tape on it
we should just have more options like
that's what bothers me at the end of the
day like here's four maybe two of them
are like reasonable for you maybe just
one how are we only having one option
for people to like do something that's
been around for thousands of years you
know I definitely think I have a sponge
in just a little bit too low
cuz I it felt like it was gonna plop out
so I came to the bathroom to adjust it
but when I tried to push it farther back
like it was just rubbing up against my
vagina in a way that like I don't like
but now that it's up there
I feel fine so the Diva Cup look once
you get it in there like you don't feel
it the rest of the day for me whereas
like with that like I just it's the
first time in a long time where I could
not feel it but I was just so mindful of
it every time like even like when I went
to pee when I'm gonna sit like it was
just like I didn't like being that
present in my period like it's already
like hard enough to deal with the cramps
and everything else but like then to be
cognizant of
being in your vagina is secret would you
try to do the cup again yeah I would
definitely try to do backup again in
fact I'm going to on my next period I
want to keep trying until I find a way
for it to work for me oh I don't think
there's anything that they couldn't the
only thing that I would improve about
thinks it's just another level up of
absorbency like keep the ones you have
for heavy days and then have like that
extra like the overnight almost yeah
yeah I only think just like if there is
a way to figure out like if more
companies start doing it maybe like way
to make it cheaper so it's more
accessible it's like opening a bag of
potato chips in a cinema when it's like
in a really quiet scene and everyone
just turns around and hates you that's
what I feel like the pad is like the
lunar pad is I having an ice cream in
the cinema no one hears it everyone's
happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
