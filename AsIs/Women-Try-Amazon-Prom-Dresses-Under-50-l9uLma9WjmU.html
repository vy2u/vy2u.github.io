and we got it and we granted and we
grounded so my first prom I went with
friends and I wore like a Paisley
looking kind of like dress you know it's
kind of like a little circle look a
little sweetheart neckline no I'm saying
I went to prom all four years I was the
prom queen oh my god my dress was bright
blue and had a bunch of sequin things
all over and voltar from JCPenney
I went to prom zero times I didn't go
but I did have to buy like in college
dresses for a recital since I've had to
buy gowns and I never wanted to spend
like more than 150 I don't remember how
much I paid but I remember was like at
least around a hundred dollars I expect
these dresses to fit in some places and
then not fit in the others I'm not
opposed to buying clothes online I do it
all the time but Amazon is not like a
specialty clothing retailer also like
the brands on there everyone's I've
never heard of literally so I'm like
what is this I want to be surprised
actually like if I could have saves a
lot of money on a prom dress I would
have been happy my mom would been happy
everybody would been happy so what do
you say should we go like try on these
dresses um hell yeah will you go to prom
with me
I'm not mad I would want us a prom it is
right there with everything that I did
where I feel like I wish the fit was a
little bit better I wish that like it
just could do so much more but it was so
close so this is pretty good for $50
just in my opinion this is amazing I'm
not mad I'm not mad I ain't going to
prom but hey I'm not mad it's way better
than I thought it was gonna be I saw you
from a distance I wouldn't be like
that's only $50 it feels appropriate for
sure like the color
great the cut interesting because you
got a little like you could fly fits
really well here but it's very tight in
my rib cage and I think that's what's
causing all the problem I like a little
Boop Pete yeah I like the cleave I like
a little just a little tiny peaky
because you know high school it's just
about a little peak I would ask my mom
to make alterations to this to make the
boobs a little bit cuter you could have
you are in high school you don't need
all that and this is like hmm just a
touch of sex appeal because you can see
it goes a little sheer at the thigh but
nothing else it's just a peek this is
very cute I just think online it looked
a lot more high-fashion like they really
tried to amp it up they made it look
like it was very you know and obviously
I'm not gonna get Barsotti on anything I
will say that I do like that it's a
high-low I think yeah milah wasn't a
huge thing when I was in high school now
same and like a mullet it's a party in
the front it can really like get my
dance on yeah but then I'm if somebody
this was 50 I wouldn't this is nice
pointed at one Amazon these are a boobie
dresses and Ruby dresses yours looks
amazing it really like doesn't look like
the price that it is I would say oh yeah
you can wear this literally anywhere you
could doesn't look like a prom dress
it looks like just a hot person guys I
feel like I would have liked this dress
or dressed like this like my junior year
prom where I was just going my friends
and I was just going to dance and I
could be like yeah I'm a princess in a
tutu you look like some Great Gatsby
like gorgeous goddess I like this this
is very comfortable
I can breathe unlike my other dress it's
very forgiving fabric but I can Amazon
we need longer dresses for tall ladies
if I relax my arms like we're
dangerously close to feels fun like
honestly I feel like I could just skip
around if a breeze comes I could be like
oh oh no freeze you look amazing
I would have just stood in the corner
like this I don't dance I'm the fashion
it's got a trainer Who am I who is
Amazon I got pointy boobs the design is
actually not bad the only thing that's
all knowing is that it's like crinkly
like you can like like what is that it's
what's happening is the sound of savings
okay if I pop it it might make it look
like my butt's there compared to like
what I saw online of this I feel like it
looks exactly the same
like stretchy but thick look at Jersey
like spandex Jersey something yeah if
you're gonna order online like go with a
stretchy fabric for sure you won't miss
David actually stretchy - if you feel it
yeah it's like there is a stretch in
that I like tulle it's more stretchy
till it is really smart super smart
because that way you feel like
comfortable you're not trapped in like
sequin strapless - but all night me like
Haven I'm awkward can I dance in it
let's test
she can dance in a dance a proof it's
got some smacks appeal but with the mesh
all this all that we are women all these
the woman from shocked in a good way
I'm shocked also I was not expecting
that no my expectations were like on the
floor yeah and I was like they can go
below the floor but now that I've
actually tried them they're not bad but
they're like they're you know they're
good I don't think people would be able
to tell that these are under fifty bucks
now see absolutely not
there's no way you were looking at these
outfits and like she's like oh no one
would say that I would argue most high
schoolers don't have a ton of money to
spend on prom prom is expensive in
general except to buy tickets flowers
like yeah accessories whatever so like
if you're looking for a place to save I
think Amazon is Amazon prom dresses a
good pet and you know spend all the
money on a limousine so you can look fly
when you roll up into prom with your
fans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
