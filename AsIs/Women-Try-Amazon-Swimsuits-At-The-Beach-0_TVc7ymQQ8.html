that are under 30 bucks which what did
it are no I feel like the swimsuits that
I wear all the time I've gotten from
online stores like swimsuits for all I
usually get my snow machines from like
forever 21 honestly yeah like 20 bucks
I've gotten them sometimes in department
stores yeah because I like to try them
on and also department stores usually
have a better selection for people with
like bigger chest my thing is I have to
mix my top and my bottom up best meat
you have I have a small chest but quite
a large behind a lot of halters will
like fit me really well but it's like
the pressure on my neck to hold up my
boobs and say yeah one pieces of so hard
they let you become a song and I said
whoa I worry because Amazon does so many
things he's spreading yourself too thin
Amazon so we gotta test out these two
MCS am I gonna write them on a scale
from 1 to 10 we are going to do the
Instagram to visit photographed well
exercise movement tests and tests does
it let a lot of sand is and then we're
gonna do a lot of tests we burn about
doing a waters it's freezing today by
the way so that's how we're gonna test
them let's go try them on hi swimsuit
kudos Amazon it's not as tight in my
behind as I thought it would be I don't
look like an elongated worm I really
like mine actually I love like off the
shoulder things so I like that I can
show some shoulder I love this suit you
really yeah usually when they shit like
the models are like fairly flat chested
and so you don't know like how these
kind of slips are gonna work out yeah
it's a really worried the difference
it's gonna be like my nipples yeah yes
I'm feeling rather exposed because
there's not a lot of fabric but that's
my choice and I she's quite impressed
with it I think this is cute and could
definitely double like throw some jeans
on over the body so you got a whole
shirt I don't have any boobs so there
was a bit of fluffing happening
you
but yeah just a little extra fabric with
mine I like it a lot for a long sleeve
like you were like modern Baywatch it
feels good the zipper in the back kind
of sucks
this is strangling me slightly I feel
like this is one of those take a picture
in it and then put on your realistic
swimsuit
there will be fanned all in my behind we
should try our little Instagram
challenge Instagram pet pics
this is literally the only thing I'm
looking forward to you're very good at
guessing me off the water should I be
like leaning I don't know why should do
I mean I feel hot you look like royalty
I'm glad I'm getting them now before we
head back oh yeah oh yeah strong point
lean your hand on your on your knee yeah
like oh yeah how you suck done goodness
this swimsuit was meant to be worn in
fucks less in love with it post
Instagram I feel really good in this
suit but it doesn't photograph boy as
well as I would want it to I think -
around very well peasant cloth see I'm
fine when I put it on I was like oh hey
it's a cute bread one sleeps ooh and
then I was like oh then I have to show
my side but that I have to angle my body
and there was a lot to it I feel like a
five-year-old wearing this bikini yeah I
feel good but it's not like I'm not
looking at this picture was like wow I
would say on a scale of 1 to 10 mine is
probably about 1/8 like at seven oh yeah
yeah 7 give it like a 5 it's like
letting other pose in the right way that
like shows the bikini off correctly and
I'm not quite there yet
alright we're gonna do the volleyball
test I don't have to do that oh no
I was saying I was fine here but it's
all in here where it's like the so
suddenly became a phone I'm actually
impressed in mine it doesn't move belly
at all I felt like I was in my
long-sleeve uniform and I was like ready
so yeah I like that I'd give it a six
and a half like a nine it also surprised
ten out of ten guys we're gonna go roll
in the sand I hate sand I do not want
sand anywhere inside my bikini and I
think it's gonna go in because of the
flaps its sand gets everywhere so it's
gonna happen gonna go
never worked too hard at work I have
like an opening in the center for a lot
of sand to fall through but not a ton
got in I thought my suit would hold up
better it did not there is sand and
every possible crevice my knees not as
bad but it's definitely in my boot
and I don't really know how to even get
it out so it's just in there this suit
is all utility it is it is totally fine
nothing's getting anywhere in this baby
I'd give it like 9 out of 10 for oh it's
time for the water taffy now you're our
only contestant today how are you
feeling about it
I'm really excited I love frolicking in
the water at the beach
there she goes
I should hold up very well it held all
the sand in it for sure who I'm wet you
know it did pretty well in the water I
tried I couldn't get a good good way to
like crash down on me but I said I did
get like the whole suit wet and even
like the flat part I didn't really go in
all the way so I don't know but the
bumpers go wet and they 1c3 so yeah I
guess it did well I'll give it a ten out
of ten like a nine out of 10 I would
give you an eight I feel like if I wore
this into the water it would be a nice I
just
my biggest takeaway from this is that
you're shopping on Amazon you're gonna
stay there a while to find the kind of
suit you like but it is worth it in the
end because bullies let's fun dance a
beat you want a wet hug from me oh no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
