recently found out that swims which are
actually really expensive berry I always
ordered from like eBay I always I'm
looking for the next time suit to buy I
don't wear them so much that I need like
really expensive ones
when suits under 8 bucks I'm like okay
but I didn't get to go pick review and
find these the fact that these are under
$8 where is me I just something that'd
be cute I think they'll be cute but
they'll fall apart immediately if I can
change my lunch budget for a swim suit
I'm happy this has on something cute and
ho ish I'm gonna get that on a mug who
should change first snows those I think
I should say I didn't oh I I did it is
it hiding all the important parts I
think so I'm gonna be make it back here
don't look yeah for $8.00 this is great
the material is fine I think just like
this style is what I'm worried about
all my business is gonna be hanging out
these bottoms okay wait this feels good
so far underwear bigger than this
oh no oh we started off so good I know
I'm not gonna like what I see
hey not that bad I have a lot of side
boob
I'm gonna be standing like this because
I don't want my vagina on the Internet
but it's a cute swimsuit yeah that's
really cute it's everywhere he's at the
top really fit me like in one of these
pods here and this has like these little
like adjustable strap a buddy all all
creases are not supportive yeah I don't
think that helps not much I think this
will be perfect if they just had two
adjustable strap and don't know how to
fix my boobs except for getting a breast
reduction that is not happening anytime
so I really like mine the only thing I
had trouble with was like tying up front
because I was like this is a little
short so I like to audio tie a ribbon or
just like tie but the backs really
secure yours fits flawlessly it does I
just wish this style was better you know
the fabric is really good like like I
said it's like thick I love the color
I guess why do you keep on playing with
you yeah they're not games I will give
it a 7 top fits fine the bottoms do not
well that is expected for me I have a
smaller top in a larger bottom you've
got a test not a good jump right not
much nothing it's falling out so not
that bad for me it fit well so I would
give it a 10 bottom half a 10 it's not
like giving me a front or back wedgie
this is maybe not the best so this time
you have to be like that
maybe the shoelace string is what gets
me the most like a 9 cuz it bad yeah I
mean the alarm doesn't know what she's
talking about
we have one more it's either gonna be
awesome or terrible nothing then beats
me there are a lot of poles and I hope
I'm putting my legs in the right one
hears that the bottom is like pretty
tight this definitely feels like
something I would have worn as a child
so Sheridan isn't moving her hands baked
like a girl I think we can all agree why
I was covering that I've never worn like
a highway swimsuit before I'm like a
little bit uncomfortable because it's
like tight and then going up
I will say though that is totally your
color the good thing about highway
because it makes your butt look good
yeah that looks good but then like I
think from the front it looks a little
bit like a diaper it has its high to
show tightly so my boobs would stay up
cool things this one if not attached so
I can just like the whole knee it's it
it just doesn't take into account that
someone of the size has boobs with my
hair but it's my body and I love it a
night of it comes out a little bit to
kind of reveal an elastic e thing
I think this is very cute I am a little
more covered in the front little
high-waisted bill I love this I'm a
little more covered up back so I feel
like I'd actually wear this top like as
a top my ass of my best quality so I
actually like how this swimsuit is like
good move I would give my gnihton I feel
secure I feel loved my back is really
hurting
I'm sure there's already like a mark or
something I feel really comfortable in
this on to you like for you I'm gonna go
ahead with hell no this was not made for
me the top is great bottom it's a little
bit tight and since its pulled up it
feels like I'm having a wedgie 7 it lose
it
without all about having to be out there
you know I'll give it like I know a lot
of different you know designers
manufacturers they think they just have
to you know make it a little bigger but
like really you have to look at like how
a plus-size body is different for the
price like I couldn't ask for better
yeah I think we honestly had the same
problems we would have had yeah I went
to the store kinda wasn't expecting a
cheap swimsuit to have a nice style
until I saw the second one and I was
like whoa I actually have a pool party
to go to this weekend and now I have two
swimsuits to bring and be like 8 bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
