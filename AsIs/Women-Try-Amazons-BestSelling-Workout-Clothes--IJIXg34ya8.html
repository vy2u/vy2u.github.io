Busan but we're gonna put things on our
books are you gonna argue but backing it
up hey improvement today we're trying
out Amazon best-selling workout clothes
I don't really have a lot of workout
clothes I go to the store and buy really
cute workout clothes thinking that it'll
inspire me to work out and it doesn't
I've been kind of on a little mini
fitness journey so I've been getting
obsessed with workout clothes I love me
some leggings that make my butt look
good because that's important while
you're at the gym and also when you're
around the office your butt has to look
good does it and when you're going to
the grocery store your plan has to look
good it's got to pass the bun test but
test the reason that I don't buy clothes
on Amazon is because one not sure if
it's gonna fit and two I hate when I get
something in the mail and it just
doesn't look at all like it looks on the
bottle I'm like in between a size 12 and
14 so online shopping is a nightmare
they do have the review section where
you can see on each product so hopefully
by reading that I will be able to find
my size one important thing I forgot to
mention that is probably the most
important thing of the entire video is
we have to be able to workout in these
clothes they're not just to make your
butt look good but but they do if they
do those blows okay so to test these
clothes we're going to rate them by
style performance and comfort we're
gonna try out the clothes right now to
see how they look style wise and then
we're gonna wear them for the rest of
the day to see if they're comfy and then
we're gonna put them to the ultimate
test
which is working out we're gonna try
workout clothes from Amazon to see if
they fit our leg length but I'm done
let's just try on these clothes first
brush woo it's good that they have the
padding because my nips sometimes are
like whoa like light material it feels
pretty legit and now for the tops are
like this blue feels very like
stretchy hopefully it's gonna like suck
everything in next we'll be trying on
leggings leggings I'm thick um I think
these will stretch but I'm gonna nervous
they won't so we broke up a different
kind of look different colors we have
the same style clothing I really like
the bra the most annoying thing when I
work out his way I didn't have things
flopping around in place don't look at
me I'm doing a shake test
I love the bra because it's breathable
and it feels like my boobs are gonna
stay there girls are supportive girls
are supporting girls
hmm I really like this shirt because
it's not that loose and stop that tight
it's like perfect I can move around in a
this is a little bit loose but I
actually like working out and looser
clothing so for me this is kind of a
perfect fit so these came in a lot of
different lengths in different colors it
looks like you got a longer one I
actually really like the color I'm a
purple girl I'm not really like a peach
pinky person and I feel like I could
fill up a size because they'd give me a
little camel toe same we both got on our
toes
no girl yours is like no I feel the
cable girl mine is like whoa we're ready
to do something the camel toes are just
talking so now we got to do the booty
test which is the most important test of
them all yo she got booty she did booty
is in place boobs are in place let's
test it for comfort I was walking my dog
today I was in the workout clothes and I
realized that when you're wearing
workout clothes already it's just a lot
easier to start running so I went on a
run with my dog and he loved it and it's
also really comfortable and really
fashionable some ready to go to work in
this you look like one of those cool
rich LA people who like go to yoga in
the middle of the day
I don't know what I do for a living but
yeah or you look like one of those girls
that just wears that around but you
don't ever work out you're spot on right
you look so fit you look like you just
would pay for the workout yeah us comfy
ank you
it's comfy and it's like stylish enough
to wear at the office so I'm gonna this
day is my day of chilling so I put it
through the Netflix and chill test I'm
gonna see if I could watch some Netflix
while eating ice cream get this in bed
oh it passed the test friends and we're
at the gym over here is it the gym you
did squats you do lunges iron workout we
did some weird fall thing I really liked
this shirt I felt light in it
I love the bra it has like these like
cups over it but it doesn't feel like
your boobs will pop out and say what's
up girl I'm working out two stood
through all the tests our booties look
good
we tested check I actually put it
through a torque test but it didn't work
I thought I was really gonna twerk for
you know
so we tried out these clothes for style
comfort &amp;amp; performance I liked them a lot
I didn't feel like a slob wearing them
at work and that's usually how I feel
with fitness clothing they were very
versatile and I could wear them
everywhere so style 5 style rated style
for me got a 4 out of 5 I need some
leggings that had a waistband on them
that's gonna be like so that I want to
go on Instagram and be like look I've
been working out you can obviously see
performance wise it was a 5 out of 5
because I couldn't move it didn't feel
like it was going to rip I would give
this 85
it felt form-fitting enough where it
would like stay in one place it also
felt breezy enough where wouldn't like
constrain me while I was moving for
comfort I would give this a 5
I give these a 5 out of 5 it's just
putting them on is like you can feel
them once they're on it's like there's
no coming back
you have to like take them off like I
think for somebody who is just starting
out on their fitness journey and wants
to find clothes that are affordable this
is def
be a good option once you're deeper into
your fitness journey and you want to
take pictures for Instagram with cute
clothes go for the extra stuff go for
the extra money stuff well so Lauren
we've been through so many rad journeys
and so many fad journeys what was your
favorite you know I actually like the
Khloe Kardashian diet a lot I really
like the yoga one because I liked being
up in the air swinging and being in the
water
I liked hot sexy yoga it still makes me
moody to this day I'm like oh hot and
sexy yoga just like a hot pocket yeah we
did a little fitness went to the gym put
stuff on our bodies and it finished and
we went to a dance fitness class none of
these words rhyme but Maya is still
moving in also did the thing with the
slimfast
undies right bet yeah
best-selling amazon clothes that are bad
Brad so this is Khloe the producer of
router fat I present you with this towel
that I stole from the gym oh she's a
trooper you are you were rats owl the
golden ticket my friends it's got my
sweat on it
