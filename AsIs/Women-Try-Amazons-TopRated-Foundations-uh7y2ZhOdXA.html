best-selling foundation interestingly
enough their best-selling foundations
are maybelline and bare minerals but
Maybelline fit me might just be the
foundation for me I might just leave
here married to a new brand this is
Amazon's best-selling foundation and
it's only six bucks
I thought bare minerals was over two
thousand eight this was hot let's
do with it let's try it clean it's not
super covering up my breakup I guess the
idea of bare minerals though is it's
supposed to be really light like it's
not supposed to look like you have
makeup on well I mean like key
connection on it's not really going on
how my normal one feels are not gonna
like my normal one is more expensive I
definitely see why people like this I
definitely see why people like it it's
really instant mattifying your pores
disappeared real test is gonna be
outside with a selfie Wow I'm very
impressed
I'm not shiny really to be honest you
don't really know how good your
foundation is until the end of the day
so I feel like we can't judge it right
now we need to we need to go and do the
rest of our day and see how it lasts
help me never used this before you got a
golden this size do you have like a kind
of a glow
matches my face or not people like in
the shade now you look fine yeah in the
shade I'm your friend
I'll see you later I'm gonna go do my
day what do you think about this
foundation I'm not mad
this is the best selling foundation on
Amazon I can see what also guess how
much it is eight dollars six dollars
really you literally look like blur but
not in like a way like sissy sissy was
sissying looks scary well it kind of
makes your skin look completely even
scary yeah all your pores are gone but I
feel like you should have support there
you know I don't think it is the right
undertones I can tell them that it's not
your real skin so as you can see this
skin to the left is my real skin looks
great the skin to the right not so much
very dry just very gray looking it still
is not my cup of tea and I think it's
something about the texture it just
dries in a way that kind of reminds me
of like a dry clay mask it doesn't feel
dry but it just looks dry it's so dry
and so Matt I can't like blend like put
my concealer on and like blend it if
it's not gonna blend
and what's good I actually have to go to
an event tonight and I completely took
off like a Dacian and redid it with my
own makeup if you were on camera or a
humor in a place where you wanted your
photo taking you look perfect
did a great job at what it was supposed
to do it's mixed reviews a lot of people
are like okay like it looks good but
like you don't look as natural as you
normally do I haven't started to get
oily anywhere just so great very torn I
think for the price oh my gosh this is
amazing and if you want that flawless
airbrush finish hell yeah
does it live up to its hype as being the
number one foundation sure but I'm for
sure not gonna just replace it with what
I know already works for my skin but I'm
still gonna be using it was on prime to
watch my TV shows and get cat litter on
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
