huh not long at all
so today we're trying Amazon's top rated
mascaras for length I'm super excited
and Sochi I have super short Asian
lashes they're like super sparse ones
two millimeters long and they never keep
a curl I've had a complicated
relationship with my lashes I don't know
what to do with them because I feel like
they're sure mine are also non-existent
wearing mascara doesn't even help so I
don't even bother with it mascara makes
my eyelashes feel sticky like getting
glued a little bit shut every time I
blink in one falls off I'm like one of
eyelashes my problem when I wear mascara
twos like I always get smudge YZ over
here especially on the outer half of the
lid because I have like a monolid
they're getting like partially covered
by my eyelid as well they've just never
been like a a source of pride but would
be nice if they were a little longer I
guess I would like length
I would like thickness with them looking
full I would like them not to smudge I
would like it to last but I also wanted
to not like take forever to take off my
face we don't settle I hate when people
ask me if I'm tired because I am all the
time but like they were open up the eyes
more and people would think I would look
more awake unless dead
does any kind of remind you of benefit
access he reminds me of candy I ate
growing up I really like this laboratory
situation going up he's like trying to
concoct the perfect mascara featuring a
curved wand for volume beyond reality oh
you can even scan here for a tutorial
nobody scans cure to it there is a woman
of Caucasian descent on the packaging so
you know already it's not gonna work for
us
but we'll see the Box doesn't maybe look
like I would have bought it on Amazon
but the container does I'm always like
kind of dubious about these like curved
wands though because I don't know if
it's the best way to deposit mascara
product on your eyelashes oh it's chunky
I don't like it it's already like
plumping some of my lashes just like
automatically stick to each other
you know what they look pretty thick
though thick with two Z's no now there's
more on the lids it is kind of clumpy
dude it looks great Michelle approves
and I don't this is one of the top rated
mascaras on Amazon that is very
disappointing so like look very thin it
looks like they had like a full meal but
I want them really really fat I feel
like now I have what they call spider
lashes yeah it's like a tarantula I
wouldn't wear this out it doesn't make
me feel confident
so it's called mad lash and I'm mad they
really like brushed your eyelashes up
but I don't think it did that for mine
mine are still like oh like that's how
mine grow they just grow straight down
wouldn't it stubborn like she is that's
real there's like no difference
this is why I don't wear mascara
just like jam-packed with fancy words
that like get my hopes up drama luck
conditioning fiber gel mascara plus
perfect bathe
there's no parabens phthalates fragrance
and some stick diets dice synthetic dyes
ginseng root extract that's so cool
every single beauty product as bought
that's like imported from Japan gets the
job done
wait what I don't love this because when
you put your fingerprints on the product
you see the smudges I just have lots of
things going on in my life like I always
have clinicians and like my fingerprints
and out all over it it's product so if
you like commit a crime and you're like
also wearing mascara don't use this one
the old like a thirty dollar mascara I
like the sound it just mean oh no what
is so fat yeah that would promise the
fatter to brush the batter of my lashes
this is not a comfortable thing to like
hold in your hand there's a reason they
don't make pens and pencils boxy
as hell it's less whi than most primers
sorry I'm talking at you all you do I
love watching people do their makeup oh
wow this one actually looks pretty good
yeah it's definitely less clumpy I like
that they're not clumping but honestly
the result isn't as dramatic as I
thought it would be I don't think that's
the best primary my opinion this one
closed fewer of your lashes together
okay wait I can see like more of a
difference with like the second coat
it's a gym thing this one is much less
clumpy like it looks surprisingly nice
they look really long
Coquette chronicles this sounds like the
next 50 shades first of all there's like
for fonts they're using they're not a
very coordinated team and look at this
ingredient list and the first ingredient
is collagen the other two I think we're
just water that's what I'm all about
give me all that the wand looks pretty
standard to like nothing fancy it looks
pretty like drugstore II but again maybe
it's a hidden gem I like how it glided
just right out of the tube like the
other one you had to kind of like tug at
it a little bit
it seems pretty smooth I like it's got a
nice consistency I don't know if it's
just like the bristles are kind of
sparse but it just feels like it's not
picking out that much product I'm just
getting it more on my face and I am on
my actual ashes really bad brush brush
hurts I want to stop putting on mascara
this one it's actually the least chunky
slash clumpy I still can't get these
outer one story of my life it feels
sticky top lashes touching the bottom
ones and it's just like from this angle
it looks like it's clumping less for
sure but giving you the length of the
first mascara this is like something you
buy from like the discount bin at your
drugstore don't feel like a flirty girl
there is like one good thing about
having sparse eyelashes Asians just
don't have that much body hair
it's like Ali Wong said about Asian men
we're like dolphins you know we're just
like soft all over the eave by Yves is
my favorite it went on the most smoothly
it just seemed like it was like actually
lengthening without clumping I really
think if I tried it with a different
primer I could create a new product
I think the primer did help me somewhat
I liked the third one in the purple
packaging the Lafleur t girl because
that was least clumpy for me I was
surprised the fact that like they
weren't brands that we all knew Amazon I
feel like has so many miracle products
and I was hoping for something that
doesn't calm lengthens like crazy but I
guess that's what eyelash extensions are
for I don't feel like they're any
different from other mascaras I've tried
and
of like people who are of Asian descent
and I guess like there hasn't really
been a cosmetic line that caters to that
audience who cares
Asians have such great features just do
what you can and make your own beauty
standard for other people of monolids
just do you live your best life whether
you want to put on tons of layers of
mascara or just like wear them natural
like it's totally up to you so find your
confidence and whatever way you feel
like you can so as you may have noticed
boldly is now as is but don't worry
you'll still get all the awesome content
you used to but just even more new great
stuff
