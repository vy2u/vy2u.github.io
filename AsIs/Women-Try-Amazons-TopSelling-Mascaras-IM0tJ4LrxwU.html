selling mascara so we're all going to be
trying different mascaras today I'm just
gonna try the luminous in the carbon
black getting longer but not thicker but
when I hear voluminous I think think I
feel like as I'm going I need a couple
wears but I like yeah it's nice if
you're looking for a mascara that makes
your lashes a little a little bit longer
you don't want to spend a ton of money I
think this is a perfect basic mascara
I'm trying better than sex by Too Faced
this better be better than sex and I
hope that you get that by applying not
by using this in a different way I think
I started with no lashes and now I have
some this is not better than sex but I
can get some after eyes good
you know this matches with dawn
definitely looks heavy but I think if
you're looking for that dramatic look
it's perfect for you exactly
I'm trying l'oreal paris double extend
beauty tubes mascara you have to not
rific their directions it's more than
one step it's two steps oh my god but
this is pretty light it's feathery if
this is under ten dollars I'd probably
buy it I'm trying the 3d fiber mascara
it's sitting on a satin pillow this is
so bougie I love it oh my gosh what is
this
why does it look like I don't like oh
this looks like after I get my eyebrows
threaded and then like all of the
comings of all of my eyebrow what is it
what problems your eyes on what is that
there's like flakes it's flaking I have
to seal the fibers so they're not just
on my way boom pow Oh thick ten years
Nathan wait
I'm not mad once I get these natural
fibers off my face I might look cute I
would order this for sure I'm not even
kidding because it's a special occasion
lash I'm gonna be trying some Maybelline
colossal volume Express
I would wear this every day slap it on
before work th and I'm good to go
they look so much longer right you see
me every day I freaking love this and I
think it's gonna be my next mascara I'm
gonna try the luminous lash paradise my
first reaction to this is that is really
not clumpy so this mascara I mean my
lash is really long which is great if
you're looking to get long lashes but if
you wear glasses it's not so great
they already can't really see if you're
my glasses because there's mascara
smudged all up on there but if you want
long lashes yes if you want fake lashes
probably not
I feel like mascara is one of those
things that you can easily buy online
because it's not like lipstick where you
should like to swatch it and see what
the color looks like I would buy my
skerin Amazon if it was cheaper and
required me not walking to the store but
I think I just have to like know which
one I liked the best before I bought it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
