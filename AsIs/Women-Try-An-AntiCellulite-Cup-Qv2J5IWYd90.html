today I'm gonna give some lovely ladies
this item to try out they know nothing
about it but then it claims to help saw
your lights so scrolling through
Facebook illa day and up pop the video
about this thing I've had cellulite on
the upper part of my thighs for years
and I've tried so many things and
nothing works I'm in good company
because according to a 2004 study a
light effects between 85 and 98% of all
post-pubescent women which explains why
there are so many anti cellulite
products in the market so say a light
refers to pockets of fat that developed
right below the skin surface that caused
like an orange peel or dimpled effect
and it doesn't just occur on people who
are overweight people of any size can
get it fluid retention genetics and lack
of dermis strength can all be factors
and whether or not you get cellulite hi
I'm Hannah I've had cellulite for about
ten years when I was younger it was
really a big issue for me I didn't wear
any shorts since I was probably 15 I've
had cellulite for as long as I can
remember my relationship with cellulite
is like not really something that I
think about in terms of like the
insecurities that I have on my body it
started like in my late teens and I kind
of went through this heavier phase of my
life and so I always thought that if I
just lost the weight it would go away
but I did and it it's her to stay
everywhere
having my arms thighs stomach it's just
a genetic thing that has always been in
my family I think I probably have
cellulite on the back of my legs I'm not
a hundred percent sure just because it's
like I don't go looking for it and I see
women who are flaunting their cellulite
and not giving a I love them so
much celebrity magazine it's always like
someone's butt like in a bikini and then
it's like this person is cellulite like
oh my god
like is there anything more disgusting
in the world I think I'm kind of okay
with it because I realized that I'm not
willing to do much to try to get rid of
it ever since college I frankly flaunt
my cellulite and I don't try to hide it
anymore I'm trying to just be happy with
the body that I have I don't know if I
believe that cellulite products work
like I don't
soon why we're trying to get rid of it
why don't we just be happy and accept it
I'm skeptical about this I'm really
intrigued as to what this thing looks
like but whether or not I think it's
gonna work I don't want to like hedge my
bets on it it might change my life this
might change a bunch of women's lives
but if it doesn't work big deal I still
have cellulite so I've seen this product
from like a bunch of different websites
and not one of them can really explain
exactly how this product works something
about increasing circulation which I can
understand but also something about it
breaking down fat how do you break down
fat by just robbing it so I'm not sure
exactly how much you're supposed to use
it some websites say 5 minutes a day per
area for around 2 to 3 weeks to see if
difference today we're just going to try
it out and see how it feels this is any
kind of live creature Chloe I squared
yeah what the hell is this this is a
baby bottle cap oh they don't give me
some trouble where is this a suction cup
to suck out my cellulite bits I'll be
honest when you said like weird
cellulite thing I thought it was gonna
be a vibrator so I'm a little bit
relieved I'm not fully sure but I think
there's a suction like you like stick it
and then you suction it are you supposed
to like oh but I don't get how you
generate the suction Oh hold on you
could dent in a car where you like put
it on and the dent comes out never
thought I would up my legs on camera
very treat yourself type of day now that
I have lubed up my upper thigh attach it
to my skin until it sucks and then you
just move it around right there's like a
little planet it's like a huge pimple oh
ok so my skin is engaged oh that feels
kind of nice oh it felt really good at
first but now it feels like someone's
gonna be like a really intense hickey
make society accept me this is what we
have to do this is being a woman this is
too much work I would rather just keep
the cellulite it doesn't hurt but you
can see my legs getting kind of red yeah
it feels nice like I said like I want
someone to do this to me it's kind of
hard to use it's kind of you have to
squeeze it and each time you it's a kind
of a hard plastic I feel like I never
really got this sort of alone time with
my bod maybe I should do that more often
I don't know I think it does irritate
your skin
and muscle enough that it's swollen so
the swelling kind of reduces the
appearance of the cellulite like I'm
just stimulating my skin a lot so I feel
like that's maybe how this works smooth
over the cellulite or something I know
it's not like sucking cellulite out of
my body obviously I was a little
apprehensive because it seems like some
of the treatments that fix imperfections
are painful so I'm relieved that it
didn't hurt it's the same idea that's
behind like lip plumpers that suck your
lips in so yeah it does like plump the
surface of your skin temporarily it's
supposed to be long-term result leaves
to do it for a long time and then see
results so for now I'm just sore and
kind of unhappy but it could work like
this is actually like I feel like a nice
stress release if they marketed it for
that I think that if I'm gonna take the
time to like superficially address the
issue I should just take the time to
like work out and I feel like for me
it's like why pay $10 when not giving a
 is pretty hours of your day or
spent suction-cup being then yeah no one
will see your cellulite because it'll be
 inside all day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
