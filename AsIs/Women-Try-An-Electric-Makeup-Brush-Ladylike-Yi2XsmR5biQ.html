can't see its brain which is what Ron
Weasley's father said to Ginny before
she got involved with the Dark Lord
Shiva about the zipa they were putting
on makeup with brushes that blend
without your having to do anything
sometimes I do get like tired my arm has
cramped up before wills feeding my own
face like I feel similarly to the way I
feel about automatic toothbrushes it
just feels extraneous to me you know
that repetitive motion I feel like I've
tried a lot of things I'm skeptical I
want it to work I have faith in blend
Smart blend me smiling I hope it doesn't
like hurt us I'm gonna do my normal
everyday routine with these brushes that
Blum themselves this is the foundation
brush that I'm gonna start with sounds
like something else I'm gonna apply this
all first I think I think that's how
you're supposed to do it it does not
like the curves of my nose it sounds
like a dentist's drill Wow yeah this is
working I feel like this was just kind
of making a mess it looks like a car
wash on my face I'm not using a medium
to full coverage foundation I'm using
more of a tinted moisturizer which is
lighter and I think easier to blend
oh you can't control the direction of
this thing this thing definitely has a
line of its own also it can get caught
in your hair which is a thing I just
learned look what it did to my little
forehead hairs it just brought them into
the equation I didn't want them this is
actually doing a really good job of
blending my tinted moisturizer oh did
you see that it's sucking my eye into
the vortex you end up having to do like
so much of your own work in order to get
it even that it's like why not just take
like the extra ten seconds and then do
it yourself next up is blush don't have
blush but I do a bronzer oh that's nice
look at how much it puts down I mean I
appreciate how thorough it is hi trapper
contour
okay automated blush brush I think I
have a lot of struggle blending my blush
and like this is this is doing it I'm
really impressed actually here we go
now I'm nervous I think I put too much
on there this is actually super useful
okay let's try the bronzer well it's not
too bad I was so excited about the way
this side turned out that I forgot to
turn this off while I was getting more
products to do the other side you know
why this is working really well this has
a mind of its own but it wants to go in
the direction that it's turning like
circles so it like really naturally goes
up and down your cheekbone this has now
become a disaster okay
for blush this is super useful and
actually the brush stays pretty clean
hopefully the setting powder will help
to diminish the foolishness that just
happened I feel like we're about to
enter a blizzard like a snowstorm of
setting powder the top of this brush
head looks like Christopher Reed from
house parties hair I'm so tempted to
just put it in whilst it's running
because you know time is precious
especially when you have places to be oh
this feels amazing this brush is color
this off is one of all the brushes so
you can't do this after your dress
I feel very matte I feel like it really
rubbed that that setting powder right in
the brush is not shaped in a way where
like you can be subtle it's like either
you get a lot or you get nothing
mm-hmm I'm okay with this blush brush by
far the best one foundation brush for me
wasn't terrible either I would use it a
couple of times I had a fun sleepover
like most of the things we try do I want
to use this everyday I know the amount
of time you have to spend basically
keeping this from destroying everything
you could be blended by now this is like
when Apple put that u2 album on
everyone's iPhones when they bought it
do you guys remember that they were like
we're going to give you a makeup brush
and you don't know that you want it to
blend for you but it will blend for you
and everyone's like
the u2 album I would try this again
before I would purchase an automatic
toothbrush no hey I'll click on that
POTUS over there see more videos from
