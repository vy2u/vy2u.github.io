lip plumper
looks like a vibrator of some sort that
you put on your mouth very similar to a
sex toy maybe like a sex toy or
something it plumps your lips by
increasing blood flow to your lips I
want to try this because I keep seeing
it everywhere on Instagram and I really
want to know if it works
I am afraid to use this because I'm
afraid it's going to bruise like around
my mouth and I'm going to look
ridiculous some users may experience
mild discomfort or minor bruising I
don't know how I feel about that I think
it's going to feel like pressure like
suctioning it says that it's normal and
you should just allow your lips to be
pulled in so don't resist the suction
pray my lips don't explode here it goes
[Laughter]
hmm
OOP I feel like it has a lot of any lips
feel weird
that was so weird
mm-hmm I still feel like my lips look
the same feel like tingly maybe I do
look bigger I don't feel like they look
bigger but if anything they look Pinker
they feel bigger when I do this maybe
the top lip feels fuller what do y'all
think
it sucked my lips a lot harder than I
thought and then also like pulsated
honestly I'm not convinced that this
isn't like a sex toy the section like
catches you off-guard even though you're
expecting it still when it happens
you're kind of like oh snap
also there's spit that definitely came
out oh my no I think I may have drilled
a little bit it didn't hurt but it felt
very unpleasant at the same time you
definitely feel like just just constant
like light vibration that's how hard it
sucks I definitely feel like there's
this trend nail of like people wanting
fuller lips best something that I think
a lot of people who naturally have
fuller lips like especially people of
color we're kind of like made fun of for
a lot so it's just like all of a sudden
funny to me that now it's like this new
trend and gets like the whole Kardashian
effect I think just like with any of
this stuff it's like this makes you feel
good go ahead and do it and it doesn't
really matter if other people like it or
can notice it if like you feel good and
it doesn't hurt you go for it it seems
like this is a safer option than the
Kylie Jenner challenge so I guess that's
the positive side of it but I don't know
I feel will work on everyone I don't
think I'll be doing this again except
for fun
that that suction is surprising</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
