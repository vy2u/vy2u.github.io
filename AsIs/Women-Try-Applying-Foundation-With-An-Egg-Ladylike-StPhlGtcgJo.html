times a thousand we are applying our
makeup with a hard-boiled egg the
YouTuber pop looks did a little egg
Beautyblender hack and it's really just
sort of taken off and that's why we're
trying this I am NOT looking forward to
rubbing a hard-boiled egg all over my
face but I am interested to see if it
works let me introduce our friend Ari
she is an avid hard-boiled egg eater
eater yes I have a hard-boiled egg every
morning for breakfast I actually have a
tumultuous relationship with eggs I only
recently started liking eggs
you know maybe about 6 or 7 years ago
before then wouldn't touch him
hard-boiled eggs I think it's just a
texture thing I'm not crazy about the
way they feel which is why it's a good
thing I'm just gonna be feeling it all
over my face I don't really wear makeup
that often it's like a special occasion
for me this is a special occasion this
is egg day and day yeah I kind of like
it to look relatively natural look but
with a pop yeah
your makeup is pretty natural anyway I'm
wearing them later yeah so this is my
egg rag and these are the shells from
the egg that I ate this morning you have
an egg rag but you're gonna have to
borrow my makeup today right oh yeah was
I supposed to have makeup I am NOT going
to eat it afterwards if you have extras
we also will probably not eat those I
already have a lot to say about these
eggs whoa they're freezing I can tell
they are not organic these eggs do smell
bad because the ones that I get do not
smell this bad to be fair it is the
exact shape of a beauty blender for the
most part we had no idea that you were
gonna come in with all these egg
expectations expectations what typically
take your makeup and you
blot it all over your face like this I
gotta get someone on my set
oh me too oh my god it's already very
wet like I think that egg is too wet for
this it's not not working
the usual Beauty Blender is a lot softer
than this this is not giving me as much
bounce see Beauty blenders absorb a
foundation it's doesn't absorb the
foundation so this spreads it around
until you find the right amount of
surface area for it to be absorbed into
your skin that could be good because
that means you use less foundation
that's true I'm avoiding my nose cuz I
don't like the smell of the egg so I'm
not getting really any makeup on my nose
feel like I look like I belong in the
wax museum certain areas on my face are
blending better than others my chin is
like nah my cheeks are like hell ya feel
like you have a better applying
technique than me you have like a lot of
short vigorous caps whereas my pretty
black buster don't judge your tap sorry
just started this you just this is your
first beating game and the egg doesn't
mold so it's hard to get it into those
hard-to-reach places
- groans successful women tapping
hard-boiled eggs on our faces it's
blending a lot better than I expected it
to all I will say that there's egg
that's getting on my face we're gonna
take a little bronzer and blend in our
bronzer as well I'm doing my concealer
and color corrector which I do usually
blend out with my Beauty Blender so
we'll see how the egg does the trick
mess is dumb because it's actually
working it smells unpleasant yeah this
egg is starting to look so gross also
has hair on it has hair on it yeah I'm
not like I'm not crazy mad about this
this is so weird
this works really what do you think they
yoke like this yo part one worth as well
um well smell my face that smell okay
yeah are you doing a little bit baby
nice so we used the hard-boiled egg to
apply our foundation blend that in I did
some concealer she did some bronzer and
it was very refreshing
the texture of this hard-boiled egg is
like smooth and a little wet and it's
kind of perfect for applying foundation
this one is run this was a new
experience for you for this egg it was I
kind of want to try a real beauty
blender now I think it's cuz it was cold
it just like woke us both oh yeah and
then it's also an egg so it's screams
breakfast time I would do this again now
I wouldn't I think I might just stick
with my wet Beauty Blender I'm not mad
at this experience I'm mad that the eggs
are smelly in any emergency in the
future where I have no brushes or
blenders but I have eggs I would do it
hard-boiled egg make up eggs are for
eating lady tested lady excellent hey
never used to beauty wonder the one I
have not used to beauty blender books so
you don't know what to compare it to I
do not I just know my love for her build
eggs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
