Oh today I'm gonna try on some covergirl
virtru fruit today we're gonna try on
makeup using CoverGirl's virtual-reality
website and we're gonna try to recreate
the looks on our face ourselves or
attempt to recreate it's more like it I
really like the idea that you can
actually try on the makeup first before
buying it I definitely have used those
apps before where you can upload your
face and like see what makeup and stuff
looks like on you a lot of the times I
feel like if I'm trying on lipstick or
something let go outside my lips the
only thing I can compare it to is
snapchat and I love those filters I'm
definitely curious to see how much it's
gonna look like the real-life version of
the makeup I'm nervous that it's not
going to work out from virtual reality
to real life not because I don't trust
in the products but because I don't
trust in my own skills when I heard that
I had to recreate it I was like oh shit
okay whoa okay that is my face really
close up there's five different looks
this one's bold brows looking like this
on my face which is I mean basically
it's my brows but darker I can move my
eyebrows and it follows it look at that
it's just an eyelash on my finger feel
like I have fake eyelashes on I feel
like it's very easy to put color on
something that moves but like be like
we're putting lashes on it's weird how
realistic this looks the second look is
the no makeup makeup look there's no way
this is no makeup makeup whose lips all
this color
without any makeup on them there's like
an inner corner highlight and it's
really interesting to see you that this
like technology can find it it's pretty
accurate to my face I feel like I'll
probably need to put some fake eyelashes
on for this look perfectly matte lip oh
oh I like the dark blue lip that's
really cool my gums are a little blue I
feel like I'm going to a rock concert
with this look this one is a smoky eye
this is great because I love eyeliner I
think this thing makes you look prettier
than you really are
it smoothes your face out I saw this
ladies look on the previous page
a lot better on her face I think that's
what I would have tried to recreate
until I thought of my own fate you lied
oh I kind of like this one I don't mess
with eye shadow a lot oh my god I like
this one this is kind of like an
everyday makeup look for myself I feel
like if I'm gonna try these products I
should try something that I would
probably want to wear in my day to day
let's try second lady I'm gonna choose
the doe-eyed look I want to go out of my
comfort zone on this I'm gonna go with
the perfectly matte lip I think I'm
gonna go with the crazy smoky eye just
because I haven't done this monkey eye
in forever let's see if I can even do it
I don't know what to start with first
eye problem with this is that there's no
instructions
it just says these are the products that
we use for this look I'm probably just
gonna stick with the matte shades just
to keep it natural it kind of takes a
lot to get the pigment to show I'm gonna
go into the purple and it looks like
it's just all around my eye oh okay
that's a lot I really like this eye
shadow actually the pigmentation of it
is is pretty nice
silver silver there's definitely some
glow enos on the inner corner of the eye
that I have to put in what is it I don't
know I go ham on eyeliner okay you know
what this is fine I think with shimmery
eyeshadows I feel like it doesn't cover
up super well try and take a little bit
maybe of this shimmery guy and just hope
oh god if brother it's like 10 times
darker on the thing so there's black and
I guess I'm going in there with it I'm
giving myself a little bit of seriously
this is really sensitive
oh my god look I'm going to a Halloween
party maybe on like a white person this
would be more pigmented it does look way
more pigmented in the picture that's
another bad you definitely can't get
like a fan brush in here so I'm just
gonna put a little on my cheeks with my
fingers this mascara is actually really
good like it is giving me the link that
I want I don't understand why this is
part of the look because it's not blue
it's more like a gray I need
to be a felt-tip pen type situation this
is way too tiny I'm gonna mess this up
so bad I'm making this up as I go along
I love a good bold lip
there was no mascara mentioned in the
full product list I clearly have lashes
in this that are much longer than my
actual lashes kind of dried it's like
kind of hard to get the product out yeah
I would definitely put this on with like
a brush trying to put it on with this
it's kind of like you don't know what
kind of control you have well it's not
dark enough nothing on my face is dark
enough as lipstick is so dry right now
ah it was smells really good I did the
best with what I had I don't know if
it's like completely perfect but you
know we had some stumbling walks along
the way like not knowing which shades
were exactly placed where the color is
pretty accurate it feels like that one
seems a little bit more glossy
I like this lip stuff actually it's
light and doesn't feel too dry but it
just doesn't look like the one on the
website I actually think this looks
better than the picture it's definitely
brighter I just feel sad to get a cool
smokey eye I just look a bit dirty if
other brands had something like this I
think you would help way more it's hard
being a woman of color because like you
don't know that these are necessarily
like calibrated for your skin type like
we saw with the lipstick for me the
pigmentation wasn't what it was in the
picture would be really cool if they
personalized it to my face shape or my
style I'm gonna go steal this lipstick
