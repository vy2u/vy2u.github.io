expect that I am about to be in for a
world of pain you guys are looking great
today we're trying bar method I have no
idea what a class looks like I think
that it'll remind me of dance which is
fun but also trick me into working out
which is also fun
I feel like bar method is one of those
things that beautiful girls who wear
yoga pants but still look really put
together all the time do I'm not really
put together I think it's gonna be a lot
of the stuff that I used to do at a bar
like this forever I don't know and then
you're like plie and you're like lifts
you like yep
oh this is plie my name is crystal
welcome to the bar method downtown LA
the bar method is an interval class we
utilize certain elements of a ballet
class like the bar and stretch anyone
can do this workout it's safe and
effective how do you think we're gonna
do you guys obviously are very fit you
enjoy working out I think you guys are
gonna do amazing we're ready to go when
you are right guys so today you're gonna
be joined by great she's one of our
instructors here so if you ever need a
form reference she's here to keep you
guys on track and right away you're
gonna start to lift your knees up to the
height of your hips lift lift
so the warm-up starts and it's already
pretty intense from the get-go
I already feel it in my abs but I'm
gonna feel it more right now release
come down to the floor for a plank we're
doing push-ups and our movements I've
got these rebound weights behind me and
we're just doing these tiny little
pulses but it's the hardest thing this
is the warmup right yes the warm-up is
incredibly hard my body's already on
fire that's what I expected oh we get
through the warm-up and we go into this
nice stretch and she reminds us that
we're gonna stretch after every exercise
which is like a dream come true
I wish the stretches could last forever
they feel great too so calm
this is nice yeah and before I know it
I'm back at the pan shaking so hard
shaking is good kind of we're starting
to do a couple reps and I'm thinking oh
this isn't so bad
and the next thing I know we're doing 10
reps 20 reps 30 reps 60 reps last 10 1 2
4 5 6 7 I got you a I did not know that
holding my leg up was going to be so
hard my left foot is tired yeah we're
about half way and it is a slow burn
it's a fast burn for me we're doing
strength here it is last 20 and you're
done immediately followed by stretching
immediately qualify intensive high rep
strength we've got these mats up against
the wall and I'm thinking to myself oh
this can't be so bad we're literally
leaning against a wall I was wrong
this is terrible my abs burn my quads
burn my butt first now we're in the ab
section and abs are always one of my
favorite parts of working out I am
having a great time but also I am in
pain we're almost done
it feels like little fire ants are just
crawling on labs as I started getting
over how hard it was and just dealing
with it I kind of started having more
fun I feel like Beyonce
we are Beyonce right now this class was
absolutely nothing like I thought it
would be I thought that I was in for a
world of ballet and it turned out to be
a really cool combination of ballet
Pilates yoga all in one very difficult
package it was so hard it didn't feel
like they have class to me at all I
think what is similar to dance is having
to lift your own body and your own body
being the thing that's keeping you back
this is one of those things that's
really really hard but also really
really fun and really really good for
you so I had a good time and I would
definitely come back you guys are all
done give yourselves a hand guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
