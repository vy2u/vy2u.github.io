which me soft and our friend Devon try
out some bath bombs I ordered like a
bunch of cool ones from online and I
kind of up and they're not gonna
get here in time instead we're gonna
make bath bombs we're gonna make a bunch
of pant bombs tonight and then we are
gonna test them out tomorrow in Devon's
bath tubs gonna be great today we will
be bathing and using bath bombs we are
here at Devon's house because she's the
only person of ours that is responsible
enough to have a clean bathtub you've
paid your shower before we're going to
be judging the bath bombs on a scale of
1 to 5 and we're gonna be judging them
based on the silkiness of your skin the
color and the transformation of the
water and just like how fun they are I'm
just here for the black bath bomb I
think I remembered why I don't do this I
don't like fit in here
very well I'm intrigued by the glitter
and the color because this is like my
favorite color ever it's not a dramatic
change where the bath bomb hits the
water hope they're good something I
think they're fizzing but the gradual
turning of the water from clear to pink
is a pleasant surprise I feel like I'm
taking a bath and cotton candy water it
is a little like Lady Macbeth you know
out out damn spot in terms of silkiness
my skin does feel really soft right now
so I probably give it like a 4 a lot of
transformation I here before I mix it up
a little bit it's pink but it's not
super opaque this is their really fun
kind of the solid 4.5
now we have a citrusy one which like
will wake you up
it's got like a very rich yellow color
looks like a little wad lemonhead Oh
like pee yeah oh my god you can't really
look at this and feel great about it but
it smells incredible I think this one's
a little bit more green to it to be
honest with you because it feels I'm
gonna gain like an exfoliation I give it
a four for skin smoothness for
transformation it's gonna have to be one
out of five because anyone saw me do
this they were just really think I peed
I feel like this is the kind of fun that
I would have and not tell anyone yeah
let's give it a three I feel such a
kinship with this bath bomb you know
what's funny is the last ones like pee
and this one might look like
is your black feels like a thin mint
this part is really fun I feel like I'm
in a lava lamp this is amazing
oh it smells just like peppermint in
fact it's so company my eyes are like
water a little bit because of the amount
of peppermint it's like very very tingly
and it kind of it doesn't hurt but it
feels cold it's invigorating is what I
was saying I think it speaks for itself
in terms of transformation this is a
complete five terms of like silh penis
this feels amazing so that's five five
million out of five for fun this is the
most fun thing that I've done all week
how's that go so much fun yeah yeah I
had a pretty good time
I got watched in the bath by a camera
and two women and that's really all that
I need we all smell so good right now
we all smell quite wonderful does it
seem worth it like y'all think you dis
again yeah I would totally do this again
the peppermint indeed made it very cold
on your skin but it does feel super
refreshing after the fact
a lady tested lady approves lady liked
all the lazy things yeah ladies so fresh
so I'm hungry yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
