browse on dogs I kind of feel like that
right now but I feel ears
it's Fashion Week season and that means
bizarre beauty care the photos are
awesome but could I pull off a
high-fashion beauty look it's ladylike
and today we're wearing runway makeup
IRL I don't follow
runway trends at all I think that if I
was invited to Fashion Week or like the
after parties or like the turnips I
would be super into it but because it
seems so unattainable I just kind of
like block it out I follow runway trends
in like fashion trends but I never wear
them because they just cannot happen in
real life
I've seen some crazy things where people
like put diapers on their heads or
something like that and it's like why I
would say for me it's more like an art
to admire from afar I kind of like to do
my makeup the same way every day I'm
Leon and I'm gonna do the girls makeup
today today we're doing a glitter
contour on Freddie a black graphic brow
on Candace and a white slicked back hair
and bold lip on Sofia and I'm excited to
see these girls rock these looks all
right Candace so today we're gonna be
doing a graphic bold brow and a
slicked-back Shinyoung
okay good cuz my hair is really
dirty I do like wearing black lipstick
but the white hair we'll see I'm excited
a little worried because I do feel like
we're taking two very extreme concepts
and colliding them into one I love when
people brush my hair like if this what
it means to be a model
put me on board this feels very facial
esque I kind of wanna fall asleep oh man
or did I forgive you
okay oh it's very cold I feel like I'm
spray-painting him yeah I feel like a
house I also kind of feel like I'm gonna
look like a mermaid like a space mermaid
a black space mermaid like that is just
a lot of different things than one
I feel really aerodynamic right now do
you feel like Gigi Hadid no but maybe I
will when I see myself they like runway
models just go through a lot of crazy
stuff and look very effortless and
flawless when they walk down the runway
hopefully as I walk down the street I
can look effortless and flawless but I
don't know if that'll be a thing that
was so much sitting still I was hard
though
I can't as soon as you're like oh my god
Wow whoa what do you think I look evil
but in like a good way I look like an
angry bird I mean I definitely feel like
a crazy person
but I also feel really fierce
I feel like with a look like this you
have to just walk around with like so
much confidence and then people would be
like yeah
yes okay I'm gonna go get a salad see
how people react to this we've already
walked about ten feet and that crazy
response is like Oh ladies
and this is BuzzFeed where people
already know we're doing something crazy
and they're still surprised hey Jen hey
buddy hello oh push it you guys look
nice is something else good or bad it's
different you guys know I'm four of us
look okay I really wish that I had a
runway outfit to go with my runway
makeup and like really complete the look
but the runway makeup is kind of giving
me life here I'm like damn she looks
like that mean mom for The Parent Trap
but like a really cool to look cool
fierce as bugs it's kind of an
adrenaline rush times like look at me
witness me when I was ordering my
sandwich
the guy was extremely happy and kind of
just like how can I help you so after
the first couple of people who laughed
and stared I pretty much just been
completely ignored since then
do not want to spectate they want to
just look away but that's okay the world
is my runway right now so a lot of
people are like really taken aback and
shocked and disgusted at first and then
they like give it 30 seconds and then
what's wrong you look crazy okay so I'm
feeling like my face that was crazy
now that glitter is everywhere but she
and her self said you should wear the
glitter all the time looks pretty cool
surprising I love that the longer I had
it on the longer out I started feeling
myself you know and I was like wow like
I actually look pretty cool I was pretty
badass even if it was like I feel
uncomfortable or it was just a laugh
people definitely reacted I think like
that's the point of runway makeup is to
make people think or feel something and
I think that's the point of art so that
was cool I could totally see myself
doing something like this definitely
maybe not in the workplace but like do a
cool like summer festival outdoor
festival Coachella or like afropunk
I feel like I'll definitely experiment
more with makeup I don't think I'll do
this but maybe something more unusual
maybe not the hair but lady tested lady
approved - the mom jeans yeah well it's
just like yeah a lot of different looks
happening yeah that's cool we're doing a
mom jeans video at the same time so it's
not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
