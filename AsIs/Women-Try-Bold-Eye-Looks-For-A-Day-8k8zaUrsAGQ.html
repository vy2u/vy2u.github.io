add more glitter I was like Oh God but
Oh God in the best way I'm jasmine and
I'm known around the office for wearing
some bold eye looks once in a while I
get so much inspiration from following
go fast people on Instagram but just
trying all these new eye makeup looks
that I thought it would be cool to
challenge some of my friends to rock a
bold eye look for a day let's bring them
in
the most bold I've ever done is a cat
eye I'm the type of girl to just show of
me like hey Here I am
well looks like me nervous I don't want
to draw too much attention I feel good
about bold eye makeup when I see it on
other people and I don't know her myself
because I don't usually wear a lot of
makeup I think makeup is just another
way to express yourself but I keep my
pretty muted feel like bold I look so
really for like print journalism or like
a runway so maybe this will be another
thing I can ask my love to set me apart
I think it'll be fun and it will help me
rethink the looks that I do on a daily
basis I'm here for it I think jazz with
rockers are bollocks every day and I'm
like did y'all thanks is so you know it
can be done can I pull it off we'll find
out I used to play a lot more with my
look but as I've aged I've become really
sedentary my style
when you're near 20s you think a lot
about maintaining the identity you've
already fought for instead of
rediscovering who you can be through
makeup so I'm excited to rediscover
myself and my creative spirit in general
my relationship with makeup is one that
hasn't been fully developed part of that
is I don't want to embarrass myself by
doing something wrong so I'd rather just
not do it
and that seems really bizarre to me
because as a person I like to go for
things that I'm very bold and engage and
it's something that I think could be
more reflected in my look and in the
makeup that I do and just have fun I was
never really into makeup too heavy
growing up young ladies are always
taught to be calm be quiet don't put
yourself in the spotlight and I feel
like these bold looks are gonna do just
that it's kind of
knocking down everything that people
taught us as young girls I'm so excited
my eyes feel heavy so I feel like
they're heavy with eating I like it a
lot
oh this is gorgeous wow this is like a
dream I didn't know I had until it was
actual eyes on my face I have an art
piece on my face I love this like very
like pop art meets like abstract
expressionist meets like I don't know I
have on guard drag queen can I take this
out now can I go give this look to the
world you look like you look like you're
walking down I love it you like it yeah
it's very
black swuan yeah and I feel like you're
more of a white swan but you can pull it
off festive it's like a Mardi Gras I
love how much it pops on my skintone I
feel like a peacock or like a rare bird
of paradise I was worried that I'd be
really worried about people commenting
on it but I've realized that my look is
so uniquely my own I really don't care
what people think
it's reaffirming that like the aesthetic
choices I make with my look are mine and
mine alone and it's more about how I
feel and because I feel comfortable I'm
not nervous or self-conscious in any way
shape or form I touch my face and my
eyes a lot I already have touched my
eyes at least three times but it's been
about five minutes it's happy as hell
under these false lashes and it's kind
of mushy once I got over that I learned
to just calm down and not touch my face
and realized how many people were
complimenting me and making me feel like
a rock star
it's like spooky but also like totally
everyday I was really overwhelmed and
touched some people were not feeling it
they were like what the hell are you
doing
and it was a little discouraging at
first but then of course there were
other people who were like wow this is
such a cool look I love what you did Wow
oh my god I love the glitter I love all
of the colors it's very eye-catching
it's definitely not like I've just go
into the market but be pretty it all
goes to show fashion is in the eye of
the beholder went out tonight I wore it
the whole time and you know what nobody
really cares but me so maybe realize
that I can't pull out a bold look I can
try something new and that's really
powerful and cool it was a really great
experience I mean it wasn't for
everybody but I was able to embrace it
with this challenge so shout out to you
jazz I gotta say I had a blast
I think the eyelashes particularly near
the end of the day they've started to
get loose and so that kind of like
throws off the look I don't feel so good
I don't really think this is a lesson to
me to continue to like excavate and try
new things just because you can have
your like a routine makeup look down
doesn't mean there isn't something else
that you could learn I really recommend
this to people I think it's good to push
yourself outside of your comfort zone I
was like oh yeah you're staring at me
of course you're staring at me I'm
fabulous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
