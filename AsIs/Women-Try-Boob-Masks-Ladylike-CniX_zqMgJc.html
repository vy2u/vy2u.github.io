be like boob masks yes you heard that
right
sheet masks for your boobs why how who
where when it's ladylike and today we're
trying breast masks when I hear the term
boob mask I think like Zorro mask for
your boobs just like straight across
with the nipples exposed I just picture
a caricature of a boob wearing a Freddy
Krueger mask a boob mask is called a bra
opening this why are we doing this I
like trying out strange skincare
products I'm down for it I'm highly
skeptical of anything happening because
it's like with boob it's not like it's
just the skin you know like the skin
isn't the only thing that's like holding
it up if I was gonna lift something up I
would not use a soggy piece of fabric
these look fun there's a leopard on it I
get this oh the gold standard
well gold apparently restores the
elasticity and skin only the most
luxurious rib eyes for my boobs
oh my busty there's an exclamation point
and then an exclamation point plus a
question mark I see this one's called
mask Kingdom pearl and Rose sexy
charming bamboo charcoal breast mask
well I do love charcoal lemonade so step
one I will do robe just another day make
it at work it's weird to be naked with
your shoes on okay I will say I am kind
of excited to exfoliate because just
with the weather change recently one of
the marshes has been feeling a little
dry liquid just spurted out of this okay
well if it's gonna be like that like no
frame of reference for how much I'm
supposed to use smells like a like a
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works peach candle some
sheet masks are like gel and other sheet
masks are just wet pieces of paper Oh
literally some juice just fell out onto
my shoe and I guess this is where the
nipple goes I was coming in with a lot
of skepticism which hasn't left me but
I'm now excited just because these are
so cute feels like I just got slimed
feels like I'm on Nickelodeon double
dare and my boobs just lost oh it's cold
and it's wet it feels cool like a
cooling gel my nipple which was soft and
warm it's been called to attention it is
actually pretty relaxing I'm gonna use
two on each boob because each one is not
big enough right now my nipple is acting
like a little coat hook the smell makes
up for a lot it does smell like very
nice jasmine tea they are sticking well
they're sticking quite nicely
literally it lies flat and then nipple
and then drifting in the wind but for
some reason I just I feel like I have to
hold them I don't usually do anything
special for my boobs so they do feel
like a little bit romanced who us the
aftermath it's just kind of wet I don't
really know what it was just wet I feel
very sticky like two very luxurious
slugs have slid down my chest so this
cream has aloe olive oil macadamia nut
and shea butter this whole thing is just
kind of weird right
but I think it feels kind of nice
there's a lot of excess viscous liquid
so I'm just rubbing that in also my
hands are covered in glitter it does
feel moisturized and I feel sticky I
don't feel flaky I mean I feel colder I
just feel soothed and nicely scented
it's stickier than I'd like to feel on a
Monday I generally reserved my
stickiness for weekends well now I'm
just confused
moments ago I was shirtless with two wet
lily pads on my boobs and now fully
clothed it again though it's been an
hour so since the boob masks I was
hoping my bra smelled like the jasmine
tea scent but it doesn't they feel very
cold they don't feel sticky anymore they
feel the kind of sauce that makes you
want to touch your boobs
in the middle of your workplace like my
boobs do feel smooth they're not sticky
at all and like that's kind of fun and
they do feel a little bit bouncier the
mask didn't do what it promised to do
which was plumping that seems like an
outrageous claim to make so I don't know
how it would have even gotten close to
that the simmer from this mask have
gotten all over me I'm like covered in
glitter I feel like a vampire from 2010
I feel like I'm split though like I
don't know if I want to recommend this
but it definitely wasn't the worst maybe
for special occasions like a date night
or Christmas I am pleased that I got
exfoliated got a cool gel situation and
that I moisturize
we tried boob masks we didn't you didn't
anything I got softer but like do I
really need to be soft enough for I'm
just like look how soft I am all day at
bombas yeah at the office is always the
X Factor where you're like I this could
have been fun but we did it at the
office yeah I mean one thing fun about
mine was that it was really manageable
like it was gooey but it was only gooey
where the pasty was and it made Marshall
n less dry I mean as much as I like
being sticky for half an hour every week
I don't like it that much
the funny thing is I am even more
confused about them like I thought I was
gonna be like definite like no don't use
this and now I'm like maybe use it I
mean it wasn't bad lady tested ladies at
parties if you want to then go right
ahead
and if you don't want to you don't
really need to they're your boobs do
what you want with them thank you so
