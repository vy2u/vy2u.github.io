peel-off mask and I'm ready to get some
gunk out of my nose so a lot of times I
feel like my skin on my face is oily
like my pores are big sometimes it tends
to be a little on the dry side I have
combination skin my skin is very
temperamental so I'm always looking for
new skin care that's gonna kind of
address these issues I caught it oh it's
pink cuz it's a pink mask
it says I'm peeling myself on the front
I always like a pun on the front of my
Mosques the last time I did a peel-off
mask was two nights ago so my skin is
ready confession I've never actually
done a peal of moss before which is
insane so it's an innovative peel-off
mask that helps this scheme the clarity
and helps minimize the appearance of
pores something about rose does I mean
it smells like rose it smells kind of
like medical actually witch hazel Lee
that's a nice pink
it looks like pepto-bismol but a little
less like watery I'm like kind of
already in love with the smell I can't
smell flowers I can't smell anything I
feel like I'm playing candy on my face
whoa Oh cold oh it's very tacky but it's
like a peel-off mat so it's supposed to
be tacky so I realized I got it on my
eyebrows I really need my eyebrows I'll
try to wipe it off we'll see missing the
brows said I have close to my always to
go I'm useless guys I feel like face
masks are like work like I can't just do
this in the morning you know oh there's
a hair in it
I look like Frank and airy that weird
Frankenstein cereal thing so the mask is
on I'm going to be waiting 30 minutes or
at least until it's completely dry to
see if I can pull any blackheads out of
my face then I take it off and I become
a supermodel
all right it's been 30 minutes or
possibly more I can't talk and I have a
headache and my face is as dry as the
desert feels very tight around my pores
in my nose area but those edges are like
lifting dude do this like multiple times
a week like why so the ultimate mask
dream is to always have it all off on
one full sheet huh Wow okay I think
that's it want to hold it doesn't hurt
thankfully did you do it this is now
part of my face oh why wow it's a lot
stronger than I thought it was sorry
this is taking me a while I'm very
uncomfortable and as I put it off like
you do a band-aid I don't think it's
pulling hairs it's definitely just
pulling that extra top layer of my skin
I almost don't want to rip it like I
just want it to be like a face mask that
I can just give to my friends its
presence or something Jesus I was kicked
oh this hurts there's some baby here's
they got con this one okay hold on why
did he go do this this is weird guys
this is a casual appeal this is nothing
too insane like I feel like if you had
sensitive skin you probably be able to
like handle this mask
I'm stinging Oliver but I think that's
why I'm fault for leaving it on too long
I mean it definitely took some show off
my face that's for sure oh my skin feels
very soft not quite like a baby's butt
but you know as close as it's gonna get
at my age I would do this again
I love boscia products I wish it smelled
more like rose it does feel smooth it
feels very smooth oh it got rid of a lot
of the oiliness that I had this is just
like the kind of feel-good stuff that I
want to do cuz I know I'm not gonna rip
my face off with this which is great I'm
an idiot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
