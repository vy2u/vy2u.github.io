don't think I've ever used charcoal
tooth whitening but hipsters find a way
of using new stuff for things that you
already thought you were good on this
 is all over my Instagram every
beauty guru I follow has done this is
charcoal supposed to be like really good
for is like natural whitening we're here
to find out I'm scared it's gonna taste
like dirt like just straight dirt why do
you think about yeah I think about my
face
chalky everything is bad for you
everything is good for you I don't even
know anymore yes so let's why not the
charcoal in our mouth yeah it's already
all over my head oh my god it's just
like pure joy
oh I immediately regret this to flushed
Cheers you just do like this oh really
Drive it doesn't it looks horrified do I
look like a beauty blogger Oh sick
finally the inside of my soul who came
up with this the hippies oh my god I
think it's quite whiter hey our teeth
really would whiter I feel like I don't
know I don't all right I'm done what's
up
what kind of magic blasphemy is this oh
I feel like I'm popping a little bit
right now this is way better I think
than some sort of strip or other product
that has so many chemicals whiten your
teeth that's amazing damn charcoal
I think the paste might be more
manageable than the powder is super into
this I think this one's gonna work
better because it's actually like piece
yeah oh this doesn't look like something
you want to put on your teeth it doesn't
look appealing oh oh there Wow mom god I
don't like the texture all right take
care
oh all right bro sir oh I do not look
like an idiot well you brush your teeth
with this one uh-huh how long do you do
that yo our teeth are poor or
lighter I feel like for some reason I
really like the powder better uh-huh
good this is maybe cheaper maybe it's
easier because it's a toothpaste but the
identical is Potter yeah so I didn't
know about anything about charcoal
coming into this and I'm amazed how
effective it was and how cheap it is and
now like organic it is I probably get
both of these
I have never do something that actually
works so quick in my life after one use
of these our teeth do look a little
whiter yeah see this is too much work
for me I'm a very simple girl I don't
like too much bus and this just seems
like it'd be a whole lot of fuss I'm the
opposite I'm a company's bitch I like a
little struggle in my life is adding
this my routine is perfect the way I
look right now is unacceptable like how
do you look I'm just a messy is all
right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
