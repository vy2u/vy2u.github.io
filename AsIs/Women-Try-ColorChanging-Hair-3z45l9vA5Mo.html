it I changed my hair color just as often
as people change their clothes for me
it's just really about expressing myself
I never used to color my hair until this
year I started playing around with some
different colors and I think it's really
fun so today we are trying heat reactive
hair color I hear it changes color with
heat I don't know how that works I'm a
little bit of a skeptic I want it to
work so I can just be like a dope-ass
person walking around with different
hair every second but we'll see if that
becomes a reality
my name is Lisette Cruz the type of heat
that you could use off Pravana Vivid's
mood color bands from just walking into
the Sun from touching it breathing on it
blow-dryer Flatiron I'm so excited to
show the girls they're gonna be blown
away so this is one of our colors and
this is tropical peach that turns into
transparent which exposes the blonde
piece underneath this one in particular
is lime green this one's a sunny yellow
you ready this can get weird when it
cools down it goes right back to its
peachy color Oh
Oh
I'm gonna test this out and I'm
making my hands cold this is crazy I
still don't know how it works but it
works I feel like I'm about to get my
letter to go into Hogwarts because I
look like an Wizard of in here this is
gonna be so much fun I can't wait to go
check my coworkers that's a magic like
Harry Potter wizardry hello like hot air
on my
been touching I wouldn't even watch
just put your cold hand on my head
my god this is crazy
you should write like a 69 I brought the
hot water what the what does that mean
it went would you I feel like my hair is
pretty greasy because people have been
touching all day but I also never want
to wash it again because I want this to
last forever I'm trying to make this not
sound like an ad but honestly it was so
cool it was like I was walking around
with a little magic trick all day
if you like if I were to just see this
online I would never believe that it
works but it totally works this was just
a really cool like temporary change that
I didn't have to commit to and I think
it's a really good way for like people
to just try something new
she's not the flavor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
