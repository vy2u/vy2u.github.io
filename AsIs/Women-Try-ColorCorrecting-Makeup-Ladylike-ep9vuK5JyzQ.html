put this all over my face what would I
look like I can't detect like different
colors in my skin all I see is white is
this purple or is this purple like I own
one item of color correcting it's like
concealer but it's peach color for my
dark circles because I do have dark
circles the only thing I know about
color correction is in Adobe Premiere
when I'm editing videos like kind of the
coal walking of makeup you have to just
hope through putting this green stuff on
your face doesn't burn you bad yeah I
also have a hard time with the concept
of undertones I don't even know where to
start there's like yellow red purple
green my mother never taught me this
the Stila compact comes with this handy
dandy a face map for where you should be
putting these colors there is like pie
charts and oh this is what's a
crayon look at that oh yeah what color
my bags he's gonna tell me that
apparently green counteracts red so I'm
gonna color myself green just hope for
the best I know I have purple bags so
I'm going to use the yellow which will
cancel out my purple faces my face is
already the color of aged parchment so I
don't need to go any more yellow what's
the difference between cancels purple
and calms redness like my face is so red
that it's like don't really know where
to stop I'm just gonna like keep going
and I'm I'm nervous for you I feel like
I'm a Navi right now from Avatar I'm
really like it alright it seems like
I've already done too much but my
undereyes are my concern area so it's
fine that I did a lot final I don't know
if I'm doing this right yeah no they
definitely did not teach us how to do
this in girls school hey heeey words on
a page what could they mean I feel like
a Monet art project remember that quote
from clueless oh my gosh she's a full of
Monet what's that mean oh you know from
far away it's okay but close-up is a big
old man yeah all the people in these
pictures look really nice they don't
need color correction yeah they're
already colored there seems to
be white dots around her mustache I
think I made my mustache worse than it
looks like I have a 5 o'clock shadow
shall we blend
we cancel out all these colors and then
what color are we am I supposed to be
invisible my skin definitely looks like
less like I just sort of like trolled it
with a brush and more like intentional I
think I'm done I think I'm ready ready
to move on ready move forward yeah
feeling good about that
am I done walking into this blind was
challenging we know nothing about our
faces it looks like someone put like one
sheet mask on you and like it's all like
one color I'm like wearing someone
else's face yeah yeah
there's no non-creepy way to describe
someone else's skin you look very creamy
thank you I'm so happy I look so creamy
I kind of feel like a ghost right now I
need to go to Sephora sit down with an
expert and I would be happy to buy these
color correcting tools I did learn that
there are multiple ways to sort of
conceal your bags this is rather light
feeling it definitely aggravated like a
lot of like my dry patches I can cover
that with hair this is how to color
correct and I think we did it
if you do your dog redid it really well
concealer ain't the only thing thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
