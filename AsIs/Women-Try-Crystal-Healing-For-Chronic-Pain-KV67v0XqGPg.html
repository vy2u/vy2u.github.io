crystals and gemstones are able to treat
ailments based off their color and
chemical make yeah but it's like what
else is healing us certainly not science
I have Kelsey and I wore in our lives
fucking sucks pretty much yeah a lot of
the time yeah we both live with chronic
pain and we're not just talking about
like oh my shoulder hurts a lot cuz I'm
getting old I have a neuropathic pain
called trigeminal neuralgia and I have
enemy trio sis among many other pelvic
floor dysfunction issue the difference
between the two chronic pains that we
have was that yours is possibly from
just genetics that is just something you
were born with and mine came from a
mistake that a doctor me but I've never
tried crystal healing have you I have
not I have a crystal dildo to be honest
that someone recently gave me because
they felt like it was gonna heal me but
you supposed to shove another thing like
we use things like comedy as a defense
to get through the day
after I did a video a couple weeks ago
where I tried medical marijuana for my
chronic pain I thought what else could
we try absolutely because right anything
right at this point if someone told you
to like stand on your head and sing the
ABCs you do it right probably already
have hi my name is Juliana Davis I'm a
Reiki Master crystal healer sound healer
spiritual teacher psychic medium and the
owner of aura Lux oh my gosh how long is
your business card
what is crystal healing crystal healing
it is using crystals which come in all
various different kinds forms colors for
healing they have one of the most pure
geometric structures in all of nature
you actually can put an intention into a
crystal or program a crystal to do
something and it will vibrate in that
energy it's hard to get in that mindset
of not being like what the hell are we
doing here and take it seriously though
I don't want to disrespect to the
practice in any way like I want to take
it seriously but the government is
fucking weird I'm sure to God like what
are we actually doing
sometimes I wonder who I would be if I
didn't have chronic pain oh my god I
think I would be a different person like
I'd be less angry and irritable yeah
are you ready yeah I'll try anything
and just feeling into the endometriosis
and everything that you've been through
with the surgeries and the pain and the
frustration and I'm feeling some
hopelessness as well Penn Medicine warns
be wary when someone says that Wales and
crystals can cure chronic medical
conditions since those things have not
been proven oil and crystal should ease
as complementary medicine used in
addition to rather than instead of
regular treatment so why is crystal
healing something that you would
prescribe to people over regular
medicine like vicodin I wouldn't
prescribe it in lieu of anything I think
that's the mistake or misinformation
that's out there because it can very
much complement Western medicine this is
lapis lazuli which is great for our
third eye and I'm gonna put it there for
you Penn Medicine also points out that
crystal healing may have a placebo
effect on people because patients
experience a positive outcome I am
highly susceptible to suggestion I've
taken a test before it actually says
that I would be a really good candidate
for placebo medication visualize
yourself walking through a beautiful
forest on a bright warm sunny summer day
you might feel it in a way where you
feel heat or cold sensations moving
through your body you might feel
electrical pulses or waves of energy
moving through your body you might just
get into a very deeply relaxed state and
almost fall asleep so you're in like
this deep meditative state
some people have actual physical
releases their central nervous system
will release does it ever not work for
people I think that once you get on the
table and are actually receiving the
treatment it's hard to deny that
something is happening
I've tried Botox I've had surgery I've
had things stuck to me that shock my
muscles
I've tried changing my diet
approximately three million different
times at the end of the day there is no
cure I think I've tried I mean every
pill known to mankind which has terrible
side effects I've had needles stuck into
my brainstem I've done every kind of
scan every kind of weird Eastern pill
mix of spices and changing my diet
massage therapy physical therapy I think
if you are used to be realistic yeah you
are as well yeah there's no magic pill
that I'm gonna take that's gonna cure me
but to me like being cured isn't so much
never having pain again because I don't
think that's realistic for my life I
think it's coming to terms with it and
being better equipped at how to deal
with it and I guess that's like my goal
like that would be a cure to me you feel
it a lot in my hands yeah yeah it like
literally feels like something's like
vibrating in man's feel the grass and
the earth beneath your body supporting
you as you gaze up into the sky gaze up
into the sky
see beautiful white fluffy clouds and as
you're gazing up at these clouds you
notice this beautiful beam of light
begin to shine down towards you I've
never experienced anything like that
before I just feel really relaxed and at
ease so I was like incredibly
uncomfortable pretty much the entire
time like I was like itchy and my foot
was twitching maybe it's wishful
thinking but it felt like she was
pulling some of my pain out of my
stomach how's your pain feel I don't
have any right now maybe it's a placebo
effect
maybe it's the meditation but going into
this like I have felt like shit all day
like my stomach hurt really bad
when I laid down and I feel better now
the coolest part though was with the
sound therapy I mean I could just feel
that vibrating on all these muscles and
because I don't have any feeling in my
face I was able to feel it in other
areas that felt really good
the pain where it normally is is not as
severe right now so I definitely think
there's some sort of connection between
the crystals and the relaxation that it
brought but I can't say this relax I got
fucking function as a human and boss ass
bitch and take over the world and shit
so it's like where's the compromise I
can't just be like taking an hour out of
my day every day to get to this level of
relaxation to not feel pain so just take
that weight off my chest was just one of
the more freeing experiences that I've
had and it's hard to do that cuz you
don't want to burden people and you
don't want to burden yourself but it
gets really heavy and it was like I felt
the weight coming off I think anyone who
has a chronic pain should come at least
do this at least once so that someone
can read you and feel places that your
body is trying to tell you something and
we can't always be in tune with our
bodies the way that someone who's
practicing this every day can be I
absolutely want to do this again even if
it's just to take an hour for myself
every couple of weeks and allow myself
to feel exactly
feeling and be worth it I'm not gonna
stop going to physical therapy I'm not
gonna stop seeing my doctor and I'm not
gonna stop seeing my psychologist but I
think adding this end and giving myself
another outlet to just deal with the
shit that comes with chronic pain it's
important to do that for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
