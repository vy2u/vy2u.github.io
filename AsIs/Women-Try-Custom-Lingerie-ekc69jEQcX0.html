lot of difficulty buying on jury from
typical stores a lot of times I don't
know where the clothes came from I don't
know who made them I have like really
tiny itty bitty titties and then like a
huge ass your girl's not finding
anything I have a difficult time buying
lingerie from typical chain stores just
because I always feel rushed you're in a
changing room there's always other
people waiting knocking at the doors
either the top doesn't fit right the
bottom doesn't fit right or I just don't
feel particularly confident in it my
body have a smaller waist I have bigger
breasts and it's definitely hard to find
something that just fits you perfectly
you go in and you see these girls and
they kind of advertise that plus-size
girls can go in there too but I don't
think I've ever been able to find my bra
size other than a clearance rack at
Marshall's this week we're going to be
trying custom lingerie I'm Monica
designer and founder of you Sirona
lingerie should feel like second skin it
should be both beautiful and comfortable
we offer over 60 different sizes as well
as free custom sizing most of our
lingerie is made specifically for the
person who's ordered it today I will be
meeting with three different women and I
will be creating a bralette and panty
for each one I'm interested to see how
the lingerie looks and what their
thoughts are hi I'm Deanna hi I'm Monica
nice to meet you it will meet you so
what are you looking for today maybe
something a little lacy maybe a halter
I'm thinking white probably sexy but
sweet cute okay fun
I love pinks I'm working for like 1950s
pinup meets the woman you see at the
grocery store in her sweatpants hot but
like super cozy and relaxed Heike
without seeming to be here at you
serrano we can gather all of your
information and we'll send you something
that will fit you well so you don't have
to you know rush to decide how you feel
yay so what's this pretty little thing
we have a wraparound style very
adjustable in the back you have
three rows of hook-and-eye it really
does look like a modern take on a corset
yeah it's like a course of it doesn't
impress you it just loves ya I'm gonna
gather your measurements and based on
the things that we've talked about I
will surprise you with some styles and
we will messenger them over to you in
some tote bags it's really become the
catalyst for me to listen to a lot of
different women of what things are
missing in terms of representation with
models in terms of offering more sizes
and to not just answer it in a way that
only speaks to me feeling like I didn't
see women like me growing up in
magazines but that speaks to women in a
more larger identifying way today it is
so beautiful
there was a caller there's a bra
underwear and also she even gave me
little stockings like sexy and then one
of these things I don't know what
they're calls but I know you like to
pull them off at the wedding so here it
is on as you can see it doesn't fit
quite like it should I think it's really
beautiful it's super unique but it is
definitely a little bit tight I just
turn it on so cute
honestly everything it's so good I was a
little worried about the sizing and
particular pieces especially the
underwear because I have a bigger butt
and then a smaller top so I wasn't sure
if the bottoms were gonna fit but that
should fit pretty well okay do you wanna
wearing these I do love this color I
think it's very cute some of the things
I'm still like iffy about my own body
like I'm still gonna be iffy about its
underwear that's of haha
tonight it's squeezing a lot I know she
didn't like that's really cute that I
just feel like it's just really I am
dressed head-to-toe in lingerie feeling
super sexy under that duvet is my lovely
boyfriend Alvin we are doing a grand
sexy lingerie reveal all right so jury's
still out and how I feel about
customizable Andre as I expected I think
the pieces were incredibly beautiful I
feel like they themselves were a work of
art which is awesome but it was kind of
a bummer because the club they didn't
fit I have felt so beautiful
and so confident in lingerie which was
something I was kind of awkward about
before but really I felt so great and I
can't thank you Serena enough for giving
that to me I wish that custom lingerie
could just fix all of those things like
if he things that you feel but only
think anything can do that I think only
you can work on that as a person
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
