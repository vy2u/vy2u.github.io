and then putting them in our hair hair
masks are very similar to deep
conditioning essentially they really
moisturize your hair and supposedly make
it super soft and silky on a great hair
day my hair is extremely moisturized
it's also very fluffy and it's big the
bigger the better
generally on a bad hair day my hair can
get a little bit oily a little bit
frizzy I let my hair air dry usually on
a really great hair day my hair is nice
and straight and shiny
I'm going to start off with one
tablespoon of coconut oil I already use
coconut oil on a pretty regular basis on
my hair coconut oil allows me to not
have to moisturize daily at my sorority
we had a magic bullet to make smoothies
but when someone told me that we had a
magic bullet I thought it was just like
a giant vibrator I was like oh okay
and we all use it okay apparently the
recipe called for one juiced lemon as
opposed to lemon juice so we're gonna
improvise good enough whatever that's
about 1 tablespoon of honey about 2
tablespoons of yogurt in whole banana
okay now I'm gonna put on my poncho cuz
I am in the splash zone oh oh no oh it's
cold
want to apply this feels amazing in my
fingers this is such a therapeutic
experience I'm gonna be honest it feels
a little gross the banana texture is
just slightly grainy surprisingly even
though there's a lot of lemon this
doesn't feel very sticky it goes through
my hair very smoothly this is the cutest
damn shower cap I have ever seen great
now we're just gonna let this sit for 30
minutes
alright times up time to go wash this
stuff out
I'm excited trying to figure out how to
maneuver my body so that this can be a
thing
it is I'm scared of the blender maybe I
shouldn't wonder this or I am now in the
flash though this is not what I thought
I was going to the pond bill is fully
that under they'll feel good I mean
honestly this is a very therapeutic
experience and to be doing this the
middle of the work day I met putting
things I can't see what's plus without
yeah all right all right
well I think I got scared of the blender
didn't puree the bananas quite enough I
think it went pretty well making it was
really easy only a few ingredients it
would be a fun sleepover activity but in
the middle of the day at work
questionable it feels like
well-conditioned hair so I am very
curious to see what it feels like in a
few hours in a few hours
my hair is dry it's pretty shiny we're
gonna check in on Soph and Freddy and
see how they're doing how is your hair
you tell me there's definitely still
some banana left and in fact this is
really disgusting but I tried to comb
some of it out but the rest of my hair
actually feels nice can we talk about
Freddy's headphone dent in the middle oh
no too much talk there's a headphone did
in my entire fro is just a triangle at
this point but is soft them I'm fine if
it actually feels super moisturize I was
really concerned because I was like oh I
need to like do a deep oil in my hair
tonight because I had washed it again
but I don't feel like I need to do a
deep oil I don't think I do with the
oily treatment because that was it I'm
happy with the mask I will say like I
don't feel like I need to do anything
major when I get home feels really soft
the feel doesn't feel dry pretty good in
that be mask was fun thank you have a
kados</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
