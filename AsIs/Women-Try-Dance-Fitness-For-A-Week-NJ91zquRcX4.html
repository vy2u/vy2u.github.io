and I think that's great because it's
like two skills and one you get better
at working out and you also get better
at dancing you also look cool I was in a
dance group in like the sixth grade that
got canceled because we just sucked
really bad probably the most
embarrassing moment of my life was going
to a hip hop dance class for the first
time being the only black person and
being the worst dancer in my entire
class yeah
so we're performing this in front of our
co-workers everyone's gonna know that I
can't dance I've kept it secret by only
dancing in dark places today and the day
where we can't fake it
well petal I judge you they laughed in
my face oh they were like I am so
excited to see that that's gonna be
funny I am less intimidated though
because we are learning this dance
routine from a video yeah and not a
dance instructor today we're gonna start
learning it and then we're gonna
practice it for a week and then for the
grand finale we have to teach our
co-workers the dance routine we're gonna
do a dance for it gasp it's gonna be
really cool my and me are gonna shake
our booties and we're gonna teach it to
the rest of the office-boy dance so we
are learning from Caleb Marshall which
is the fitness Marshall as it goes by on
YouTube he makes a lot of dance fitness
videos really excited to see what he's
got okay this is repetition I like that
it got all that as a Latina we're
supposed to have rhythm we're supposed
to have sass on which is spice and I
have all that spice item in terms of
dancing I don't so what the dance me and
Maya felt kind of a saying we were both
trying to be sexy and trying to feel
comfortable I don't know if that was
really translating well with the dance
that we were doing I wasn't really
getting it
I was trying really hard to do exactly
what Caleb was doing like when he turned
around he was twerking you know I was
sure
turn around pork but as you can see it
doesn't really look like I'm doing
anything
every time you back in the burro we just
have this weird fear with looking dumb
being embarrassed and failing in front
of people this is really making me push
through that fear so he's doing a
running and then he fastens the running
and it gets down and then he just like
does his legs yeah I was like the
washing machine there you go exactly
he's just doing that but quicker the
water chamber it's gonna do really
dramatic stuff then I look like I'm
dancing actually a workout we're
sweating a lot that means we'll work our
co-workers out so they won't have time
to laugh at us okay yeah all right let's
go practice it over and over again woke
up a little early so I could practice
the stairs
I don't know how to do certain things
that he does in the video like uh sting
I'm a little worried that we're gonna
look stupid I'm not gonna lie so I asked
curly to help me dance and he just
started doing this what's not helping me
so I'm going to attempt to practice this
dance hopefully I got this right I feel
like when he does it it looks really
cool but every single move that I do
just looks very stiff see I can't
remember what the hell I do next I feel
like if I remember the steps I'll get to
a place where I can put a format without
having to thanks so much
and then hopefully get to the point
where I look cool that's really the goal
at this point
so I'm on a hunt to look for someone who
can teach me this dance coupe can you
dance
dammit coupe I just been looking for
anyone with rhythm in the butt area that
can help me figure it out oh this is
where I go Rick in bonkers it's like
shimmy a shoulder I'm trying to just do
it cool that's literally all I can do
you and I are in the same Club honey
thanks for your help anyways that's my
bad can you dance my friend destiny who
is a way better dancer than me help me
work out my whole issue with the legs
portion of the dance keep doing maybe I
can do this
we'll see so we're about to talk to the
fitness marshal see if he has any tips
or advice for us now I am NOT in a good
space right now so I definitely need
some encouragement when we finally talk
to Caleb he was like you know what you
don't really have to do the dance like
me what's your advice for kind of
nailing those moves if you don't have a
lot of experience when I watch someone
else dance I like cannot copy what works
with me is all like see a general idea
of how they're moving to the music and
all to do whatever my body does you can
do it whatever way you feel comfortable
and channel whoever makes you feel
confident and sexy
I thought about Rihanna and I'm like
selena quintanilla when you're doing the
dance all you have to do is imagine that
you are Selena and you just slay don't
have to be perfect you just have to
exude that confidence and have fun and
be silly the silly is six as soon as he
said that I'm like you know what I'm
just gonna have fun who cares if I
looked up after I clicked into that I
felt like I moved better he practiced in
the bathroom
people were pooping and peeing and
walking by like Oh what are you face
doing I realized that my lack of
confidence was really blocking myself
from trying the dance to my fullest
potential when he finally did it I was
like what am I freaking out about this
isn't that hard I'm just gonna figure
out how to teach this class somehow I
don't know how but we're gonna do it I'm
so late right now literally granny ready
to dance are you is do it
I hope we're ready so Levi cubanía be
with me I really need your help
it's time I woke up this morning I was
like I don't know what the hell is gonna
happen
I feel like during the dance when people
were watching us I felt a little like
you were judging hard yeah like they
were just like oh that's it I thought
that looked really easy and I was like
this is what we're doing but when I had
to do this myself it was hard and I
couldn't get it right try that a little
bit faster boom take it okay yes and
then it cuts into like at one point I
looked at their faces and they just
looked so happy and like they were
having fun I don't usually get to bust
out my dance moves at 10:30 a.m. those
endorphins are really coming on strong
that was super fun I forgot how
empowering dance classes can be and what
it is to like pick up the vibe of the
group that's what my pick it was a real
legit workout so thank you bias alarm I
feel like I don't have a good start to
my day now
you gotta be some kind of Jew some kind
of light something I need something you
need something to spend the time maybe
it's me maybe shoo shoo shoo away
my club
let's go to night
that was the point the way that we felt
about the stand at the beginning of this
challenge versus like now is so
completely its Boulder office yeah I
think it's a lesson to other people who
are put in a situation that makes them a
little uncomfortable who cares
you have to overcome that voice inside
of your head that says like you're gonna
look dumb why are you doing this and
just be like shut up yeah I'm gonna
learn something from this experience
it's awesome that Caleb has done so many
videos on dance fitness and that he's
inspired so many people to get fit on
their own terms that's amazing and props
to him if we can do it you can do it did
a little dance for our little friends
and we taught them how to do it even
though we felt like we were gonna look
dumb it's okay cuz we still had fun whoa
you did one rhyme and her mind was blown
dancing Brad a fast
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
