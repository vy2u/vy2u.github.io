to me
slather me in Dimond cream
there's like three of its kind
this means the de lactic black peel-off
mask it is infused with charcoal CU
Dehradun in sapphire and diamond powder
wow this is art it's add some black
cheese we're trying the hydrating
holographic one which is super dope I'm
excited and I also love how it says I do
care like it's a pun level already
feeling this I think it's gonna be a
glowing no we were we definitely was
just like this packaging am i right it
looks like luxurious milk it begs to be
touched I really look like slime from
Nickelodeon
definitely it's just like robot AI skin
I feel like a like a linebacker I feel
like a Nickelodeon's all right now it
was like putting green slime on my face
I feel like we're going to the Coachella
a face mask you have some just like very
stubborn kind of like clogged pores on
my forehead so I want to get rid of some
of those and then you know Mama's tea
baby yes how do you do it so quickly wow
this looks like a little snot booger
coming up is it necessary for my face to
be holographic uh probably not is it fun
what have you press I have not had as a
facial expression in like 20 minutes I
was like it's when it starts to feel
tight I feel like that's when you know
it's like ready to come on a little bit
just rip it like a band-aid babies have
a more hair on my face and so it hurts
more it's actually all off of my skin
right now it's the hair that's trapped
underneath that's holding it yeah I
think your skin has a lovely glow to it
right now
it's very dewy I care I tend to have
more drier skin so this makes it feel
matte without it feeling super dried out
I have no more hair on my face and we
accidentally waxed our faces because me
and Sheila have hair on our faces skin
has been like in a prison for half an
hour and like it was a breakout so glad
it did and now it's emerged fresh and
new it's like reborn my thoughts why
must it get peeled off of course it's
gonna exfoliate if it's getting peeled
off cuz you're ripping off the top layer
of skin I believe in this mask can I
avoid tragic in I want try the other
ones because they are all so
cool-looking I know I would definitely
use this again and then you just get a
fun little piece of art yeah then frame
it you know it's beautiful
overall ten out of ten I'd be like eat
at it
oh okay well I have high standards right
okay apparently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
