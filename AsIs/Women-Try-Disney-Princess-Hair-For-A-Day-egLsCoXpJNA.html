turned into jasmine Rapunzel
Ariel from The Little Mermaid when I
think of Disney Princess hair
I think big thick very shiny growing up
I loved both jasmine and Pocahontas and
how long and beautiful their hair was
Rapunzel just wakes up and her hair's
flawless I feel like she asked a lot
like two hours of her day to just like
brush through all of her hair it's gonna
be crazy
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my oh my whoa that is hilarious
it looks great like I wish I had had
like this I remember trying to do my
hair like Jasmine when I was little and
completely failing oh my god it's like
on the ground it's on the ground I have
a feeling this is gonna be really
difficult to maneuver I guess it's time
to start this day
I forgot my hair does and I walked out
the door everyone was just staring at me
you guys doing what do you think you're
doing what do you think we're doing or
the are you like Rapunzel Oh gross Oh
they started off pretty good because I
was excited to have so much hair but it
did quickly go downhill from there
Andrew oh I like it pretty an
understatement it's only been like five
minutes and my hair is already coming
undone and my head already hurts
this is inconvenient tell me god I'll go
to the bathroom I haven't done it yet it
got caught in everything my daily
routines were just harder oh my god I've
been in this for ten minutes and I'm
already so tired people definitely
noticed and immediately knew that I was
Jasmine it's pretty are you jasmine I'm
Jasmine Jen look gorgeous your judgment
yes my headphones wouldn't really stay
on there was so much thickness I would
put it over and I couldn't like really
get it to go on my ears it would more so
go on my hair I drove to my sister's
place didn't tell her anything that was
happening oh my god I should've expected
it I couldn't have be done done the
extensions got caught on a doorknob and
we're giving me a lot of trouble it's
too unruly it has to go as thick
bitching hey we went up to the roof
because naturally Rapunzel has to throw
her long hair off the building
you've let your hair down where are the
men that's the question not on earth man
I was looking around for like a hot guy
or something but that didn't happen I'm
so hot mine time neck is sweating
breathe when I was a kid I would have
really wanted this you know we all
that's what we all got going into this
and now it was on her head I didn't feel
like a Disney princess at all it was
just interesting to see how
uncomfortable it really was the worst
part of today was feeling like I had a
bowling ball attached to my head I
actually felt more like a princess now
that all the extensions are out I am
literally never gonna watch any Disney
movie the same four beautiful sisters we
share everything men hair stories or
sisters okay Oh God
princesses do not belong let's do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
