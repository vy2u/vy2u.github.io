see it calls me and today we're going to
be trying an eyeshadow palette that is
mana themed I am a Disney person I'm one
of those people like I'm an annual pass
holder I go all the time
I do the races I'm on board for anything
and everything Moana
I love Milano because she represents
being really brave and wanting to go on
adventures is me is a little politically
problematic at times the depiction of
Maui kind of perpetuate some not-so-nice
stereotypes of Polynesian male body
image it's never gonna be perfect but
Moana always will still just represent
hope with this new change that is
perhaps going to befall Disney the fact
that Moana does focus on family and
elders which is very vital in the tegra
to Pacifica culture as someone with
brown skin I usually look for eyeshadow
palettes that are really rich in color
and that are like heavily pigmented so
I'm really hoping that this eyeshadow
palette does not disappoint
I am excited to try the palette I'm
excited to get you're definitely more
authentic perspective as opposed to just
my Disney fanatic perspective either way
I'm excited to play with some makeup so
let's do it
I love this I'm a big color person I
wish it came with the brush the names
are pretty cute there's money in Ottawa
Tama Toa Kaka Morra moto nuit
the chicken and the figure inside which
is great o super excited about that I'm
gonna go for the gold it's not giving me
Beyonce well goddess yeah everything's
like five shades lighter than you think
it's gonna be I didn't have put a little
bit on my cheeks cuz I like this thing
as a highlight is it great it's like a
kind of green for as colorful as the
palette is I thought definitely come up
a little bit more vibrant on the skin
but you know not translating for me it's
not like a real Sephora level eyeshadow
palette but it's also not priced like a
real support level eyeshadow palette so
considering there's 13 shadows plus one
that we don't know if it's a shadow or a
highlighter it was just the cousin that
comes around the family out of the 13
we only got really good color payoff out
of what one probably montseny is the
best color payoff if you get some
glitter if you're a huge fan of movie go
for it I probably wouldn't buy it for
myself but I might think of buying it
for like a child of my cousin or
something like that like something very
cute for a little girl my family canva
wanna use this palette I think she can't
because she's a little bit more tan and
some kids glow than me so she can't use
it
why you got her name on it I think this
palette existed and they just put my
wand packaging on it because
none of these colors have anything to do
with the movie regardless of what people
look like they should be able to pick up
the pallet and be able to use it instead
of having white people constantly
creating the narrative now I just hope
that they let the actual people depicted
in the story create the story and create
their narrative this time we need you
