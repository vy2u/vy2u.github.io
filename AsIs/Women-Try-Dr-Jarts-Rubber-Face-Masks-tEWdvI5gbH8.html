Doubtfire when
she puts the cream on her face and it
drops into the tea one important dear
so today we are trying a face mask we
don't know what it is but we were given
various options as to what we could have
I have pretty dry skin so I picked a
hydrating mask
I picked firming because of my face
being old your face is not all it's
gonna be like a hamster I don't like
this oh my god why is there something in
its mouth dr. jart shaking shot mine's a
rubber hydro mass mine is a rubber there
we go
it's like you find a very old allies you
store baby juice should we like do this
that was to apply for you that one is
opening it done Oh
remove the spatch oh the straws is
spatula so this is creamy and this is
liquid which is interesting I didn't
want to tell you what this looks like
but look at it I'm gonna mention what
that looks like
Oh mine's blue she's mine or like
purpley blue let me close the baby's
mouth with our fingers I didn't close it
immediately tends to like climb like I
don't know peek and see okay it's
definitely mask like this would be great
for like a sleepover situation yeah for
like kids yeah it's pretty mine oh god
it's gonna get in my eyebrow this feels
like something they would put on you in
like a spa I felt a lot on and it's
still going is this for someone with
like a big face maybe they have to
account for people you know with lots of
facial real estate wait here's a
question
do
what movie knows why this party okay so
the product says that we have to sit
with us on our faces for 15 to 20
minutes so we're gonna do that yep oh oh
that feels good
oh yeah oh yeah it looks like Elmer's
glue when you like oh my god it is
that's what it feels like it does feel
like I'm feeling putting glue off my
face I loved doing that when I was a kid
yeah I love that I always feel like I'm
in a horror movie when I pulled on
putting a mask off because I'm like hey
guys my face oh it's so smooth feeling
my skin feels pretty good and it does
feel like very hydrated you you and you
are glowing like your face looks really
good I got that baby glow looks very
hydrated which is weird cuz it's not a
hydrating mask I have a firming one but
it's still hydrated is it feeling a
little tight I think it's good I'm
actually pretty impressed with this it's
one of the few masks where I felt like
it actually did what it said it was
gonna do and also you know it looks like
a baby coming out of a little veg
yeah what is this edge about yeah that's
what I'd like tonight don't a job was
delivering baby fresh skin
