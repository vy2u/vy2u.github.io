True Match in nut-brown see resonate cuz
it just came nut-brown I'm really gonna
try and just move fast it like you
wouldn't let me row you would not let me
row so we're gonna see if we can find a
foundation that matches our skin
perfectly at the drugstore typically
whenever I'm trying to find a foundation
I go to whatever station is the closest
of the makeup store when I really
started to wear foundation I kind of
went straight to Sephora and then they
use that machine on my skin and I've
just been using the same NARS scented
moisturizer for like four years and I
tend to get too orange so I'm skeptical
but you know I'll try my best to be
optimistic about it just from being in
this boat before of trying to look for
foundations at drugstores I'm expecting
to find a red one and a yellow one that
I'm going to have to mix to get my skin
tone so now we're gonna go to the
drugstore and see we can find I have
faith I have hope it's gonna be a good
day I have faith in you okay
so in the drugstore and we're a little
overwhelmed almost out of all of these I
can probably use two and I would say
there's about maybe thirty so I found
this Maybelline it's just pulling a
little bit more yellow for me which I
think I need all the other foundations
are like completely sealed and I just
watch Apple so I'm just going to see
what this one is looking like actually
it's not too bad did the first amount of
agent I picked up and actually swatched
actually work either you have to just
choose like really light or like just
really orange it I feel like it just
doesn't get dr. it just gets more orange
so we just came from the drugstore and
honestly like it pissed me off how much
there wasn't there for us I personally
don't think that what I chose is going
to work out for me just because I
literally had two options and we haven't
had a chance to really try it on
and see what people said on our face so
I'm Frank for the buzz but I honestly
have a lot of downs we're back though
not feeling better it was okay I mean I
think that there's something workable
here so this is the one that I found
that looks pretty similar to my NARS
tinted moisturizer that I use every day
I'm nervous that it's gonna be a little
too late whoa it looks way lighter in
the bottle that it does on my skin way
what do you think if there was like half
a shade up yeah so this shade is even
darker than this one so since I bought
it I'm gonna go ahead and try it but no
I already no no no oh I started putting
this one on um going into it just from
already testing this one out I knew it
was gonna be too dark but I just had to
go ahead and try it I'd already bought
it so now we know that it's not for me I
came up with a Maybelline matte poreless
for like eight dollars it's not as bad
as I thought it would be just now I
thought it was gonna be like way too
light for my face but it actually kind
of blends in I feel like maybe going a
shade darker might have might help the
coverage just because of my blemishes
are pretty dark I'm using this one
because the more I look at this the more
I'm like this might be for a lighter
person than make I backed into a corner
here how do you like the consistency of
it I consistently know this isn't my
shade I think if you were in a pinch and
going out in the dark now I'm gonna try
Maybelline I don't want to try this I
already know it's too late for me but I
have it so I might as well try it and
see like maybe I'll be delightfully
surprised I don't think that this shade
is is bad for me it makes me look a
little ashy it needs a little bit more
read to it I'm doing the Revlon and not
feeling super excited about this but
we'll see I would say this is definitely
darker than some parts of my face but
it's not too dark to the point where
it's like that's not her color I don't
know I think the lesson here is that
like color matching is so hard and
finding your perfect foundation shade
like truly the journey I think actually
when I do this next time I would still
opt for going to a makeup store instead
of a drugstore just because it's easier
to be able to put the makeup on there
and have somebody match your skin tone
rather
then try it and then have to keep going
back over and over pretty much overall I
kind of just think I should have gone
maybe a shade darker but to be honest
the only other shade there was too dark
probably for my complexion so I'd
probably have to go to a different brand
if you're really looking for like you
want your perfect foundation it needs to
be more than just like going and being
like hmm that that's about right yeah
and then walking away and I feel like
I'm just on the hunt now for like the
perfect foundation for my face you
buggin
