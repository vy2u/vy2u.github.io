refuse to do this video stop laughing
makeup is fun but sometimes it's sad
when your entire page egg goes straight
to Sephora but does life have to be this
way
it's ladylike and this week we're
putting less expensive stuff on our
faces $259 t1 cents
two hundred and ninety nine dollars
three hundred eighty seven dollars my
life is a money garbage disposal we all
know that I spend a lot of money on
makeup I am in fact a vib Rouge member
at Sephora
I don't actively search for bargains
when it comes to makeup maybe I should I
use a mix of drugstore in high-end
makeup I enjoy a good bargain as well as
a good Duke I spent a long time not
spending any money on makeup I really
want to see if I can substitute some
stuff out sometimes I'll look at my
makeup and be like
do you really need that though would
that money be better put in your savings
account or towards new underwear or
something there's just so much selection
like I don't know where to begin do you
think I'm sandy beige or light beige I
didn't realize how pink all of these
foundations were until I realized all of
them are paying and I'm not pink so I'm
looking at this eye liner and I don't
actually understand what it is because
it says liquid eyeliner pencil but then
the tip of it looks like a crayon picked
up a bunch of nude lipsticks but can't
swatch any of them so I don't know what
they look like I'm buying them all cheap
makeup used to be all the makeup I owned
how did I get so bad at this so I'm
finding what I think can help me be out
of it dupes I think we're ready to go I
think we finally found everything that
we need here we are with our backup
spoil I'm here trying to find something
that isn't going to make my skin super
mad all I want to do is swatch this
stuff which of you lovely ladies will
become a part of my permanent makeup
routine this is what the foundation
looks like I didn't get to swatch it and
the color is pretty pretty good in my
opinion this stuff feels like an oil
spill on my face and all the Penguins
died I don't know if everything's
blended properly because I use tiny tiny
brushes Oh No what is this all of a
sudden I miss everything
it's day one haha can't cheat on day one
her name is my eyeliner this is doing a
lot for my eyelashes though look at that
I don't know minimal flake egde I'm
doing okay so far I can tell when my
skin is mad at me because it turns very
red I just finished eating and this is
what happened and Freddie thinks it's
hilarious tip it ready
damn so it's been a couple of hours and
my eyeliner has its own eyebrow I got
used to the eyeliner today so I actually
used it you see though the wing
disintegrating hi Freddie
I'm breaking out it's like popcorn is
erupting on my face I'm going back to
Walgreens shimmy Twilight coffee that
looks like a shade that I want so I'm
actually a huge fan of this color that I
just picked up here's my whole that cost
me about 65 bucks of my own money my
face has been peeling shiny I never feel
like I look as nice as I usually do with
makeup my skin is actually doing a
little bit better than I thought I would
since my skin's usually kind of acne
prone but I definitely do have a couple
little pen please there's wet in my
omega-6 pretty good I think this is
gonna get incorporated into my routine I
appreciate a lipstick that doesn't make
me feel bad about putting on my lipstick
correctly hey I'm honestly very excited
that it's the last day I never thought
that I would be brat about this and I'm
actually kind of ashamed for the past
week I've been using drugstore makeup
there were some good times and some bad
times I think one of the things I got I
liked a lot and the rest of it was a
nice reminder of what it's like to be in
your early 20s
it made me feel very fussy I felt so
fussy the whole week growing up I used
only drugstore makeup and eye
never really realized the negative
effect I might have had on my skin the
primer burned my skin so much it kind of
sucks you have to buy stuff at the
drugstore that you can't try it's like
honestly is like buying a lottery ticket
I got two different types of eyeliner
one and I could barely even get it to
come off the brush the other eyeliner
that was like this thick and it might as
well have been a dry erase marker
but it was three dollars and forty nine
cents and so that is what I started
using for what it is that eyeliner was
great I had the most luck finding a
foundation that was similar to the
foundation that I use obviously when you
buy two products that have vast price
differences they're not going to be
exactly the same but I found that mostly
all I just had to do is reapply more
surprisingly the thing I liked the most
was the wet and wild lipstick like I
kept going back to it went wild when you
need a great lipstick that has a very
unfortunate name I found myself falling
very quickly into my old spending habits
no matter where I'm shopping drugstore
makeup isn't actually as cheap as you
think it's not five dollars you know
maybe just for fun I will continue to
see if I can find a good drugstore dupe
am I gonna change my ways no we all know
who I am if anything I'm gonna be
spending even more money because if I'm
waiting and I'm like okay CB s on the
corner you know let me get at that
