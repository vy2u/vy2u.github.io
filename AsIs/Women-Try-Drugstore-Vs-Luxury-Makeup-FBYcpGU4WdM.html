face I really love makeup I feel like it
doesn't love me because I don't know how
to use it I'm a vib member at Sephora
which means I spend way too much money
like you can find good drugstore brands
but it takes a lot of testing and I
don't have that patience so I end up
just getting a lot of high-end brands
instead I do like my money so if I can
find an easy medium then I'll be great
too I want to like the cheap ones
because I'm cheap I can save money I
will I'll spend my money on three things
makeup wine and Netflix we're trying the
Revlon not just nudes palette it's
what's inside that counts right like
what it's made of let inside it smells
like a point it's not much to see
there's nothing's really showing up just
yet if you need to get your like little
needs something yeah we're their
birthday this would be cheap and will
last them until they're old enough to
buy gun maker this is the Tartelette in
bloom see this is pretty it is hella
cute it's like you yeah you got cute
packaging my eyes are going straight to
it and my fingers are going in my wallet
whoa this goes on nicely oh my god oh my
god I feel like a lady with this palette
yeah I feel like I'm about to do my
makeup I would splurge but you're not
actually splurging if you were to get
this because it's worth like so much
more if I get adopted by a rich family
tomorrow I would totally take the turtle
it flourish
we are trying on NYX liquid suede for
your lips what smoo yeah so a good
liquid matte that dries without looking
crusty on the big fan of you look like
the dark queen of the night
barely feels like there's anything on
your lips which pulse this is called
evil twin which I like I never wear dark
lips but if I do but we all know the
true test with Matt is how long does it
stay on before crackin it's a little
streaky putting it on actually it's very
streaky here's the ven NYX you can get
multiple colors you can get like three
NYX for one of these I would say trying
on eyeliner you need your liner to be
the one like constant in your makeup
routine you'll have time for flim-flam
and boys of liner I think I'm
already gonna save like I already see
it's gonna be good
feels like it stays on though but it's
like smudge is a little bit I'm not
liking it I thought I would really like
it I know how to do eyeliner it's the
bed I swear we are trying the Kat Von D
tattoo liner what is this a paint brush
oh my god my finger on the Maybelline
and the Kat Von D 1 and the Maybelline
one is still a little bit wet and the
Kat Von D one is already dry this is
worth it I would definitely splurge for
Kat Von D I would swear John the Kat Von
D I think it shows that you really have
to review each individual product not
just judge the brand as a whole yeah I'm
gonna keep spending money on makeup
until I die I would say overall I don't
think you need to break the bank to look
beautiful
