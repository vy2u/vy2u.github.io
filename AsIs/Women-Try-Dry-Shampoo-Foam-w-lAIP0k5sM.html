trying foaming dry shampoo my hair is
really fine but there's a lot of it so
the issue is it like tangles up lots so
whenever I use regular dry shampoo it
just like tangles it up even more I tend
to use like the dry shampoos that are
the physical powder instead of the spray
but at the same time when it hits that
like max level of dry shampoo it just
looks wet so I started using baby powder
and then I just smells like baby powder
and I just like felt dirty I'm always
afraid that I've got like white stuff in
the bag I'm about foam it's just I don't
know if I'm Pro foam dry shampoo so
we'll see oh this looks classy I'm gonna
smell it I'm thinking about smell its
like floral do I have to shake it can I
follow me ow
come on me that looks like shaving cream
yeah oh my god it's like almost like the
the ready-whip oh it's like mousse I'm
so scared this is gonna make my hair
okay oh I don't I don't like how it
feels so I guess just work it straight
in there this is all good I don't wanted
to do it I feel like this was a mistake
is it too much I feel like with foam you
like work it in and then you just keep
on working that product cuz it melts
into your hair okay it's not like drying
in any sort of weird way or anything ooh
actually look at that wet right one
right
yeah I feel like it definitely like gave
my hair a boost and it's not leaving any
like white stuff all up in my hair I
mean I definitely think it looks better
than like earlier
yeah it looks cleaning first of all it's
fun comes home second of all it just a
like gives you volume to that sometimes
I feel like you have to work for with
other dry shampoos this is way better
than any dry sham yes this is way better
yeah I think I like it more and more is
it like yeah settles in I think I'm
gonna give this a nine to ten on my
scale through ten because it's fantastic
it just works and I feel like there's no
like bus or bus to it you literally have
dry shampoo and clean here
