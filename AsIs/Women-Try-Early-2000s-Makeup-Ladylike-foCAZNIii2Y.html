was my bronzer stick like a pen you
click click click click it until it
would just like ejaculate some sparkly
browned bronzer and eye you'd be like
great it's ready to go
so today we're taking a jaunt down
memory lane and we're gonna try makeup
tips from the early 2000s what are we
talking about here
this was a time when I bought a lot of
these magazines and was like I do not
look like any of these people we have
got some juicy seventeen magazines from
2001 I think there's one in here from
like 2006 I was allowed to wear face
makeup in middle school but I was
allowed to wear lip balms which sort of
expanded to include lip glosses as well
mine was light she assented it cost way
too much money all the sticky makeup on
your face I'm like I'm a cute ask me to
prom except I had to ask I was like
really really into colored eyeliner I
would do like a green eyeliner and then
like a blue eyeshadow and then I was
like yep
all of your like style tips came from
these bad boys I shadow without eyeliner
was was huge what a time to be alive
they were definitely simpler times so
obviously these magazines have great
advice so let's see what they say about
makeup looks I'm gonna use the
common-sense that I had when I was 15
and 16 which is just don't know where to
put it put it all over these eyes or
something that I would totally have done
you would see some crazy eyeshadow like
this so let's try and do something like
that so I'm gonna try and copy this look
you wanted to become like a very
reflective surface in case you went out
running at night and you wanted cars to
be able to see you there weren't any
Beauty blenders back then all we had was
what God gave us okay it says first
swipe base on areas that are prone to
redness then blend in the product with
clean fingers no makeup brushes that's
Jill it seems like she just has pink
just all over her lid remember the days
when you could just put one color on
your lid and that was it liquid
eyeshadow yeah I said it liquid
eyeshadow that was a thing it's gonna be
it we're doing it we're doing it wise
people I don't know how she did like the
matte cheek look because that is not the
outcome here the picture literally just
has her eye and it has the brush right
here it's my understanding that you have
to smudge your eyes instead of blending
you smudge I was a big term back then
when the girls are doing their makeup in
the bathroom I was
writing Harry Potter fanfiction okay I'm
gonna put that shimmery shadow I'm gonna
kind of migrate it up there anyway yeah
this feels right I remember this and
we're off to the races that almost looks
like too good
is there a glitter I still use my bare
minerals bronzer that I used in high
school it's not of course the same pot
not that disgusting I feel like if I
would have walked out the door this my
mom would have been like remember less
is more so start with a small amount of
blush and layer it on to intensify the
shade this feels very accurate tonight
early 2000 experience ready I would
second my cheeks mm-hmm mm-hmm
now I remember why we don't use liquid
eyeshadow anymore at cakes
it's like cakey it looks like I have dry
skin like it's just flaked off my face I
mean I imagine people like ten years
from now we'll look at magazines and
Pinterest to be like oh these girls are
crazy their eyes look way over lined I
feel like I started off like homecoming
and now I'm going back to like seventh
grade dance I feel a sudden urge to
write every boy I kissed in high school
a letter of apology a la lalala and then
they come back and they just have like
gunk I am very glad that I'm not my
early 2000 self anymore
because that person was somehow even
less cool than this person though this
is not something that I would do
nowadays I do remember this fondly it's
part of like your formative years when
you just like you make weird decisions
about what to put on your face and you
know and it makes you the woman who you
are today a lot of the techniques I
still use a lot of the products I don't
use this is a good reminder that it's
good to be older keep inside all of us
there is a girl who looks like this and
she needs to be celebrated feels good
like to not be shackled under the weight
of glitter any longer that I'm ready to
go see spider-man with my friends and
that's all that counts that was so hot
when he was like upside down they made
out that was really hot okay that's all
I'm gonna say about that movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
