the dessert line that was my favorite
and it got boys to kiss me my question
is who does edible makeup help you know
like whose life is improved by having
makeup that they can eat I feel like we
all just kind of accidentally consume a
fair amount of makeup in life there are
many lip glosses that I would eat I
think that it's just like oh it's so
natural you could eat it oh okay so it's
like this floor so clean you could lick
it but like don't like before tasty face
organics coconut vanilla cream cleanser
those two ingredients sounds tasty it
kind of looks like tapioca pudding oh oh
you need the whole thing you gross what
the it's so bad it's coating my
tongue it tastes kind of like strep
throat it tastes like you took user and
creamy just spray it into your mouth you
know as a cleanser I can't but Smerch it
but as a food I've besmirches natural
organic Edible cosmetics white tea toner
like just these shot glasses having
frightened assist sativa is there pot in
this all ingredients are edible but are
formulated in concentrations for the
skin surface and not for ingestion let's
suggest it
it smells like fireball you know it's
actually doing a good job of getting rid
of the cleanser taste tastes like I ate
my grandmother's perfume
it tastes like very lukewarm iced tea if
someone gave this to me and they're just
like witness pouch Oh drinks this all
the time I would drink and be like yeah
that tastes like something she would
consume it's not good even song
essentials goddess Envy moister
this looks very thick hey you know it's
kind of nice like does this mean you
could also use this as like ingredients
when cooking Oh No ran out of coconut
oil but I have my facial cream though
okay eating oil in the solid form Cheers
oh no no it's not so bad oh my god
consistency of food but none of the
charm it tastes like the geriatric wing
of a hospital
it tastes also a little bit like fish
oil pills a mousse blush lipstick
Cayenne what what hold on why do we have
a fork in a knife
we're really full-on into like actual
makeup product we're weirdos it's quite
vibrant it is cute this is just
sacrilege for makeup lovers everywhere I
know I know it's like oh god the hood oh
this is so fun getting this saw into
lips thing wait I'm kind of excited to
eat this I feel like you'd be headed it
yeah I feel like I did a bad deed yeah
oh this is not bad don't hate it
no it kind of tastes like a sweet tart
hmm that's dangerous oh because then
I'll lick it all off it's very good yeah
it's it's really delicious it is stuck
to the roof of my mouth
you know the lipstick would be the
funnest and the best tasting what just
happened that's a good question what did
just happen we get what the companies
are doing by marketing these products as
edible to make people feel better and
safer we got a taste of grandma piss of
soap and then a decent lipstick edible
implies that it's like a food don't eat
it is what we're trying to say I think
that they probably should say like hey
not food but if food no hospital this
video is not edible makeup it's what
happens when Sofia tries to cool
