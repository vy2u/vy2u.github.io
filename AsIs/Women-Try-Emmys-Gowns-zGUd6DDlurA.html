like all the time today we're getting
styled like the Sears Emmy nominees
everyone has their own person but I'm
doing Kerry Washington
she's like Beyonce level confidence if I
could even remotely emulate that that'd
be great
I have Maisie Williams also known as
Arya Stark I'm really excited because
her style is a style that I've never had
before like she's effortlessly cool am I
looking inspired by Viola Davis
she's like old Hollywood glam great
silhouettes lots of drama
taraji P Henson I picked her because
they think her style it's in line with
my style but it's like it just like
takes it to the next level Tatiana
maslany from orphan black she's just
cool and I want to be cool so why not
write Amy Schumer is my inspiration and
homegirl loves to have like a
tight-fitting dress
show off her body which i think is
fantastic
my biggest worry is that the clothes
might wear me like I'm afraid I'm going
to get swallowed and like this gown or
just be like oh that dress looks great
like who the is that under there oh
I don't know how I'm going to look
because like my boobs fit into nothing
ever and I also have to learn bra at all
times or else they're like floppy
this is gorgeous I love it and love to
be the Luba color I love the beautiful
like whimsical little hemline it feels
different than it looks like when I
looked in the mirror I was like oh I
really like this but it feels like I'm
wearing a Kurt I looked out like someone
trusted me enough to wear this what I
like how simple it is I feel like a lot
of times people think Oh fancy vents you
have to kind of go crazy but it's always
the most classic lines that are kind of
the chicest this is like a gorgeous like
two-piece gown and I really like that
I'm carrying a black clutch that's
probably worth more than my rent like I
think that really helps complete the
look I love this dress it's beautiful I
love red and I love this little like
whole peekaboo I love the satin this is
just I feel like I'm good bold lip I
wear this anywhere I wear this to the
DMV I was definitely wear this on the
red carpet but I would probably lean
more towards like a short scandalous
dress if I was just going is like a
plebeian I would be like yeah this is
fun it looks great and it does look
great but it's not really my style I
would like to thank Carrie would be very
proud and flattered that she inspired
like this kind of look that someone
would want to emulate it I don't know if
I lived up to her fierceness I hope I
did I think taraji B Henson would
definitely admire the effort I put into
looking like her I really enjoyed having
someone to look to for inspiration for
those because it really helps you get an
idea the kind of styles you like so I
guess just like looking at people and
seeing oh I like what this person is
wearing maybe they'll help you shop a
little more I think this is a great
experience and I think every
woman / every person should feel like
they can go to the Emmys and wear a
beautiful dress like it shouldn't be
limited to these people that we see on
TV and you know I think it's great and I
think we should all be able to play
dress up like this and wear this all day
but to give this back No
yeah let's go take it it was fun but I'm
ready to take it off now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
