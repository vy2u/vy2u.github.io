today we are trying to recreate extreme
eye makeup looks from this season's
fashion we know gonna do that it's gonna
be great
I used to wear eyeshadow everyday and
then I ran out of it about like three
months ago so now I don't use it I still
don't really wear eyeshadow that much
but I will say that my skill has
definitely improved over the past couple
of months the thing is I like rubbing my
eyes and so then I'll like spend 45
minutes on this look and then I'll just
be like off Clark yeah I think I'm where
i shadow probably once or twice a month
I think they have a lot of resources
with makeup artists and we have none of
that it's gonna be good we're just out
here our feet lie within these envelopes
Oh No if nothing else know that I love
you fresh wow you got the asian girl I
got the white girl oh wow we don't get
tutorials listings like any a lot of
skill eyeliner which I do not have
that's the thing about these looks is
that this is like okay it's just like I
think wing or this is just a brush
stroke but I'm sure when actually doing
it it'll prove to be much more difficult
I mean it's not gonna be hard for me to
do this I think it'll be hard for me to
do in the way that's good I feel like
you can do any look and it just looks
cool all right so we're trying to
recruit another extreme makeup try by
ladylike again we make mistakes you
don't have to definitely it's snowing on
my lashes we've been doing a hell of a
lot of extreme makeup lately yeah it's
almost to the point where it's like no
longer extreme I know I'm like saving my
money for a trip to Japan and I'm not
even gonna try to say for jhamora
the poorest for what for out I think I
have a little outline this is where I
would stop if I were just applying
regular shadows you've got the look I've
got the look I just keep making it
bigger and bigger and it starts looking
sillier and sillier something about
doing a cat eye makes me so nervous I've
never had the experience of brow meeting
my eyeliner but we're doing it today
maybe people will be like oh they
probably just came off of the run zhu-li
thought to meet this family we'll go for
that can I add to my look no a lot of
pressure trying to look a little bit
like a fancy clown I'm like done on the
model it looks like I calligraphy on me
it looks like fake wrinkles while
Schatzi finishes a snack I'm a fan see
mine when I was in third grade I had a
shark seemed a birthday party and my mom
baked a cake in the shape of a shark
pretending to be the brake lights in
somebody's car you really made it work
like even though you and the model have
completely different eye shapes and she
has a lot more space between her lid and
her brow so I probably gonna take one
look at us would be like those girls are
the girls of the future living life with
a white brushstroke esque I look
happening I added a heart
let's go get some lunch now that we're
out in the sunlight mm-hmm shaunti
startled me what is that
is this like flax is this a gang and in
ya heart yeah I thought it was a
teardrop I'm not gonna lie you ain't
going outside like that ya know is that
a style man
yeah it's a runway trends it's a runway
trend yeah but it's only for the runway
Jen and I are walking to meet Freddie
and Chantal and they haven't seen her
looks yet no but what a response we will
get no why is it so straight yeah like
on the runway it would work but in real
life it's a bit like just like a light
breast room Owen like the heart though -
I know I added that like oh you did
that's not anything in my extreme
Oh oh wow
it's very actually liked it a lot
here with our high makeup don't care
shanties eyes are just becoming more and
more normalized as lunch goes on
you think it's all normal but then this
look is cool for certain circumstances
and people do not find it to be a good
office look they didn't one thing I will
say about this on makeup as it does make
my eyes look bigger from like a distance
which I'm a fan of stream eyelets from
the runway lady tested lady now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
