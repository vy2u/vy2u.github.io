yoga yo get your boob juice you know
what I don't have juice I'm a movie
that's a lie
this week we are trying three different
types of yoga I don't
yoga ever is that how you say I'm not a
big yogurt I don't get why people are so
obsessed with it so it'd be cool to see
something that is a little bit different
but still Yoga I'm just gonna dive
headfirst into some extreme yoga we are
doing aerial yoga I saw a pink do this
in a video once if they can do it we can
do it we're gonna be pink but yoga scape
I guess it's like we're in the room and
it's dark and it's gonna glow in the
dark and the last you go we're gonna do
is aqua yoga and a little frayed in the
water so definitely gonna wear a shower
cap because that's when downward dog
turns into your onward dog I think that
this is going to be less scary because
we are doing this together and we got
this we're gonna do it and we're gonna
do the thing why do it well we're gonna
do some aerial yoga and some aqua yoga
maybe some yoga skate and we're gonna be
super exhausted I'm half excited in half
like damn what did I get myself into
I'm Kalia Frazier an instructor here at
Air the class that we'll be doing today
it's a combination of yoga and then our
air foundations class which is a lot
upper body core and stability works and
lower body work some inversions and
tricks to get you upside down
chest lift your feet up off one of our
first challenges was being upside down
with our legs spread out hope you'll
enjoy hey it didn't feel that good she
was like she been doing some polls
lately shutter holding for that Manuela
Tommy not Toberman age I got a lot of
weight down here in my bottom and I have
no core strength I don't know how I'm
gonna lift myself up and it'll be really
difficult to get ourselves a ended up
having like a lot of bruises on my legs
and my kids which is fine because
they're like battle stars the hardest
thing for me was the last thing that we
did Ghana cocoon and then we just had to
lift ourselves up with our ABS it looks
like I have abs you guys but don't be
fooled
I struggled a bit my and the instructor
really helped me grow bootylicious
yawning yeah I was able to get up at
least for a second yeah it was great
that we were trying to support each
other before foot was in my face like
the entire last rally
I have both associates which are like
dirty fees
this is the like a baby with no support
from my head that was awesome on the
next yoga class I'm Steven earth Mets
here dearths Power Yoga we're gonna do a
negress power yoga session in our yoga
scape which is our surround video wall
system hot y'all I'm from Arizona I
thought I got out of the key always get
Moody whenever it's hot and I sweat we
don't want to make you cry it's great
when I started doing the first couple
poses I kept wobbly but the more I just
focused on like girl stop thinking and
just think about where your body is
where you go Stephens gonna help me it's
gonna be chill ifs alarm falls I'll
laugh at her I'll feel better about
myself it's okay
I like to get a lot doing it in a hot
space the yoga scape the music
everything really came together I feel
like I'm in tune with the physicality of
my body got the feet up a little bit
more yeah like that you're gonna slide a
bit because you're sweating and that's
normal don't worry if you weren't
sweating then I'd be concerned it's
almost like a detox and I kind of felt
more like calm and less stress you know
easy that was
you guys did fun the warrior pose I felt
comfortable with that but with all the
poses I still got unbalanced at least
once I feel like it an aerial one I did
that blast pose I was like yes in this
one you look totally rocked it leaned in
your left foot and just try and just
lift this leg up and now straighten up
your back straighten it up
I got halfway there I guess it all takes
practice like honestly if we both did
this a lot more we could do what all
those other people are doing come up to
a simple seated pose this with your legs
crossed in front bring the hands of
prayer position and we say the word I
must and that's it that ends our class I
need a nap
having a pool welcome to h2 yoga my name
is sue kisser I'm the creator of the
program h2 yoga is a completely unique
form of water yoga we combined water
waves with traditional yoga poses and
dynamic flows to create a virtually
gravity free workout that's not like
anything else so as you can see right
now I'm wearing a khaki and Maya decided
that she's too cool for caps a little
frayed in the water so definitely gonna
wear a shower cap shower cap let's do
this in the beginning I was like what
are we putting on our body I'm gonna
look like a fool with this it was kind
of a learning curve there were moments
where I didn't know what the we
were doing the direction was really fast
my head was going in all these different
places because I was trying to remember
all the little things we were supposed
to do we had to really focus and think
about our core so that we wouldn't fall
over so that we wouldn't fall forward we
almost like each other
keep your leg straight I had no idea are
we gonna do these yoga poses like
downward dog in the water but we ended
up doing like an upside down downward
dog was really cool
we partner only thing that we can never
control will be like
so in the end we were able to put
everything we learned together to get
through an entire vinyasa flow but we
started floating away from each other
vinyasa flow - at one point we looked at
each other because we were facing our
powers hurt it was just a total like by
the end of it I got super emotional
because we started talking about how
your strain correlates with awareness
creates new friends like yes this
relates to my life Wow every single yoga
was an experience the water yoga I loved
so much my body and the water just like
dive so well together the other two I
feel like man do I just suck my oh we're
polar opposites my favorite one was
actually hot yoga I loved being hot the
fact that made me moody right off the
bat and you can't stand the heat stay
out of the yoga studio the only thing
that really made me feel comfortable in
the hot yoga was seeing this alluring
there she was a familiar face and I
really enjoyed seeing her like kill it
on this one move that looks like your
moment you know what Maya are down
stuffing yourself we both have such
different strengths but I think that
when we try different things it really
shows we swung up in the air we sledded
our booties off and we swim like
mermaids underwater weird yoga rat or
fad Brad
