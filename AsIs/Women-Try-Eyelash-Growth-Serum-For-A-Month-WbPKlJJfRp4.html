like where I want to be as like my
current relationship with my eyelashes
is pretty like stale I'm getting married
in a couple of months and I would love
to have those long lashes for my wedding
day recently I've been on a natural kick
honestly like wearing less makeup I wish
that they were more naturally longer I'm
not a huge fan of falsies and the few
times that have gone to a salon to have
them put in
I immediately rub my eye and all the
lashes fell out I got like the fake lash
extensions I have like OCD so I get like
this tick or like I know it's there and
it's not part of my body so it's
annoying so I'd rather just like grow
what I have I have a little eyelash
drama you did a cookout one time and
like I had to turn on our grill my
eyelashes were like burnt to some other
reams so I'm hoping this makes me right
again we are going to try two different
eyelash serum one expensive and one
affordable and we're gonna be putting
this room on our eyelashes everyday for
a month on the left eye we will be doing
the cheaper serum which is the rapid
lash eyelash serum weight on our right
eye we're gonna be using Rodan and
Fields enhancement lash boost both of
these serums have pretty great reviews
online so I'm hopeful and I'm ready for
flawless lashes that sound like a
Maybelline commercial my lashes are
supposed to appear more beautiful
youthful and I have them labeled so I
don't this up we both have the same
instructions just to apply to the Queen
eyelid I'm optimistic let's try this out
doesn't really feel like I'm doing much
the road Annan field seems to be going
on a little
see it's a little wet right now
hopefully I didn't use too much I almost
wish it stung a little because then I'd
be like it's working but it doesn't feel
like anything happened so I guess you
really just have to wait and see people
are noticing the redness of my eyes more
than how beautiful I am so that's been I
have really sensitive eyes and I should
have known going into it but people have
been coming to good or you out last
night well yeah it looks like it's
snowing at night too that too but it
honestly the product it's been making me
react it kind of just feels like what it
does is conditions your lashes so that
they feel more confident to grow I think
that's how it works scientifically right
now I haven't noticed anything though
you have to put it on before you go to
bed like it has to dry for a little bit
a reason to stay up later I guess at
first remembering to put your Mon just
an extra thing you did at night but then
like you put it next to your toothbrush
you do it every night it was easy that's
not the product that's hard cuz the
product is just like one swipe but it's
just getting into the routines I'm just
not consistent so having to introduce a
whole new thing into my like nighttime
regimen has been the struggle there was
like two days that I missed and then I
put a little post-it note above it
saying
put the syrup on I've been doing
it every single day without really
hesitation it just kind of is just like
part of my morning routine the more
expensive I was a lot I guess wetter
or like the brush was thicker the more
expensive one has more liquid when I
apply it like there's more to dry it
looks like you have like some gloss on
your eyes kind of like the rapid lash
the applicator is just like finer and I
don't feel as wet as it does it was it
was surprisingly easy though I will say
that there was once where my eyes got a
little red because I think I got the
serum in my I woke up my eyes rub like
maybe needed to dry more or something
because my drops on and
clear the redness right now I don't know
maybe I put too much on other than that
I've been using it super regularly and
it doesn't bother me at all I don't want
to give up on my eyelashes I kept
applying them and over time it's kind of
now it's like fine I don't know if it
like got used to the syrup but it's not
red anymore
looks like my right might be a little
longer which is the more expensive kind
I couldn't do notice it's a little bit
more full but nothing too serious no
changes so so far so good I stopped
wearing mascara to see if anyone would
notice the difference in my eyelashes
and no one has said anything yet I mean
obviously there wasn't gonna be extreme
results for some reason I
I just wanted my eyelashes to literally
touch my forehead at this point but it's
not quite there yet now that I've gotten
into the routine and I'm remembering to
do it I'm just like getting impatient
though like mascara or fake eyelashes
it's just kind of instantaneous and then
yeah so that's so having to wait like
six weeks is getting a little yeah I
guess I've noticed in my mind that
things have changed but I'm just trying
to see if it's the real deal or if I've
just been like hoping it into existence
the changes happen very slowly so it's
been hard for me to tell myself but
every time I see someone I haven't seen
in a while they can tell and they look
long each each one looks about the same
length
I gave one the edge I would give your
right IV edge
I think more people said this side than
this side to your eyelashes on the left
I mean you're right this one yeah okay
this one this one looks longer can you
see it
and so I finally got it down we were
nice I was just forgetting to do it and
I got the cadence down until I run out
of the serum I do want to continue the
change might be just like minimal I
definitely noticed that the more
expensive I had a little bit more
fullness to it for sure even the bottom
it's just like a little bit more I don't
know just noticeable nobody has said
anything to me I've been asking people
forcefully if my eyelashes have changed
at all or if they notice anything is
fuller if he walks the boyfriend to see
if he didn't notices any differences
whatsoever wow they look really good
baby
I wouldn't say any longer maybe a little
fuller but they do look nice healthy
it's been over a month since we started
the eyelash serum
I got mermaid lashes the woman who put
the mermaid lashes are on she commented
about how nice my eyelashes looked I
can't cry because then I'll ruin my new
eyelashes and then I had a physical and
my doctor was like are those fake and I
was like nah bitch they're mine I'm
really excited to take a look at these
photos of my eyes he's nuts
before and after
oh my gosh my looks so mangy before
I don't
okay I personally see the difference
everyone's going to like this bitch it's
crazy
I definitely think the right I got
fuller or longer like by a smidgen for
sure like there's no doubt about it but
I really think that it renditioned to a
more full or lash like okay look at the
top one it's like you can clearly see
the difference here I think so I think
it definitely looks like so I'm actually
very much so pleasantly surprised that
it actually does make a difference my
eyelash has a little bit more of a curve
to it I'm glad these lashes are mine in
here to stay oh okay so oh you seem like
that create some shapes there's pros and
cons to both so the more expensive
product like felt better when I was
using it it felt like it would do better
but I think looking at these photos that
both the serums work go big or go home
go for the more expensive one because
clearly it's gonna work faster
it clearly has results in my mind if you
want to start and you don't have like
just cash money laying around I would
start with something a little cheaper
and see if that works
eyelash serums are not a myth they
actually do work it's mine
they're good I feel good about them what
you try serums for the first time just
setting expectations and I was like
expecting this dramatic like change and
you're not missing that obviously
because you're looking yourself every
day if you're curious I mean like it
won't hurt this picture they look
 bomb I didn't even realize that
my lashes looked you know any being that
nice I cannot really do like my natural
lashes I games lash pride and love the
flash love I'm gonna be able to do my
wedding one less thing to worry about
make sure at the band that we were the
flowers the groomsmen get the right
color suit but I don't have to worry
about my eyelashes anymore that feels
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
