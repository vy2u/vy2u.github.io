new dawn these are my buds
they've sprouted nipple rings
among the Nadia of the body accessories
can I pull it off don't worry we're not
piercing each other's nipples that is
illegal in the state of California we
looked it up
it's ladylike I'm gonna wear a pierced
bralette for today I have a long
precious journey with piercings a keloid
I get infected a lot a nipple piercing
would be like so painful for me imagine
how horrible it would be if your nipple
ring got caught on something and like
ripped off I don't even wear dangly
earrings kind of because of that it
would not be worth whatever aesthetic
value I got out of it because I know
that my particular body would just feel
like ow you aesthetically and like
what they stand for or women just
getting them just for the hell of it
because I feel like it I support no
piercings I feel like even though we
live in a very accepting place nipple
rings are still something that I think
can get a very visceral reaction out of
people I do think there is a kind of
like badass
stigma where it's like oh like you don't
care what other people think I'm hoping
that today my confidence will increase
and I'll feel comfortable just wearing a
shirt with no bra even if a piercing
isn't even a part of me closure for
utilitarian purposes this seems pretty
weak the actual style of it is pretty
cute when I picture any type of nipple
piercing or the nipple piercing that I
have seen they are never this thick oh
man this is gonna be really awkward huh
any opportunity to try on a bralette I'm
very excited about bra that's are so fun
they're so flirty they still kill it's
not a bra that's clear to me oh well
there's a little latch in the back which
is something that bra labs don't usually
have but this is going to be mixing like
the flirty fun and cute with like
badassness so I'm all for it it's just
not useful as a bra they're actually a
little bit further apart than the Rings
but they're pretty close to the ball
it's very comfortable this is weird you
guys okay all right
the reveal I don't know I expected them
to be a little more perky I think
because you can see the bralette through
my shirt I'm wondering if it's even more
unbelievable than it would be just in
general I think right now they're just
like little metal bars where my nipples
usually are I expect them to be like
bouncy or something
you know just looking down at the shirt
it doesn't really look that visible I'm
channeling Rihanna today kind of looks
like I've stuffed some things up my
shirt I've stolen some earrings from
Claire's I did notice that when I do
this just like point the hooks upward
that's like when it is very clear that
something is going on bitch better have
my money
let's go
Krusty what do you think of my bra I'm
more surprised that you're wearing a
white shirt I don't understand typically
out don't you think your that's good
with Sarah down there going on party
hats are out though I'm kind of
forgetting that I'm wearing this thing
other people aren't forgetting and it's
surprising
I think it's surprising cuz just so
brazen you know it's like is that really
is she okay
it definitely takes me pointing them out
for people to even realize that there
was there's like big ringing cringe they
look so real and I can't stop staring at
them I just left a meeting nothing was
said no eyes straight from my face so
maybe it is more of an in my head thing
than actually other people perceiving me
thing this is a thing or people doing
this just to to give the illusion of
kinky yes it's like you know a
non-permanent ways
have fun time mm-hmm the purpose of
these nipple rings I think is like
because people sort of like view nipple
rings is like very like rocketed
reviving it yeah like them go for I'm
just worried about the pain I like oh I
really do I like I don't know my nipple
ring but does it look like those are
some danglers the shirt is a little
see-through so you could what why is it
what do you mean yeah it's a lousy thing
so you can just kind I thought it was
just cuz the lights and the key knows
it's see-through out here like a little
bit can you show me
I feel like unless you really like take
a look they could just be wrinkles on my
shirt please leaps to wrinkles we wore
nipple ring bras today you could have
stopped that sentence at nipple rings
but we didn't we were nipple ring bras
which was weirdly even weirder you have
to be like oh no it's like not a real
nipple ring and I think that is more
confusing than if you were just like I
just got my nipples pierced I do kind of
feel away when people wear fake septum
rings so if I were to be wearing this
nipple ring bra and not really
committing and going for the gusto it's
just like I'm not real I'm not out here
the most fun way to wear this garment is
to wear it by itself or like under like
a jacket so you can kind of see the
effect of it it's more almost the
lingerie in a way you know to like the
fact that I think we were able to like
walk through our lives like pretty
confidently even if it was a fake nipple
ring is kind of cool just because I feel
like I thought I would be like walking
like this most of the day and eventually
it was just sort of like it yeah
whatever like you might look at my
nipples more I will just have to deal
with that I did enjoy it but I don't
really want to wear it again at least
not in public
lady tested lady amused chuckle chuckle
mm-hmm
