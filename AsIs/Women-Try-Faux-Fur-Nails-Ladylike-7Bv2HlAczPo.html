becoming each year oh I don't think you
can well you can wash you I think you
have to wash them like this
just keep working Instagram is always
buzzing with the newest nail trends but
what happens if you don't have the
budget for a professional job can you
DIY intricate nail art it's ladylike and
today we're playing can I wear that for
nails addition the Panera pasta meat
anaconda there
mm-wha Takako Kalika Zara TECA that's
pretty much that we are applying these
fake nails to the ends of our nails so
we have like a place to put the fur you
put the glue on the nail tip and then
you apply the nail tip to your nail this
is a perfect fit for my little pinky Jen
how we're gonna do the fur part I
already regret this I'm gonna say that I
already regret it Sugoi what I knew--i
not a little more this kid or designee
allocated to a fun money night I like to
put a little bit of glue on the tip and
then you take the fur and you put it
right on oh
okay that's not bad is that over : so no
say Kaplan young weekend Aikido so you
special event to taka taka daka party to
connect us to construct or plaster on
toast mo kawaii it's a little baby troll
it's like my dog Patrol I mean your
professional opinion you would say that
these probably are not the best nails
for everyday use hi this is the height
of fashion
I have reached it welcome
so we are about to embark on our day
we're getting wiped down to get the glue
off of our hands right now I'm going to
keep this feral and I think I might say
anything you like I'm just Chantel have
those two yeah no I see Chuck - yeah my
bad I have to pee how am I supposed to
do just peed my people ready can you
take us some lunch before you feed us
this is fancy a business yeah
what is this cashmere daily tasks are
pretty difficult please oh my nails
literally hurt right now my hands hurt
are you okay ah it looks like you dug
your hands into a dog hey I offer to I'm
scaring the puppy
why to look like it's high fashion no
what is it so I just try to type see if
you can decipher it's supposed to be
this is the worst day ever
you guys really aren't doing this right
it's likely run away today
oh did you apply them yourself yeah okay
yeah are we can cut it stupid you look
stupid it was a day that I will not soon
forget in terms of practicality as we
learn from our expert these nails were
not really meant for the everyday look
taking them off my fingers have never
felt so crusty before because we were
just soaking our fingertips in acetone
the question was can you DIY intricate
nail art the answer must be no
resounding no are at least other people
might be able to we clearly cannot it so
we lady tried to test it and it was lady
lay down for me a puppy ran away from
you so I'm not okay with that
maybe for someone else but not for us I
don't think I think it was lady disliked
there's a time to play this was neither
