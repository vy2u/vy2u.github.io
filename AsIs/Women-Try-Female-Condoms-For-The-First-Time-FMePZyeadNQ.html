going in it is sort of is my god okay
this terrifies me can it be like a big
penis like an elephant condom there's a
ring at the bottom it's bendier than i
expected it's not attached now it's a
chode condom in a ring I'm assuming that
the little part goes in first you can do
like a like and this bigger part kind of
sits on top like too much material
there's a good amount of lubrication on
there not even that good so what if the
guy has a small penis and it's like
dancing in there considering how much
Lube I'm covered in right now I'm a
little scared about trying this on I
feel like I'm gonna like end up with a
condom lost inside my vagina kind of
intimidating I'm not looking forward to
putting this on but I'm excited to try
even know how to do this there's that
bendy ring you're supposed to grab this
end and I am inserting it babies like me
getting new baby feels like the worst
trip to the gynecologist ever like a
legit like trash can bag inside of my
 I'm at that point where it keeps
popping back out I'm gonna walk around
stretch it out
head in for like five minutes and it's
fine
I took some trial and error I think I
got it it was interesting and by that I
mean awful and traumatizing you have to
get that thing far up inside you
definitely putting it in is the hardest
part it took me like 10 minutes like
actually putting in was just kind of
like popping out of my hands sorta felt
like a ziploc bag and then there's like
the outer part that just kind of lays
there like like a Christmas tree skirt
my boyfriend said it didn't feel like
anything I was like well maybe this is
enjoyable for him and he was like no
this is terrible I had to like hold it
down a little bit so we could do the
thing he sort of felt like he was in
in a bag I could see you wanting to use
the female condom if you were doing if
you're doing a double dick maybe it's
better for prevention of skin to skin
transmitted sexually transmitted
diseases it wasn't terrible he did it
hated it not really my five but maybe
it's someone else's you do you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
