silly I can do it let's try it let's
pump it all over this body I know that
it has the word contouring in it you
know what a contouring is when you put a
bunch of junk on your arms and try to
make people think you go to the gym more
than you do
it's like a mirage like I ain't by
numbers for your body it makes you think
something is there when it's not I don't
regularly contour most of just cuz I
don't know how to do it but I think it
looks really good when people contour
well yeah people come to our what looks
amazing which is why it's really sad
that we're doing this ourselves yeah I
think that it's gonna go really well and
I think that people are gonna laugh and
we're gonna have a good time and we are
going to look toned look toned in tan in
the middle of February hell yeah let's
 contour do it
hell yeah I'm Scott let's contour it I'm
going to be contouring my chest arms and
legs I'm gonna be countering my arms and
my legs it would be helpful if we had a
tutorial oh my god oh okay watch this
what happens see basically you draw
lines where the muscles would be if you
weren't a lazy okay ah I didn't
notice that
well it's good good - he has working
pectoral muscles it's a lot of
steps to this I bet if we like
screenshot it we can figure it out just
from that that's real okay let's try it
so I'm trying to just put darker color
wherever a crease would be and I'm also
trying to match it to the screenshots we
took of this tutorial
oh maybe you did the smarter thing I do
like the way this feels it's very
relaxing to just brush up no buck pink
nope I'm pale I am a pale like moon
white so then you take the lighter color
and you trace over your darker color
like that stuff like that look at my
muscles by giving myself cases with this
beauty blender that's good you deserve
kisses time to blend blend this is
actually enough of a work
where I could have to find muscles if I
just learned how to do this correctly
and I would happen wouldn't have to like
draw Brown smiles on my Harper it looks
great I should use the powder Midas kind
of looks like I have like a real bust in
vain
the cream seems more difficult to blend
in the powder the outer was really easy
to blend yeah this is super hard one
this doesn't look like anything I look
like the guy in like the camp of zombie
survivors who's been bit but hasn't told
anybody yet and it's like it's fine yeah
I'm gonna try the other arm with the
powder oh I am I'm right-handed this is
tough too gentle balls
