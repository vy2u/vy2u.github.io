as much as I love Rugrats that's not
exactly the look that I want to go for
so today we're gonna be trying Gabrielle
unions hair line brawl union is they I
feel like she's been an icon of black
beauty
aside from Tatyana Ali and Zarya from
Parenthood she was the only brown girl
that I really saw on TV that was like my
complexion representing I like used to
straighten and perm and like do all of
the terrible things to my hair and in
like 2008 I was still in college and I
couldn't afford the perms anymore so I
stopped and then in 2010 I stopped
straightening it and my hair is been
growing ever since
like I think before I used to really
struggle with my hair and didn't know
what to do with it but I love my hair I
love my fur I begged my mom to let me
get a relaxer because that's what all
the girls were getting and I just wanted
straight hair and then probably four
years ago I did the big chop and I
wanted to get my hair healthy again and
I wanted to remember what my natural
state even looks like I wanted something
fresh and new and I guess to get sort of
back to my roots I'm excited to try
these products I hope I find something
that really works for me I don't know
every single thing will I have no
reservations whatsoever so I just
finished shampooing and conditioning the
shampoo was intense I could feel like
stripping all the oils from my from my
scalp but the conditioner then
replenished everything so that's good
and now I'm about to attempt this hair
mask real quick I really like the
feeling of it is very very heavy which I
like for this feel like it's like
strengthening my
this could be worth it this definitely
could be worth it I did the shampoo and
conditioner and I used the hair mask and
the oil treatment and all as instructed
when I am noticing if my hair is like
super shiny and really full and this is
balm so this takes your hair I must say
it is full and pop and so it's about
5:30 p.m. and my friends just been out
and about all day I think it looks
pretty shiny and moisturized but feeling
it I think it could use another spray or
two I'm kind of thinking about the shine
spray is something that I should keep on
hand to kind of three up throughout the
day but in general I think it looks
pretty moisturize so the last step is
the shine spray I'm not seeing as need
to find stalls but smells delicious okay
so I just took my bonnet off my hair is
feeling pretty moisturized but my curls
are no longer defined usually what
happens by this point and they'll be
anyway so I'm going to throw my hair up
and use this edge control gel for the
first time so edge control seems to be
doing okay I do know that it's supposed
to get tacky and a little bit more
sticky over time which will keep the
flyaways down so I will keep you posted
on that but my curls appear also as I
said undefined and usually what I'll do
is I'll just like wet a few key pieces
and wrap it around my finger using
conditioner and so I'm going to
with this conditioner so I used the
smoothie conditioner to kind of define
what my curls and it did do the trick
see my hair now it's a little frizzy we
about to try the shampoo and conditioner
and see how it turns out so Kerry said
to now put the oil treatments in my hair
for styling purposes and then I'm gonna
put some shine spray in it so she's had
to put it in between the roots and work
my way up i'm scrunching it in just
because I got microscopy to find um what
I mean my hair is looking pretty big so
it's pretty close to the end of the day
and I think that the edge control is
turning white and kind of flaking on my
edges that's not ideal I mean it has
been holding them down but I'm not
really here for all this over the week I
noticed that my hair got like a lot more
shiny and especially full that was like
the thing that surprised me the most I
think I'll definitely continue to use
some of these products as a part of my
hair routine and I think the shine spray
is something that I could always use
just to like give it a little bit of if
it happens to start looking limp
throughout the week I would definitely
recommend this product to like my
friends I'm really happy that Ulta has
teamed up with Gabrielle Union to make
this awesome line of hair products for
black hair I think it's really important
to be able to go into a store and into
any kind of establishment and know that
you will find something for you I think
that this is the perfect line to do that
at Alta and I hope other lines follow it
