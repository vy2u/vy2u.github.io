slays ass lady sometimes you don't get
the most amount of sleep which sometimes
results in dark circles and I baggies
but what if you accentuated your dark
circles instead of trying to hide them
if ladylike and today we're trying
glitter concealer so how much sleep did
you get last night
last night was a good night last night I
got eight hours yeah I don't know I woke
up and had to pee like four times I'd
say I got about eight hours of sleep
last night really did what what does
that look like you went to bed at what
time maybe with 11:00 and then woke up
at like 8:00 yeah that matters I wasn't
that math we might know sleepy I just
don't do makeup cuz I don't want to yeah
I've already lost the fights I'm not
gonna put on makeup I'm not gonna
convince anyone I'm a well-adjusted
individual like have you ever noticed
when you're really tired your makeup
looks different
yeah for sure I mean for me it's more so
like I get like a puffiness around my
eyes as opposed to like dark circles
it's kind of like the opposite effect
feel like if I'm sleepy or tired my face
is just extra shiny even shinier than it
normally is it just looks like I'm a
thirsty person it just looks like I've
been in a desert and I'm just like a
ghost person I think it's cool to just
take stuff that people are like cover
that up and you're like how about no I
don't want to do my eyes I can't really
picture wearing glitter concealer
outside LM using this well we're about
to we're about to do that
I'm ready to become an art project so
step one you take your normal concealer
and then you put that under your eyes
and that'll act as glue to hold the
glitter on you don't say Chantel you do
not say and we're not using a bead layer
here at all right
no not really my boobies sorry you got
boogies eye buddies they're gone now
r.i.p step two you just kind of take art
project glitter and you put that on
first I was a bit heavy-handed with with
the first touch no I feel is good oh
yeah yeah let's do you okay come on once
said that glitter is the herpes of arts
and crafts cuz it gets everywhere and
you can't get rid of it can't get rid of
it yikes that's pretty accurate you're
supposed to start with chunky glitter
like art glitter and then move to like
makeup glitter oh no now this is a
classic folly of makeup where you're
like I'll just eat it out I'll just put
a little bit more on this eye and that's
where you end up with a coon eyes the
one thing about glitter is once you
start yeah I'm with you there I'm like
trying to make sure that I'm not getting
too crazy but like what is too crazy
when you're working with glitter this is
a lot easier than I saw it I'm just
gonna be I actually kind of feel like a
Missy Elliott backup dancer I feel like
my alter ego is Kesha now that's a I
wish I could say ketchup because that's
John chantell's yeah like Kesha you know
I see why this would be kind of a go-to
if you have dark circles it's like
you I didn't get any sleep be blinded by
my glitter I think people are gonna like
it I'm not really nervous about what
people are gonna say about it I do have
a meeting with my boss in 30 minutes so
there is that I think some people will
see us with this glitter and not really
questioning mana do you think that my
eyes are weird
I was taken back at first but how can go
wrong with glitter these glitter eyes
are sure funny one of my friends think I
actually didn't look at it yeah it kind
of looks like he fell into a bin I like
Michaels and I was just sort of like
stayed for years and I was just a part
of you I loved it as good Taylor right
now where you can close there and then I
got distracted with the cookies that you
just brought in so I'm walking down a
rather windy corridor and I'm realizing
that glitter could at any moment just
fly into my eye
I think this glitter concealer is kind
of messing with my vision a little bit I
can see it like out of my peripheral
like not this way but like underneath
yeah
honestly I love it
it's so extra but like it's so cute when
you got punch back well I want that I
need it so I have an eyelash in my eye
that I did mistake for glitter but I
think the glitter was a catalyst most
people I feel like you've been given me
a pretty positive reception to my
glitter eyes you look like rainbow fish
I did look like rainbow fish a gay fish
okay so it's now the end of the day and
I'm gonna try to take off this glitter
but I think I'm gonna go at it with some
coconut oil no no this is not good I
don't know if you can tell but those
pink glitter pieces stained my face I
think I accidentally might have dyed my
under eyes pink the day is done
glitter concealer was fun but then my
skin is stained you know maybe you
shouldn't wear under eye glitter for
eight hours like I did I make mistakes
so you don't have to get enough sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
