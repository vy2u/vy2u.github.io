holographic lip glosses I'm more of a
lipstick person I did wear a lip gloss
though back in like middle school I also
love anything holographic love getting
my nails done holographic style
have this holographic backpack have this
holographic glut and then I'm wearing my
holographic skirt my expectations for
this are something that'll stand out so
if I walk down the street with it on
people will be like Oh her lips are
holographic
I feel like holographic lipgloss is just
gonna be clear I don't understand the
science that's gonna go behind it that
makes it holographic I'm hoping for the
best but I don't really know okay I see
holographic branding oh my god oh my god
it's so trippy because this is a white
one and when you put it on it comes out
purple it's like glow-in-the-dark it's
really cool every streak I do changes
color at first it's like orange and then
it goes to pink what it's it's cool but
I think that for some reason it's boring
to me when I think of holographic I
think of my alter ego and my alter ego
is not boring
it just is shining like a thousand suns
ah
this is so weird this one looks like it
doesn't any green in and it comes out
and it's like green I'm gonna try on
transcend to see it it comes out the
same way it's coming out on my hand
right now
this is so cool
I'm gonna try otherworldly oh my god oh
my god oh my gosh I don't even have to
say this is beautiful this is perfect I
feel like I need to be you know
launching his face I ended up really
liking transcendence which is rising
because it was one of the colors I was
like oh like it's cool but yeah maybe
not I am shocked that these are all so
different and so pigmented I didn't
think that you could have holographic in
so many colors like this is a dream
it did meet my expectations I'm not
walking away from this upset I'm walking
away from this feeling like a badass you
know skeptical at first but blew me away
blew me away thank you for making the
world a better place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
