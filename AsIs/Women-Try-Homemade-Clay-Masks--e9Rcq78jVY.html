whether it doesn't the audience won't
know they're just going to see my face
cover with some really weird brown and
we're going to go with it so today we're
trying clay masks whoo that was we
typically attend to get acne like here
and there throughout the entire mop so
I'm very oily I do like to get the extra
oils out I've definitely seen this on
Pinterest before these ingredients all
look super familiar I haven't heard
about specifically Indian healing clay
but something in my brain is like yeah
clay that's really good for you
mix clay with equal parts of raw apple
cider vinegar so you can't use a metal
bowl or a metal mixing utensil I kind of
freaks me out I wonder is this one of
those masks where like your face gets
too pretty too tight I'm just gonna use
two spoonfuls of this oh it's fizzing
ooh oh okay
oh yeah nice and pasty oh no tingling
sensation yeah guys but let's hold for
more of a reaction I never put masks on
so I feel like very glamorous I probably
look super glamorous too I don't really
like apple cider vinegar and that's
literally all it smells like but at the
same time if it's gonna do wonders on my
face I don't really care I don't think
there's any way to look cute while
putting on face masks when you go to a
sleepover you know that at some point in
the night you're gonna look like a
gremlin and I really thought the smell
wouldn't be as potent but it is it's
drying well I don't want to laugh okay
love there's so much a lot of those but
I can't if I I've had tighter mass maybe
I could have put on a little bit more oh
god no I'm so
but guys we're in the bathroom we're
about to take this off let's see if my
face is transformed like I literally
look like the cracks and a desert floor
yeah it's really cresting over Oh what
is that sound yeah
maybe I don't know if we let it sit for
do is one of my eyelash nasty done just
kidding
looks like snot rocket it's like I mean
my skin definitely feels less oily that
might be because I washed it it's kind
of like an arts and crafts project it's
messy and sometimes it ends up on my
face
unfortunately I'm pretty bougie and I
really like to spend a pretty penny on
my masks because I see the results
immediately this has given the same end
result as when I've used those expensive
masks I'm definitely down to do this
again it's two simple ingredients so why
not
