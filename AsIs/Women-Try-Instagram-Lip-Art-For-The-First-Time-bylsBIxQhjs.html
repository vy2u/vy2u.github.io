sweat going down my back I need some lip
injections before I start this process I
don't know if I can fit a whole galaxy
on these things look at his eye it looks
like I ate a little bit of glue did you
get so many dots I feel like I missed
sup when in doubt I just keep adding
more of the little white dogs oh my god
what a world of difference butter makes
people I lost the comment and there's
somewhere I lost the stars but the color
is kind of cool you'd like a snack oh
yeah I can't even eat how do Instagram
people eat I'm surprised I drew within
the lines that's just a feet on its own
you know people should get awards for
this
it has sequins so it's gonna be extra
hard it's like I can already hear people
on the internet judging me there's gonna
be glitter on my face for the next four
years after this I honestly don't know
how she does this so fast that's not in
the right spot it's fine I think
honestly is the easier if you just shred
some eyelash glue around your lips and
then you just dunk your face into some
sequins we're just gonna slowly watch
this gold dribble down my chin the black
and the shimmer I would definitely do
again that's about as far as I was
couple I don't have an upper lip so like
it's hard would you kiss me you kissed
me right I kiss me I would not kiss me
but it's kind of cool and I'm really
trying it's not even like I'm not trying
like I'm really trying if I get one more
little gem in my mouth I'm gonna be mad
this is when your ex text you with the
how you've been texts good now that
you've gone I'm holding my arm cuz I
shake this is so relaxing oh it's not
that bad
mine kind of looks the same kind of I'm
very proud of myself you know I need to
have more confidence in my abilities to
do makeup this is like really difficult
cuz the colors are so vibrant that like
if you mess up it's gonna be noticeable
I'm not bored yet hon this is what you
don't see on those YouTube tutorials the
show that's down here never thought I
would try to force something in a drip
from
so first time for everything I have been
trying for five minutes to make this
bean trip happen just try it
how did this looks like I have a little
soul patch now I think I nailed it and
I'm very surprised and I think it's
because it doesn't require like
perfection I feel like this lipstick
would trick people into thinking that I
was happy to see them if you were out to
eat or something you would just be
eating just lots and lots of butter your
purchases about glittery everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
