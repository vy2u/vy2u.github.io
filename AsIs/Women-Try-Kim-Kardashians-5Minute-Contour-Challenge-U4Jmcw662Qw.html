to you woman to woman just like don't
lie I'm Kardashian posted a video on
Instagram that's a five minute tutorial
on how to contour there's no
way can read it it takes five minutes a
convoy we all have time lapse these days
I can see it she could do it in five
minutes I don't think she does it in
five minutes we're gonna try and see if
we can actually do this makeup look in
five minutes following Tim's video
she definitely has more makeup on than
she's telling us I wish I knee does
sound weird Kim short forehead no
there's no way she did that there's a
way I think I can do something in five
minutes I don't think I'm gonna look
like Tim well this timer is set to five
minutes that means I have five minutes
to get Kim K Slade on your mark get set
go and she's going so fast oh my chains
a little darker
she looks like Simba good but it's not
going great
this is what she does right whoo I have
a shorter forehead guys stop the clock I
beat Kim K she is setting me up to fail
I think I'm done okay here's the thing
I'm done before the time is up but this
looks terrible
I'm three seconds okay I get it I get it
cool Kim why didn't you do this to me do
I look like Kim Kardashian know that
beat Kim yes do I think there's a snake
yes you told me I can do this for five
minutes and I couldn't I definitely need
to practice but I think I kind of
Kardashian this I actually thought maybe
I was gonna be able to do it but it
turned out far worse than I imagined I
contoured with the K and he did it good
I know that she didn't do that it took
like three hours we're gonna do but she
looks great I think five minutes is
enough time to do this if you're Kim
Kardashian my cheekbones do look ray
endorse me for contouring on LinkedIn
