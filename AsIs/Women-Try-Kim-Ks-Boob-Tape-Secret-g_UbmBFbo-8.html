her app that were held up with like
copious amounts of tape that's her
secret to getting great cleavage in like
low plunging tops I have very low
expectations because I have very little
to work with
I've breastfed two children and my
breasts are not the same I wonder if the
tape will actually like bring me the
lift in the look that I'd love to have
really good push-up bra gonna cost you a
whole lot more if it works for her it's
gonna work for us right this is like a
very strange arts and crafts project
yes I'm kind of making a bra you're
supposed to bend over so that like the
boobs are like where you want them to be
putting sort of a piece of tape on the
side to like push the under boob in a
little bit I work that side boom ladies
what I thought make sure they thank God
it's not like she's perfect she knows
how to work it
I need to make an adjustment and that
hurts what the hell I wish I had like
two days porn of assistants to help me
do this
you
I feel really good like I feel like I
have support I'm big fan of how they
look with the tape you know - the tape
showing through I would rock this I
think Kim knows what she's talking about
and standing very stiffly because if I
move my shoulders a certain way all the
tape is gonna come off and they'll be
really awkward when my boobs just like
drop a foot I couldn't do this at an
event it's so hard to move you can do
this for like a one Instagram shot and
that's it it feels better than I thought
it would still not great like I wouldn't
like go out all night with tape on the
tips I'm not very impressed I mean I've
got small boobs it wasn't like I was all
of a sudden gonna become Kim Kardashian
I get it
just gonna wear the dresses that I know
I look good in and not feel obligated to
change my body for a photo my partner's
gonna be like shocked and kind of
worried that I have bandages and tape
everywhere they're like are you okay are
you bleeding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
