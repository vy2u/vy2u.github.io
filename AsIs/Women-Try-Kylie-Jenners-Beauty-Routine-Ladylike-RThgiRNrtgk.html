me King Soph and she said no
Kylie Jenner arguably the most stylish
of the kardashian-jenner clan but is her
look attainable by mere mortals like
ourselves
it's ladylike and we're trying Kylie
Jenner's beauty routine Kylie for a
family that's criticized for being
famous just for being famous I think
she's taking that Fame and trying to do
something legitimate how lucky could one
kid be to just like be able to have
access to all these different resources
she has to kind of always be
camera-ready which kind of sucks she's
got the lashes the wig I like her makeup
I think it looks nice it doesn't seem
like it's that complicated to me the
lipstick the extra lips I don't think I
will like this challenge just because I
like to eat cheese I hope I don't break
out I don't know how she'd hate such a
good skin let's do it
wig me up did you know Kylie Jenner
started wigs I don't know what any of
the stuff is I guess I just put this on
my bot like everywhere did she do this
in case like fans grabbed her they just
like slip off I need to wax my arms I
just let them go for so long that the
hair is now wrapping around my arm Mel's
like Girl Scout cookies it's just crazy
that somebody who just turned 18 RT is
using like eye cream eye cream is so
expensive Charlotte Tilbury light wonder
youth boosting perfect skin foundation I
have never tried any of our products
because they're also quite expensive I'm
gonna attempt to contour myself now this
is like AP makeup class I look very tan
more bronzer I like it I'm into this I
feel like I just bronze I've never
gotten to the privileged to use this and
it's about to go on my face maybe yeah
time for the bottom brown pressed powder
this I am intrigued by these are huge
okay so she has like dark colored
eyelash glue and so when she puts it on
the inside here it looks like she's
already wearing eyeliner does take
everyone else's long he's feel pretty
lightweight actually they feel nice I
don't usually wear mascara on a daily
basis I do wear mascara if something
fancies happening for my final trick I'm
gonna put on some lip liner but the
funny thing is he doesn't use the
lipstick she just uses the liner for all
over lips I have a bad feeling about my
butthole lip that was so hard time for
the Quig again this bad boy I have more
hair than this wig does so it doesn't
really fit I feel like like exactly like
those famous Instagram models I'm more
uncomfortable than I thought it would be
the last time my hair was this color
George Bush was president so Kylie
doesn't really wear perfume but uh when
she does it's this coconut passion do
this no dairy
one day everyone's been giving me like a
very polite hello and then they'll be
like draw it back to like Christmas so
the guy at the cash register said he
thought this is my real hair which is
impossible but I'm also mad at Freddie
because Freddie got feta it's fine I got
avocado it's fine we all like cheese
Freddie walking a lunch right now and I
honestly feel like I'm dressed like such
an asshole
start lipstick is so scary I feel like I
can't do anything with my mouth my
headphones keep sliding off my wig I was
gonna play
things have been going quite well with
that
Sylvie's in the bathroom I've just been
making a lot of snapchat it took me
forever to take a selfie I feel like I
don't know any of my angles anymore I
gave up on just wearing a lip liner and
I put on her own lip kit and it just
it's so much better I also have to eat
Kylie's snacks which is this sad packet
of almond butter what up everyone its
Kylie in my car I'm taking this wig off
because it's so itchy
it's time whoop my lashes are literally
pressed up against my glasses it's
pretty crazy the difference makeup first
no I have zits that I did not have 12
hours ago
I like sheet masks this one's rose it
smells very nice hello Clarice it's
auntie Kylie we have all returned to our
natural habitat saw you need our natural
faces we're all okay now
so we survived I do have a couple
pimples
I was super greasy I literally just
watched as it slowly grow in my face
throughout the day you looked great with
your weight I was amazing I got things
like that blonde color ashen you look
like the summer version of you Oh feel
like summer 2016
sadness mostly I turned into a monster
that couldn't stop taking selfies like I
was literally in the bathroom holding a
handful of tampons and taking selfies I
was at the place we won with our
co-workers after work in the bathroom
again taking selfies I actually loved
those false lashes I could not feel them
throughout the day they were wonderful I
really like the lipstick I'm not a brown
lipstick person I am a bright lipstick
person if we had that added element of
people following us and stalking us that
would be really creepy and
I worry like how much pressure she must
be under to like live the way that she
does like yeah she's super privileged
and very rich but like that's got to be
hard for any kid I don't know if this
makes sense but we're interested so lady
tested lady curious does that work would
do it again yeah yeah
I'm fascinated still interested more
powder this time though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
