really pigmented eyeshadow we're trying
Kiley's holidays yeah yes I ordered the
entirety of Kylie's holiday collection
and we're gonna try and swatch every
single color I don't work highly
products I try them but I don't like to
order my makeup online I like to see it
in person I don't - Kylie liquid
lipstick and that's only because we use
them in videos but I do like them a lot
like I actually like actively wear this
I own a few Kylie products and I do like
them they're a little on the expensive
side but I find it invigorating to try
and like get them online you know you
get a kick out of it you got to wait I
borrow a lip gloss here and there for a
special event and it's nice this is how
big the collection is yeah and they're
intimidating oh I should actually do
this way wait hold on wait this is what
happened when we open the boxes I'm
going to keep those styrofoam things so
they're so useful okay thanks Kylie so
we have five lip or nine yes oh I didn't
know those are ornaments - these are
deluxe ornaments I'd get excited if I
came downstairs on Christmas morning and
saw neshama tree badges just don't know
if I need this hanging on my tree it's
what but it's a present in an ornament I
trying to hang them at an angle at which
you would hang them because you are a
tree I already broke this lip liner oh
my god sure you bedded it the thing
about Kylie's lip kits though is that
they smell so wonderful yeah I can smell
it from here

are all just kind of like holiday
berries winter holiday berries
bramble berries cranberries of black
berries boysenberries there we go I
think my favorite is definitely Mary I'm
a fan of sparkles so I'm gonna say
dancer I like this color but I don't
think anyone surprised that I like this
color so the skin on my bottom lip is
sealing and it's very visible with the
it's all over my teeth yeah I didn't
take long I've never used a makeup wipe
on my teeth but I'm like getting close
this is a little set of coal size
full-size liquid lips it's like sparkly
rose gold into it it's like My Little
Pony colors sign me up
I lost me I'm staying away from the
constants let's start with Cupid it's
like sexy penny I'm into it sexy Lincoln
you would dress up as an ornament and
wear Noelle on your lips
this is Blitzen the bro' reindeer yeah a
pretty little perp for this one is angel
it's a little bit 80s sitcom set like
this is the color of the curtains on the
Golden Girls oh I feel like Britney
Spears right now I look crazy just
because my lips are so so pink under
here no and I wanted I wanted to be an
ornament
I love Woodson it's definitely my style
I don't know if it's holiday no it just
looks like Freddie mm-hmm I think I
perfected the bird face another lipstick
