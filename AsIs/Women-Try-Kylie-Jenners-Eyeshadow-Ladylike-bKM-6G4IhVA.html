everyone who watches this video we're
playing a game called let's be nice to
Freddie for 30 minutes I'm here with our
friend Jasmine who is gonna try these
Kylie Jenner eyeshadows with us I think
she's having a lot of fun with her name
in her products they're called Chi
shadows upon until you said that what
makes a good eye shadow though is the
fact that it stays on I think like how
pigmented it is how it blends how it
stays on right like the world of makeup
is fascinating it's so old-school
BuzzFeed to have us watching a video
with a little headphones on it is let's
dive right in
oh Lord so they're long wearing they
blend so effortlessly
what do you I get confused because I
don't totally understand like what it
means I don't know I'm not upset I'm
getting like emotional haha in her
defense I do like that orange but I
think it's funny that she was like the
color orange it was very important to me
it does disturb me a little bit that we
never see Arielle's face like do you
think she only has one makeup artist she
probably is a few for different
occasions right what tiger's eye you
could tell she she is grinning she's
like this is an inside joke Tyga's ah
they're back together right did he buy
her a car I do not know this is just a
lot of activity in and around my eyes I
think at this point tears would just be
streaming down my face yeah exactly I
mean it looks nice I just want Arielle
and Kylie to like me so what look are
you gonna try to create I'm gonna try
and do this oh cool alright shall we get
started let's do it
let's prime eyelids what do i do first
here Jasper oh this like really white
one that's Jasper look at the orange
Hudson since I light maybe a bit bright
for me so I think the second color you
do a thinner line of highlighting quartz
to the brow bone okay back to the brow
bone realize I'm ambidextrous yeah I
don't know I did that
thanks Kylie when's the part where they
talk about how to dry your makeup you
should take your face in there
conditioner
that's my number one I think that
Arielle used every color lightly ad
topaz to the eye crease and buff really
buff me into one yeah having to go
darker Tyga's I think his eyes are
really that color what do you think they
talk about oh I'm noticing that this
tutorial does not cater to my skin tone
at this point I'm just DIY I obviously
haven't blended anything but I feel like
these are very pigmented and a lot
happening they stay all right citrine
okay I'm coming in with citrine the
orange that's it yes much time to shine
I guess I just get disappointed because
I really do feel like I'm trying hard I
don't know we'll see how it looks at the
end right I feel like my grandma why
pick my grandma wears crazy colors I
think you're just coming along quite
well I just need like a little bit of
validation to get through makeup videos
so I did the tutorial I got scared I
bite it all off that's the story of my
life it literally looks like I have
nothing on so it's okay like it's
definitely it's subtle maybe push harder
these do that blend effortlessly Kylie I
feel like I'm blending my eyelids were
all I veered off course I started
putting powder in my brows my vision is
blurry I feel like the judgment of how
good of a job you are doing is if people
saw you would they think it was a joke
would they think it was in earnest but I
put her eye shadow on my lips it looks
like a barn her lips oh it's nice I look
crazy I think I needed to ditch the
tutorial a long time ago we're reviewing
this palette I feel like we like the
palette if we're reviewing like our own
application of the palette I think that
they're nice shadows and they blend well
and it was fun I think it took me from
like fun and exciting to basic you feel
like this is basic Jasmine
this was a time for me ahead of time I
think Freddy is going to be okay is my
conclusion
listen Kylie I will give you cash
shadows I think I shadows is a funny pun
I will not give you tiger's eye because
we know you're referring to your
boyfriend I'm having a hard day you guys
yes everyone be nice to Freddy goddammit
