like scuse me please take me to the hit
job section of the store recently Macy's
did something super exciting they became
the first major retailer to have a line
of jobs and modest clothing Verona
collection which is a line that has the
jobs and other types of modest clothing
for the Muslim gals today we have almost
a lot of stuff yen Verona we have jobs
we have miscellaneous long stuff we have
bumpers robbers long stuff yeah sure and
we're gonna try them on and you get to
see you strut not like see us try it on
but but like you know you know but you
know what I'm talking about
well should we go try these clothes
let's do it let's do it this is Verona
and this is tu okay so we have matching
duster things I like it I think it's
really functional it has pockets it's
like a nice thing to just throw on over
like you know these high-waisted jeans
that I wear every other day so my head
job the frayed ends are really cute and
I'd like it'd be super keep it just like
tie in front or kind of like put behind
to you and it's a little texture to I
give you and you can see like rays you
always need like a staple piece like
this yeah especially with the duster I
think it'd be super cool to like wear to
work like if you are like in a more
business casual environment so outfit
number two
you look amazing you'll be like I'm
feeling these the button oh yeah
oh I like this like long dress it's very
like Islamic schoolteacher but like you
know make it fashion like with this
little slit and it's like it's a it's a
good look for like a formal event or
like kind of even more casual depending
on like how you want to dress it down
this is like a robber situation going on
but it's very like it's like a satiny
feel which I love rompers but I don't
really have a romper
like this it literally feels like I'm
wearing PJs throw this on and like a
bright good job hmm
you've won whatever the whatever the
thing is you want it okay I see you I
see your ruffle I love it that's cute I
feel like we're victorian-era like poets
that you know are like homies yeah
Victoria here homies I love it I love
your hood job did they have her jobs in
the Victoria in 1709 you could wear this
to like 18th century poetry reading or
you could wear it to work I live for
just casual nude slash Brown jobs I
don't think you can ever have enough no
I really like these little bell sleeves
I've been looking for a good fellow it's
a really cute like subtle bell sleeve
which I really love yeah it's not too
over-the-top I'm obsessed with this like
blood red that the pinata ring into the
table it's like a really everyday outfit
which I like I think I feel most
comfortable in it I feel like overall
this line a is so convenient like
everyone has a Macy's near you like I
think that's an amazing kind of seat for
a Muslim woman especially Muslim women
run companies need to be recognized in
this major way that's phenomenal and I
think like that makes me so proud and
inspired one thing I think I'd like to
see as we see more Muslim labels come up
is just like including more plus-sized
women more clothes for curvier women
petite sizes taller sizes I think we're
like in a really pivotal moment as far
as like Muslim fashion goes it'll be
interesting to see how Muslims
should develops in the future so I love
it and I think we should go make a trip
to make these let's do it why are you so
far away I don't know just do this let's
go to sleep
so you might have noticed bold leaves
now as is but don't worry you'll still
get all the same awesome content you
used to plus even more new great stuff
