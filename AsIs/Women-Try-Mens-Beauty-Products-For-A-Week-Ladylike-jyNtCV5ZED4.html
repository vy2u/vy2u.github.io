yeah there's no manly oh you do yeah
don't tell me no woman's body care and
bath products can be expensive as hell a
lot of time it's more expensive than guy
stuff is it all a marketing ploy or the
stuff we use actually better its
ladylike and today we're taking on the
pink tax the pink tax is what we call
the extra money that it costs to buy
women marketed products especially with
like razors and with body wash I think
that women have more options of course
some will be more expensive but I think
that no guy stuff is not as fun or
exciting
I will pay a little bit more just to
know that like my hair is moisturized
and that my curls are being taken well
care of basically I'll pay any amount of
money for a good hair product marketing
companies kind of play off of that and
feel like they can get away with more
expensive things because women consume
it more
I think guys products are like there's
less frills to them so it's easy to find
cheap versions I'm very susceptible to a
good deal
go to Target command section how do you
know it's for men it'll say for like
rugged probably gonna be the tiniest man
section it's like all women feel like we
need to get to in 1 3 in 1 look at this
well is this for men no this looks kind
of goes kids for children now do they
have a men's ethnic section or do women
only have you as an exception clean-cut
look classic pomade I could use this for
my edges why do boys always want to in
one like why don't what is what is with
caffeine and menthol we beg you done no
I guess I just don't want to smell like
an asshole ask Apollo X Phoenix what
option do I have
this is the face wash I use there's no
organic stuff no more getting suffer
guys got everything we lost Freddy right
well ok Freddy's dead and this video is
taking a very different turn
you found Freddy hi I had to go get a
birthday card but hey I'll need things
from Target ok
you
you
so just trade it in all of my girly
for all the manly also can we talk
about how this is volcano powered sweat
destroyer with palm tree scent okay so I
have the shampoo in my hair and first
thing I noticed is that it smells so
strong okay so I just went to yoga this
men's deodorant is doing the trick this
is what happens you have big hair he's
doing what you bill so I just used the
axe shampoo two-in-one
it doesn't feel super moisturized I
shaved my legs probably 24 hours ago
they feel pretty darn smooth I will say
that my hair looks crazy but it feels so
pretty into the body wash it felt really
good in the shower um
smells pretty nice it's a little strong
for my taste I smell so good right now
so maybe men's deodorant is for me look
at that leave that man moisturizer it's
behaving like regular moisturizer and
the breakouts have begun PIM please
popping up they smell kind of like a man
no you smell nice
why doesn't it smell good it's not your
usual Musk all right so I'm a cold booth
and this
pretty much all the selection that are
just marketed for me I found some
three-in-one natural man so then I'm
gonna pick that up and see how that
fares today is the last day of men's
products I really miss my normal
products it's been a journey so I used
men's personal care products for one
week I think I wink at more people this
week because I was like oh I'm just sort
of a dude and then I was like the first
morning I woke up and I was like there's
a man in my bed no that's me I had the
most feelings about the deodorant this
deodorant is not antiperspirant and I'm
mad about it this deodorant did things
for me normally at this point in the day
I smell like vo on a stick it smells
great it definitely smells like a dude
I like that smell wasn't that much of an
adjustment I know I actually kind of
liked the new smell I kind of smelled
like a metal pole I did shave my legs
the first day and it was so nice but the
two-in-one shampoo was horrific
my hair didn't look terrible after I
used it but it was dry the body slash
face washed - and one thing broke me out
horribly but I will say the sort of
natural body and face wash that I got
from Whole Foods did work for my body
and face my boyfriend Paul uses women
shampoo he uses my shea moisture shampoo
because again there really aren't that
many options for ethnic hair for men I
would definitely buy men's versions of
deodorant
and razors for sure I like consistency
so I'm probably not gonna switch to
these products but they worked fine most
of these products are pretty much the
same it's more the selection and
personal preference that comes into play
I could tell a difference I just
honestly I want to go home and wash my
hair with expensive things
what body wash to use Ben
