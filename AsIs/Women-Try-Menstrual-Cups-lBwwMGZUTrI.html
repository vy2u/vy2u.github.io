time in a month I usually use pads day
one I'm like oh shit I have to run to
CVS and then I buy a whole box of
tampons tampons are the main form of
Defense I just try and pray that it
doesn't come but it always does I am a
proud Ivica owner enthusiast guru
whatever does this cup and you fold it
in half and use it stick it on up there
it just catches the blood let's say I
got my period in the morning go the
entire day with it in and then at
nighttime a night shower
so when I'm taking a shower I'll just
like take it out dump it out take it
back it up clean it stick it back in my
dima cup right now is doing the best
thing you could ever be doing it is in
me because I'm on my period what did I
get myself into my little diva cup it's
uh you know really nice now when it's
not covered in red mucusy blood oh my
god it looks like a little nipple this
is big I feel like I'm gonna be walking
around all day like I have to pull up my
ass or something how do you know when to
change it out wow oh my god this is
overwhelming
a little bastard I will win this one
maybe I should just shove it up and see
what happens great okay oh god I'm
sweating engaging okay giggles now and
oh god no okay I start over again take
two how do you relax your vagina muscles
okay think about vacation this is so
hard
hold on oh I did it we did it it is in
I don't feel anything what the fuck
idea it's pretty good it's like a
phantom in my vagina it's pretty far up
there it's pretty sizable does it be
like hanging around and not feeling
anything I just don't trust it basically
I put it in there the my vagina was like
all right so I've been you know walking
around having a normal day all is going
well so far I also feel like I have a
secret that no one knows about
definitely there were leaks I'm just not
good at this or how difficult that thing
was to get in I have not felt it all day
I don't know being able to get it out
we'll find out soon stay so just check
that for lunch
there were still leaks and I'm out of
panty liners so stakes are high
I just spent about 15 minutes try to
make that shit out I eventually had to
use my Kegel muscles to really push it
out okay sorry update
that was thing enough for lunch it's way
too many hours later so I'm here now
after a week I've lost my David Cup
virginity I have an appreciation for the
Diva Cup versus using a pad it was
pretty awesome the goal was to master
the Diva Cup did I complete that goal I
don't think so
the nice part was being able to wear it
pretty much the entire day without any
fuss it's just like a tampon you don't
you don't feel it and it just seems
pretty convenient honestly and I did
have like one set of hours I was
fantastic it was like like six hours
where it was working it was doing all
the things I'm like is it worth the few
time that it doesn't I don't know yet
the hard part I would say is like take
it out I mean that thing like really
like sucks to you you know what I'm
saying like it's really like a cuff like
you you gotta like pull that shit out
like a puzzle no I feel like a gladiator
like I fended off the bloody enemies and
yeah it feels great I'm a pro Diva Cup
user makes her period not quite as bad
yeah I mean definitely not out of me
