monolids are basically just eyes without
the crease or the double fold is when I
was learning how to use eye makeup I was
using techniques that people with actual
double eyelids were using so it just did
not have the intended effect on me
I think a lot of people can relate to
like painstakingly putting like a nice
line of eyeliner and then as soon as you
open your eye it disappears
I've been recommended double eyelid
surgery from people I guess in a sense
it would have made it easier for me to
put on makeup because it's kind of hard
to find monolid makeup tutorials I'm
always open to learning more makeup
packs
I guess monolids are a blank canvas
we'll see the floating eyeliner happen
that's basically just where you do your
eyeliner where you can see it only and
not like the super thick black eyeliner
that a lot of us tend to do this
technique hopefully will save a lot of
eyeliner I'm putting on primer right now
which is supposed to help keep the
eyeliner from smudging it's like hard to
tell where to start but if you have your
eye open and you just want to like got
it a little bit I think it helps I'm
gonna try putting a cat eye if it looks
like there's eyeliner on when I open my
eye that's crazy
Oh nope I'm not completely sold on it
because it might look weird when I close
my eyes I know that this hack saves
product but honestly I would just go all
the way and fill everything
the colored eyeliner hack you put on
some colored eyeliner around your
existing eyeliner and it gives a little
color pop going in so I'm doing a pretty
thick line of the purple this is so
pretty
mimic the color pretty thick because you
usually have to make my liner really
thick for it to show up I like it it's
got a lot of like personality in it but
not too much personality
I feel really cute I don't know I'm not
allowed to say that I get the idea
behind this hack but I don't think it
works for me unless I were to like
pretty much fill in my entire eyelid you
can't really see the color
the vertical gradient technique
basically it just means that you're
taking your eyeshadow instead of going
from light to dark
this way it's better suited for monolids
to go from dark to light
I'm putting the darkest color close to
my lash line so far it's kind of working
and then do a medium color then the last
part which is the highlight at the top
I'm not great at a shadow so there's
definitely a learning curve with any
type of makeup pack maybe with more
practice I'd like this technique I think
it's a lot more subtle it's a lot better
if you want to try the like no makeup
look the faux crease I'm going to use a
dark eyeshadow to create a fake crease
and then I'm going to fill in the rest
of my eyelid with some lighter shadow
and you're just blending the out of
it so it can make your eyes look really
great all those people who told me I
needed a double eyelid surgery look at
me now I can save that money and go to
Paris I kind of like it in certain
angles but no no no I do think it worked
in that I feel like this eye does look
bigger but again the issue is I am
at makeup it looks like I drew on my
face with markers
this was actually really fun to do
because I don't really play around with
my makeup that much before today I'd
never tried anything that was
specifically designed to work with a
monolid eye and it's just a cool
alternative or an option that I have
instead of getting surgery which if you
want to do I think that's totally fine
but if you don't you have these mica
packs I'm always open to experimenting I
just need some training first
