well let's just be real we knew this
we knew this we knew that when they put
me in this chair that I was here to fail
the neon makeup trend I know it's the
thing and I know that there are some
women and men out there that are really
good at it and I don't think I'm going
to be one of them I didn't know that
this was a thing that was real but I
love color so it was super excited when
I found out it was a real thing I feel
like I've seen neon makeup and like
music videos and stuff but I've never
ought to wear it this is never a look I
would personally do on myself it's a
little goth that can't be real oh this
is insane
looks like a Tim Burton character and a
Tron character had a baby that baby
threw up on these people's faces let's
start off with like a little light base
I think after this I'm either going to
look like a clown or just like very
hungover almost fully covered on this
lip here pers looks kind of like Whoopi
but mine looks kind of like go there oh
yeah okay just gonna eyeliner it out now
just gonna eyeline right now I'm not mad
at this I think it's a little bit muted
right now so I think once I put the
black on top of it it'll be way more
defined
I think I'm just barely II could buy
here like this is like a merica the next
top model' and I have to like create my
own runway look I was just like shaking
her head at me right now when in doubt
you just wiped it back off David Bowie
would approve this look Oh hmm this is
not this is not my look lord I didn't
expect this to be so hard and horrible
what I'm still gonna I'm still gonna try
yeah I don't even know what happened
here this is just a disaster
these colors just I don't think are
flattering on me I look like Malibu
Barbie got really drunk and got lost I
am finishing with a black lip because
one I feel most comfortable in black and
two I think like it needs to be finished
she probably used some like exacto
knives to like frame it out she probably
like had like a stencil on her eyeball
this was made for me to fail okay
this was hard like I thought this was
going to be maybe a little easy because
I'm pretty decent with makeup I mean I
think this look is definitely not for
amateurs you know maybe maybe I need a
little bit more practice but I think I
got the general idea this isn't like the
best case scenario of things happening
on my face but it's different and I'm
all for being different the only
difference between me and the girl in
this picture is that I did not use
witchcraft while doing my makeup I want
to see some receipts oh I see a tutorial
to see that this girl actually did what
I did with this stuff
I can't look in the mirror and be proud
of myself right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
