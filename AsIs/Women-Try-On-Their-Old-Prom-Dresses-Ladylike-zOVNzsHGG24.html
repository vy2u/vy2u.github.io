how out of touch we really are it's been
five plus years since our big night that
our prom dresses suck
it's ladylike and we're trying on our
old prom dresses yeah we're all this
behind prom is a night for everyone to
get all dressed up in fancy the height
of heterosexual high school it's like
the last time you can have a really good
time with all your friends without
drinking a whole lot afterwards is when
the fun happens it's a really exciting
time it's like it's the end of an era
and there's all this pressure that like
everyone's gonna like lose their
virginity on this night you know but
that never happens
I remember the food the most I remember
that I was wearing matching eyeshadow to
my dress which I now regret my mom
doesn't think my dress will fit still I
think it'll fit
I really hope it'll fit I get this dress
on me here's my dress just like I
remember it
oh my nipple what the no it's fine
this over him whoa Wow
nope I cannot zip this up I literally
have no idea how to get this dress on
feeling short of breath yes here yeah I
feel like one bad movement away from
just boob exposure I feel good I feel
like nothing's changed except for my
boyfriend I do like this dress actually
it's very of its own time oh my god I
forgot about this brooch as long as no
one looks at me from the side of the
back I feel pretty good I feel mobile I
feel like I can dance to Lil Wayne's
lollipop this dress makes me feel old
and young at the same time last time I
wore this I was straight I'm a little
surprised that my mom let me show this
much cleave for like a 17 year old okay
I think I ground like who let the dogs
out was like everyone was like this is
our jail
so my prom and like the height of Jersey
Shore's popularity was like at the exact
same time and so we did a lot of the
thing where you would like fist pumping
you're like I love it
do you know I'm talking about then you'd
be like uh yes I'm ready to see myself
okay oh yes Oh Oh God
half of my boob was almost falling out
the bottom of this dress so I'm hoping
that my boobs have just grown since then
and I wasn't being grown at 17 this
dress was like a little bit low-cut and
so my mom lovingly sewed in this little
piece of lace so that I wouldn't be
showing my cleavage to the world I still
love this dress it's still so unique and
different you could put like a moto
jacket over it and it would be very a
Perl you know what I'm saying it's I
mean it's a cute dress look you know
it's cute in my size right now I would
wear this dress like right now I think
everybody gets super nervous about prom
like there's specific things you have to
do and there are these huge expectations
and it's really just kind of another
night you might as well go to prom
because then you went and then you know
what it's like and you had an experience
yeah yeah I feel like everyone would
want their kid to go to prom if they do
decide to go to prom I'm gonna be that
prom mom who will probably hold the
pregame at my house have all the cheese
all the crackers I'd be fine if my kids
wanted to go to prom it's like yeah
because it's a thing that a lot of
people do and if they don't want to go
I'd be like that's cool too because like
I barely remember my prom I barely
remember what I was wearing but I
definitely remember the steak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
