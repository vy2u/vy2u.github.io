the size of this swimsuit we're trying
one size fits all swimsuits apparently
those exist each designer will do like
small medium large extra-large others
will use numbers I don't believe it
I think it's a height I think if it's
like a dress like a loose dress that
would work what for a swimsuit I think
that's kind of hard
people have different boot sizes but
sizes like even if you're tall or
shorter or whatever your size everywhere
it can be different I don't know if I
really believe that it's going to fit
everybody all right let's see what these
swimsuits look like
oh well no I have used tampons larger
than this I mean I get it so suits are
supposed to couple the nipple but I mean
I think it should cover a little bit
more than the nipple yeah this is one
size fits all for like a toddler so I'm
gonna go try this on thank you very much
hmm we'll see how this goes
I'm like almost a hundred percent sure
that this is like not YouTube look come
look okay it is not that bad
I like how there's both over and under
and side boobs like you can't choose
mine let's do em all tada
look oh my god the bottom is so small I
feel like the wind could blow and my
cheese would be out okay guys so this is
just not happening it's not happening
okay I'll try it on because like I lost
my shame is like 1996 so I will go for
this supermodels aren't made they're
born that is what this is I don't oh
yeah that's that's terrible
like one this kids like going up and
like I don't even have big boobs but I
feel uncomfortable this is a tragedy
there's there's nothing you can do you
can't you can't like pull it up a little
bit yeah okay let's see what the other
one looks like let's see if there's any
dignity I can get that yeah
ah okay and now we're trying I like
don't even want to fill the material it
feels like a sweater they have a lot of
stuff in here so that it stretches yeah
but it looks really cute actually it's
got a design I'm coming to this what am
I getting myself into this is just not
in my job description some suit oh it's
cute
yo that's cute if it's really well Adana
it's kind of cute it's really cute feels
like you're just like crypts on under
your body but not like a constraining
way oh my god it looks so good
and then it's like it's this like
perfectly where it's like snug but also
tight they're not terrible no I mean my
boobs are strong other than that
everything else is covered I like it I'm
down I think the bikini we both needed
wasn't gonna work just by looking at it
we were like yeah we were like there is
no way this is gonna fit every size I've
just noticed with like you know a lot of
campaigns or you know even just in the
stores when they show that it's one size
fits all all the women wearing the thing
are the same size they are very small
size so I think it's totally okay to
have one size fits all but like you need
to show that different bodies can wear
it this one like had like the material
and like you can kind of see how it fits
on every type of woman instead besides
this bathing suit a lot of
one-size-fits-all stuff is ugly in my
opinion baggy t-shirt yeah it's just
like disrespectful I would rather just
have to do the extra work of shopping
for something that's gonna fit me in my
body everyone's different all that time
we spent trying to look like everyone
else if you just spend your time living
your life and being happy and like
accepting who you are you're gonna have
a lot of extra time to do other fun
stuff like binge watching TV eating
pizza like my schedule just opened up
after I got rid of the self-loathing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
