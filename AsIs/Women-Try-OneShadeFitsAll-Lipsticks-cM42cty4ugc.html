slow-mo they'd be like I am so excited
today we are trying one shade fits all
this gets so tricky to find that one
tree that looks good on everyone to
trend no the one size fits all when she
saw everything sets everything as much
as I love the whole trope of one shade
fits all I need to find something that
fits me and then I'll worry about all
y'all
I'm skeptical I can't really picture
what that shade would be I don't think
such a lipstick exists we're gonna find
out today yeah I love glossier holy crap
shall we it kind of harsh yo it's not
going in what the it's like a lip
balm and it's buildable so you can do
like four layers if you really want a
color not a super high pigment it's kind
of sheer super hard to put on I
guess I'm just like looking for more
color so I'm just like if it's my skin
color I don't know Purple's my jam
Purple's a little bolder than I'm used
to I opened I was like holy crap that is
crazy dark and then you put it on and
it's like where did the color go I don't
really like you doing I like a blueberry
maybe a rotten blueberry purple is
surprisingly good locum both of us it's
just something I'm not into us gets a
triple thumbs up if I had a third farm
this was yet it feels like so
much of a moisturizer I would forget
that I'm wearing it and I would just be
like
I can get cheeky with this one it looks
really cute here I won there how look
like on my skin because these colors
always tricky okay this is really good
it is super new I like that it's more
brownish I mean I'm not mad at this one
looks good on you
I love the color it might say like a 90s
grunge II lipstick now this looks good
on you
it seems Camus tea and dark on me hers
looks brownish mine looks more pinkish
I've never found a nude before that
actually fit my skin color so this would
be a first
yeah I wear this to work and wear it out
I hate nude lipstick mainly because it
makes your lips look ashy half the time
with you know women of color if their
lips look dry and sometimes really tasty
I'm not getting that you you got me
Smashbox you got it's brighter than I
thought it would be I fake blond hair so
any like super bright lipstick it's into
Barbie territory are you ready cheers
Cheers
it's very creamy and soft it is red it's
not that red it gives you like hot pink
vibes I'm like confused it's a little
too pink for me like I've kind of rot on
the bone it's like a paint it's like a
hot pink with fire nice I don't think I
would go out and buy this for me but
somebody gave it to me I might use it I
feel like I look like snow white with
the like super red lips I think it looks
cute though it makes your lips look
super full I would wear this in June
occasionally but it wouldn't be an
everyday go-to thing we're looking for
something glamorous maybe like a one
night out when you're feeling snazzy
it's a little groan for me yes we're
talking about sure oh it all too pinky
and a little too bright it's just not
vibrant red enough it's just not my
color this says I own a penthouse like
the Upper East of Manhattan we're
talking cachinga Ching
so we moving right on to the city it
seems it's on Instagram and it literally
looks amazing on everyone
I don't think we Anna can do any wrong
her face is beat for the gods
is this a trophy or is it lipstick who
knows the bottle looks a little bit like
nail polish it's never gonna come off
the bar lips ever again
I mean I hope it doesn't who it's very
pigmented there's so much a liquid on
the applicator she wanted color this is
color ever like a drop and I was like oh
my god I put too much on that one
it feels amazing it looks amazing
it looks good with fair skin it looks
really good with your color skin and my
color scent I like the shape of your
lips yeah I would like this and like all
the other shades
it's got this toasted at Red's look on
me it makes me feel like I'm a part of
me on his life for me the real test is
if it looks good on a alien or
something because this looks
amazing on everybody we came in here
thinking what is this one shade fits all
sort of men what makes it work is
because the same color can look like two
different shades on two different skin
tones but they still look good overall
the sheers
it could be hit or miss but the highly
pigmented ones we both like I thought I
would love the colossi a really liked it
but it was just like right revlon it's a
little bit too advanced for me how can
you up my most amazing i would be
if i as the nude just looks like
something I would be comfortable wearing
but Betsy it's magical
I thought I'd be more into the neutrals
but then this one
surprise me this is like lipstick on
another level I think it's really cool
she's creating a line that's inclusive
and makes everybody look beautiful and
not just like a certain kind of person
you look now go with it
turn a couple of heads it's like glam
break a couple of necks around that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
