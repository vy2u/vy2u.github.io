know that they just had this pretty Jews
I was scrolling through the internet and
I found something that I've never seen
before one size fits all jeans I don't
know I'm skeptical too how does this
work I don't think it does thought the
many ways because I want to see if a
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was
real so I'm gonna lurk in the bathroom
today and I'm gonna see how many people
in bathroom I could get to try on these
pants to see if it magically fits them
yeah sure will you try on these jeans
they're apparently one size fits all and
I'm trying to see if they work or not
there's no way these are one size fits
all they might be but everyone Wow okay
so actually these do fit me pretty well
they're like super stretchy which I love
I don't even really feel like I'm
wearing jeans but don't think they'll
fit everybody do you think you can try
on some one-size-fits-all jeans for me
I'm doing a video and I get as many
people as I can
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom I'll
go to my co-workers desks and ask them
to try them on for me cuz this is creepy
don't do this hey you found these ones
sighs no I don't know if you know but my
Buddhists might be too strong for these
bands that is one of my thighs actually
haven't worn jeans
for years here I've never held a pair of
Jews as small as anyone interested in
trying them I tried now I mean this is
some ya-ya sisterhood seriousness but
there's no way to test this is crazy
oh my god
we don't have any i'm smash hey they
don't look bad it's not giving me like
belly rolls you know like sometimes like
your pants are too tight all of a sudden
stuff source I have this ones don't do
that ok you can expect it to be like
looser and adjust to the body pretty
well yeah I think you have to try them
oh my god there's no way that I could I
don't know I mean you do you think I
could if they wasn't pretty imagery I
would try those right there just like
wait hold up this is insane they're
zipped on the ramps and their button do
the bit that has to be witchcraft I
don't understand but they're wrong
I got a lot
now that I'm a believer and this is
reddit of the Traveling Pants I'm gonna
give it to someone else to wear and see
if they fit her - oh oh
this ship this
oh my god I actually know nothing top at
all oh my god all these just like a
unifier
I feel like I'm sort of like your sister
I am The Sisterhood I really can do
anything these days I feel really badly
and up in in like a very long time my
butt looks good actually I have this a
little bit
