hard wax beans the hard wax beans is a
waxing method that's supposed to be
painless but I doubt that very much
they are little beans beads that you
melt and wax your body hair with it
looks like something that you would find
like maybe in the bottom of a fish tank
I have never gotten to wax in my entire
life I have dealt with waxing pretty
much my whole life because I am a very
hairy person you cannot convince me that
putting hot liquid plastic on your skin
and ripping it off doesn't hurt I'm
sorry I'm just not buying it I think
anytime you're ripping hair out of its
little hole in your leg it's gonna not
feel good
I tried waxing my legs once and it
didn't even work because my hair is so
thick that it just like wouldn't come
out so I'm really curious to see how
this goes I am terrified I am like
let's just do it let's not think about
it I'm so nervous
it smells like chemicals and like if you
accidentally like microwaved your Barbie
or something I'm scared as all get-out
let's just go for it okay that's kind of
nice warm comforting it's happening
there's no turning back so I gotta wait
for this to cool so I'm just chilling so
you're supposed to rip it from the
opposite direction that your hair grows
I don't want to do it anymore
yeah it feels like it's like there
forever but let's try it it hurts
oh my god they lied I'm just getting up
a little corner to see if it's ready
okay I think I got a good little pull
tab here this is some bull No oh my gosh
I'm not nervous but I'm pretty sure it's
gonna hurt all these instagramers out
here talking about it doesn't hurt I'm
scared right now boo boy okay just rip
it off like band-aid one two three oh
that wasn't bad actually whoa it's like
a porcupine
Wow that didn't hurt at all
Wow there's no hair in my leg okay we
made it this is actually amazing there's
like little like you can see the plug of
the hair that's really cool
it looks like it took off might in a
little bit ain't about this
painless that worked better than
anything I've ever tried I'm gonna try a
little strip on my arm to give it a fair
shot and I do my whole body right now I
immediately regret this oh it looks like
a um fruit roll-up I don't know why I'm
so scared it didn't hurt before all
right okay it's just like a little pinch
and then and then it's over
all right don't think about it I need a
shot whoo okay one two three oh it
wasn't that bad maybe I should have just
been ripping it all of them off it
wasn't that bad that actually really did
not hurt at all it was like it felt like
a piece of scotch tape was on my leg and
I ripped it off it worked I have a
little red bump so I wonder what that's
gonna it's all about the rip you gotta
rip guys you gotta rip I could do this
on my whole leg and I probably wouldn't
still be fine afterwards like it doesn't
hurt this seems like this would take an
hour of your life that's like that's
where I'm out I think I just don't have
the time you guys it's not painless but
it's a little bit of pain I get my
eyebrows threaded and that is like I
would say ten times more painful than
this was I've seen it all over Instagram
and Facebook and people sharing it like
look this new thing that's painless and
I'm like yeah right there's no way but
like I'm honestly really surprised this
actually worked and didn't hurt and like
it's like too good to be true
