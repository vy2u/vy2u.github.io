visor visors to protect us from the Sun
and also basics what is a paparazzi
visor well Lindsay it's funny you ask
the paparazzi visor is made 100% with UV
protection and four celebs
we're not celebs extreme fashion chains
I feel like are usually only acceptable
for celebrities to wear them like it's
almost like Rihanna for example can
literally wear anything anything
anything anything anything and so I
really want to try and prove that like
regular people
can be fashionistas and wear extreme
trends and also be dopest ahh
I saw Patrick Starr wearing one of these
on Instagram and we had to try it
hey guys I'm Patrick Starr and I am a
beauty influencer and fashionista today
I'm gonna help the girls out to try the
paparazzi vibe
so what inspired you to wear this
amazing visor I thought it was just
quite a trip on an island and I was like
I want to look cute but not look like
too crazy but also have protections so I
saw these my friend showed once I mean
he was like you have to have one and I
was like these look cute so I got them
in pretty much every single color okay
so how do you style these I just message
of 1/2 and you cannot go wrong with
black or white I feel like I think of
them as a neutral matching it with one
basic piece do you think you could wear
these anywhere just by the pool I wear
these anywhere grocery store you don't
want to be bothered just kiss me like
doll talk to me these are very bold and
very I guess like trendy and kind of out
there you have any tips on how we can
just be confident wearing them just do
it I think it just takes time in finding
friends who love what you do and I feel
like we all look good together you know
it's not just you're wearing it we're
already looking good I think we're
excited to go and conquer the world and
our paparazzi visors so thank you
Patrick
by
I'm wearing them for like five minutes
my head are earrin October
what's up you're like an Asian grandma
oh it feels like you're all astronauts
it's very like ASA staphon she right now
are facing the Sun and seeing if it
works with the UV protection it
definitely does
they will everywhere in sunglass
so it's a lot more attention than
sunglasses I'm kind of thinking that
nobody can see my face it's leave me
alone chic it's creeping me out I can't
see you I don't like it look are you
looking at me and breathing intimidating
let's don't like it's very lady good bad
it's supposed to like whatever hides you
from the paparazzi but it makes you
stand out more but I think that's good
because I if I just like didn't know you
and I saw you on the street I'd be like
that's somebody this is great for
outside a little difficult for inside
but in terms of styling I kind of went
for Sunday Trader Joe's
this is a look that I would go for
just like running errands and running
around on the Sunday you know I have my
athletic
so I can be mobile you know I mean my
just want to be bothered so that's the
vibe that I went for today I mean I
think it looks pretty cool I think most
importantly they photograph
which I guess defeats the paparazzi
aspect of it but you know Instagram
before we describe my look as a scene on
on the beach I would wear exactly what
I'd wear to the beach but
from the future I guess I'm not I don't
like wearing sunglasses that much
because I feel like I'm missing out on
the world and it's beautiful colors
I don't know if it's just me lately bye
this makes me feel a lot more confident
because no one could see my face and I
could just walk around and do whatever
the I want I'm feeling good I'm
feeling like I can't work on anything in
anyone I'm feeling like I can hit on
anyone and no one will know what to say
but they'll see me and they'll love it
[Laughter]
is meant to stop traffic because I look
like a little traffic oh my style in SPO
is Halloween eat stuff up so
feeling like the fall vibes these days
honestly I could do whatever I mean no
one's gonna know you know it's like who
is she literally like who is she
so this is so creepy oh my god you guys
turned at the same time oh my god that
was so creepy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
