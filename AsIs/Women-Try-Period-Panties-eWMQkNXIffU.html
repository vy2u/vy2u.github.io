vagina and you're like I'm not sure what
that was
I am a strict tampon user I'm big tampon
fan tampons
and the day I got my period - today I
like go ham I have like super absorbent
tampons I will rock like pads like I
don't care if it feels like I'm wearing
a diaper I really don't like the way
pads smell so this underwear I'm kind of
really nervous about this Rihanna's
yay
undies sports we see what is this like
that interior of a car uh
this is really soft very thick kind of
feels like the air muffs used to wear as
a kid to keep you warm this is really
hot like vaginas are already kind of
sweaty it also scares me that these are
partly white they put them on any Jing
okay you so like mad comfortable okay
they're nice and silky smooth I mean
it's kind of nice just in the sense of
it feels like a pillow they just they
cuddle up to the vagina they're super
cozy I feel like once like I get actual
blood on this it might be a different
story it might get all like soggy and
what I don't know comfy but frothy mr.
probably described most of my fashion so
far in the Battle of like my period
versus underwear my period is undefeated
maybe there'll be a maybe it'll be a new
champ
alright around these parts so um wearing
the underwear under yoga pants just
lounging around the house and my poor
boyfriend touches my butt and then goes
what's that oh and then just like solo
it removes his hand typically I would
like to be a little bit more discreet
about the fact that I am bleeding out of
my vagina this is the happiest day of my
period so I am about to sleep in nothing
but these of period panties I'm
just hoping I don't wake up tomorrow and
it looked like somebody was murdered in
my bed I usually have to get up in the
middle of the night to change my tampon
and I was able to sleep through the
entire night not get up at all and I
didn't leak there was no like spillage
there's nothing gross happening
incredible
it worked I haven't worn a pad in a
really long time so the act of going to
the bathroom is really bloody and
unpleasant I just woke up and it's kind
of nice to not have to like immediately
jump out of bed to change my tampon and
fear of leaking so I've made it through
both nights without staining my sheets
so yeah that's pretty good
here it is 8:30 and I should be them
work but no I'm washing and bringing out
a period painting
I think the period underwear is
attracting dogs because it's just
outside and I passed the dog walker and
like all the dogs ran towards me and
we're sort of just like scoping out the
area still going great still like it's
still like how easy it is and it's very
comfortable my period is over and my for
a with period underwear is over for at
least 30 days ok I'm not like a totally
changed woman
but I realized that I was a little quick
to judge their pan pasty I didn't have
any leakage holy they are so
comfortable to sleep in exactly like my
impression the first time I put them on
it just felt kind of bulky like wearing
a pad did I think what was like
disconcerting was like when you're
washing them in the sink just like
watching all the blood go down the drain
and I was like oh god it's like I got to
tell you like my period it's like one of
those big like 8 gallon water jugs just
goes and the period panties just took
care of it didn't give a I was
afraid it would actually get really kind
of soggy and it didn't like at all it
for sure was not completely dry which is
not ideal if I had to choose between
knees and a pad I would definitely use
the underwear it's not time for this
 like a tampon it's like poop out
the window like your period is already
an inconvenience I don't need any more
 to add to that these are product
that make it
it's easier to be lazy and I will always
endorse things that make it so that I
can move this body anywhere but on the
other hand I do love dogs so I was sort
of like once I push them away from me I
was like all right this is fun but yeah
I don't know maybe it's attracting dogs
I'm not sure hi oh hey guys dad here we
made a series it's coming on November 18
