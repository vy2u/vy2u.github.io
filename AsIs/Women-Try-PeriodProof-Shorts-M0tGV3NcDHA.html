have cramps like just workout it'll make
it better it's like how are you supposed
to work out if your cramps are so bad
that you can't get out of bed these are
the shorts as you can see they're like a
little bit shorter than your average
you've got a little pocket and some mesh
here for breathability and then inside
is just a pair of underwear so it's like
a thick pair so this baby's like thick
but in a good way so it's gonna absorb
that what I'm gonna try these think
shorts out I'm a little nervous just
because you know I don't have to wear
any pads or anything and I don't think
I've ever had a thing where it's just
like it basically kind of just feels
like you're free bleeding I'm also
nervous just because you know chub-rub
big thigh nation and I'm nervous about
my thighs laughing around together class
we'll see how this goes but I am really
nervous
my period is pretty heavy to where I
don't really feel like wearing a tampon
because it kind of hurts sometimes but
you obviously don't want to wear a pad
when you're working out so usually I'm
just stuck wearing a tampon sometimes
that's weeks through or sometimes it's
painful and I can feel the tampon in my
vagina
so I'm very excited to try these short
this invention feels like it's a long
time coming and if these work like I'll
buy them seven different pairs so we'll
see okay so this is the little label
that comes with it I like the veins
emojis all right you guys the shorts
you're on definitely a little bit
shorter than I would like I love the
feeling of them I wish there were a
little bit more high-waisted because you
know when you're on your period you like
bloated area shorts on and
I'm glad with their black just in case
they're not quote-unquote leak-proof I
think my real fear will be the uber that
I take over and I pray to God
the seats are white all right you guys
come on the mountain wearing the shorts
a little bit shorter than I thought in
real life that's so far so good
I've definitely felt some blood come out
and it's not on my leg and I don't feel
like it's going through my pants so
great news so far honestly it's
definitely a weird sensations to just
bleed brilliance my workout pants but
it's something I could for sure get you
so I just got out the car no stains I
was terrified for a second when I got up
but yeah we're doing good so far it's
definitely really nervous about leaking
it didn't leave it all it honestly I
feel like it didn't even feel like I had
my period hit I'm home from my hike I
was there for about an hour I could feel
blood come out for maybe 30 minutes at
least of that hour I'm home now and it
honestly feels dry to the touch which is
crazy
no leak nothing running down my leg like
in terms of like feeling like I was
gonna spill out on the floor anything
like that I felt completely fine and
safe I actually I'm really excited to
use them for future periods I'm
officially done using the shorts but I
actually really loved them like the fact
that they exist is just amazing like we
just have more stuff like that I will
say I didn't totally feel like they were
period proof when I was doing yoga it
definitely felt like blood was going to
come out on this side but for hiking it
was great like I don't move around that
much when I hike I just kind of walk up
hill and I took care of the blood so
they have some stuff to work out like
they are a little short sizings a little
weird but the fact that I have shorts
that I can bleed freely into I mean sign
me the hell up I'll buy five pairs they
were super comfortable didn't have to
worry about leaks or anything like that
and washing them every day would seem
like it would be a lot so I'd probably
only wear it once during my period when
I was going to go exercise
I was really surprised how just the lack
of leakage that was you get my stamp of
approval I'm all about them I can't wait
to use them again I guess you could say
I'm somewhat excited that if you're good
now let me stop playing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
