Matthews but most people know me as J's
or M I am a model blogger and advocate
for plus-size women as a plus-size
person it's really frustrating to try to
find clothes that are both affordable
high quality and look really really good
so today my friend Jess and I are going
to be going through some of the top
retailing stores that have plus sized
clothes and rating them based on a
number of factors Jessa and I are going
to be rating ASOS ModCloth and forever
21 what their selection is in-store and
online their price point is it cute
which is like basically the most
important they're sizing and then the
return policy hi my name is Megan
O'Connor I'm a fashion stylist who
specializes in plus sizes and I work
with celebrities like Adrienne Seymour
and Tess holiday so can you tell us a
little bit about yourself I've been in
the fashion industry for the last 10 or
so years I specialize in focus in the
plus-size space one because I am a plus
woman and also because the space is
growing I so desperately deeply want
high fashion for plus I like look at the
runways and be like oh my god like why
don't we have that any final tips for us
before we head out I would say be
confident put on your lipstick look good
feel good like get yourself in your zone
we're quick to give each other a
compliment
yeah but we're really slow on
complimenting ourselves if you look good
you feel good head out there and be
confident and patient and that's like
the key
first we're going to take a look at esos
online it's a lot of black it works for
me cuz that's what I like but me I like
color soft tux jumpsuit 12 through 24
now we're gonna go on to my cloth this
black dress is so my alley I can't
stress how much I love this outfit I
felt like I'm gonna be starting the
jeans jumper I've never owned the jeans
jumper and I've always wanted to own a
jumper the quality of the coat was
really nice on the texture and the color
I was really nice I would have wished
that the forever 21 dress the 3x was a
little bigger the midsection was a
little smaller and I was kind of
surprised that it didn't really fit me
well the best selection was definitely a
so yeah ball gown seems to work out in
things to sleep in you even find
anything so what about price on forever
21 really gives you options for a super
affordable price plan if you have a
budget you can definitely work with the
21 who wins her is a cute in reality all
of them was cute we honestly got three
outfits from each that we would wear all
of them win best in sizing definitely a
so I was also surprised by Mon cause
your jumpsuit was really well made easy
to return what do you think a CIL's wins
for easy service earn angry give you a
little bag you just like stick it in
there and drop it off at the post office
it's like so easy winner is definitely a
sews in a tie for a second was forever
21 in ModCloth I hope this helps you
figure out where to spend your money and
what's gonna fit your body best and get
some really cute looks if you want to
see any of these looks and check them

of the outfits thanks so much for
