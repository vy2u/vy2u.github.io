Gabby freshers new line for swimsuits
for all the process of shopping for a
bathing suit when you have hips and
curves and boobs and it's just not
really that fun for some reason it's
been decided that a curvy woman
shouldn't wear a bikini and I'm ready to
knock that Sigma down and show that we
can rock bikinis just as well as other
people can finding swimsuits is pretty
impossible
plus-size women are built a bit
differently and you know I want
something they'll hug my curves and not
hide them I wish I could take like
different swimsuits and then frank and
sign them together into something i can
actually wear my dream swimsuit would
have not only the size for the bottom
but also cup sizes for the top i haven't
had too many positive experiences
finding swimsuits it's just like what i
make of it
hi i'm gaby fresh i'm a blogger and a
swimwear designer for swimsuits for all
and I have a swimwear collection with
sizes 12 to 24 I think my line in
general is a little bit more chic than
what I would I'm used to seeing on the
market the hardest part about buying
swimsuits is finding the right fit
especially when you're plus-size because
we all carry our weight differently
today I'm trying on the red wraparound
bikini and I'm super excited because I
think it's gonna hold things where I
want them to hold them and it's like a
pop of color that I want for summer I'm
excited to finally you know have my body
be recognized as deserving of a cube
bathing suit I'm trying on this like
really sexy awesome olive green bikini
it's also really cool that the cup sizes
are d2h I'm a triple D and it is very
very difficult no matter how large the
sizes might go to find a cup size oh I'm
really excited to see how well it fits
and how will it support
I'm super excited
I like cuz I feel like there's lots of
ways in which the general squishiness
can be distributed and unless like you
have that issue you're not really going
to know how to make swimsuits for
someone's body that's like that
I am trying on the one-piece black
swimsuit I am really nervous because I
put one-piece things in my head like
you're never gonna look sexy in a
one-piece but like this one-piece is
sexy as hell so I'm hoping I can pull
this off I was inspired to design
bathing suits because I knew how much we
knew them as a curvy girl I knew how
hard it was to find anything I like I
feel great in my suit I love it I think
all of these suits really complement
different types of bodies which is
awesome to see and their great color I
think I just appreciate it more because
it's coming from someone that knows like
how we feel in swims like this were
pretty true to size I feel good and I
could appreciate this because she made
it and she has a body similar to mine
swimsuits for okay everyone everyone
just like take a step back
