I won't be mad I'll say that much today
we are trying Korean Powerpuff Girl
makeup who doesn't love the Powerpuff
Girls who doesn't want to be a powerpuff
girl they were super empowering they
were really cute but they also were
really heroic we make up the beauty team
at most feet and we all are obsessed
with trying maker I'm bad at makeup we
love the blush the eyeshadows the
contour I like makeup but I'm not like a
pro I'm just here to have fun you guys
Powerpuff Girls are really colorful as
is so I can only imagine the makeup it's
gonna be lit I think there's going to be
a lot of fun nostalgia factors today I
won't say no to a little chemical X
bring it on
this is not as colorful as I was
expecting I'm loving the peach tones in
the brown this is good for blue eyes I
feel like we did my cool last skateboard
this goes on your eyes though I was
expecting a lot more color I would use
these more often than I would use if it
was colorful wait what do I do with this
there's three different colors yeah
oh girl you only put one color on your
eyes I don't do eyeshadow bro I really
like there's the shimmer for the inner
corner and then the neutral and then
kind of one to put at the end to make
your eyes pop you can do Day tonight
with this really easy what color do I
start with and what part of my eye does
it go on this is just turning into
idiots we're gonna do makeup and then
the pigment on the shimmer is okay are
we looking like the Powerpuff Girls yet
wait why is this not green though that's
my question
Wow go okay wait yeah I'm mad at this
what I like makeup you could carry this
and if you were going out or if you were
going to work you would be fine because
you could like dress it up or play it
casual I think it's frickin precious
what's next Kelsey's gonna do eye makeup
for the next 20 minutes so I want to
move on
black Kara not gonna lie
kind of mad there's no bubbles one you
can have mine when I'm done stop it I
don't want to pair its software we come
to save the day okay this is really cute
it actually looks very inky it's an
angled brush which is bombed because
that means longer lashes I am impressed
what look at the difference before look
at you look at that stuff I'm gonna try
the mascara on my eyebrows there's no
eyebrows stuff right oh you put anybody
my brows yeah why not
the Powerpuff Girls have really big eyes
so it only makes sense that you have
mascara to make your eyes look bigger
Nona Shia yes so weird because the
Powerpuff Girls actually don't have
eyelashes I was just looking no but my
eyelashes look powerful Wow
distinct before and after - my eyebrows
look we're very sorry
Inc cushion whoo that sounds nice I want
a cushion on my face oh this is like a
Barbie a stuffy but better a badass
Barbie called the farmer's girl oh it's
soft it's so creamy I'm only putting on
my arm because already have foundation
on but it's in class it's making my arm
look ball this would be cooler as like
wow BAM mirror BAM watch like Kim
Possible was all like oh you think it's
makeup just kidding it's my secret
communicator that's it that's a nice
poreless arm oh that's really really Wow
yeah it's very white I wish there was
more variety in the skintone colors of
the powerpuff collection anyone should
be able to feel like a powerpuff girl
but as far as the consistency and like
how it goes on hey Plus so here we've
got a Perry sink velvet it's the lip
tint that is bright that's pigmented
choice which should we do you want to
actually so say I want to see for mine
this one we're going with this long
sharing right here yeah I don't know if
I pull off this color guys what do you
think about mine for some reason I think
that works it's like kind of fun with
your blue hair really yeah this really
takes velvety to the next level here
it's creamy uh-huh it smells good I feel
like it should have been green blue and
pink and not normal colors I like the
normal colors because I wouldn't use
like I was really excited for very much
sick what about this color says
Buttercup to you they're just gliding on
yeah I agree this is really great I've
never tried anything like this
overall this was adorable
yeah safe to say that this is maybe some
of the cutest packaging I've seen in
makeup the colors in the eyeshadow we're
a little bit more muted than I was
hoping for but with the bold lip you
kind of need the muted eye shadows I
really enjoyed this this felt like a fun
little trip down memory lane I would
expect blossom to have that color lip
not this muted color tone but I mean you
also have to have a variety of like fun
fun and maybe I'm not the fun one to
that I wish there were more variety in
skin tones
I think the blossom one did the best at
like feeling like it fit her character
I feel like I could take on the world
and defeat Mojo Jojo I'm still upset
that I didn't get green lips okay well
we'll get you green lipstick next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
