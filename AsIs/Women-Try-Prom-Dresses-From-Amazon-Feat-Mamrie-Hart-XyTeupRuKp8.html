we are trying on Amazon Prime from
dresses so if I thought it was over
we also just drank some tequila how was
your box I mean it was fun I danced I
had a date he wanted to use it I think I
got my dress like the day before for
like 50 bucks
why is this pretty in pink normally
everyone wears those long beautiful
gowns once we do belly is saucy bitch I
made a Betsey Johnson sweetheart
neckline long green Sparkle dress I
looked like Tinker Bell prom sucks I
looked back I got I got like the like
twisted notepad and I have these like
rhymes yeah and butterflies and one of
those rhinestone tattoos
you know what did your dress look like
how much worse can it get I'm the
epitome of fashion excuse me you look
like that I've never had someone yelled
back in my face what an experience
well let's see how these Amazon prom
dresses look on our hot a spot
fashion they don't look that bad this
actually looks kind of expensive he
looks very cute - the tip space yeah I
got a lotta extra boob space I really
like this cuz it relies you have like
80s style stuff and I'm super into that
I do like the short style that fabric
feels really cheap you look like you
were on that MTV show my super sweet 16
and then that was like the best day of
your life and so you're refused to stop
wearing it ten years later this feels
very like sweet - this this I love it
this is something I would sit in a
garden with it's really not that bad
it's a great you know who would wear
this who would wear this to the prom
look we're all who's planning on losing
her virginity that fight oh you know the
girl who's like still has it it's like I
just really want it but I like to be
like really nice and when we started
together and get along really well
I love me I think we're gonna go tell
you I think we're gonna do it I honestly
feel like yours of my favorite you're
really I just really like it I feel like
I would wear a jean jacket to prove this
is my favorite I think you look like you
bought it from y'all remember cash
stores I mean I wouldn't grab the boobs
as much to keep the class boys high but
I think that's a straight-up $300 dress
from cash ray I lose my virginity
tonight you get pregnant tonight you run
for Student Council
I got a campaign did it just implants I
feel like these were in style when we
did high school I feel that we're about
to try on aren't gonna be like a step up
look how tasteful we are so this one has
a lot of thigh you are Angela
I would definitely get a spray tan look
how a she is the material is like
something you would find out like a
Nordstrom I like it yeah you like like
Healing it that's a dress you get
engaged in if I got some Spanx on yeah
which I can high so I don't think I even
knew it's things were but this are you
choking have fun I feel like dancing
emoji you that would be stepping on this
all night it's definitely not good oh
it's dirty but as a 27 year old woman
going to offend this is good for me yeah
red carpet it and then just do the pin
it up or put a little loop and hold it
on your finger that's like a cute ass
dress not for prom I would I need
something to hold the boobs up you can
rock it to prom if you did like garishly
large jewelry you know if you have like
a cool necklace fun with my hair burn in
there cornrows yeah I'm sorry but no
like a hot yeah I do like a like an
old-school kind of like fun your way
this anchor when you want to go 20 I
feel like this is just one size too
small it's cutting into all my bad part
so I guess if you're going for
form-fitting or something like that
maybe ghost as a it's a two-day delivery
so if you're one of those people that
don't want to fuss with go to the mall
make it a big production of it I'm gonna
be a big deal you can order from the
comfort of your home you can always
return it or give the other one away to
like Jenny wow you've never looked more
like a real housewife this dress has
changed me I still suggest a Macy's sale
rack that was always good to me I like
trying them on do you know what you
should do go by memories book get prom
nothing matter it's a great about the
money you're gonna go to so many more
events in your life let's go have fun
and by me hurries book with the money
you saved by borrowing your dress
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
