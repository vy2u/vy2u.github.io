naked why am I putting this on hi my
name is Jasmine my name is Ali hi my
name is YB my name is destiny I'm Nina
hi my name is Salam
today we're trying Rihanna's size
inclusive lingerie line I hope that this
experience gives me more confidence and
I can see for myself that I can be more
positive about my body I want to feel as
close to her even as possible I want to
feel empowered like bitch better have my
money
des naeun this lingerie is fierce she is
unafraid she's confident in exactly what
she looks like and it's proud of the way
she's built do I feel sexy I guess it
depends on like when you're asking me
like sometimes at different points of
the day I do feel sexy like a lot of
times when I'm getting ready and I just
have like my broad underwear on I look
at myself in the mirror and I'm like I'm
pretty hot
one thing that was like hard to grapple
with was that like I have like a pretty
large chest but I don't have really like
perky boobs it's like a hard thing to
come to terms with your like recognize
your own body is sexy and just like
valid as a thing when that's not what
you see presented to you it's normal to
have boobs that like sag and it's normal
to have like wider hips or love handles
or whatever I want to feel like I just
don't give a fuck about what people
think and be instilled with a certain
confidence and a certain don't give a
shit attitude I'm here for lingerie I
stand for it it makes me feel sexy it
makes men feel sexy it just makes people
feel good I like to put it on my body no
I'm a pretty shy person and so to be in
lingerie is something that's putting you
out there and it's supposed to make you
be sexy and I just don't see me as sexy
because I never look like the girls who
are modeling it so when I wear it I'm
like I don't look like this I don't look
sexy I was skinny until I hit puberty
and then I just kind of thinking about
everywhere I'm a solid girl and that was
never marketed as beautiful growing up I
don't really see it as something for
women who are a little more curvy
and to be quite honest it's also not
really marketed towards women of color
like Serena to me was the first woman
that was like she is beautiful and she
is in my size seeing women that are not
considered the stereotypically beautiful
owning the way they look and still being
like forget what you say I am beautiful
that has helped me realize that that
gives me and that I just have to get in
that mindset of destiny you're banging
when I started like looking on social
media all the influencers and models
like everyone has perfect bodies with
like big boobs and I was like oh my god
I don't have boobs and I used to never
care about it until recently when I
started like seeing those pictures
everywhere I think because of that I
always found it to be able to be hot to
be sexy you have to have boobs and I
know that's wrong but like because of
all those pictures I always saw on the
internet I was like well I guess I'm not
in the category cuz I don't have big
boobs I never really felt comfortable
just watching myself like trying to be
sexy in a lingerie if it was for someone
else like my boyfriend maybe I can try
it but it was never kind of like for
myself I think it's great that like any
kind of company is trying to do
everything inclusive whether it be like
skin color size and especially things
that's intimate as lingerie you should
be able to wear them if you want to
every woman and every size should be
able to feel comfortable and feel sexy
in lingerie I feel like when I try
lingerie I'm supposed to have this
elongated body I think that comes from a
lot of years of growing up and being
told what a beauty standard is in this
country or in anyone's eyes and just
looking at myself in the mirror and
saying well I'm not it but I think that
like as I've grown I've seen more and
more women just wear it with their
normal clothes or just like where it's
an empower themselves and I've always
wanted to be able to wear lingerie in a
way that doesn't really feel like it's
for anyone else but me the word sexy has
always been something that's so foreign
to me and if I can feel confident and
comfortable in lingerie then I can
achieve that I envision someone who is
self-assured someone who's confident
someone who lacks insecurities and can
just move through the world and not
really care about what other people's
judgement
and what other beauty standards are
around her my relationship to lingerie
right now is pretty much non-existent I
have a one-year-old baby at home
I sleep pretty much in my husband's
t-shirt and sweatpants if it's cold and
no sweatpants if it's not cold when in
the past I've worn lingerie I was a lot
younger and a lot you know more
confident with my body it was sort of
like a fun thing to do I have to sort of
remind myself that I'm still sort of
like a person and a woman not just my
son's mother I lived for 38 years before
he was born and I had a life and I have
a body that's mine I very rarely sit and
think about Who I am to myself and it's
been a long time since I've hoo-boy
since I really thought about the person
that I was you know sometimes I have to
remember also who Allie the individual
is regardless of the changes I can still
feel proud of my body my body has
brought a human into this world and
that's something that I want to
celebrate I come from a sports
background so it was always spandex and
sports bras for me so I never really
bought lingerie too much I never saw
myself as sexy just because my curbs
weren't as important I have a big ass I
have big legs I have big boobs you know
I'm just like a big person and I never
really saw that many people show that
that was sexy when I came to BuzzFeed I
was on a shoe where I had to be in a bra
and underwear and model with Tess
Holliday and I think that was the first
time where I looked and I was like oh I
can be that like I can do that too you
can pose certain ways and you can wear
certain things that complement your body
and that that's sexy in the past few
years I've been really pushing myself to
wear just a bra or take a picture in my
underwear and that's what I define is
sexy like me just being my most like
vulnerable sell lingerie should make me
feel safe lingerie should make me feel
comfortable
lingerie should make me feel empowered
lingerie should make me feel bold
lingerie should make me feel like me
lingerie should make
me feel unlimited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
