their life
today we are trying sailor moon makeup I
love makeup I live for makeup so this is
like a mash-up made in heaven
she's just such a cute female but she
can kick ass the transformation sequence
when they like race up into the air hold
up their pens and wish for us I expect
to transform after this
makeup eyeshadow flat style the
packaging is adorable
Oh broach right I just want to take a
moment and got like pinks and browns
these are kind of like natural tones but
any you know Sailor Scout could rock it
definitely feels like you segi colors
look at the shimmer it's going on pretty
smoothly I feel like I can successfully
say only two out of the four would be
flattering it is so freakin creamy the
pigment already is pretty bomb oh the
pink does look good on you hopin I
blended the golden shimmer with like the
darker Brown it's kind of making a nice
little smokey eye I think it lives up to
its selling point which is representing
sailor yeah
now we have two different types of
eyeliner - liquid and a non liquid are
you team liquid or you teen team Ben
phone yeah I'm Team Liquid we can play
each other I feel like this could be
total trash and I wouldn't care because
the design is epic the pencil like it's
kind of going on a little bit weird but
I feel like if I keep working at it
the point kind of softens down and then
it becomes kind of a nice little smoky
block it's not going as smooth as
regular eyeliner I'm gonna try this
liquid eyeliner I feel like it's got all
of the makings of a good eyeliner the
tip is real pointy it's actually really
good for the cat eye look at the itty
bitty line understand it's so precise I
just wish it were a real transformation
pen and it would do all the work for me
shining moon powder oh man oh really
have goose bumps liquor packaging right
now I think this is just kind of a light
setting powder I don't know what's gonna
happen when I put this on my skin okay
no whoa what does it look like it is
real pale it's really smooth it's a
little chalky but maybe with a brush
blended in yeah I don't think it matches
our skin tone I'm pretty pale if it
doesn't match my skin tone I don't know
whose skin tone you're gonna get any
beats for Artemis
Nicator lip gloss I think it was gonna
be like the watch okay she's good in
contain her excitement I love that how's
it for all of the classic Scouts oh my
gosh I opened it and it is the brightest
spread ever Jenny Lamar's no smell which
I really love I would say yeah mix my
lips feel good and feels play creamy
there's a little bit of pigment but it
doesn't give you much after living a
matte lipstick life for so long but once
you put something like nourishing glossy
on my list they're like
we have the makeup moisture Rouge
Stephan pigments was classy yeah I love
ours gold likes nice rosy pink oh gosh
let's be right Hank ha
it goes on smooth I feel like Sailor
Moon would wear this color lipstick I
like it this one definitely feels
moisturizing this is great makeup for
like play or if you're looking for
something that's really subtle I'm
excited that I got to feel like Sailor
Moon for the day I loved it yeah we
minute it was quite a trip down memory
lane the packaging is a lot of fun and
if that's the payoff you're looking for
then it definitely delivers in this look
I could fight evil by moonlight and win
some love by daylight you're my Mars
you're my you sucky friendship is so
beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
