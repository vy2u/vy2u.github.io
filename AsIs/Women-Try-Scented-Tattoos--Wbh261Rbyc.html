tattoo which is just with someone like
painting on you I think tattoos are a
great way to express yourself and might
even be a little bit addicted to them I
have four and I want to get more it
looks cool I want one but also I don't
know what to get I honestly think people
overthink them it's no big deal I do
probably want one but I really don't
like unnecessary pain so I was always
that kid that would buy the gum with the
stick on or wipe on tattoos and throw
the gum away don't mess with some
temporary tattoos less commitment and it
doesn't hurt scented temporary tattoos I
don't know I think that reminds me of
like the 90s something that I've never
heard of I'm kind of nervous I you know
whatever floats your boat I'm excited
and hopefully they don't smell bad I'll
be surprised if they were if a tattoo
can look it and smell that that's like
doubling both good fun oh these are
pretty I even like the colors they're
not bad for temporary ones these are
pretty you're really nice drawing oh
these are actually really neat I'm gonna
go for candy tattoos because it's the
opposite of everything I have these are
like cartoons
holy these really smell like
flowers one kind of smells like really
really good for breathe it smells like a
luxurious anthropology candle oh my god
that's so cool
it smells gonna like mint but like a
flowery mint smells like really cheap
perfume you wear as a 13 year old that
you think super cool I thought I would
be reminded of like chicken in the pan
cooking with like winter potatoes
actually just smells like very natural
and really nice it's not something now
would one on my buddy smells like the
garden section of a hardware store once
it's on me is it going to smell too
maybe it's gonna be like when you put on
a perfume and at first it smells really
good but after like a few hours it goes
away I really want to get this right so
I'm gonna ask my best friend MacRay from
Australia put it on for me look this
works oh good it's hard to smooth it
down oh it came out pretty good oh I
love it
I kind of wish it wrapped a little bit
more around but you know it literally
smells like you just walked past like a
huge like wall of flowers it's not still
smells like Febreze it doesn't smell as
strong as it did on the paper it smells
a lot less fragrant as it dries more the
smell intensifies I'm a candy-themed so
if I'm gonna smell like muted candy all
day it's really not the worst experience
of my life
so I smell any different it smells like
markers that little kids have you know
that are like fruity I don't know what
the point of a scratch-and-sniff tattoo
is I said oh good I mean you have to get
your nose in there oh my god this would
be such a good replacement for you it's
lavender right yeah what yeah okay it's
a very generic flower smelling your arm
yeah that's what I said they're just
shoving your army I don't know what they
like smell exactly like the herb or
whatever it is but if they smell good
don't smell anything
not really it was originally a scented I
think it's maybe more huh
smell skin towards the end of the day it
seemed like you can't doesn't smell like
anything anymore
BL the tattoo itself is really neat it's
held up pretty well
before I was kind of like I don't know
about temporary tattoos but these smell
and they look beautiful I would wear
these again firstly care more about the
design than the fact that it's scented I
love these it doesn't reminded me how
much I like doing beats just cuz it's
like so pretty
and I feel like I have a tattoo but it's
not permanent what's one because it
smells good even in particular a very
playful and childish so it's kind of
making me feel like a bit of a kid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
