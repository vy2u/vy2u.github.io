years ago what are you sweating up I
can't talk about that on camera what and
we're going to a sweat lodge this week
I'm gonna get sweaty shape house in Los
Angeles it is renowned for being a place
where people lose weight you sweat out
all your toxins and we're going to
debunk whether or not this is actually a
thing that works welcome I'm Sophie I'm
the founder of shape house or the
technology we use is this infrared heat
which kind of provokes your body to
think that you're in a bit of a fever
and it fights it by cooling down why is
this better or different than like an
hour of Bikram yoga when you're doing
yoga your muscles are engaged when you
hear the cosmic muscles is so relaxed
the water is able to go through better
so when you're sweating that sweat has a
lot more toxins in it not sure what
sweating without working out will do for
me I don't think this should or will be
able to replace a fitness routine and
then we actually did it for the first
time and it was really friggin hard we
are fashionable suit song you know they
tuck you in and they ask you if you need
anything then you sit in this bed and
it's more of an cozy and they put the TV
on for you and you're watching your
shows and you're like oh man ready for a
little me time and now we just sit here
for 55 minutes when you first get in the
burrito it's actually really comfortable
if my feet are getting really warm and
then 20 minutes later you're like what
we should get me out of this fire bed
the most comfortable part of my body is
this hand that's out of this out of I'm
getting super super slimy and I was like
I think I'm suffocating I'm gonna pass
out this is the worst thing I've ever
felt in my life a cool towel oh man
that's wonderful for about 12 seconds
and then it doesn't feel cool anymore
earlier this summer my a/c at my house
broke during the heat wave this is
pretty similar it's like the longest 10
minutes of your life those last 10
minutes
are your hands tingly no oh my god are
yours yes probably the sound stuff then
it finally beeps and they come in that
was all I survived and I'm super dizzy
as real hot real uncomfortable I feel
pretty relaxed now I'm interested to see
if by the end of the week we have more
resistance to he day to kind of sucked
for me I have the worst headache ever I
definitely didn't drink it up today
after I got a headache on day two I
actively prepared and hydrated a lot for
day 3 I'm not really looking forward to
today but I'm trying to like embrace the
experience and what would they say on
the wall surrender surrender and believe
it that's important to be proactive
drinking water even before the session
not to guaran and after like constantly
just drinking so much water it's making
me like appreciate and like really
consider how I hydrated my body the
learning process yes I kind of went into
this challenge thinking that just
sitting in this sweat thing for five
days would be pretty easy but I think
this is very difficult in a very
different way every day things kept
getting a little bit better do you think
this is what caterpillars feel like when
they're in their cocoons and like the
second it's over and they get to spread
their wings except I'm not as beautiful
as a butterfly
oh no especially not by the end of this
I've been drinking a lot of water so I'm
feeling pretty good and my sleep is
basically unaffected don't kind of
restless yeah every time I get really
hungry here that's am
magic feet we're well done getting out
of this bed after sitting in it for an
hour is the best feeling how you feeling
ready to go cannot say that there's any
definitive change in my body after a
week of shape house I could maybe see
myself going back like once a week maybe
to help kind of like keep my muscles
warm and loosen stuff I really enjoy
taking hour out of my day to just be
with myself not doing anything with my
body and relaxed even though it was a
little uncomfortable and I really
appreciated that humbling experience
