gum I have never ever ever had hair
shorter than my shoulders I just like
one short hair that's super easy
something that if I cut my hair like
this I can just like this and this and
then like that manly done I've always
been slightly self-conscious that I have
like a round face so I've been afraid
that like short hair will make me look
really young if I could pull it off
I would love it
oh wow oh wow oh my god this is amazing
hahahaha oh my god
I feel like I kind of look like my mom I
don't look like my mom I thought I would
feel a little bit more boyish but I feel
more womanly
I'm cute this looks great I'm very ready
for this week we're gonna see how my
co-workers react for the first time to
this it looks so I've never getting a
bit of a non-viable yeah it is this
people have made over the Kardashians
are you thinking about having kids now
should I cut my hair this shirt no hey
guys hey I knew that you notice I want
to say like a grand mom I haven't a lot
of people tell me I look like I'm wrong
now I can see my bed head and it's way
chiller I felt this is weird you need to
wear more makeup to like maintain my
humidity nobody like seems to think that
this might be out of character for me
apparently it's like like oh yeah sure
totally do something like that
no it's prepare keep it such a life do
you like it hey I like the long better
there is a certain element of
get-up-and-go but I also had to like
play with my bangs for a while not on
here took my wig out okay I'm about to
take hip-hop class
so sweaty or no miss maggot yeah I don't
know how I feed on why is the being a
mom a bad thing and why do people freak
out about this so much I better back on
I look like a beetle I'm getting a
little tired of it you want what you
can't have and then you're like kind of
miss what you did have red hair but I
got the stomach virus last night I left
my wake at the office I can't do it it's
not for me my little girl back there
turn are you bullying hair girl I know I
said this morning that I missed my long
hair but I do think part of me would
miss this short hair to be honest people
were either like you look like my mom or
they said that I looked very
authoritative I've always been kind of
an old soul so the fact that people were
telling me that this made me look a
little bit older I was just kind of like
yeah I was expecting to feel this
masculinity but I also could feel really
feminine a second they found out it was
a wig suddenly they would like express
how much they really didn't like it
my boyfriend hated it I could totally
see cutting it all off at some point I
don't think I'm going to cut my hair
because I also think it's really fun to
do stuff with long hair I don't think I
could do it at least I know now when I
get older I could kind of pull off short
here I feel like I'm a more confident
person and just that I can rock whatever
I want to rock and it doesn't really
matter and it doesn't really affect who
I am
I just woke up and one of the night and
saw my wig and that was a perfect way
