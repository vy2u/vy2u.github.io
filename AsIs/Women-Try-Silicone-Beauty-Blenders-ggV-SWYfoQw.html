we're comparing silicon Beauty blenders
I literally cannot live without my
Beauty Blender it's what I use to put on
foundation every single day it makes a
makeup look so flawless even though I'm
like feeding my face for like ten
minutes I was about six months into my
relationship with my Beauty Blender when
I realized I had to wet it I've seen
this all over the internet and people
keep raving about these silicone sponges
I want to meet the girl who brought up a
silicone and her bra and was like yes
yes I think she's a STONER definitely
more firm than my Beauty Blender for me
like I can tell that like what I'm using
it like my skin like looks kind of
patchy I feel like it's not applying my
makeup as evenly as a Beauty Blender
would it just seems to be like wiping it
uh-huh it's kind of therapeutic feels
like I'm applying my makeup with a
ziploc bag jell-o jell-o on my face
click a tooth one you stuff it in your
bra need more foundation this apply it
in the bath the designs wid but it felt
nice
so plus about the silicone sponge is
that you don't have to dip it in water
between a yay or nay I would give this a
yes yes but also like
it's purple it is purple we're super
purple right now the original and this
guy had a baby and that was this this
takes the product and really smears it
throughout the face definitely agree I
do feel like the silicone puts on a
thicker covered it feels a little harder
than a typical beauty blender and it
feels harder than this guy but I kind of
like it I feel like this side of my face
is sandpaper I decided my face is like
satin makes me feel like I'm putting
down my foundation with like purpose
purpose yeah purposeful foundation one
of my main things that I would complain
about what the buting's blender is it
soaks up like so much makeup I feel like
the texture of this wouldn't soak up as
much the application was better the
overall like finish of the product was
great look how fun it is we've already
decided it's a unicorn's you know when
you're alone or with friends you could
just pretend you're a little bit Horne
majestic is there even a competition my
skin looks all velvety and soft I would
actually go ahead and buy this one shut
up and take my money I think this one
deserves viral fame yeah this is this is
a star yes start my book waiting to rise
slick hey this is what the new feminism
looks like taking it out from your bra
and using it for something useful
repurpose bad recycle mm-hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
