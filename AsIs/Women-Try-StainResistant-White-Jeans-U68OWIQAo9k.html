hate him but old Davey came out with a
new pair of stain resistant white jeans
and I'm going around the office to see
if this is actually a thing or like a
thing so let's go tie them up what are
your opinions on white jeans I will
almost always spill something if I wear
them I like them I don't really wear
them because I'm clumsy I can't really
wear them because I get the messy what
if I told you that there are some new
stain resistant white jeans
so try them on sure so let's test out
these white jeans with a three liquid
test we are starting with coffee going
to apple juice and then we're going to
Cola are you ready I guess
let's do this wait a minute II I feel
like it didn't like go through my pants
as quickly as I thought it would it's
weird cuz it rolls right off but I still
feel wet let's see what apple juice does
to the white jeans there was some
ricochet effect on that one I felt a
lawsuit this apple juice is like nowhere
to be found now we're gonna move on
piccola oh so there's a little bit of a
brown tint I feel like the more I wipe
it the less you can see it these jeans
fit pretty well I I like them but I feel
like we need to raise the stakes to
these you know like what do you have in
mind
we couldn't find a tub of like wine or
something and just dumped the pants in
them let's find a tub of wine what I
wasn't completely seeing let's go look
out oh my god we're doing this I really
want to see if this is gonna work with
these pants so I guess I'll give it a
try this is nice I haven't taken a bath
in quite a while
feel like I'm a toddler again only with
wine okay let's see how this does
it doesn't look too good I think any
other pair of jeans would be red and
these are pink you know there's still
some white in them so they held up
pretty well this would be really useful
for someone who's kind of messy like me
that's pretty crazy you know what that
means right no it means that you could
probably period it is just saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
