confident in my styling ability because
as someone who wears a good job i always
have to be a little more creative and
the things that i put together pretty
confident my styling ability i used to
work as a stylist at express once upon a
time okay okay what is this oh this is a
lovely dad shirt oh my god i love this
this is actually great okay this is cute
love the color and the pattern i can
definitely do something like this
if i really like the color some beige
leaves i would try to sex this up i
don't really do a lot of legs all the
way up to the neck in high school i
would wear a lot of short sleeve stuff
and to do the long sleeve underneath i'm
already leading towards that situation I
love that the under the color underneath
is black because I wear black every day
could do like the gold necklace and go
for like Miami mob dude I thought it was
gonna be something like like a tube top
and I have to just like figure it out
dad should be wearing this let's
see how we're gonna style this shirt I
don't have to check the weather and so
it's gonna be like okay I'm back home
now I have the shirt I'm gonna look
through my closet and see if I have
anything that I can wear with it my goal
is for simplicity so I'm thinking about
wearing this white long-sleeve shirt
this is actually a lot harder than I
thought I was gonna be a needy some like
really like eighties early nineties pink
rousers kind of oversized on me so I
want to fix it up a little
got a bunch laid out here everything
here is black sorry I was considering at
first maybe like balloting it looks like
I'm wearing a robe so these are the
options for my attack color so I'm
thinking one of these to accentuate that
color to really kind of bring it to life
I think I want to do this jumpsuit
you how much you got some accessories
hmm
right now I'm leaning towards strappy
black bra and tight skirt so see how I
feel feel like they have to think of is
to cut this bad boy hope I don't
had a feeling yesterday that was
probably is gonna end up cutting this
shirt anyway so I have like a Hawaiian
muscle shirt when I grabbed this is my
favorite necklace
I'm gonna put this on as like a kind of
bolo tie inspired kind of necklace we do
thank the cherry on top is going to be
hat and I put it on and I went out my
room and my roommate was like whoa
definitely you're just so
fashion-forward today with this necklace
under this collar like it did you cut
those sleeves serve it yourself I do
I've been getting slacks all day about
how hot you are and that's so nice
I usually typically don't try on a lot
of options of clothing in the morning I
thought I knew exactly what I wanted to
wear but when I put on the mom jeans
this morning they were just like loose
and then coupled with this was a little
I was like getting lost in my clothes if
you know what I mean I had a few options
with a job color I went with green I was
like you know what feel like a tree
today feeling like a part of nature and
brought this to the table at honestly I
think I did a good job pretty good I'm
just gonna compliment you sure yeah it's
very California it just feels like like
a little surfer bro like make it
national
I'm basically wearing it as a kind of a
faux jacket maybe it's serving to cover
the sultry bits underneath I'm wearing a
little sports bra that has some saucy
stress and just like a plain black tight
skirt with regard to the shoes
I wanted to do something more fun in
summary because it's like a very summery
shirt and I've kind of intensified it
with like blacks I like this - sure yeah
I would wear it I know it I like it semi
oh it's too big it's just too big for
you it was a little tough I will say
that I feel extremely lucky that I got a
Hawaiian shirt with black and the base
color what would like a rich cool
grandma wear so I went with a black
jumpsuit and I purposely went for kind
of like a more flowy fabric because it's
more beachy like I'm gonna use this to
my advantage and like really get the
tops out you know really give them their
moment and then I tied it to kind of
like you know make it a little bit more
feminine my style and then I rolled up
the sleeves put tons of necklaces on to
give it more like fashion I like your
shirt I like how you styled it what do
you think you know I love a good
Hawaiian shirt this is what you would
wear to like a beach party yeah
in the water yeah that's exactly you
know I'm not get in the water
I think I'll definitely wear this again
I think I'll definitely find something
else to work with
I was toying today with since this is so
hot wearing like a pair of like daisy
dukes but that was like I gotta go work
and my ass can't be hanging out of my
shorts I think I would wear it again but
maybe with like a brighter job or I'm a
bit different type of man you know I
could definitely see myself rocking this
thing again some slight alterations but
I don't make it work again I was putting
this on and my husband immediately was
like what is that where's that from then
I was like oh you're interested in my
clothing Mouser suddenly and he was like
I want to wear that and I was like well
and then I wanted to suddenly like wear
it all the time just because he wanted
to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
