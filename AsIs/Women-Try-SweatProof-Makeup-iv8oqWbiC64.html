we're using the makeup brand sweat which
is supposed to be water-resistant for 80
minutes which seems extreme I feel like
I usually work out after work and I wear
makeup to work so I don't bother taking
it off when I go there I do not wear
makeup when I work out I would rather
die I sweat all the time my face breaks
out when I like wake up in the morning
impending problem is we live in LA so
like every time you go to the gym but
there's like a wannabe Kardashian
contour to the max feel like I'm just
gonna feel like cakey and clogged just a
lot of it yeah it says hello beautiful
flow to the sweat squat so it comes with
a brush you twist it oh your brushes
there oh your pressures gone and then
this color which I guess we're gonna put
in the butt of the brush there it is in
the butt now what just shake it shake
and tap at a downward angle until you
see powder oh oh got it
this is very uneventful I don't really
feel like anything is okay it's
definitely going on you oh that's just a
chunk of color right it only comes like
right there it needs to like yeah
disperse it's a little light for me it
makes me look a little ashy and this is
the second darkest color it feels really
nice and it's like calming on my skin
which was really read like a second ago
if I was going to wear makeup during a
workout already like this would be the
one that I would wear we're gonna try
the bronzer highlighter I don't know why
we would need a highlighter you think
sweaty it would be your highlighter
there's only one color which is terrible
because everyone has different skin
tones it looks like I'm putting Nesquik
oh my gosh it looks so good on you yeah
I think the highlighter works for all
three of us I like that it's sparkly
bronzer and the foundation or both very
cool tones and I don't think that that
looks super good on my skin tone I
actually liked this makeup way more than
I thought I would I don't feel like I'm
wearing makeup but when I look in the
mirror
okay I can tell I'm wearing makeup I
look better than I normally do it was
just so hard to blend on my face that
even though the color was pretty good I
just got very annoyed and exhausted
wonder how it's gonna be when like water
and here's the mixture I feel like it
like a crisp and drippy get hosta Club
right that's science we are going to put
this makeup to the test and go workout
with a personal trainer and get really
sweaty see what happens let's do it
great
hi I'm Brynn and I'm a personal trainer
we're gonna do lots of body weight
exercises we're gonna work on lunges
core work lots of jumping around so get
ready to see a sweat
roaring up the pit huggers right here's
our warmup there's no really well
I feel the tinges of perspiration I
don't feel like I'm wearing makeup which
is good good good guys keep it on I feel
like Niagara Falls is on my face the
makeup kind of started coming off of me
a little bit but not as much as if I was
wearing another makeup I feel like I
didn't wear makeup during this it's like
very breathable don't feel clogged in
the pores higher skill oh great oh you
did really well you did everything you
trust you and you are so I didn't think
we should go see if this makeup
withstood the time yeah
Oh someone oatmeal I think that it went
pretty well I was sweating it happened
for me it felt really nice during the
workout that that was the only thing
that felt nice during the workout maybe
I'll look in the mirror and I won't have
any makeup on and I'll just look like
trash I don't know well I'm excited to
see how it helped
it stayed yeah yeah oh my yeah I thought
mine stayed I liked it worse looks
Wallace yeah yours looks exactly like it
not work out yeah well I do look great
the contour is like definitely still
there and there's no streaking or like
flaking or even like we all thought that
it was gonna get a clumpy I'm very
impressed
it's crazy wetted and we were putting on
and we're like this is the worst but
holy this is worth it this is
awesome now we know that they've
mastered a foundation bronzer highlight
show me some I like some lipstick I
never thought I would want to wear
makeup when I worked out but now I guess
I will I'm so here for this yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
