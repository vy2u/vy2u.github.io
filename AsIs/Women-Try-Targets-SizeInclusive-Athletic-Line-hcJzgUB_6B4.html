would we are here to try targets new
size inclusive workout line people
nowadays they're like very into at
leisure or whatever so they buy cute
clothes to workout in and like go out
into the world in I get a little scared
when companies say size inclusive just
because it usually means just a couple
more sizes larger or smaller than
they're used to size inclusivity is look
great and it's an awesome idea but I
think it's really difficult to make 12
different sizes based on the same fit
model in most stores it's kind of hard
for me to find things that fit me
lengthwise because I am very sure
pregnancy is such a weird thing because
every part of you stays the same except
for this whole middle section I think
like when it's good it's great and I
think when it's bad it's like oh well
just another day my favorite thing is
definitely this gray top
he's like thumb holes it's like a little
off the shoulder and has these two
pieces everything else though is kind of
meh
also wearing a sports bra which is like
okay for it being size increases if I
want to say it runs a little small once
you go up in size at least in the bras
it's like not gonna really do anything
for you when you're like bouncing around
or whatever and you really need that
support I'm pleasantly surprised the
leggings are really comfortable I don't
like things pressing on my stomach I'm
very sensitive about that and they don't
hurt at all I could probably wear them
for eight hours and wouldn't have any
issues you can tell it doesn't cost $100
but my bank account thanks me for it
like I definitely wouldn't be running a
marathon in this cuz there's not much
support with the built in bra but I know
it'll be fine like running up that
mountain okay walking I really like the
mesh in the back because it's really
breathable it's not necessarily
Maternity usually with maternity wear
you have this like ruching on the side
that sort of like allows for like the
belly the pants well I appreciate that
they have the front panel for the belly
I would prefer if the panel were either
a little bit higher or a fold down if
it's not like you know cute sporty
athleisure to me it's just sort of like
tight pants a big shirt
there are ports us that are good parts
that are bad okay it's fan everything
staying I don't understand why the shirt
need to have a big logo on I'm not a fan
of words on workout shirts pants are
like a little bit long on me but hey
it's workout clothes like no one expects
spectacular tailoring from workout
clothes the point of workout clothes is
to make sure you can workout in them and
so that no one sees you naked while
you're working out unless that's your
thing I feel okay the leggings are a
little long the tops are actually both
pretty tight the materials actually very
soft this is super super lightweight
there's just too many straps to all of
this it's very uncomfortable I think
it's cute and looks nice but I only wear
it if I was like going to impress
somebody at a yoga class I really love
this bra it's super cute and it's
supportive which usually you have to
sacrifice one or the other these
leggings are like tight but comfortable
and they suck everything in and my ass
looks great I don't have to worry about
my leggings riding down which is a huge
problem I hop of spin class and plus I
like to like go run errands after I work
out and I'll feel really cute while
doing so I would get my button shirt if
I could like honestly it is rock-hard
I'll tell people be like behind me not
even flexing punch that it's amazing
