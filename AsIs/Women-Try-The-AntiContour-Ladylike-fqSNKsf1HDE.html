me Spanx are hard to pee in
so like this does not yield those result
much easier to pee in
so we are trying non touring today which
is great because I really haven't gotten
the hang of contouring same well I think
not or I just think I just don't do my
makeup in my mind non touring seems
pretty synonymous to like Shrove a I
imagine like a band not going on tour to
be honest with you I do appreciate the
non tour pun because like it works
itself very naturally into there what is
non touring so non touring is basically
it's not contouring okay well we scratch
that off you've so much highlighter your
normal skin is almost like the contour I
could just like highlighting the parts
of your face that you like as opposed
like trying to hide things just have a
chill non touring sesh okay so first we
prime our skin with this illuminating
pearly primary oh it smells magnificent
like you just start glowing and you
don't you don't stop we're just gonna
glow from the bottom up this make my
skin look very Goldy like a feel like an
Oscar it feels a little bit like grown
up body glitter yeah it really is like
we're getting ready to go to the middle
school dance all right I am laughs I
look like Tracee Ellis Ross you're
supposed to use a tinted moisturizer or
a BB cream next I brought this
moisturizer that we can mix in with our
foundation this isn't to steering so far
here's some tips if you have bangs and
you have to put your makeup on
underneath your bangs but you have
makeup on your hands you can lean down
and just kind of scoot your
Beautyblender underneath your bangs when
you pop up you're looking fresh
they have no idea
I know you know so sheer coverage just
like evening out the skin I guess I
don't know I'm just sort of saying
things that I've heard Beauty you to use
day literally sound I'm just like yeah
okay whatever you're saying sounds
perfectly good to me
I don't feel blue anymore feel like my
Tracy left with my math tinted
moisturizer still early in the game we
still have some highlighting to do so
here's a fix for that more liquid
highlighter we have Becca and Sephora
brand because I went oh I want to see
those up close well I don't know I mean
I was like Becca so for his younger
sister I'm gonna go with this paint guy
he seems fun hmm go for the areas that
you highlight usually so like forehead
um
brow bone cheekbone nose Cupid's bow a
little bit of the chin now I'm touring I
feel like would be more of a summer look
I don't know cuz I feel like you have
that natural do when it's this summer
you know what I mean
might be like reflective you're allowed
to live your life you don't have to
highlight every part of your body if you
highlight a whole text book then none of
it sticks out funny you should mention
that
I was definitely one of those kids I was
really bad at taking notes because I
thought everything was important because
it's so shiny I just kind of want to
watch my face move from side to side the
last step is this powder highlighter and
we just go over either anything you lost
but mostly just your cheekbones so I'm
gonna take this darker highlighter and
put it underneath my cheekbone as like a
suggestion of contouring let's not send
the non time police out on me bring that
shine up to the cheekbone like really
intense I look like a penny are you a
Lucky Penny oh yeah this is like you
know the wild wild west of makeup right
now and I think that's that I think we
didn't I think that we non tort silly
name awesome outcome yeah I think it's a
useful look and I think it's like kind
of like fun your highlight looks great
yeah it feels really light on my skin I
like it cuz it's less steps and it's fun
and fresh and cute and flirty I feel
like this is a very attention grabbing
look because it's natural yes sweet
mm-hmm cute yet less yeah you kind of
look like an Instagram girl right now oh
no it's the best compliment oh yeah this
glow is everything I feel like this is
definitely a look I couldn't see myself
doing this
day but definitely for a summer function
where I'm trying to get Jones what is
that
getting chose means someone hollering at
me okay I'm trying to get a guy's
attention gotcha
it was easier than contouring yes it was
way easier than contouring I was able to
do it myself and no one yelled at me at
the end which means I didn't do it that
badly cuz it's just like highlight
foundation ng dad mm-hmm this is more
just like dust dust Sparkle Sparkle I
really like it is this lady approved I
think this is lady approved this was fun
lady tested lady approved lady true yeah
for sure to cheekbones up that's good
