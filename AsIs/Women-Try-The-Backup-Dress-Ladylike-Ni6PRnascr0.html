umbrella no it's the no stress backup
dress a tragic spill an impromptu
rendezvous or an unexpected invitation
to a fancy event need a cute dress for
when you're in a crunch its ladylike and
we're trying on the no stress backup
dress I've been in quite a few
situations where I've needed like a
dress for emergencies if I'm ever
underdressed for things I don't have a
solution really I'm just sort of like
well you get what you pay for and I'm
free what could it possibly be made out
of that it doesn't wrinkle it seems like
something like when you're on a ride and
you need a poncho so you throw on the
poncho but this is just cut like a dress
it's like waterproof this is kind of a
diarrhea color this is pretty much just
like a long tank top there's a lot of
mesh I feel like this is something I
play tennis in um all right okay right
on I don't feel good I don't feel good
in this I don't want to see myself
the bandeau part is not tight enough to
really like secure you and give you
proper support it's nipple town so
here's something that I forgot because I
didn't realize I'd be trying something
on so it's laundry week now we're under
why can't my brawn because this bando is
not really a bando it's just a flap I
feel like a model in 1999 regardless of
the body type it just shows like every
crevice of your body I feel very exposed
these it's just a simple black dress if
you have like a cute cardigan you throw
it over this you're fine
I really like weird hits on me is it's
like right at the knee I'm super into
like the midi-length and like the longer
dresses that are a little bit more
form-fitting you have to be okay with
your boobs and your back and your
stomach and your butt and all of it who
is this organized enough to not remember
they need to dress fancy but organized
enough to also have a backup dress in
their purse like who who falls into that
very specific like set of people ready
to see myself this right here you know
it's just I see everything that's
happening I see nips I see boobs
side boob under boob bellybutton could
you imagine if someone asked you out on
impromptu day and you're like let me
slip into something more comfortable
it's kind of cute like it like isn't
like unflattering if you're at the club
and you throw up all over yourself or
somebody throws up on you this is a
great thing to have with you I think
this dress is an awesome idea in theory
but I think that it needs a little bit
more work shopping when it comes to
finding a cut that kind of works for all
people I don't know if I feel less
stressed but it's a backup dress
