I was born with a birthmark it's also
called a port-wine stain and that was
really difficult growing up I was always
trying to cover it up growing up I had
really clear skin but in college I
started to develop acne and it's just
like never gone away when I was pregnant
I got like some darkening on my face it
just didn't go away so I have a lot of
tattoos and I'm interested in seeing
which of these foundations are truly
good at coverage it's been pretty hard
to find foundations that I really like
and work with all of the elements of my
skin finding a foundation that could
cover it all isn't super easy when you
have a baby you have no time so I really
haven't super explored any options just
really like excited to try something
completely new
packaging's pretty cool it's like super
glittery and that like followed thick
and chocolatey I will say it's a little
thick for me you see it when you put it
on your face like boom it's not like
blending up super covering whoa I mean a
coverage is really good it's very creamy
I'm very very dewy maybe I'm not a
foundation person though cuz I feel like
my skin looks worse it blends pretty
easily and I don't feel like I have to
put it on my whole entire face I could
just get coverage in those spots this
reminds me of like stage makeup it's
like I don't even have a birthmark this
is actually really scary I haven't
covered my birthmark in so long for how
heavy it is of a product it doesn't feel
heavy on my arm this area seems just the
same amount of noticeable as before it
doesn't feel too heavy I applied it
wrong the first time where I put like
way too much butt on this cheek and just
like gradually increase the coverage I
really liked how it worked I mean it's
definitely gonna cover up whatever it is
they are trying to cover up but I
definitely need like two layers of
powder to like get rid of the shine I
feel like if you walked past me you
wouldn't know I don't think it's gonna
come off
this was cool they'll have no idea how
to open this well tonight so this one's
a little more creamy which I like this
one is like a normal makeup thickness
not like damn glue but maybe that's not
as good for coverage it's spreading over
my face a lot more easily I think it
covers enough like this is what I feel
comfortable I would put this on my face
I don't see any any difference in the
upper lip yeah the coverage is like
really good actually it's considering
like how light it is there's still not
enough coverage or like it to cover up
all the redness on my face hasn't solves
a problem but it's not making things
worse it doesn't cover a lot I can
totally see myself actually wearing this
like every day we're gonna pick a little
bit of a darker color I'm automatically
hungry because I feel like I'm scooping
out cheese tip on a cracker
you have to scrape it to get it out it's
so cute a little goes a long way
this one's thick but it is gliding on
quite smoothly the area that we're like
trying to work on this upper lip looks
more noticeable to me I don't think it's
working like too well with the Beauty
Blender it was like better with my
finger I think because of the warmth I
feel like it's blending in fairly well
oh this is insane I have like a little
like redness around my nose and it does
seem to cover that it feels very tacky
but I mean it's doing its job
the coverage isn't fantastic for me up
close it you can still kind of see it a
little bit it does enough coverage it
didn't like feel disgusting to put on
next time I should just put like a color
corrector underneath it and then just
work on upper lip up close it looks very
kinky but it did provide more coverage I
would say out of all three the Kat Von D
was I think my number one thing
would go ahead and give the derma coal
and the Kat Von D a try nothing super
work I think I would use the Kat Von D
one if I was going out someplace nice
but I mean to having like full coverage
is definitely not something that I feel
like I need to be comfortable and like
feel beautiful and happy about getting
out the door every day for people who
are different and look unique like me I
think makeup should just be fun it
should be something that even it
creative with if it makes you feel more
comfortable it's that's great but I
think that you're you're beautiful no
matter what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
