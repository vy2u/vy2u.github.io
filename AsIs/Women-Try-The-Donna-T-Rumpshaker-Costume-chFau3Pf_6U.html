sexy Obama costume I used to watch The
Apprentice with my mom when I was little
I don't know how he's managed to look
exactly the same for the past 30 years
he to me is this caricature I just think
there was a bet and Donald Trump was
like yeah I'll run for president I was a
Girl Scout would you like to try to
Samoa this what is this what is this
what is happening on the right side of
my face Ashton Kutcher ruined trucker
hats for all of us so did that Hardy no
need to bring him back Trump I don't
know how Donald Trump goes around living
like this every day this is just an
all-around awkward costume this could be
like its own wig like right here I look
at myself and I think I hear an ice
cream truck this doesn't make me like
Trump anymore and then like if you're
hot you know you're dancing in the club
then you take this off what are you I
don't know about you but like I wouldn't
want to shake my rump in this outfit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
