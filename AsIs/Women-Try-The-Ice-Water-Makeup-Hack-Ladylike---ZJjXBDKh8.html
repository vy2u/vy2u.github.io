beauty hack jeongsu that's supposed to
make your makeup last longer but
involved ice-cold water and baby powder
I'm trying to imagine how those two
things can come together I'm not quite
sure so first we're gonna cover our face
with concealer and foundation and then
we're just gonna take a thing of baby
powder like just have it ejaculate all
over her face what is maybe better use
for just like diaper rash and then we're
gonna dip it in water and then we're
gonna be beautiful maybe it's like you
do your makeup in the morning you put
some ice-cold water you don't even need
coffee
you're just man I hope it works I mean
I'm always in the market for a smooth
matte look I'm concerned about the baby
pad I think it's going to shine through
as being ashy and white I have so many
concerns
I feel like ice cold water is good for
your skin but it's going to be terrible
for my mood all right let's do it let's
dive right in
good work gonna start off with some
priming my face looks like I've been at
a Funeral I typically start off with my
brows and my eye makeup but for the
purpose of this hack we're gonna start
off with concealer and foundation I'm a
little worried that this baby powder
thing is gonna feel super heavy so we've
done our foundation and concealer baby
powder is supposed to seal in our makeup
so we're gonna cover our faces with it
you're supposed to try and make sure
it's as even as possible so I just use
my normal powder brush for this how
we're supposed to get that much baby
power on our faces yeah it no okay
no if you have dry skin this is not the
thing for you it's like soon or dandruff
I never thought I would say this but I'm
ready for the ice water you can take
breaks as needed take break free zero
you did not tell they're a whole
Christian seconds mine has more floating
ice chunks than yours I don't even think
I can hold my breath for 30 seconds one
two three done
it's too cold this is like in Titanic I
don't want to be in the water I want to
be on the doors actually it's painful
okay oh my God my head hurts I'm
catching pneumonia I can feel it imagine
the worst head freeze you've ever gotten
and then imagine it's on the same day as
the first day of your period nope I
don't know what I hate more the fact
that we did this or the fact that our
face looks too good afterwards this is
pretty good oh me could this
possibly keep our makeup on our face
rather than just completely removing it
and this job okay well I will say this
did give me a runny nose I feel like my
skin was like really tired and upset
with me and then now it's kind of like
hello yes I was just gonna say that your
skin actually looks nice though
I'm gonna say like I think your
complexion looks like really matte and
really even
all right well I'm not mad at folks yeah
your skin looks really glowy and
beautiful like I think as you have
smaller pores like this definitely
worked for you
I'm pleased I'm confused it feels like
there's a very thin film on my face it
definitely feels like it's gonna be mat
for a long time I think that like my
cheeks in my forehead look good yeah
it's just my nose I look like I have
like a bunch of really tan freckles on
my nose I'm super impressed with how
seamlessly the baby powder came off of
my face after dunking while this was fun
it's not over we have three challenges
to put our faces through throughout this
day to see if it holds up challenge one
it's raining outside today it is so if
this can withstand the rain it gets a
nice little checkmark challenge number
two is going to be the clothing
challenge we're gonna see if our makeup
will smudge off on other people's
clothes or our own clothes
and challenge three at the end of the
day we're gonna take blotting papers and
see how oily we are any challenge passed
is a win all right
let's do it I just feel like walking
around in the rain is kind of refreshing
but um we'll see if my makeup moves or
does not lose for some reason it seems
like every range app is like avoiding my
face all of a sudden which i think is a
win just came it from the rain and it
still looks good hair's a mess
yeah but no the I mean I don't see any
run in channel C
it's pretty pretty solid doesn't seem
like any came off on the collar so
that's pretty boss I actually don't feel
as oily as I usually do I think that at
this time usually my makeup would be
much shinier but I don't think I'm
completely matte but I do think it's
helping
so I've literally been running around
campus like a crazy woman enough to
start sweating I think way more makeup
would have come off if I hadn't done
this Korean beauty hat it is just a
little bit kind of foundation coat and a
little oily oh yeah so this is just a
little bit of tapping on my forehead you
can see you can see the makeup and the
oil I'm pretty greasy I'm pretty well
greased typically around this time my
eye makeup starts like bleeding on to
like my cheekbone a little bit and it's
not doing that at all I wish this trick
didn't work as well as it did
it's hard to tell if that's foundation
or bronzer the bronzer was not in the
baby powder ice-cold water situation so
there were no promises made about the
bronzer but it looks like there's a
little bit of foundation mixed in the
hack doesn't necessarily omit any
possibility of smudging I think that's
inevitable at the end of the day but it
really gave me a soft matte smooth
looking face the entire day damn soon
thank you
we sealed our makeup with baby powder
and by sticking our faces in cold water
it actually made us look pretty good by
the end of the day usually I'm like
quite shiny and I was like okay it was
painful to do you had baby powder
everywhere everywhere when you took off
your bra on Friday night wasn't just
like sprinkling baby powder everywhere I
was pretty doubtful of this hack I was
very pleased with the length of time in
which my makeup lasted and I was
displeased with just the projects when
it looked good we first did it I think
it'd probably have more to do with the
fact that it was just water on our faces
and it just perked up our faces like
little face bras if I'm gonna get a head
freeze it might as well be because I've
just polished off a lot of ice cream
would do this again for like an event
maybe maybe perhaps lady tested lady no
no play why no lady why lady why why are
you doing this how was your affair do
