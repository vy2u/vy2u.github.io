look I would just go dark gold gold and
on both sides and then like walk into my
history class and be like slang now
we're gonna put like little little baby
products all over our face this is us
naked and afraid everyone that we saw do
this on YouTube are like complete
experts like they're all really really
really good at makeup
we are not makeup artists we have no
formal training we are regular people
look princess so starting when I was a
kid Claire's was in to get your ears
pierced there but that was pretty much
it this BB cream is from Claire's it's
the only shade they offered they only
have one shade Huus is aimed at cute
little white girls this is from icing
this looks like not your color
this is also not my palette evens out
complexion and conceals imperfections
but kind of makes me look sickly a
little bit is this good I would wear
this as an adult I don't really see how
this is for kids like this is already
just looking crazy on my skin you're
faster than I am I just didn't do it
right this is like a tennis ball this is
this Beauty Blender where's the blush
shimmer bronzing powder which is that
just fancy for blush this is like also
kind of a highlighter I was just gonna
say this is giving me more highlighter
than bronzing blush see this is for
children because it's supposed to make
you look like Mary Poppins or like
little halo lamp well that's not a word
you are incredibly thurston if you were
asian I would say you have an Asian glow
right now she's not though we understand
the difference this clear is palette I'm
kind of in love with it's so nice it's
beautiful I'm gonna use this shimmery
beige eyeshadow on my eyes because it's
sort of similar the color I usually use
when I was a kid I had like art kits
that look like this I'm so torn between
this lime green eyeshadow and everything
in this palette this Darth Maul spongy
thing I remember and I used to use this
all the time you guys are played pretty
pretty princess come on up yeah I'm just
gonna reinvigorate my life with some
yellow oh hello nope just kidding it's
Oh yep nope wait never understood that
like getting a black ring that you lost
pretty pretty princess oh that's what
that meant yeah
I don't think I ever played a game
correctly in my whole childhood I
already feel like a unicorn
you are unicorn it's not a color that
like I would wear but it's not a color
that I hate having on I need more purple
I need more intense purple it's not
enough purple there's so much glitter
just like around my eyeballs how old
were you when you got your first
boyfriend well I had a boyfriend in
kindergarten me too he was white Sam ha
ha ha now I'm just like embracing what
this is I was trying to fight the fun
don't fight no don't fight the fun let's
put some blue on my face for some reason
using kids makeup makes me feel okay
about experimenting with colors and
having a bit more fun so in order to get
any type of color you have to press
really hard but that means precision
just goes out the window I'm really
pleased with the way my browser coming
out
I wonder how Kristin and Jen are doing
ahh are you ok it really hurts -
tropical sunset I'm like wearing like a
black maxi dress like sweeping through
the hall was like death herself and I'm
like on my face it's like it's vacation
time whoa this smells like alfredo pasta
oh this smells like superglue smells
like weird
this smells like sharpies oh yeah I
don't know what you're getting possible
okay in prison whoa who's the Italian
here you are huffing glue right now I
also never do lip so how do you purse or
you keep open I do like this color but
now I'm nervous about my tropical look I
will say all the makeup tastes pretty
good that tastes like great wow I could
be the first lady in the United States I
look like a holiday Barbie from the 80s
this is a lot of fun this is like the
most fun I've had in a while this was
the childhood sleepover I never had I
appreciate the chance to be able to just
be like you know what
there are a bunch of colors and they
belong here I feel like we started off
Rocky with the BB creams just because
they didn't have a variety of shades but
we worked with it we worked through it
definitely pleased with all of how
pigmented everything was pleased with
how pigmented our brow powder our
eyeshadows our blushes were we came here
to have fun we did and to look
delightful and we accomplished both of
those goals you look like a little box
efficient
like a delightful little angel on the
back a cereal box might just pluck you
off the shelf myself take you home with
me push you in my cart we're going on
and then God Oh delightful little angel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
