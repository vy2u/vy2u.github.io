that's gonna take off all my makeup and
make me ugly no I'm just kidding today
we're going to be trying the original
makeup eraser apparently like replaces
all of those makeup wipes and everything
which are so damn expensive looks like a
pink pearl the packaging I'm into that
remove it with just water
I wonder what chemicals are in this then
it's oh it says 100% polyester who knew
you could erase your makeup with Justin
forever21 shirt up to reasonable for a
thousand washes which is like less than
three years maybe well are you kidding
me I can't even keep up with a bath
towel for like six months even if it
still took your makeup off three years
later if it would be sanitary at that
point excited to use something that's
better for the environment and maybe can
save me I hope it works oh it's like the
water doesn't really go into it
alright work what's going circular
motion that's not doing so bad right wow
this actually really works you can see
the difference I love to see that the
best foundation I don't know what it's
doing and why it's working it's not
necessarily faster but it it doesn't
feel like I'm like stripping my skin or
anything it feels really soft as you can
definitely see all that
is there like a chemical in here no
there can't because you can launder it
for three years
I look different and my skin is not
super red after like wiping it down I'm
very impressed
I mean it seems like it took off most of
my makeup and like my faces and feel dry
it just feels super soft it does do a
decent job and I'm very interested as to
how it works like the same amount of
time as a regular as washing your face
three months worth of makeup wipes but
one of these that lasts a thousand
washes come on I just realized you're
probably supposed to hold it in your
hands like this and like rub it like
this see that look look that's my face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
