face whatever celebrity trend whatever
Instagram like hashtag is like on about
skincare I'm going to try
I do face masks every I sometimes do
like two to three days a week I feel
like maybe this will influence me to pay
more attention to my skin
we'll see the face mask that I do a
strictly mud and gel I've never really
done a peel which kind of makes me
nervous just because the nose strips
that I have tried in the past have
brought me so much pain I've seen peel
off face mask and like YouTube videos
and tutorials and like some of my home
girls will do it and they'll like put it
on snapchat I'm just like that looks
painful why would you do that and now I
am one of those people
Mama's gonna clean up her face let's go
I'm already regretting this I'm putting
it along my t-zone upside-down t-zone
because my pores and like my upper
cheeks are like weirdly large it doesn't
actually feel bad like it feels fine
right now it feels very minty I feel
refreshed I'm just nervous about hanging
it off I feel like I know this is gonna
hurt I'm ready to get out these pores
I'm ready to take on the world
come at me pollution and acne and
bacteria I'll duck scoop you out so we
waited for about 20 minutes and now I
guess it's time to peel it off okay
oh my god no no no all right
Oh
okay
oh my god that hurt like a bitch
someone just bitch-slapped the out
of my pores call Tuesday and they left
me like it also like just didn't really
hurt as much as I thought it would there
are definitely more sensitive areas on
my face that what kind of like ah I
definitely feel a lot fresher and a lot
more rejuvenated I think I'm a little
red but I feel like that'll go down
eventually I might try this again
in like a few years when I've grown and
I've become a stronger individual but
currently it hurt more than I expected
boom this is so cam actually I retract
that statement I'm gonna use this maybe
on a monthly basis yeah actually I would
surprisingly I would do this again
either I have a high high pain tolerance
or I just was going to get these
blackheads out of my pores beauty's pain
guys I'm I'm not mad about the pain
anymore if my face is gonna feel this
