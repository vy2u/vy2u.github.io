are burning and I think that's not a
good sign eyeliner is impossible without
a mirror it's gonna be miss it looks
really hard I am NOT expecting great
things I think I'm gonna be pretty good
at this
we'll try oh this is just what I use on
a day-to-day basis put on a blush
touch-up a brow liner for my eyes and a
concealer it's very complicated uh I
have no idea like how much product I'm
actually putting on my face oh god
you're smiling I'm like trying to
imagine my face in my head now we blend
just basically like beat the toy your
face feels weird cuz you don't know
where to look I don't feel like I'm
having any me time cuz I can't see me
make sure everything's blended as well
well I'm seeing it everything's blended
in bronzer this is this love could be
bad oh did I put that on to her I can
tell you that right there now oh god I
don't know where my cheekbones are my
body just knows what to do I do this
every freaking day but very not really
feel well I breath I'm like feeling for
the hairs the to see you really are I
actually don't fill in my brows ever and
it felt a I'm just drawing on my
forehead oh god you're gonna be a good
eyeliner I am so terrified to do those
right now oh I feel my heart breaking
inside oh it's up there I can feel it I
have no idea if they're even I don't
even know if they're filled in right now
I know nerves I left off you're in oh I
don't even want to see this island
mess do I look flawless my eyebrows for
sure I don't want to leave oh okay oh
okay I didn't blend in my bronzer at all
I look like I took like five shots this
isn't that terrible I would honestly do
this in real life that's crazy I don't
even need a mirror until I make that I
got some nice highlights it is blended
except for that bugger I have it's kind
of like abstract try liner this should
inspire all of you feel like there's
also a satisfaction in watching yourself
do your own makeup if I'm feeling myself
like that's all that matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
