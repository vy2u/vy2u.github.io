a few weeks ago I read a post about the
cha-cha jowls and everyone in the
comments was that they were like super
gung ho for it like this is the greatest
thing that's ever happened I've wanted
this my entire life or why was this even
created if I want to try this product
because it's summer in New York and
there's only so much that air
conditioning can do when you have boobs
that are not in a cup bra let's are not
your friend at all I'm really
hoping that this like kind of does the
same thing that is wrong let's do for
people who have small boobs hoping that
it'll really help rid me of the sweat
that I get sometimes well lounging
around in 90-degrees los angeles with no
central air-conditioning
I hope it works I want it to work really
badly I'm about to open the top now my
first impression is that it kind of
looks like oven mitts I think it'd be
great if I can do pizza rolls out of the
oven and I can just outside is towel the
other one is kind of like cute and
floral this looks like it would
definitely be able to hold one of my
boobs in let's try it out
throw it over I'd be lying if I said I
didn't already love it this is
definitely something this Tata towel
kind of reminds me of like a halter top
that's missing the middle never been
separated in my life they kind of look
like people who are standing too far
away from each other middle school dance
you're in this very comfortable it does
feel like a warm towel is hugging my
chest right now I think this is
definitely gonna be good for moisture
wicking let's see how much this tattoo
towel can handle I'm gonna take a shower
and then do my makeup and see like if
it's gonna hold them in place while I'm
getting ready for the day
tend to drop you know toothpaste on
myself but my Taj Hotel is catching it
I really caught a hair for a moment
touching my skin the bathroom is super
high and cause it really hot showers and
so then my boobs end up like being one
underneath or sweating but like the
girls are pretty dry I'm jumping oh no
no no tattoos are do just lounging
around doesn't really help keep things
in the center of my body I was dancing
and this will not come off it's like the
support of a sports bra but like a
halter top
I'm impressed a bend over just nope the
taco towel did its job well I got ready
for the day to be honest I am really
thrilled about taking it off like that
the Tata towel isn't necessarily great
for like being very mobile I enjoyed it
I liked it more than I thought it was
going to my boobs weren't sweating when
I was getting ready even though like I
was blow-drying my hair and everything
whatever sweat that I do have I don't
need an entire brought owl dedicated to
that this could be good for if you have
had a baby recently and are left dating
don't know if I could justify spending
$45 on it like I liked it's like a
novelty gift like a gag gift that you
get for your friend with big boobs also
but yeah I could justify spending twenty
dollars on this I could not do forty
five dollars in my mind that's like okay
$45 I can get like five or six burritos
that's just where I'm at in life cut
some peanut butter in my fingers I just
wiped it on the towel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
