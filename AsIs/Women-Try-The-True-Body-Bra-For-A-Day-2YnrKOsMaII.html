(laughs)
Like I hope I find out.
So today we're trying the
true body bra by True&amp;amp;Co.
- I actually don't wear bras that often.
Or like ever.
- I wear this.
It's a sticky bra.
I call it sticky boobs.
This is all adhesive.
- I've never not worn a bra
since at least third grade.
In the past year, I've kind of been like,
you know what?
Fuck it.
- I have a few bras, but they're
from like the ninth grade.
- I don't know any woman who's like,
oh bras, let me put on a bra today.
That's so much fun.
- I think having the motto like,
naked but better,
really worries me in terms of support.
- Alright give me the bra.
- No underwire which is
one of my biggest beefs.
- It has a little bit of padding inside.
- I'm down to try it.
- Maybe this will be the one bra
that I'm happy to wear.
- Okay, it's very soft.
- So the material feels nice.
Very close to a second skin.
I'm not going to lie.
- As far as comfort goes,
this is definitely like
the most comfortable bra
I've ever put on.
- Naked but better.
I don't think there's
anything better than naked.
But this might be close.
- Oh, let's get this day going.
- It's really hot today,
and I'm a little concerned
with the amount of fabric I have on body.
I'm not used to that.
- I'm honestly already a little anxious
but you can see, oh my god,
it's like already,
it's just like sliding off of me.
I'm skeptical.
I hope this gets better.
- This is a bra.
Feel it.
(laughs)
- I really like it though.
It's like seamless.
- Right.
The only thing I hate about it,
is that if you see it like rolls up.
- If this didn't roll, I think
everything would be great
about this bra.
- Literally right now I'm wearing
the most uncomfortable bra
on earth.
You can see that I like
tuck my t-shirt under it,
because it rubs.
I would try that.
- Okay.
- That looks really comfy.
- You know when your shorts are too tight,
and they're like pressing on your stomach
and it gives you a stomach ache?
No, just me?
Because there's so much
material, like down here.
It's pressing on my stomach,
and I think it might be
giving me a stomachache.
- I rarely go without wires,
- Yeah.
- So I am like, the fact that
your boobs look this good
with no wires, is phenomenal.
- I sat in my car for
like less than 10 seconds,
and I felt immediately like Niagara Falls
was underneath my shirt.
- I don't have a car,
and so I take the train,
which results in about a 20 minute walk.
Like I can't feel myself sweat,
but I know it's just because it's in this
like rolled up part.
I'm like I just rolled it down,
and it's like soaking wet.
- I don't know if it's because
the bra is super slippery,
or if it's cause my shirt is kind of soft,
it keeps sliding down.
And I don't appreciate that.
- I don't feel like my boobs
like are down to my ankles
or anything like that.
So, that's nice.
- So I've been in my air
conditioned office for a while,
and I've actually completely forgotten
that I was wearing a bra.
- It could be a cute shirt on its own.
But I did notice today that
when walking, slash jogging
down stairs, I didn't have
to do this whole business.
- It's the end of the day.
I'm like fifty fifty on this.
It does provide great support.
- Maybe I'm a new bra wearer.
Probably not.
- I put my pasta in my backpack,
and I wrapped it in paper towels.
But the juice got out of the pasta,
and it soaked my sticky boobs.
Guess it's a good thing
I have another comfortable bra to wear.
- So I know I promised one day,
but I couldn't make the
bra work with my outfit.
It's just too hot, and
I'm going to a concert.
So braless, once again.
- As someone who loves to be naked,
I don't think this is
better than being naked.
But it's kind of close.
