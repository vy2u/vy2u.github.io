in the boob section but not a lot of
room down below just in case you have a
fat kitty I have a few reservations
about this shoot today now
today we're in the Hollywood Hills and
we're trying on swimsuits that claim to
be size inclusive so swimsuits were all
came out with a line of swimsuits from
sizes 4 to 24 for those of you who know
me I never ever ever do shoots like this
that I just volunteered to do it like
Katniss I'm either gonna win this whole
thing or get killed
shopping for swimsuits for me as a
 nightmare to put it lightly my
boobs are a size BB but my butt is flat
so it's very confusing bathing suits are
very hard to find I think with my body
shape a lot of my weight is in my belly
and in my thighs and I think that's
where I'm most self-conscious I'm just a
girl that just constantly blown you know
if I got a little fun feet that because
of the tacos I earlier that's okay and
that's just me one time I was at the
beach and I heard like a group of
preaching girls saying how if they were
my size they would never wear a swimsuit
I thought I looks great and you know I
think everyone should have the
opportunity to feel beautiful and sexy
no matter what their sizes
okay the time has come the suit is here
she is laid out beautifully you know
what I think this is gonna fit usually
when I look at a suit I'm like there's
no way but I'm feeling kind of confident
right now to be honest like I'm not that
worried like this is a lot more than
I've worn in the past whatever man I
signed up for this I didn't think about
it see you later Internet I hope you
like this you sick bastards like a bride
on her wedding night oh my gosh
kitty is out - purr it's just really
like pressing down and it's just up here
I didn't even what bone is this look up
to my room I think there's enough
material here covering me I'm not sure
about my ass but it's 2017 who hasn't
seen an ass find out we're mine to be
specific all right now that I have this
bad boy on I'm excited to go accessorize
and take some hot pulpit I think since
we are trying on sides inclusive
swimsuit it is important that we have
all different types of body sizes with
us today for the shoot and I'm really
excited about that there's a lot of good
positive energy and it just seems like a
safe space to be in for something like
this to happen I'm excited and ready to
just kind of like get into my inner
goddess I just want you know feel
glamorous for a bit
when I got to set it didn't dawn on me
at all what we were actually doing today
until I like saw the swimsuit and
realized that I had to be in it and I
had to like look good and be sexy which
is like all my worst fears in general I
kind of just avoided swimsuits my whole
entire life I felt like every time I put
on a swimsuit I felt really insecure but
I feel like I've entered a new phase of
my life where I'm trying to be
body-positive and I don't really give a
 what I look like because I feel
good so today when I showed up at this
beautiful house with a pool in the
Hollywood Hills I was like holy
this is going to be a really really
really fun day for me personally a lot
of my swimsuit body issues comes from
cellulite and always deal with the fact
that people think slice disgusting and
gross and people always told me to cover
it up and I'm tired of it and I'm here
to own it and whatever some
suits given to me I'm really stoked to
see how this dating suit look normally
finding swimsuits in my size I'm just
kind of like uh whatever trying to make
it like as sexy as possible but still
like take my body into consideration but
recently I've been kind of like no
about anything and I felt generally like
covered and secured like nothing was
going to pop out or say hello everybody
was around me and being super supportive
and super super just like yes girl work
the vibe on set was really amazing it
was just basically girls supporting one
another
I will say I was a little nervous
especially when I learned I would be
lying down just because it's not the
most flattering pose I was worried that
it was just gonna be like a whole lot of
stomach but once we got started I got
like really into it and was just trying
to channel the most like glamorous woman
I could
this is one of the most beautiful
locations I've seen it was a little bit
intimidating it's really difficult for
me to try to be sexy that's usually not
what I try to be but at the same time I
feel like I'm at the age where I should
own my sexuality so I'm really really
happy that I got to work my stuff and
strut my stuff in front of all my
friends I'm not nervous about it being a
one-piece I am nervous about it being a
little revealing there was a part where
I was standing up next to a donut thing
on the outside I was looking fierce but
on the inside I was really crumbling but
then I saw the photos and it kind of
just changed my entire narrative about
how I look at my body I actually forgot
that this whole day was about size
inclusiveness mainly because everyone
was wearing the same thing and looks so
good so it just felt like a positive
experience I think having a size
inclusive line like this just gives so
much opportunities for each one of us to
feel so good everyone is insecure about
certain things about themselves but I
felt like today I couldn't tell you what
people were insecure about because
everyone was so happy and just really
chill being themselves since I'm more on
the smaller side I feel like I've not
worried all the time about finding stuff
and I feel like that's up if I
get to strut my stuff I'm something that
I can wear and then other people can
wear at the same time I'll give you my
money it is important that we have all
different types of body sizes with us
today for the shoot since we're people
showing off our bodies on the internet a
lot of times people are like oh you guys
are just celebrating obesity and that's
not it it's hard to do stuff like this
and put on swimsuits and you know be
confident it's really cool to be doing
stuff like this and kind of getting in
touch with yourself and realizing that
you are enough if someone tells you that
you're not allowed to be happy and
confident in your size that's on that
that's their problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
