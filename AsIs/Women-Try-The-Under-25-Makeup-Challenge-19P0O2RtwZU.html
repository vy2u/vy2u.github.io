expensive
what y'all all here paying $4 per
eyeliners ah today we are doing the $25
makeup challenge three of us are going
to three different makeup locations with
only $25 to see how much of the full
face
I'm feeling pretty optimistic I think I
can definitely succeed at the challenge
because my makeup routine is pretty
minimal and also CBS has like everything
so surely they have something that can
really give me a good sling I am at
Nick's professional makeup store in
Union Square New York City and I'm about
to go inside and see how much of a
complete look I could get for $25 I
think I'm gonna do well I believe in
myself I think I'm gonna rock but
if I'm here outside of Mecca and Union
Square in New York I'm terrified but I'm
ready for this challenge
and if I want to take you public stick
and make it super Universal as in like
the rouse eyeliners contour lips all
with you one product that sounds as
crazy as I just said it so ordinarily I
would definitely use liquid eyeliner
however this liquid eyeliner is four
dollars and I'm an image what I'm going
to do is like get two products that are
like a first in time but I can use like
eyes and lips maybe or like lips and
blush people do that I thought I was in
good shape but I don't know I'm not
feeling so confident anymore
I have a lot of really grand dreams of
what I'm gonna do with these poor
products but whether or not I can
actually execute it and questionable
this is going to be a thing and
I am NOT confident myself the slightest
I'm gonna start with like the simplest
and safest thing which is eyeliner for
me it's a pencil eyeliner that's out to
high school how ordinarily do kind of a
wing to but I don't know if I can do it
with pencil so I'm just gonna do a
regular eyeliner I got this like
concealer that I'm going to use kind of
as foundation hopefully work alright so
the color I mean it's clearly not my
color it looks actually as bad as you
think
I have this elf brow palette I'm hoping
it works I'm a little bit nervous I mean
for $4 it's not bad glossy eyes are in
you couldn't like put a little lipstick
on your eyes I'm taking like just like a
tiny just a tiny tiny bit oh I don't
hate it
I'm supposed to put on a contour okay so
this is a lip it's by Milani I'm gonna
try to apply a little bit as some blush
and hope for the best
I regret it already now I'm gonna try to
put the darkest color on my lips I don't
know guys that's that huh wow I'm
shocked because I think going into this
I was like very nervous about like what
I can actually do on my own I think it
works out it definitely it's not like my
most perfect like glam everyday look
that I normally like to wear but it's
definitely a look I know I first sure
didn't win this challenge but I think I
gave it my best shot and you know what
whoever has the most fun one I didn't
even have the most fun though this
challenge really forced me to make
certain products multi-use whether you
have twenty five dollars or twenty-five
thousand
you can definitely still look you and
you don't have to spend your life
savings trying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
