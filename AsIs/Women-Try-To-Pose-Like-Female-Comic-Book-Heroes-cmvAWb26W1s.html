off and my butt feels like it's about to
spring off into another dimension today
we are going to be trying out the poses
that female superheroes are often drawn
in in comic book you know they look good
I hope I look that good we'll see I'm
excited I'm a little nervous a lot of
ass in this pose for me
thankfully I'm really in touch with my
ass so I'm very excited to get this much
closer to it I know I'm gonna look bad I
know it's gonna feel bad I don't think
it's gonna be easy I bet I think it's
gonna be fun I think I can do it you
notice how her right hip is popped out
yes oh my god I might have lied oh is
being easy it just scared you because
her back is literally like fuzzy and no
matter how hard I stick my butt out it's
never gonna look like that it's so hard
I'm fighting so much cry because getting
ready for crime means putting on a full
face of makeup that was very sexy feet
also a pout a little yeah look at this
one more time mm-hmm I'll be fine if it
I go to the chiropractor later I'm going
to look trial of fierce so don't judge
me okay
this is horrific I think we're we're
good here
that was dignified I did not enjoy that
I hate yoga so I don't know why I
thought this would be fun I wouldn't
have made it I would have been like
zapped with some sort of ray I like I
started to break a swag and feel it on
my eyebrow like in my back when you
actually put your body in my position
it's totally impossible to do I think
the photo came out pretty well I did
feel pretty badass I'm pretty cool and I
had a fan blowing my hair in the wind I
don't think that I look bad in the photo
but knowing what I was supposed to try
and recreate it was like such a huge
failure in that sense like her ass is
like a heart shape almost mine is just
like flat across or drawings and her
spine is a Z and her butt is a bubble
and it's just not something that my body
will ever look like I thought I was
really interesting doing this as a
plus-size woman because I was very
conscious of the fact that like my
stomach was sticking out in places and
the way these women are drawn it's like
she's just basically like a life-size
Barbie and here I was trying to compete
you can't help but feel like really bad
about yourself even though like even if
I was psylocke size I don't have the
legs that she has and my torso is not
that long I didn't realize how short my
thighs were until this moment that's a
new thing but I can worry about feel
like I wasn't fierce enough I did my
best I'm not gonna get mad at my body
for not being able to do impossible
things what I was trying to think was
that I'm trying to fight crime but at
the same time I've got to look like
beautiful and hot and like a boss ass
bitch I would like to see her I don't
know in some kind of strength clothes
instead of like a sex pose I know that
they're not realistic but I do think
that people who read these all the time
probably absorb a lot of how they should
perceive women's bodies and like what
woman's body should be like even if they
don't know that they're doing it hard
out there for a female superhero you
know
I need to go to like a spa right now my
neck my back my in my crack you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
