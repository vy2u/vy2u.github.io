how that's a different
I don't really laugh easily in college
they called me Daria I didn't really
like smile or laugh alot basically
guaranteed that I'm gonna lose my
either crying or laughing or both at any
given time so I don't know how I'm gonna
do with this but I'm gonna try challenge
one so we're starting off simple and I'm
just have to read a review out loud so I
think I got this yeah does that
count
I already lost that I didn't even start
the lipsticks stayed on for I you
not 21 hours before I start flaking off
in that time I had several meals
vigorous sex a shower
a whole night sleep and a morning
blowjob if we're nothing else it's worth
having a few of these for date nights
I usually hate having to buy things from
a consultant but holy I am now
ellipsis evangelist it's okay I guess
challenge to break way I'm so bad at
accents I'm so sorry the accent oh great
so I don't have to like choose one Pony
let me get to pastrami on a long long
long sub double the sauce double come on
what are you cheating me out here so if
it's anything like that
I definitely have a southern accent I
grew up in Florida which technically is
a South but in Miami which technically
is northern South America so I guess it
doesn't count I'm so sorry to everyone
from the south I wore champagne pop oh
my god so wet already I want to laugh
because I'm embarrassed for myself oh my
god I wore champagne pop when I went out
to a gay bar last night I'm a girl and
as I was dancing a guy from 10 feet away
yelled oh my god girl you are glowing
yes bitch give me laughs bitch so it's
definitely my favorite highlight what
the I just got handed a mouth guard
and a review
oh yeah this feels better this just look
good oh my god are you doing a lot okay
if this is what I think it is I'm
definitely gonna need some of the lip
sense lipstick because this is gonna
mess up what I have on my mouth Oh does
that count as laughing before I'm
reading stuff wait which way does it go
the big side I don't know if that can't
be possible
little side in oh oh no oh no are you
sure this is how I do it one size does
not fit all I usually want to take a
hike go for spending the night I or
friends this is it as a drunk off
tequila shooters anyone wearing heels
the size of his dick and I set out to
return the favor not Ian I'm not on the
face and the sex good for her it
actually feels nice after a while though
the ton Jews were interesting the
blowjob almost got me and the nut in the
face kind of got me but the southern
accent definitely got me shoe everyone
who writes these reviews never stop
being who you are I want you to write
more give me some fanfic in some urban
decay reviews like I want really good
stuff if you have ever read a beauty
product review that's made you laugh cry
pay yourself poop yourself basically be
like a bright giant adult baby or if you
are one of my favorite people in the
world and you have written one of these
reviews please leave it in the comments
and maybe we'll do another one of these
and you can watch me Lamaze breeze with
a mouth spacer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
