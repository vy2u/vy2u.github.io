welcome to my spa okay it's a set so
weird things keep being advertised to me
on Instagram and I just bought one of
them the other day and I'm like I'm
gonna surprise my co-workers with it and
not tell them pretty much anything about
it other than it removes hair now this
is a self threader it looks like a
torture device and I'm gonna give it to
them and see if they can figure out how
to use it and if it works wish them luck
the area that I'm trying to remove hair
from today is gonna be my upper lip so I
have a lot of fine but dark hair up on
my cheeks with hair I'm going to clean
up my eyebrows today before I used to
try to shave it I get my eyebrows done
about every three weeks I have gotten it
waxed before or like straight ripped the
skin off of my cheese if there were a
tool that I could use at home that would
be super convenient and save me a ton of
money so I hope this works
oh my god this actually looks like it's
gonna cut my face off I got my eyebrows
threaded for years and I really liked it
but I don't know about doing it on my
own I've never done threading before but
a lot of my friend do threading all the
time so I'm very excited so it looks
like we have to put it together it's
like when you go to the gynecologist the
first thing you'll need to do is replace
the thread that arrived in it okay thank
you for creating more work for me they
spelled thread through red tear it to
read simply hook the thread through the
eyelet no it's not simple what the hell
is this so this fun little thing has a
ton of discs that you take out and each
disk has a new thread run the thread
from the outside inward and this is a
very detailed y'all they've got pictures
- it's feels more like crafts when it
does hair removal this is clearly not
right I was given this example and I'm
going to try and copy what I visually
see here so this is how one that
function looks like and this is what my
looks like right now I have to twist
something five times two three and it
broke turn dial on top clockwise to
tighten it's not doing nothing
this better be worth it I did it without
looking at the pre-made one so I'm gonna
try this on my arm so I don't mess up my
face this is something I'm familiar with
as a person who gets started all the
time baby powder on your face to begin
with oh that was a big one
pressing doing the thing oh look they
fell down cuz it did the thing this is
good oh oh that hurts
I don't know if I took anything off but
I felt pain all right stand in the water
but working though well I think it took
some of it off okay stop my Skinner is
that hair what's happening I realized I
was holding it like this but this needs
to move against the grain of your hair I
don't know if it actually is taking them
out or just like pulling them I just
want everyone to know that these
close-up mirrors are really hurtful
oh yeah that's definitely gone
this is harder to figure out than IKEA
furniture oh my god it works
I had hairs all around here and they're
gone if you're up for hair removal and
maybe a puzzle this is perfect this is
not working for me I can't figure it out
so I am just going to pay $30 for
someone else to do it
I feel like it is getting some of it off
but not all of it off if you are gonna
engineering then try it once you
understand how this functions it's
pretty good for like a quick cleanup I'm
definitely leaving here today with less
hair than I had</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
