early my name is Brenda stump I am an
underwater photographer and today we are
making some art I am so nervous
just because when I've seen examples of
this done everyone looks so beautiful
and like peaceful and I am the most
anxious stressed out person I know I'm
excited but I also feel like I get
really excited about these things and
then I'm afraid that I'm not gonna like
do as well we're going to teach you
angle how to look beautiful underwater
it's a long process but I think we're
gonna make some really great stuff it'll
be so nice to see plus-sized women in
this kind of glamorous beautiful light
we're already different and being
plus-size and being darker skin tone and
me not having hair insured and having
all the hair just underwater having fun
and feeling pretty
all right girls so we're gonna be
working in the water today and is one of
the most unusual amazing places to shoot
ever we've got a blue box that's
actually your set that's where your
world is going to be today when we're
down there one of those important things
remember about underwater modeling is
that when you are holding your breath
the breath is not in your face it's
gonna be interesting to see how I can
remain underwater hold my breath but
still somehow look beautiful and
glamorous
I've watched on America's Next Top Model
episode it was the petite season they
did really bad underwater and they were
models so we don't want to be going like
that right one of the tricks we use an
underwater modelling is using weight
belts we each got weighted down with
these belts and it helps with your
buoyancy you're not fighting to always
get up you're not fighting to stay down
you're just able to think about what
you're doing I don't know I kind of
freaked out a little bit I was like what
am I need to get to the top I know that
who do you want to be in this photograph
we each kind of like chose a character I
shattered out Aphrodite
what does she love she is passionate and
apparently she's down visiting uncle
Poseidon I just want to be like warrior
strong a little bit sexy show me what
that looks like I don't know
I think this is the first time that I
have ever been under water in clothes it
felt so wrong it felt so weak when
you're in there it's just like all
flowing I'm scared just whatever way my
body goes out to this chill yeah yeah
we're gonna take a few round of just you
get used to this okay
Oh beautiful face really yeah you are
you sure yeah okay how could she go for
broke this day a walk so ready yeah so
pretty but are in it is making it look
easy
yeah but it is not easy you try holding
your breath underwater while looking
sexy and glamorous at the same time
that's gonna not be able debris first I
got your dress is flowing everywhere and
your face is doing things you're trying
not to free as much as you think that
you'd be relaxed like you really have to
like work on those places like you were
pointing your toes and like making sure
your face is there it's really weird to
figure out what to do with your hand the
only thing I would say is watch your
arms no that's it I literally was
thinking that in my head I'd put them
all that I was like ah they were like
you're doing the YMCA sounds like when
it comes to underwater photography you
come so much in tune with your body when
I'm shooting underwater what I'm looking
for is there's a moment and there's a
moment where everything starts to happen
and usually isn't in the beginning of
the session it's usually you know three
ten minutes in we're all so and everyone
starts to kind of get their rhythm
together we're like a symphony
than it is a painting
I think this was a really just like
overall crazy experience I never saw
myself doing this or trying this and
then finding out how hard it was that
being said it was freaking awesome lots
of awesome women cheering each other on
doing something insanely crazy and
fantastic yeah
get to live out their dreams and be the
best version of themselves underwater as
they are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
