know when people say they're going to
begin that means like no fish no eggs
just no anything with the face starting
to look the products that are more
natural that are better for my skin I'm
assuming that's the exact same way with
makeup
hi I'm Mara tea I'm the head of content
and education for a company called the
detox market we specialize in being your
green beauty expert both online with
stories in Los Angeles and Toronto vegan
means no animal products beauty world
that typically is going to mean he's wax
carmine lanolin gelatin collagen okay so
here's what I use pretty much every day
I love to know what's going on yeah
definitely what I'm seeing in your bag
is that you need to be camera-ready most
of the time is they're all priests oh
yeah I need to be blurred guys this is
not a filter one thing to preface what
we look in your makeup bag is women put
on average 12 products today on their
bodies
from the green Beauty world there's two
different bunny certification the bunny
with the ear this way is the PETA
certification and if anything bunny
which is actually a lot stricter those
are telling you that those products are
cruelty free but happen it has nothing
to do with whether they're vegan is
there like a symbol for vegan on mega
products or not there isn't no so we are
interested in research if you were gonna
give me a recommendation on something
that wasn't like a natural foundation
what shouldn't be in a natural
foundation my biggest ones are parabens
they can mimic estrogen not so great for
our body so the columns not because they
will make you sick but because they are
terrible for our skin I'm excited to get
you some swaps and see how you'll a day
you know what coming to the natural side
extending so just it means where she has
I'm going to use the staff of the
foundation this is their hair coverage
foundation and a great TV so it's
actually court already putting
consistency with that one I'm gonna do
this mix all over just to give you a
nice light market or without a whole
face of vegan makeup and to my utter
surprise vegan makeup is super super
accessible learning all these amazing
new things of all these different brands
but give you responsible options for
your choices and me we finally got in
our contouring and our highlight which
came in yesterday so we're starting the
day off fresh with the new routine a
while share everything kinda in the
right place I'm so used to like
contouring with powder I've never done
it with a liquid laser the parts of the
animal
it could be anything from needle-like
remnants to make like the color red but
could be live beautiful by your lips no
like rush of a beetle to get
segmentation in color is day 4 and I
want to say it's like 4 o'clock right
now and I'm just continuously struggling
with the coverage of vegan makeup so
shiny and places that literally
typically won't be shiny at this one
today I miss my old Potter were you
added we're you the one thing I will say
about this week vegan makeup has a ways
to go when it comes to creating
foundation and concealer colors for
women of color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
