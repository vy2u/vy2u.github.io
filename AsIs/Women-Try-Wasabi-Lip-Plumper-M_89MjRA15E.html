lips for some reason why am i doing my
bottom lip tends to look a lot fuller
than my top lip it would be kind of nice
if I could find something to sort of
even them out a little more I feel
pretty good about my lips and I would
say if I had like a problem area of my
face it would probably not be my lips I
love my lips I think they're I'm a small
but they get the job done
I think the wasabi on my lips is going
to burn like hell and maybe make them
red I have very sensitive skin so I'm
nervous so I'm gonna be a little baby
and go slowly and do a little dab and
see how I feel all right
do this this is unnatural
it's definitely already tingling ow I
can like oh geez I can like feel it
burning in the little areas where I
sometimes pick up my skin oh no it's
things oh it stings a dessert I'm
leaving it on because I know I have to
but I'm really upset about it Oh like
how much did you just like completely
lose feeling of your lips and know that
that's when you stop putting it on and
I'm just kind of wondering like how many
times a day do you have to do this to
sustain that plump lip like how long
does it last
I don't know just wait for my lips took
up pull out
young girl this isn't fun I have to pass
okay that's that I'm kind of into the
feeling now it's weird it's like a light
sensation a burning sensation that like
makes me feel alive I was like am i
doing SH and off on my mouth yeah I feel
like my lips look bigger
I can definitely like feel there's like
a plumpness when I call my lips together
I think it worked my top lip kind of
looks like it was stung but like in a
sexy way I'm underwhelmed I don't think
I would do it again most of these things
these beauty trends are just about the
woman and how it makes her feel so if
this makes you feel good
then do it was it worth it I don't know
talk to me in an hour and see if
anyone's notice my new luxurious lips
and then I'll get back to you too hot
for my lips to take and I'm not trying
to be looking crazy out here in these
streets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
