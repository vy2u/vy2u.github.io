high we're gonna put marijuana inside
our lady parts to see if it helps with
period pain we go through a lot of
man yeah a period suck I got my period
when I was 13 years old almost
immediately I had really bad cramps
where it feels like someone is punching
you in the uterus and like a lot of
girls you know before I ever had sex or
thought about having sex I was on birth
control for my period cramps I just take
motrin 1012 pills that's what it takes
to relieve the pain the things we have
in our medicine cabinet are dangers and
we don't think of them as drugs but
there's their drugs I'm really excited
to see what how does it work from the
inside yeah I get it what I imagined it
like it's in and then
think about boy oh that's so cool is
that this you know prevents the need for
higher-level narcotic prescription drugs
which then leads to higher incidence of
addiction this is not a lead tampon it
is a cannabis based product in the form
of a suppository that dissolves with the
heat of your body this isn't a quick fix
but it works it is not what I expected
probably super gentle to put in right
it's cocoa butter what could go wrong
just trying to put myself out the door
again it broke so I put half of it in
and then I just put a tampon in with it
to like stick it all the way up
suppository is in TM i as a fibromyalgia
patient I feel like nothing relaxes my
muscles like THC and CBD so I'm excited
talking to my patients their biggest
concern is how am I gonna work how am I
gonna you know K take care of my kids
and that's what's so cool about the
forea is that you do not get high it's
been a couple of hours
I don't feel still don't feel numb it's
been almost five hours since I did it
I'm just feeling relaxed and tired but
not high I'm debating if I should put
the other half in I don't know how to
get the other half in I don't even feel
that dull throbbing pain like when you
take something and it takes that like
top level pain away but that bottom
level pain still remains I don't feel
that at all you know it kind of feels
like I took an advil you did it we did
it well some of us did it I do have a
confession to make I didn't put the
other half in there hate it
whoo you guys don't do it they're not
for eating they're really really really
strong cooking so I followed the rules I
had no issues I was clear-headed and I
think if you're a mother and you're
worried about maybe trying it but you do
suffer from cramps I say go for it I
think that this is an awesome product I
think that we should be able to study
the effects of THC on all different
parts of our body so the fact that
someone has been innovative and is using
it for women's health I think it's super
cool I'm always down to try new things
to help the pain I'm really excited that
somebody thought about this and cared
enough to invent it to try to help women
have less menstrual pain half of it up
the new hot is definitely not going to
ask you out so start small</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
