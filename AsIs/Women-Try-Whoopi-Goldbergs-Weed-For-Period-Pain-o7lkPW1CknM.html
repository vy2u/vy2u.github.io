clinched up and I was in so much pain I
was screaming at the top of my lungs
finally someone found me I went to the
hospital and they said you have period
cramps like take Advil
hi my name is Sam and I have PMDD which
stands for a premenstrual dysphoric
disorder I'm Laura and I have
endometriosis biggest symptoms that I
suffer from the most are mood swings I
can go from zero to what blackout angry
in a second being in pain every day
really takes a toll on you the most
powerful change in public opinion in the
past couple of years when it comes to
cannabis has been children with seizures
sadly period pain is not that obvious
of a problem it's something that women
suffer from you know usually alone and
quietly if there is a product out there
that can change that then hell yeah I'm
going to try it I'll try anything
hey thank you so much for joining us
today first of all we're just wondering
like what inspired you and Maya to
create these products
raku Grande High Times and he was
telling me about all of the people who
have gotten into marijuana face and I
said is anybody doing anything
intellectual crafts and he kind of went
no and I went really
mr. Dow it's a niche market hmm it's a
niche market that has half the
population we're still doing this kind
of socking you know if a guy had these
clamps but I had this issue there would
be all kinds of out there crap this
was done in order to find a way to
relieve cramps so please try and if the
worst do you tell a friend if it doesn't
work for you not to worry we'll continue
to try to create something that may so
I'm about to start using the Whoopi and
Maya products I'm not looking to get
high just looking for some sweet relief
it's not doing anything yet still feel
like my uterus is trying to murder me
I only truly wish that you could smell
this through the camera because the
smell is so good I've had it on for a
while now
and it feels amazing it's hard to
explain it's like this warm heat all
over my abdomen which of course when you
have cramps is like all you can hope for
is like a built-in heating pad day 2 of
using the products I took like a
tablespoon of the chocolate and with
PMSing pretty bad and I went clothes
shopping on days where I usually just
want to like sit on my couch eat ice
cream and watch Titanic while I sob
silently into a pillow
I bought crop tops that feels like a
victory to me I just finished the bath
truly it was an amazing experience
all the bloated feeling and the
pain just kind of melt away it makes you
hella comfortable which is pretty much
all you can ask for when you have a
really bad period I used the tincture
today and just did a couple drops in my
coffee so it was a little rough I had
like a like one kind of outburst but
again like only one outburst compared to
like what I can usually do is pretty
solid for me these products allowed me
to exist clearly while helping me
maintain emotions that I do want to feel
if you have endometriosis and you're
struggling like I am every month I would
absolutely recommend that you try this I
think many women would agree that
they're willing to try almost anything
to get the pain way
