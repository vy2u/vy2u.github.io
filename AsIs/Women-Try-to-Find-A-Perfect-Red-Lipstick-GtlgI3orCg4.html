and loudmouth grandmothers red lipstick
or any lipstick looks horrible on me I
feel like my mouth is saying too much
even if I'm not talking when I have one
red lipstick my relationship to lip
sticks is I'll wear them here and there
but it's not something that I tend to do
all the time because I feel like it's
too much of an attention rather I kind
of like controlling the attention I get
like I want to be able to say oh I'm
okay with it and then okay I don't want
any more of it up until recently I
didn't even wear lipsticks and when I do
I only weigh like dark blues like dark
greens so looking at Red's is definitely
gonna push me out of my comfort zone
wait I'm picking this Mac cuz it's deep
and I like I like that red anything
between red and brown so kind of the
burgundy scale I think is great pick the
color pop one just because it's not as
red as the other one so I want to just
have a little step in first and try a
little kind of coral kind of color I
think I'm gonna go with the one that I
think isn't gonna look good first
oh so dark mmm is this move it's a
smooth operator it's feeling really rich
but there's like no pigmentation yeah a
lip gloss and it's really gloppy
honestly it's not bad at all
you look sexy as this is what I go
for a nice little cute Burgundy I guess
if I was gonna wear some type of long
ago it would have to be this color I
feel like if I hold the mirror really
far away I'm not that mad at it but if I
could like actually see my face I'm
horrified I just think the pigment isn't
there I'm also I think realizing that
I'm more of a matte lipstick person and
not really into this like shiny gloss I
usually go for dark so it would be nice
to find something that's a little bit
lighter but still fits with my
complexion I'm gonna try the color pop
first because I think it's it's the
cheaper out of the two I'm going to try
this covergirl matte lipstick in crimson
Kat I'm going to try it because when I
usually buy lipsticks I buy rather
expensive ones because I know I'm gonna
wear the out of them okay I like it
it's not a color for me though yeah no
I'm mad at this one yeah yeah yeah
that's good I feel like this isn't bad
at all I feel like if you like lipsticks
yeah likes good in stick form I feel
like this is a really great contender
oh you can already tell I'm gonna like
this that's beautiful Oh where are you
intimidating for me
I know it's too much for you but it's
really good no it's good with your blog
it's my mom Street here come on love
realistic and she like to thank you all
right I don't I don't hate it
what's up meeting like it's just like
meeting not you to it I even to it maybe
I'll like it
growing up I feel like I always heard
things randomly we would be like Oh
black women don't wear red lipstick and
I feel like this Kat Von D kind of puts
that Touche texture-wise it's nice it
kind of has almost like a buttery like a
thick butter feeling I don't like these
sparkles I'd be okay with the color
I'm the sparkles are just killing me
does it look good let's see oh my god
yes really yes you look like you just
stepped out of like the 1950's olive oil
wow this is a nice red I like that it's
so pigmented it looks just like one
Queen layered I really like this
the two that I tried were two really
good things for what they were like in
their own categories like this was a
great lipstick as it was still super
pigmented and it felt like really nice
and satiny I feel like with anything
always revisit so if there's something
that you're like oh I don't look good we
have lipstick or oh I can't do a cat eye
like revisit it because if someone else
can rock it you can definitely rock it
and I feel like in the air we live in
now there are so many shades of red I
think that the stigma that dark-skinned
women or black women or whomever can't
wear them is garbage and I think it's
just all about finding the thing that
works for you which is kind of the truth
in life like not everything works for
everyone just find what works for you
and that's all that matters
I've always wanted to try it I just
never done it because I thought I look
horrible but now I feel a little more
encouraged so yeah I think maybe I'll
all start with like a lighter red not
like super vibrant for like a little
faded red and then maybe I'll like ease
my way into it but I think in the future
I'm gonna see if it's going
