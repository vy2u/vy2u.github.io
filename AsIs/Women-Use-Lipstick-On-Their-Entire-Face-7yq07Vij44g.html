just start off with foundation I'm gonna
mix these two colors together because I
feel like this is too ashy for me and I
feel like this is too red for me I feel
like now I'm just going for a
monochromatic it's not giving me
coverage though I look crazy fifty
shades of purple you know what it is I
look kind of dead this is like the
makeup that they give black people when
they die where you know you don't say
 away dark

need to blend you I'm blending uh I feel
like I look like a Oompa Loompa I don't
