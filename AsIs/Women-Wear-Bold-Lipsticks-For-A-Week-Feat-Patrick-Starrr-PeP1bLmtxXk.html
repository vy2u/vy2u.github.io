little mistake and look at that this is
definitely not today hi I'm jasmine and
as you may know I am obsessed with
lipstick I always hear people saying oh
I can't pull this off oh I can't wear
that
but honestly anybody can wear anything
so I've decided to challenge three of my
co-workers to wear bold lipsticks for
the week just to let them know that they
can rock it too so let's go see if they
can do it I'm a fan of lipstick I really
really love it on me no way
like I feel weird having too much
moisturizer on my skin let alone bright
colors
I wear lipstick every now and then I'm
nervous because I feel like a lot of
attention is going to be drawn to my
face and I don't want that it's gonna be
really hard for the first few days to
just show up and this looks color but
I'm hoping that I'll just get used to it
and I'll just walk in the room like yeah
I'm wearing blue like you
hey girls my name is Patrick Starr I'm a
makeup artist
and youtuber and I'm gonna teach these
girls how to rock a boat Ashley thank
you so much for gracing us oh my gosh
thank you are you guys ready I'm so
excited so what got you into
experimenting with bold looks I just
want to stand out I want to get notice
but you know I'm still single but it
doesn't matter I still look good you
know someone like me I don't win any
makeup okay if that changes today that
wasn't part of the deal so before we
start this do you have any final tips or
anything else about like how we can rock
this I get it don't be scared
and I remember shopping in like the mall
and nothing fit me and then it clicked
to me and I came up with the phrase
makeup is a one size fits all I know you
got this you got this I trust you
I trust you I'm very much over today my
water bottle is completely ruined I'm
not mad at the color though it looks
good the black made me feel like I just
didn't give a about anything like I
felt like I could do anything I felt
awesome in it the only problem with the
black one from you is that it faded so
quickly it comes off super easily and it
looks really really bad when it does so
I'm gonna reapply round to tail you
could not unsee the teal only a few more
hours of this but it's only eight one
okay day two and my color is green okay
I missed the block but I actually think
this a sort of thing it does go with my
pings it goes with the black I feel like
a mermaid there's a lot of happening on
my face today and I'm not sure you know
everyone says that the colors that I've
been wearing I've looked really good on
me I just think it's something that I
have to get used to so and a day - no
one's commented on my lipstick
expected a lot of commentary like mostly
like whoa kind of refreshing that people
are just like yeah today's color I'm not
mad at I actually really like it I just
wish it was a little bit more sunny but
maybe I'll brighten people's day up with
this pop of color I really loved the
black let's take that was I was just the
bomb and I had my leather jacket on and
everywhere it gives you the illusion of
being more confident than you actually
are
this feels like I'm a state color I like
it I think it's very vague patient shape
so it's not totally my vibe it
definitely feels like something an older
woman would wear till I try to be hip so
today's color is very nice it's not as
bright a little bit more neutral and I
definitely wait right so today I'm
supposed to be wearing bright pink but I
have this important meeting with people
in the New York office who I've never
met before and I decided to put on this
color instead it made me a little
uncomfortable to be wearing like this
super super hot pink at this meeting
you know what I am glad I didn't wear
this during my meeting it is very
intense
I feel a little bit like a clown but
like a hip-hop clown so I'm into it I
don't know about this one I tried to
match it with my outfit but I feel like
it's me very much like lipstick but my
favorite part of the day is taking it
off it's like the bra of my life right
now so today is the last day we wear
lipstick this is probably my favorite
lip color very bold but also at the same
time not like too crazy and not neon
like all the other colors we've been
wearing so today's color is another
shade of blue it's like also sort of
faded like what it goes to look like
first impressions were you know it's a
very bright color maybe not for me but
you do you do you hate it I don't hate
it
I just anywhere
I won't live yeah it's so different
you're not fired I didn't think I looked
good partly I wore bold lipstick colors
for a week and I felt awesome
I fell unique I really love lipstick
it's awesome I think I'll wear lipsticks
when I go out I definitely think that
this week has helped me be open to the
idea of wearing milder lipsticks and
trying new things when it comes to
makeup I loved them all like every day I
felt confident and I felt excited and I
felt fun and I felt sexy even this sort
of like orange brown color I've never
worn before and I've had it I've had it
for months so now I'm starting to wear
all the colors that I actually have and
have always wanted to wear I didn't
really want to wear lipstick because I
don't stand out more than I already do
but why the not if you're nervous
about standing out you're probably
hanging out with the wrong people so
drop them and do whatever you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
