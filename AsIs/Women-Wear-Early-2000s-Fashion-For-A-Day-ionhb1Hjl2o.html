remember being in middle school and just
how that was such an awkward time I was
in middle school and it was very angsty
and discovering who I was as a person I
think is like all the horrible tracksuit
bottoms think of my favorite music early
Destiny's Child
JLo Ashanti ja Rule my favorite era of
music to this day so there was a lot of
like questionable fashion choices the
celebrity that I looked up to in the
early 2000s was our Lavigne because she
was this super fierce and edgy girl the
first CD that I ever had in my life was
a JLo CD and I was obsessed with it and
I was obsessed with her what I was
wearing in the early 2000 I wouldn't
necessarily call fashion but I think I
saw people like Gwen Stefani was like oh
my god she's so cool okay let's do it
when I was putting on these clothes I
was laughing these are some crazy bold
choices I didn't think I could pull this
off and it actually doesn't look that
bad so I feel like a bad feeling really
nervous this is a lot more skin that I'm
used to showing every new item I was
like up I guess this is going on my body
okay so let's rock and roll and stuff
right when I saw you like JLo at the
beginning I was definitely feeling
really self-conscious well as the day
went on I just kind of like I was like
this is what I'm wearing for the next
two hours and that's it good
only one person knew I was a virile I
think that most people just thought I
was dressing like a tomboy these are
lovely a problem afro tumblr absolutely
Carol Levine yeah no no that is I know
Apple man they were like oh this is a
cool new look I'm about to walk into my
meeting dressed like this
hi hi some are changing up your luck
yeah people were shocked and
disappointed in me yeah but I enjoyed
that
I have pinions and concerns about to
walk into the other office right now and
I'm a little nervous about what my team
is going to think I feel like I should
be hating more when I'm with you I'm
just sleeping on camera you look like a
chola from my neighbor's all the things
on that new yeah I see that time and I
see those expose boxers it actually made
me realize that I would like to dress a
little masculine what the hell am I
looking at
I think obviously this is not
appropriate workplace attire it's just
weird to see during a bikini top over
your outfit don't very sexual but also
very badass so I'm like very confuse
your faces nights and Vicky's so like I
don't know what's going on it's like
Folsom and then down there I'm like one
thing I did notice is that fashion has
really changed yeah this era was prime
Square so funny
in the flesh oh my goodness when that
was a lot better than I expected people
didn't seem to have the reactions I
thought they would I love that JLo I
don't have to be completely dressed the
way I normally would to still feel like
myself who to still be confident I feel
like a lot of the trends in the early
2000 cesare not necessarily something
we'd be wanting to wear today but it's
so fun I might feel like JLo tomorrow
when I'm wearing my own clothes and it's
something that makes me more comfortable
tis what made her comfortable and made
her feel sexy if I find the perfect
outfit for me then I can feel more like
JLo every time I need to wash my hands
I'm take this off sweating can be
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
