mom will be mad at you for showing to
other people we're going to be wearing
sexy lingerie this week I don't know
what that means this is my sexy movement
I've been a long-term relationship I
don't need to impress anyone I'm so
nervous about it some of the words that
Devin just used I don't even know what
they mean Jimmie's babydoll hell is that
when I think of the word lingerie
I think French Victoria Secret straps
fashion before function whips LAN trains
like what middle school boys look at at
the Victoria Secret catalog serpentine
is an online boutique that specializes
in lingerie and pole dance clothing I
created it because I wanted to have a
space for women could buy anything from
like a classic bra to a chain-link teddy
and feel totally safe and normal and
excited to do it do you find that women
are on TV oh they're absolutely
intimidated we've really sold on one
kind of way of being sexy so unless you
set some kind of ideal then you know
it's not meant for you Hey ladies
hey I'm Christina and I brought all
these kind of lovely bags goods for you
today before we get into them I wanted
to see if you have any kind of questions
for me do you wear these kind of lacy
underthings on a daily basis I do but
not every single day okay because I'm a
normal human being does any of this have
any sort of like structural um purpose
you're talking about support I think is
what you mean
yeah just like seatbelt situations yeah
absolutely
they'll have structure when you find the
ones that are perfect for you can we go
through the bags
for women who think that lingerie is
uncomfortable I would say to them that
they just haven't found the right
lingerie yet so lingerie isn't just
meant for excite your partner but also
for women to enjoy their own bodies so I
wish you sexy luck this week these are
the rules for the week first day I have
to wear a fancy bra and show it to
everyone just covered in straps I have a
lot of experience showing the internet
my bras so I feel like I'm gonna ace
that one I've never worn a bra that
exposes my nips so it'll be interesting
just knowing that this is what's under
my dress today I like this kind of weird
dominatrix vibe I'm getting I like to be
comfortable but I did find the ball
that's quite comfortable as well as cute
if you like the bra let's and I may have
an understanding day two is sexy panty
day sexy panty day so I'm mmm let's just
hope the sexy panties aren't insane so
these are the underwear I'm supposed to
wear today what do you think
I don't even know where to begin there
are a few things that are attached to it
I don't totally understand what they do
but overall it's actually not that
uncomfortable it was totally fine and it
was kind of fun having a secret
I said fancy panty and Jen just stuck
her little head out like what's up they
look like normal panties until you
realize that this hole is for your butt
cheek thing about assless underwear is
whenever you're sitting on a chair and
you're wearing a dress you're very aware
that you're sitting on a chair it's only
the second day of this whole lingerie
experience and it's already giving me a
totally different outlook on just
dressing sexy for myself the third day
I'm gonna wear my lingerie to bed I've
actually recently been looking for
little nightie s to wear so this is
actually pretty easy breezy this feels
very like minimalist and very light it's
very very thin
cute I feel like I'm in like the
twenties or something so after a long
day I'm going to be wearing this to bed
what are you doing there's a knitter II
in our apartment I'm team sleep naked um
sorry mom and dad
I feel like I'm just making this worse
here is what I am supposed to sleep in
honestly I think this thing is more fun
to take pictures in than to sleep in is
every time I shift I have to like
rearrange the whole situation day four
is matching set day matching bra and
panty day I'm on board with that
I have on my little see-through bralette
situation and I wore something that can
kind of show it the underwear are really
really interesting they have like a
diamond hole at the crack you mean your
panties what did I say underwear my
panties Oh what's the difference between
through angel which one are you wearing
today this oh I think you fall on saw my
nipple just I'm having a mostly good
time panty is fun it's high-waisted it's
definitely sexy it's giving me a bit of
a panty line weirdly like right at my
navel this was my favorite day here it
is the only matching bra and panty set
I've ever owned I do feel prettier than
I thought I would I know if felt a
little naughty it felt like I was
breaking a little bit of a rule oh I see
this I see the heart I see the heart
it's peaking hello day five is
thigh-high day which is great because
it's July putting these on is so
precarious so far I've learned that
these are a very easy way to feel
dressed up and also very warm but I like
them oh they make a little swish swish
when I walk final day throwing on these
bad boys don't really know what to make
of them but let's do this I think my
least favorite day was probably the
thigh highs I did like them but they
didn't give me as much ba-ba-boom as the
other things did
Hevy channeling time from clueless to
the fullest if I went to lunch and as I
was crossing the street my skirt blew up
with the wind and everyone on the street
could see all of my jelly I wore
lingerie for a week and it was awesome
it was nice just at like have someone
provide things for me based on my
personality and not just on my size I
learned that lingerie can for sure be a
form of self-care and feeling just good
about yourself I think I get lingerie a
little bit more than I used to
I had overall a fun time with a couple
of awkward moments lady testing lady
obsessed with wow that word panty panty
you really have to say that whole word
you can't be like panty panty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
