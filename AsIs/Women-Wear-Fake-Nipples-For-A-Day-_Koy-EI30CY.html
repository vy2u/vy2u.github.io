nipples today I don't know exactly what
the true point like why somebody made
these from what I could see it was
basically trying to go for the whole
braless look let's say these things this
is a pretty cute box
all righty cold feel Hut is it cold in
here you just happy a CV Oh
win over your eggs like but he's my ex I
don't want that guy back
III but what are these things
pearls I love how the aureole I bit is
like a flower
these come in two sizes freezing oh
they're so large and this is cold inhale
nice sweet pendant holy I got a lot
it took like eight attempts I'm feeling
good I'm feeling proud oh I feel a
million times more feminine I'm ready
I'm ready for the day let's free the
nips I'm going with my new nipple check
that oh do you notice anything different
about me I'm wearing like fake nipples
outside of my bra I'm kind of jealous
because I'm kind of sexy and like I'm
like I haven't gone above Oh how's it
look hardened like cardboard for those
blonde they're like pearls or
some
they look natural though good I just
thought you were like free method today
in the outside world walking to lunch
and just one man looked down very very
intently at my nipples I walk past some
guys and they literally like do a triple
take at my nipples almost seems like
it's like asserting that like yeah you
can show your nipples but only if they
look like that
like why can't I just have my room like
I just want my real nipples like this is
an impostor nipple do you know anything
different about you pervs look huge it
is just like choking up there and they
looking really round right and amazing I
just sent a picture to my boyfriend and
all he sent back with all caps I can't
see boring after a long hard day in
the office can't wait to take my nipples
off
my day was adorable day literally no one
really cared I personally felt more
confident like here's my nipple makes
complete sense if you are trans have had
breast surgery or reconstructive surgery
or you want to accentuate the nipples
that you have and you're making that
executive decision that this is for you
in order to feel genuinely yourself I
would have maybe felt more free and
feminine and myself just wearing my own
nipples but maybe that's nipple
privilege as I have them the sexiest
thing is being confident in yourself and
rocking it so go out wear a bra don't if
you have boobs cool if you don't that's
fine to show them don't it doesn't
matter as long as you feel confident and
you feel sexy then do you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
