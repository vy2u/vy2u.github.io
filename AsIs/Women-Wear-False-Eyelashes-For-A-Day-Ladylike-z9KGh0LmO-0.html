really good
Freddie Chantel and Sofia recently did a
video where they wore Instagram makeup
for a week and they looked beautiful
every day they did they look lovely but
we did notice that a key feature of
Instagram makeup was something called
false eyelashes when you're gonna get
fancy they really like up the ante Devin
and I are like trying to up our game
makeup wise in order for us to level up
makeup wise we have to pick a skill and
we have to get good at it all we need
for today to be a success is one
compliment and a lot of heart
there's all this like rose gold and it
says these policies are going to be the
signature to my masterpiece these fall
so you seem pretty thin and pretty
delicate measure trim by placing the
lash on the eyes leaving about a point
five to one centimeter gap from the
inner corner of your eyes this would be
a really good time to actually know what
a centimeter of looks like I'm supposed
to trim this so that it fits my eye the
glue apparently goes on white but it
dries clear so you're supposed to wait
before you actually try to put these on
so the glue can get a bit tacky I'm
gonna put this sucker on BAM what a.m.
here we go whoa your eyes your eyes be
poppin is that it did I just do this in
one time the one take these are really
easy second lash let's do it I'm feeling
confident I'm feeling strong I have it
on it's all right
I mean I'm sure someone who's a
professional could definitely do this
better than I could but yeah they look
great I am very aware that I have fake
eyelashes on like I can feel them but
they don't weigh down my eyelid which is
good
I just finished shooting with Jen and
I'm walking back to my desk when a
surprised the rest of the girls and
ladylike with my fake eyelashes how do
you think they look did I do the right I
think I look pretty you're like an
expert after that Instagram makeup I am
NOT an expert my corneas have been if
not scratched at least tickled after
that my concern is that the fake
eyelashes are going to fall off they do
feel a little bit loose now that I'm out
in the wind Devin's bangs disguise her
so a little bit whereas yours are just
really out here oh you got lashes on are
they easy to put on yeah surprisingly so
45 minutes in your assessment is that
they're pulling your skin a little bit I
feel like maybe I should have snipped
them a little bit more what are you
doing tonight with your lashes I'm going
to Home Depot I'm trying to return this
orchid so I'm gonna try to use my
eyelashes I'm gonna bat my eyelashes and
see if that gets me the orchid that I
deserve Stephen do you like my eyelash
whoa I just noticed that I've been with
you all night I mm yeah so that means
they were put on seamlessly it's not
really you but maybe it could become you
it worked I get to choose a new orchid
some random girl told me I look cute
which was nice I was like oh something
thinks I'm cute I'm about to take off
these fake eyelashes and as you can see
they're already starting to like peel at
the top general consensus and false
eyelashes is I actually do like the way
they look I'm excited to have this skill
in my repertoire maybe for fancy night
I'm not gonna lie to you that felt
really good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
