that's the way she doesn't show them
like something every friend knows their
friends fake like oh so as of right now
my vision is pretty much perfect but
both of my parents were glasses so I
anticipate it's probably in my near
future so when I was in second grade oh
boy my class who I will not name holy
that I look ugly with the glasses cuz it
widened my already big head honestly
ever since then I have been very against
glasses I think that my eyes are my best
feature
of my face but on the one hand staring
at a screen every day I have noticed a
significant deterioration in my eyesight
realistically at some point I will
probably need to get glasses so I think
I'm about to become hipster trash and
wear these every single day these are
very old man glasses to me but I like
them like I feel like that's like a vibe
that's kind of coming back reminds me of
my dad's class it's oh I feel like my
mother maybe I can make mom in now I
don't want to try that let's take it one
step at a time I look like a turtle I I
expected to like these a little bit more
on I feel like they feel really good on
they're kind of big however I need your
opinion on something so I I said no to
these I think they look like I'm in a
lab right right right I initially picked
these because they reminded me of
Malcolm X and also the 1950s I love that
era of style I find these to be pretty
flattering here's pair number one what
do you think that's enough they do
make my eyes look huge I also think they
make it look like my face is melting a
little bit but I'm not really against
that I don't know maybe it's kind of
trendy I just don't know I feel like
this is throwing my world for a loo
think that this this pair is gonna be my
pair so we're doing these
so we're just finished getting ready for
the morning and now to throw on my final
accessory father cute I like them okay
I've done my makeup
he's gonna and see it in like
that glare of my glasses I think I'm
gonna pick a wig that men you know mixes
with these the best okay no this hugs
too much and I feel kind of trapped yeah
I think this is kind of cute I don't
know I feel about these I feel like they
widen my already wide head actually the
kid in second grade called today was a
Fathead
remember that now talking all about it
yesterday I'm glad it doesn't clash with
the rest of my look but I wonder how
people wear glasses every day coordinate
them with their outfits
maybe you just need to get like ten
pairs of glasses what do you think of my
glasses I think you would look great
with glasses but these are too big for
your face when he came up to me he said
I don't like I don't like these glasses
okay
I think they distract from your
beautiful eyes my beautiful eyes my best
so this is one thing I don't like about
the glasses you know making my instant
coffee and then you go to drink do you
see this this is what happens when you
make coffee do you usually wear glasses
no I do not I'm trying them out as a
glasses-wearing person what do you think
they look nice yeah yeah I like I'm
Sookie I think make sure you yes
you know what I think deep down your
soul your glasses yeah like your soul
reads like an you know knowledgeable
intelligent and this is like matching it
a fly flew into the inside of my glasses
a little while ago and if that isn't a
sign that I shouldn't wear glasses then
I don't know it is yeah like um yeah
yeah do you like I don't know I feel
like I would like to see a few different
frames on you though you look adorable
this glass is a great it was ready to go
to like law school or something you
think I bullies off
yeah you look intellectual shucks almost
like a librarian great that's the vibe
I'm going for so they're getting really
dirty
is one thing that I've noticed that I
don't like I think it's because just LA
in general is dirty but when I walk to
the office there's just like schmutz
Onam I was just complaining to my friend
Liza who is a veteran wearing glasses
about how they're so dirty and obtrusive
and she whips out this miracle juice
what do you think of me with glasses in
general I think you could saw off the
backs of two coke cans and put them over
your eyes and you look good so nice I
just don't really like being encumbered
I don't really like having a whole lot
on my face like my nose are and is
pretty much the only thing right well
regularly on my face and I can't even
feel it so I think I'd be more into
glasses if you couldn't feel it I went
in hoping that this would change my mind
and I don't think it did I think if when
the time comes for me to have to get
some sort of I help glasses maybe like a
sometimes thing but I would definitely
not wear glasses on the daily here's the
thing I still wouldn't consider getting
real glasses because at the end of the
day I just don't trust myself to not
 you're gonna lose I'll miss the
thing yeah like they look cute but don't
it's like me don't get nice ones cuz
they're gone even on even on adderall I
still feel like I are disease but I
would consider wearing them
fashion thing yeah I think they're super
cute um and I feel more ballsy doing
that now that my wear wigs it's like
what's a pair of glasses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
