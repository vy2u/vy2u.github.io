people are probably gonna think I'm a
little kooky or offbeat but I'm gonna
welcome it I didn't realize that there
were so many different types of God I'm
excited to be a pastel goth because it's
like kind of the cute goth
I chose cybergoth because it seemed the
craziest out of all of them it seemed
like really intense Morticia Addams you
have to be like a certain caliber of
cool to pull this off I don't really
think they're worried about other people
I mean that's cool about being goth is
it so DIY this is so crazy
I'm putting yarn in my hair on other
people I don't mind it we'll see how I
feel about it on myself I never imagined
myself as full-on Morticia until right
now and I feel it in my bones and I'm so
into it I kind of like how its badass
yet romantic and like kind of like
feminine and kind of sexy I don't feel
like myself at all I feel like I need to
have a new name I love my look I feel
like evil Katy Perry this is crazy this
is so unlike anything I've ever done I
feel so great my boobs are made of
leather it's been like six hours I can't
really breathe right now
so I might need to make a wardrobe
change and then of you our plan for the
week I really want to focus on this is
gonna be like an idol people don't take
God seriously meeting
is what I've learned I felt like I was a
different person and I didn't feel like
Alison was like embarrassed or weirded
out about being that person like I just
was someone else
so overheard someone say they're afraid
no she's cute but I feel like it was I
Cassie it wasn't a bad experience it was
kind of cool to just be sort of a
different person these people have just
been like consciously looking away from
me
it's kind of cool kind of weird I don't
know how I feel about it
some people were amused some people just
tried their best to ignore everything
that was happening and look like just
into my eyes and some people like we're
too scared to even look at me it was a
lot of time and effort - a lot of makeup
had on the shirt and then a skirt and
then stockings and then shoes and then a
cake I feel like you have to really love
God to be God I've thoroughly enjoyed
the outfit I thoroughly enjoyed the
getup I thoroughly enjoyed the effect
that I had on other people my mom would
say Oh like that's exactly what she
would say a lot of people when they saw
me at work they're like this is you this
is who you are I'm like I know this is
my soul so it was kind of cool to tap
into that I give so much respect to
these people who can dress like this and
get to be they're a hundred percent true
selves which is really cool I think that
goth me is like the most evolved version
of me like right now I am squirtle and
goth me is Blastoise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
