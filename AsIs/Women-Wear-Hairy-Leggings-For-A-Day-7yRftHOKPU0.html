like the patterns are a little different
it's a fun choice for a Tuesday so today
I'm trying hairy leggings cuz that's the
thing now I don't shave my legs just
because I don't show my legs it's
already hot as hell outside and I could
just grow up my leg hairs instead of
wearing an extra layer of clothing in
this heat I think this is something that
I'd totally wear during Halloween just
to be funny it'll be interesting to see
how I feel having really hairy legs
today I'm ready whoo ah these are very
interesting okay this is like my dad's
leg hair sorry dad and just as I
suspected they only come in white person
colors yay yay for me this is great this
is actually not as bad as I was
expecting I was kind of anticipating
that I would look like a monkey today
they're like spirals like my hair on my
head so I'm excited to have have the
bottom match the top I'm in the world
with my lady I kind of wish we've had a
real hair on them weather sticky little
hair I think that would be more
effective how beautiful in my little is
abstain that's disgusting
wait think about my leggings they're
kind of confusing like it almost looks
like it's like a spider web I think that
it's great it's like it could just be
like summer
so we'd like a little left asshole this
is my damn leg is this supposed to be
hair it is I feel like the hair is
scattered unnaturally your hairy
leggings what do you think honey it
looks like someone doodle all over you
like a toddler took your leggings and
put pen they could be the latest
Lululemon you see this this is an
accuracy if the thighs hairy the but
should be hairy and I know because mine
does too
do they give you like a few the feeling
is nausea its end in leg hair which is
horrifying
like if you came what I'm saying like
that would give a I like the latest
look like normal leggings to me Ben and
I are gonna go get coffee and I'm taking
these bad boys into the outside world
you got a little marble leg yeah
my I'm supposed to be hairy Bethany
little Emma
okay back it's like a weird like light
pink white lady new thing is the same
reason that those same colored tights
don't work on black ballerinas really
cute he's got a mom I've got him on
Nyla's judging us my main conclusion of
this experiment has been if you want
hairy legs just grow it your light hair
you know if you want really Airy legs
add some fur on top of your legs because
this does not look like hairy legs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
