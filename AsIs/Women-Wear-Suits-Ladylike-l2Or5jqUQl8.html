Parker was still wearing Blazers with
little fabric flowers on the lapel so it
was a while ago power suits we see them
on Wall Street in DC and in some
boardrooms in Hollywood but it's not
everyday we see them on people like us
unless it's like an interview or like a
wake or something but why is that can a
jacket and pants make us feel powerful
its ladylike and today we're meeting
with Tony and Leon from Sharpe sitting
to suit up and boss out the first custom
tailored suit that I ever had was
amazing I felt finally I could be taken
seriously and I knew that this is
something that I wanted to bring to
women as well as my community I see from
some of our customers a kind of
empowerment that it gives them when they
wear something that fits their identity
and sort of just claims who they are to
the world by what they're wearing the
fit and the cut are most important it
needs to fit around the shoulders and
you want to make sure that it fits
around the seat another big important
thing to focus on is definitely the
color because even if something fits
really great if you were maybe
apprehensive about the color of it it
could still sway your confidence if a
man can feel sexy and empowered in a
suit then a woman should be able to feel
that way as well and that's what we're
here for this is my jacket see my mom
bought this jacket for me from like
anthropology it's like a beautiful cross
section of I'm a weather caster and also
I'm about to marry the King of England I
actually really like this suit I feel
like Olivia Pope but I can't move around
in this suit I'm not feeling mobile in
this suit this jacket I got on sale from
Nordstrom probably senior year of
college think I got it cuz I was like
I'm gonna probably maybe be working in
like an office or something I don't own
any suit pieces none zero I tried to
find anything that would even resemble a
suit and like it wasn't even close I
just I just don't own anything like that
if I'm gonna go out I'm gonna wear like
a wrap dress a pair of heels and like
that's my armor hey Kristin
one thing that you would want to focus
on is probably a shorter cut I think
sort of emphasizing your top half and
just the way that you do with dresses
sort of letting that hang I think is a
really good fit for you yeah this 3/4
 is not working for you you are
tall and you're sexy and you want to
feel empowered with that you want to
find shoulders that end at right at the
shoulder endpoint not too far out so
just focus on making the fit perfect up
here and it's gonna look nice it won't
look so boxy the concern is that you
want more flexibility you want to be
able to move more I think the jacket is
great or maybe just finding a pair of
pens that will compliment you could wear
something that's very skinny that has
stretch so not only will it make you
move around it's not fussy it makes you
feel empowered but makes you look like
Rihanna
yeah I really really like this jacket
I'm looking for pants that are kind of
in like a similar fabric I guess first
of all you'll want to find pants that
have the material that matches your
jacket I would recommend a crepe wool
with a high waist band and that's fitted
right here and you're gonna have it kind
of hug your curves and then go straight
down go by yeah hey let's do it we're at
the mall and we're gonna go suit
shopping it's gonna be friggin awesome
for our awesome buys I think I'm a
culprit of definitely like having a lot
of things to mix and match Rob have been
having like a few good pieces Oh Freddy
and stuff got distracted by the chokers
and Claire's chokers I mean but chokers
though I get it I know we're supposed to
get fancy but look at this bad boy
skirt just all right I'm gonna look
online for some suits cuz it's gonna be
much easier for me to find a suit on the
internet then in a store I mean I have a
feeling there's like a whole world of
suiting options out there that I have
completely ignored up to this point
there's a cool outfit
it's not in my eye very long limbs and
just a lemming person and so I hope that
I can find a blazer that makes me feel
sleek but also like cut me in the right
way I am reaching the juncture that
every woman reaches when she goes
shopping which is I'm gonna have to buy
a size that's bigger than I normally
wear I'm a long human I think I've been
to it I think I might get it I think
this may be it
I want something that fits really nice
but also I can move around in and be
mobile I think I'm gonna go with these
pants I think they're a little
but they do taper at the ankles I
definitely have commitment anxiety about
like spending a lot of money on a good
suit I love it these are fun I love a
wide leg
you look very businessí do you feel
powerful though that's the whole point
you accepted her
I think we're gonna do a tuxedo yeah if
you told me that I was gonna be buying a
tuxedo for myself like three months
before my wedding I would have been like
yeah that kind of sounds like something
wacky I would get into we got all our
items s made it and you look cool
oh thanks babe you look you look hot I
got my whole suit on power suit in the
park looks great I mean it got me to
dress up Tyler doesn't usually dress up
when we hang out but I made him put on a
button-down and like some actual pants
and we went to the mall I felt very much
like Miranda from Sex in the City dating
Steve you know cuz Steve's kind of got
the kind of like on the go like springy
guy he's wearing his jeans and he's like
dad shoes and Maran is like coming out
you know from the office from her law
firm like hot Steve what could go wrong
being not at an office in a suit gives
you an air of you were just at an office
so I think I felt like oh well I was
just somewhere very important so so I
wore my pant suit to work I had two
really really big shoots out there that
I was directing and shooting and
producing and I felt amazing it
literally looked over and I saw Fred in
her outfit and was just like she's in
charge I definitely think there was a
boost in my confidence when I was
wearing my pants at onset so where she
our engagement photos and I am wearing a
suit with a little bra and actually I
was gonna wear an alternate outfit to
change into but this actually is pretty
crude working early on yeah plus you can
see my boobs yeah I like that okay
literally 15 minutes ago I got my
engagement photos back holy
they're so cool I just felt more
powerful
I felt like cool I felt like that cool
woman who might be designing things for
like Vogue or diet Vogue or some other
you know but I don't I can't think of
any other names of magazine so I'm here
at my Airbnb with my mom and I'm about
to put on my suit to go see Hedwig and
the Angry Inch my mom came to town and
she and I went to go see a friend and a
show and I noticed that being a tall
woman when you wear suit people just
tend to like look at you what do you
think about wearing it without a blouse
underneath I could just kind of wearing
it with fur all that honestly what do
you think well it's not my style
usually I really don't like walking into
a room and having people to eyes on me
because it makes me feel like really
frantic and like I need to perform but
there was something that was like super
calming about wearing a suit it was like
this is who I am
I'm wearing a suit you have to take me
seriously because of the suit I've done
a couple like nods of approval like
and I'm not even wearing a blouse
underneath it we shot the video the day
after the election and honestly I didn't
want to shoot anything that day I didn't
even want to be at work that day none of
us were expecting to feel this way and
to be doing this at this kind of
political climate but at the end of the
day I think we were all pleasantly
surprised with what we learned it was
something that catapulted me into really
like making sure that I felt powerful
making sure that I felt good and that
was a hope wearing a suit made me stand
up a little straighter I took myself
seriously I didn't doubt myself as much
he was almost like a peek into a
different world you know like if I
hadn't gone a different route maybe I
would be wearing stuff like this all the
time when you change kind of how you
look you change how other people look at
you that's what I think I learned when I
was in college I saw like The Devil
Wears Prada I was just like those are
the people who shaped the world and like
now I feel like I'm a people who shapes
the world
hey I'll cook on that post over there to
see more videos from our Channel
some of our favorites are in there and
some we like this okay but watch anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
