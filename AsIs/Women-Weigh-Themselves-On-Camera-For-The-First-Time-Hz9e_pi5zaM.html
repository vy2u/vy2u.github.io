that I'm a worthy person that I wonder
if I still feel the same about what a
number means to me I'm Jasmine I'm 27
years old and I haven't weighed myself
and probably for months
I'm Lindsay I'm 24 and the last time I
weighed myself I was 16 my name is tan
I'm 29 and the last time I weighed
myself was about four or five months ago
my name is Nina and I'm 27 and the last
time I weighed myself was probably last
month sometime
my name is titi I'm 35 and I haven't
weighed myself since I was 21 years old
Thanks
my relationship with this guy is
unhealthy I grew up in a really healthy
household almost too healthy so as a kid
even I would have this like calorie
counter book and we used to weigh
ourselves all the time like a lot of
people like I have kind of a love/hate
relationship with my body me sometimes I
just feel really defeated getting on the
scale and it's just instead of like a
tool for progress it's like why would
you ever be happy with yourself now look
at the number my relationship with the
scale was defining I don't know why but
it's like kind of engraved in society
like the number like correlates beauty
in a really twisted way I was an actor
when I was a kid I remember an agent
saying to me that I should lose weight
and I would book more work and this was
when I was 18 so I did I got so obsessed
with a half a pound a quarter of a pound
seeing that it would go down and if it
didn't then I less and less every day I
started and developed like an eating
disorder when I was 16 till I was 18 and
then again when I was about 21 in
college it was just always centered
around my control issues and the truth
of this scale if this is a higher number
than what I think I'm probably gonna
feel really terrible honestly which
sucks but that's the truth I don't know
I'm nervous but I'm hoping it doesn't
have the effect that I think it will
it's already at four pounds I just want
to point that out now I'm going to take
my shoes off cuz I ain't trying to play
like that
really
wait you serious
doe doe doe doe doe doe really wait this
is so much better than I thought oh my
god wait this is a great I really
thought you were gonna have me get
weighed this school with what okay yes
oh my god damn i woulda worn flannel Oh
oh my god I'm so excited
dude I'm so glad I came in I just want
to say that I feel very good that I'm
about to do this
the scale represents so many shitty
feelings for so many people and then and
we're gonna like and like it feels good
to up that's such a cause of
like pain and anxiety for a lot of
people including me
I picked this teal color because I
almost didn't even want to eat my lunch
because I was like oh but then I have to
get on the scale but like this color and
like knowing that I get to up the
scale like puts me at peace and like at
ease I feel like a powerful woman
already just holding this in my hand but
oh my god
so like I never went away myself again
and this is just gonna mark it I picked
the color green because it kind of
symbolizes rebirth and a fresh start and
I feel like destroying this it's totally
a fresh start
I like this color it just seems like
anything could happen like opportunity
change and celebration this is
amazing and fun and pink is so bright
and it just reminds me of good times
here's to not giving a single
yellow is a color to me that represents
Laura Shing and represents positivity
and this scale to me and my perspective
can only be positive for anyone watching
that has problems with this scale like
it's not easy to get over that but I
think realizing that like a number
doesn't define you and your worth in
your beauty is something that we should
all remember every day I wish that I
could go back to when I was 18 and do
that would have saved a lot of time and
energy and I want everybody in the world
to do this right now I think you just we
really don't need a scale to find a path
to love yourself like you'll never love
yourself because of what the number says
you'll love yourself because of how you
feel about yourself I'm still gonna
leave here struggling with my body image
but I just hope that this made someone
love themselves a little bit more did
definitely work for me somehow this is
literally just a machine and it does not
rule my life and I'm gonna take away
that no matter what that number
as long as I'm taking care of myself and
I'm happy and I'm healthy then that's
all that matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
