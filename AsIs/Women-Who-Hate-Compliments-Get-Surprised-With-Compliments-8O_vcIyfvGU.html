this is so sweet this is the best day
ever and like they're you getting
compliments makes me uncomfortable
because I immediately get my head about
it
my parents are Chinese immigrants and
just like the way I grew up you know is
more of like you need to fix this you
should get better at this which comes
out of love because they do you want you
to get better at that thing makes me
feel really weird about it is I don't
know the person's intention are you
feeling sorry for me are you trying to
give money out of me I was like when I
got a compliment it's like oh no they
saw me now you have to thank do I say oh
you to thank you you just say thank you
it kind of like ends the conversation
and you're not going anywhere so you
feel like you stopped it if you're
trying to progress in your career you
should take credit for the really good
stuff that you've worked on and when
you're trying to like take that credit
away from yourself it doesn't do you any
favors what I usually do is like look
awkward and walk away no already crying
this is exactly how I get when I get a
compliment like my arms get shaking my
belly goes crazy and my cheeks is just
like bread I'll feel uncomfortable but
I'm going to try to fight through that
awkwardness okay they're evil and okay
so you make me happy I come to work
every day oh that's sweet probably be
more successful than you think you will
be see he says this cuz he knows that
like I'm so deprecating I know out of
anyone that I know and I
you're probably one of the most
dependable people Oh
I'm just super overwhelmed you're one of
the funniest people I've ever met in my
entire life
I love having you in the office you are
utterly fearless I think that is
something that a lot of people strive to
be as bold and as fearless as you are a
lot of you're just like a
really wonderful friend and I'm so happy
and just grateful to have you in my life
hope that you know how wonderful you are
I think I blacked out a little one of
the things that I always think about
when you come up in my head is how
special you are how giving you are how
you're just a go-getter and a badass
your happiness is effervescent it's
contagious it's infectious
am i dying you are so so supportive
seeing you just lost them into this even
more beautiful human and I can't wait to
see what happens now you got the tears
thinking okay this is that's it you got
what you wanted oh my god it's really
nice to know that I have these people in
my life who are like so supportive and
and do think so highly of me oh god my
life has just changed when people are so
genuine it's like you can't block that
emotion I'm starting to wonder is like
my insecurities what's coming up in here
so emotional because I've had to come a
long way to like accept it definitely
times were you could have handed this to
me and I would have immediately started
bawling because I was at a particularly
like down on myself moment I mean you
still made me really emotional so you
know some of them really do mean it and
I should be a little more welcoming and
more willing to accept that I'm not as
horrible and I think I I guess I still
have to work harder at like accepting
accepting it it's like a protein a
pretty beautiful phobia that's what it
feels like right
that's exactly
Floyd and feelings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
