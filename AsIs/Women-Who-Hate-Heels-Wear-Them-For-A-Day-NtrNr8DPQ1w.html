legs
so today we're wearing heels for today
he was a hot on other people and I don't
ever wear shoes that make me taller
because I already tower over everyone in
my life I feel like I want to be someone
who wears heels especially as a 411
woman I have like a love-hate
relationship with heels I used to wear
heels all the time in college when it
comes to heels I really don't like
walking just to make sure you don't fall
and I like not to fall I've never won
heels before and it's not really my
identity also they're not comfortable
I've honestly worn heels like two or
three times in the last four years there
you go you have a bunch of heels to
choose from this is gonna be a struggle
they're high man if anyone can wear this
for more than 10 minutes they are a hero
to me this is very tight around this
area I'm anticipating some potential
blistering putting on heels strips I'm
not seeing my vagina
they're already uncomfortable been in
them for like one second I don't know
how many inches these are but my knees
are already like to my forehead how do
you get it in the hole
oh my god I'm already tall I feel like I
just worked out
I feel tall as so I'm just going to
try not to walk as much as possible
today I'm nervous about all the laughter
and ridicule that I'm gonna get and
tripping over and potentially breaking
something well around it's fine so I
literally have been wearing these heels
for like one minute and my feet are so
sweaty you are
you look like your Naomi Campbell
suicide why did she was sign when your
feet hurt and she look really good
so suicide why did I make I race on by
me with your comfortable shoes you look
really beautiful my heels are bringing
out a more dressy side of you so you're
willing to experiment more with some
like cooler things in your closet
yeah this
you'll hear from like
okay there hi uncomfortable but I
stretch your stuff strong about to drive
with heels on and I had absolutely no
idea how to do that it's probably not
that difficult but I do have a fear I'm
gonna like slip and cause a horrible
accident I'm about to meet my girlfriend
for lunch it's like I'm going on a first
date with her all over again
what do you think of it as look it's
pretty powerful have you ever run in
heels
I've never walked in heels this is my
view over every single one of these back
home schools can I just watch you oh
baby they're actually not as painful as
I thought they would be I will say
though that like like there's a lot of
body going on here and this paint really
kind of like evens it out but I kind of
like it honestly I like being like like
I'm already about six feet tall and
adding like four inches on to that like
I feel kind of like a badass I can
totally see why people would want to
wear heels makes you taller could make
you feel more confident I had a lot more
fun than I thought I would and I
definitely think the next time I'm going
out I'm gonna try wearing them so far
the reviews have been mixed some people
like were cursed right
I look great and then others are like
you look like a baby giraffe I have like
never seen someone look more like a baby
giraffe
honestly it wasn't that bad I think that
I was super self-conscious about things
that was clearly all me nobody was like
oh my gosh you're wearing heels they
were just like you look sexy as go
for all I need to start buying some
heels just because I think it's time men
and women who wear heels kudos to you
guys not all heroes wear capes it's true
some of them wear heels
