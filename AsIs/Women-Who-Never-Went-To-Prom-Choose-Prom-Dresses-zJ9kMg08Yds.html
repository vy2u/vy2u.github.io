one being that I thought I was too cool
for school dances to our prom was also
on a boat and I get seasick England
generally doesn't really have proms
I grew up with American TV shows in
American movies I always wanted to go
but a real American crawl Believe It or
Not wasn't that popular in high school
figured well it's not really worth it to
go to prom because it's gonna cost a lot
of money you did not have any
perspective dates
although going through problem I'm
excited to at least choose the dress I
like the idea of wearing something
really audacious I am sad that I missed
out on that opportunity one thing I did
do when I was in high school it still
looked at prom dresses unloved I think
people will be surprised to see me in
something so formal and potentially
something really feminine
I don't really dress up for the office
kind of is to go around like with
anything tight on me but photographs I
do call them as lighting sometimes we're
here at the mold let's go shopping
doesn't really fit this has existed
definitely from when I was in high
school to now that was second added one
more strap and called it new
I don't know if I seem like the type of
person who loves sparkles but I love
glitter
I want a feel and they could breathe in
things look at this one this is a very
princess Sara hate actually why would
you put these two colors together
because Cleary's do yeah I like this
what if this was fooling I didn't shave
my legs well enough I anticipated a long
dress is there a dress code in schools
cuz I'm not from America this seems very
risque I don't remember we had prom
specific dress codes in school school we
have a three finger roll which is like
you couldn't wear a strap that was
thinner than three fingers insane but
for prom like so many prom dresses or
spaghetti straps
yes I never wear like floor-length
dresses I mean who does really I guess
but I would like to find one that's
super long I'm gonna into this you
should try it on do you think you would
have worn like a suit you could wear a
suit you know I probably would I'm not a
suit person particularly but I just like
jackets a lot I love the netting under
it but it's just not very Pro me is it
it's like a sauna party in the garden
what I want to see in a prom dress is
something a little off the shoulder off
the shoulder is very on-trend right now
that's great and I love off-the-shoulder
because it's like a little skin and I'm
not seeing as much of it around here as
I thought it definitely wouldn't have
been there when we were in high school
because it wasn't cool back then it's
just like you have he's like wearing
chainmail night know no one's gonna
cooling like Art Deco
yep how many bronzer you going 2-5
making up for lost time I wear a lot of
black and so I think I want to stay away
from black I picked it this big blue one
I don't know how I feel about I don't
really like these halter top things and
they usually give me like way too much
cleavage so we'll see I'm trying on the
previous thing I can find just for fun
and then some less PC things
this is insane I don't actually hate it
which is good so different from white
everywhere I feel like it's been the
whole night just gonna be up how do you
feel he's like clearly business where
the nipple is supposed to be remote like
not where mine is at all I like the
color a lot though I wish it was like
this printed in like a thin fabric in a
shape that I like it's weirdly making me
feel very confident because I don't ever
wear clothes like this
it's so tight on the chest but you can
see they're asking to for some hair I'm
like surprised at how much I like this
wow it looks better than on boob right
now let's go super shape the thing is is
that it's too loose or too tight yeah
that is pretty pretty it is I would have
to get put like something away or
something it's kind of like I don't feel
like a sexy witch now I'm gonna try that
one they do really like the silhouette
on yeah I definitely think I'm gonna go
from one that has the autumn because
it's a little more glamorous I dunno you
asking putting stuff so this is like I
feel like I have to cook sleepy but no
great I feel like two simple really
I'm just very you I feel like that a
Fomenko dancer I do like so like sleepy
silhouette and me off the shoulder
that's like you that see Sarah
normally out back
oh yeah well we've tried on a bunch and
I think we've each found our dress let's
go back to the office and see what
people think Oh to prom all that
so we have our dresses on we're ready to
go and show the office this is more skin
than I think I've ever shown anyone
maybe what do you think of Alma you guys
are really pretty can't even oh my god
you look like the fancy girl music I
used to see you guys in very casual
snack than young professional at the
time but it's nice seeing you
because all of this person I would thank
you in a sparkly dress with the pockets
naked what I have forgotten is that prom
dresses have a lot of fabric oh look at
that such a good friend my mom actually
chose my dress for prom and I thought it
was like the
thing ever and then I wore and I got the
most unique dressed up
so I I wore like hot pink and then a
halter top and it was all leopard friend
I was really tan because I always come
in 2000 and I have a man blond hair nice
they were cold our strapless cool yeah
it's a kind of dress like in what other
places maybe if I ever go to like a
super fun surprise
is it true ice like that is pro I feel
that this is far from yeah this is like
you're going to like I would not because
it's not really my style
I like glamour but it's a little bit too
much it's a different sensation
I used to especially like showing my
co-workers who I don't think I've ever
seen my bare shoulders we don't know if
maybe this wouldn't be allowed in some
schools as someone who has some
experience of this I can tell you that
all of these dresses at some schools
would be damned good to see the sheer
paneling and also because I feels like
there's a gap between the edge of that
and like your armpit whoa means I don't
know so don't you think teens are
chilled wear this yeah I would like if I
had a kid I really think her prom it's
just like do you like whatever you're
most comfortable in going yeah I think
it's really fun because as a teen I was
way more insecure about like my body and
how its presenting myself to the world
I'm still insecure about those things
but like just a knotch less so it was
nice to be able to pick something from
that problem section that adult me
really feels like I can draw so I still
haven't been to prom but at least I got
to choose the dress that is probably one
of the more fun things to do about prom
anyway seeing myself in the dresses like
in the dressing room I didn't feel
surprisingly confident in them just like
get yourself a prom dress because it
really does wonders for like your
confidence I feel great I don't have
anywhere to go so get a prom dress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
