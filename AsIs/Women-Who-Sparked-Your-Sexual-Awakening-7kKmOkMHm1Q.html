nono areas and hers were just kind of
hanging out the whole time early season
the boy meets world Topanga was this
like weird hippie frizzy-haired
tiny girl and she went away and came
back and topango was high sexual
awakening was a Secret World of Alex
Mack specifically Alex Mack jennifer
Love Hewitt was a big one for me I
wanted to touch Alex Mack music videos
for sure and specifically Fiona Apple in
the criminal music video super sexy a
hundred percent Alicia Silverstone she
looks so ridiculously hot best thing
about you and Apple is that she was like
kind of an every girl kind of person she
was still relatable home by ninety
prepubescent sex fantasies just involved
the most big-breasted woman I could
think of Dana Scully from the x-files I
had a poster of her and David Duchovny
on my ceiling and I would tell people
that I had a crush on David Duchovny but
that was a lie brush that define my
childhood was Tyra Banks there's this
scene in Disney Channels life-size Tyra
Banks is a doll that has turned into an
adult it's weird she comes out of the
shower wearing a football jersey and I'm
like oh yeah that's doing something for
me really in Douma thermos I saw a movie
Harry and June had it occurred to me
they could have sex with two women at
the same time and then I saw that movie
I was like oh my god that's a thing that
could happen so really like Lindsay
Lohan in The Parent Trap I had that
poster of Lindsay Lohan in my room my
parents were like why do you have that
and I was like she's a really good
actress Lola bunny in Space Jam like she
was waiting long Lola bunny from Space
Jam was pretty high she's still pretty
hot
watching like Pepe LePew little cat
friend they definitely like if you were
to compare Pepe LePew to that cat
you definitely know like oh this cat's
got tits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
