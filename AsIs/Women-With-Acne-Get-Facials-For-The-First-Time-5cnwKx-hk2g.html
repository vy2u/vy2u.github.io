year of college and it was really
frustrating colleges when everybody was
already finished with their acne like I
never had it in high school and then I
just randomly got it
I had like your regular teen acne when I
was in high school and then I hit 25 and
it was like an entirely different piece
so when I started to develop acne around
sophomore in college it was like
profusely like agitating I'm super
self-conscious about this being in front
of a camera not wearing makeup just like
showing what my skin looks like be open
about having the conversation I like so
many people let's deal with this acne
definitely messed up my self-esteem
because when I was talking to people the
first thing I would see is either like
something called my face I'm hoping I
find another way to help my acne out
today we're going to do a pineapple
enzyme and enzymes are going to help
dissolve oil dirt it helps open up the
pores so this is your first time getting
a facial like smoke is gonna go back
this is it this would be great haha so
I'm going to put a pineapple enzyme on
you right now you might feel a little
bit tingly I don't know if you feel
tingly or from just feeling it cuz she
said it after that we will do
extractions
just gonna cover your eyes with some
little balls
a lot of it like kind of just like
tingly and the extractions like totally
don't hurt I think it's like a good
mental thing cuz you're like oh I'm
getting sick so this is a cucumber and
probiotic yogurt mask and also has a
little bit of shea butter so it's going
to help moisturize and those dry spots
these are called cool Globes and they're
gonna help push the mask deeper into the
skin they also help close down the pores
it feels like I'm like when you're in
the snow you have wind your face it
feels like that level and it's like my
favorite part I was like cold air going
onto my skin right now and you just feel
really refreshed how do you feel I feel
richer I don't want it to end I'm very
relaxed right now I feel like my skin
like I'm so afraid to touch it because
it feels priceless the experience was
really awesome my skin feels a lot more
calm and refreshed it felt really good
and like super relaxing I thought I was
gonna be painful I thought I was going
to be like ripping stuff out of my face
but no wasn't actually really leaving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
