school it was just like really bad all
over my face it was really red and used
to hurt really bad in the teenage years
I had normal acne like I think most
people but I always assumed that I would
grow out of it when I hit 21 for some
reason out of the blue I started
developing cystic acne it was a really
awful time in my life oh man me and acne
yeah this has been a lifelong
relationship at its worst was probably
when I was around 13 14 and it was just
forehead to chin like covered I struggle
with using makeup to cover my face but
also like trying to make it look natural
I always feel like it looks like I'm
wearing makeup I definitely would like
to just learn better techniques all
around I'm willing to put a little more
time in because I love to do makeup I
think it's so fun just the whole process
of transformation I don't use any
primers on my face maybe that will help
breakouts I wanted to do this video just
to let other young men and women out
there see that you are not alone you
know I feel like in the media we see
perfect flawless complexions everywhere
oh my god it looks so smooth and warm oh
wow I look really great I love it
doesn't feel like I have a lot of makeup
the blush and the highlighter like for
the cheekbones that's something I never
ever ever do it's great to see my skin a
consistent color always have redness the
old scarring I think the big thing that
I learned is that I do cake on my makeup
normally it's still okay to put a lot of
layers just make sure there are thin
layers I'm going to just study this and
try to like start doing lip color start
doing some contouring some blush I love
makeup it's like drawing on your face
and making all the great stuff about
yourself just stand out more
now okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
