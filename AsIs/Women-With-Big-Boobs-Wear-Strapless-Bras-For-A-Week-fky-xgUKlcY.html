on Adam Sandler movies I'm giving up on
strapless bras this week are going to be
trying out different brands of strapless
bras with big boobs
I hate strapless bras I would rather
pull out a dry tampon than do this but
here I am I know that obviously bras are
supposed to do mostly support work in
the band but in reality the straps hold
up a lot of your boobs as well I'm
worried about getting through a whole
week of work it's like having a crotch
that you have to adjust except there's
two of them and they're at eye level my
best friend's birthday is on Saturday
and she's having a moon bounce at her
birthday party because she hates me so
let's hope I don't get arrested three
bras seven days no parents like we're
hot yeah one this is the torrid
strapless bra it's so thick if someone
wanted to kick you in like the lady junk
it would be it's actually bulletproof so
we'll be fine the band curls under for
some reason I don't know why that is but
this Tori bra at least understands where
the boobs are traditionally located on
the human body
so I'm actually feeling pretty
comfortable right now it looks fine
under clothes it's a little
uncomfortable around the band but not so
much that I notice it's not like every
second I'm tugging on it the underwire
is curling into my body I spot something
my boobs look ginormous in this top I
think push-up bras are tough it's like
having stilts
I don't need my boobs to be bigger I
just need them to be higher I don't wear
tank tops usually on your bra strap show
maybe now I can wear a tank tops out
more often this is the LME bra this is
the bra that everyone wore in the 40s
yeah there were like the point here the
boob the more likely were to get that
secretary job there's a wire going in
the middle of the boob it hurts so much
if you told me I could either get my
period every day for the rest of my life
or ever have to wear this bra gun for
more our I would choose the period thing
does it simultaneously ride up and slink
down you betcha
this is a broad that like learned what
the human boob looked like 15 minutes
ago I hate this bra so much I hate this
bra so much if you can choose it the
googly eyes here these are basically
frog faces my fiancee definitely grabbed
one of my boobs and was like that won't
do it all he said it was like grabbing
it upholstered couch I just don't
understand were they like oh if you
can't feel your tits that's a good thing
my boobs would actually just fall out of
it and then the wire would cut so far
into my skin I thought I was giving
myself a tattoo I had to take a break in
the middle because the bras were rubbing
me raw on the side and I had to let my
body heal before I could resume this is
the walk hole strapless bra a little bit
more simple it's weird because I can
already see the sweat marks in the bra
that my boobs are gonna leave it's like
really supportive it's soft
I feel separated it doesn't give me well
which is the thing I didn't realize I
had to look out for I just wear this
every day and that's a huge compliment
it was way more comfortable than any
strapless broad needs to be
I actually got home and spent 20 minutes
without taking it off
I feel pretty supported right now
Michael I know double boob dreaded
double boob we're rocking the one cold
bra with the Darth Vader dress it
doesn't show over the top it doesn't cut
off your boob in the middle I mean
normally with a dress like this
I just wouldn't wear a bra and then like
apologized everyone I saw but with this
bra I feel like it's actually an option
it's my own damn fault but I thought a
strapless bra could be on a moon bounce
but you know what when there's a moon
bounce at a party get on the
moon bounce
also my friends are the kind of friends
who point out things so they were kind
of pointing out that might it was in my
mouth there were definitely some winners
and losers this week wearing a strapless
bra is like doing a group project and
two people drop out so the rest of it
has to hold it up I think I might have
scars for the rest of my life the thing
that surprised me most is how much pain
I was in after wearing strapless bras
repeatedly for a few days what was cool
about this challenge was that I was
forced to wear things that I don't
normally wear to see how it works with
the bra so dress is a lot of
off-the-shoulder stuff I didn't realize
how uncomfortable I was with my
shoulders until I had to come up with
outfits that were all shoulder bearing
honestly it gave me a new appreciation
for the advances in strapless bra
technology big boob in friends you just
have to find one that kind of works
don't stress out about strapless frogs
