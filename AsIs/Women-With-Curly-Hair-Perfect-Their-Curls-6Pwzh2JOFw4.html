[Laughter]
today we're at curls one-on-one and
we're gonna get curl makeovers so I've
been straightening my hair for about
twelve to thirteen years I've just
recently started wearing it naturally
curly I think I've been straightening my
hair for about 15 years
kids they would throw paper clips
erasers paper wads they were trying to
chuck it into my hair pretty much the
straightening my hair every day since
then this society definitely made me
feel pressured to wear my hair straight
people would say that my hair was messy
like even my own mom would be like brush
your hair out like keep it clean I was
like this is my natural hair I don't
know what to do with it back then I just
didn't feel confident I didn't feel like
myself because I had to pretend to be
somebody else but now I'm finally ready
to see what it looks like being having
my hair curly every day I'm tired of
damaging my hair and want to embrace my
curls more often let's get this haircut
on the way hi I'm Donatella I like this
I'm gonna take care of your curls today
okay love talk to me about your hair my
goal is to kind of give more bounce to
my curl like get rid of like the dead
ends and really give it life again maybe
take a couple inches off and because I
know it's all like dead hair let me
explain to you a little bit about the
haircut they used to cut your hair
before straight it's not a bad card but
it's not for curly hair because it
translates completely the opposite
because the top is pretty heavy and it
doesn't let the curls bounce back so I
want your hair to look more fuller in
the back sure and we'll have more fun on
the top both suggest you to not use too
many oils for your hair
I know curly girls would love oils but
we're gonna stay away a little bit from
the oils
don't use this for the your hair this is
the worst thing you can use for curly
hair it really really creates a lot of
breakage because it's super teen the
best thing it will be something thicker
so we're done with a haircut and now
we're gonna jump to the styling
your best friends for your hair is going
to be water conditioner massaging water
conditioner massaging
just got it washed I look like a wet
puppy dog right
you don't have to do this every day but
you're gonna go out to you on your hair
curly you're not gonna wait for hours to
dry you can take the diffuser and you
can allow the diffuser do the work for
you because usually do this which it
creates more first right so all you do
pretty gentle you put your hair in the
freezer and let it sit so the gentle
you're gonna be with your hair when it's
wet the bear is going to look when
you're driving
I just have to wait for this to dry and
the transformation is done
my hair looks fun recognizable oh wait
my major looks so pretty it looks like
it shines oh my god I'm such a big baby
this is oh my god it's so full and
healthy it's so crazy and curly my curls
were waves and now I feel like they're
actually curls works the magic my hair
feels like it's me getting it good I
feel like a new woman I know that's so
cliche but I feel transformed I feel
like I'm in a dream I don't think I've
ever imagined my hair was ever gonna
look like this now that I've learned all
the things I've learned today I'm gonna
start wearing my hair more curly like
all the time now I think I've just been
doing it all wrong for so many years and
that's why I've been kind of hesitant to
wear it curly
Donatella has some magic and I feel like
a queen and I'm ready to strut out on
the streets of LA right now with all of
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
