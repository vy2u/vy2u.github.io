put it all I have gone to a salon had my
hair pressed walked out got to the car
and it was I straightened my hair about
twice a week and then I'll do like mini
touch-up straightens and I know that
that much heat damage every week is
probably really really bad for my hair
but I haven't really fallen in love with
like my hair in its natural state if the
intention is for me to be able to wake
up tomorrow and have my hair be so
straight that it's like believably
naturally straight there's no freaking
way all righty
African threading you do it by parting
your hair into manageable sections and
wrapping each one in thread oh cool blow
dry I would not have guessed that this
is what it was gonna be simply add your
preferred styling product and then brush
your hair straight with a vented hair
brush and and the blow-dryer hair wrap
after showering and combing your hair
divide it into sections while still wet
these sections should be pinned flat
against your head afterwards
wrap the scarf around your head and
allow at least six hours for the hair to
dry oh you comin in paper you're gonna
be embarrassed but go after a couple of
hundred YouTube videos I think I figured
out how to do this African threading
method so I'm going to take four
sections because I just don't have the
patience to do more than
okay maybe that's art nothing about this
look is cute but I'm threaded and we'll
see how it turns out in the morning I
didn't really wash it I just kind of wet
it too to get it in a state to be able
to be dried I'm also gonna section out
my hair just to give it a better chance
to be like fully straightened and like
really give it a chance to work the
reality is setting in of just how long
it's gonna take
I wonder if I even have to use smaller
sections I'm gonna smooth out as much as
you can smooth my hair on this side
I don't know how well I actually wrapped
my hair around my head so I guess we'll
find out in the morning so last night i
cool blow-dried my hair and I think it
went like okay okay so I had to use the
African threading method to straighten
my hair as you can tell it did not do
that didn't work like I thought it was
well no it works exactly like how I
thought it would
it didn't straighten it elongated my
curls but I also feel like I might have
done a lot of things wrong I didn't
brush my hair I didn't have it soaked I
feel like if I put some kind of like
moisture to it maybe it would've came
out better I think that if I were
planning on straightening my hair this
would be a really good thing to do the
night before so that maybe I didn't have
to use quite as much heat in the morning
to get it to this point
but I would never step out of the house
like look at my naturally straight hair
like this isn't convincing anyone I
think mine had the best chance for
success and it wasn't completely
unsuccessful but you know it worked you
should go and try it at home and do
better than me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
