shampoo is like it literally makes no
sense to me most of the time my hair is
just dirty I feel I think
dry shampoo is absolutely geared towards
white women I like women with very very
straight fine hair some of my white
friends use dry shampoo all the time and
their hair tends to be more greasy err
for ten years I used to Japanese
straighten my hair and every maybe one
to two days it would get really oily and
would be some upkeep so I would use dry
shampoo pretty regularly but I've never
done so with my curly hair black women
typically wash their hair less I wash my
hair either once a week or every two
weeks I wash my hair about once a week I
think for a lot of women with textured
hair like black women in particular if
we wash our hair more like that strips
moisture and so you don't want your hair
to be too dry because that's when it
gets brittle and it starts breaking my
hair is more dry so I'm curious to see
what the dry shampoo will actually do
because if it's gonna dry out my scalp
and like what's the point of me putting
this into my hair when I was thinking
about it I thought like I actually want
a little grease a little sheen on my
curls so I don't know that I would ever
use dry shampoo on my curly hair but I'm
interested in seeing what it looks like
I'm going to try the living proof brand
perfect hair day dry shampoo it says
actually claims hair eliminates oil
sweat and odor that sounds like you have
to live up to the hype the ingredients
are a little bit concerning I don't even
know how to pronounce half of these
which always scares me I'm a shake it
just seems like something you should
shake okay so it says spray and a
sweeping motion oh my god guys I'm so
scared
it smells like alcohol like it smells
like bricks I mean there's definitely
residue I thought it was gonna be like a
bunch of like powdery flakes everywhere
so I'm happy for that I will say like my
hair doesn't feel like bad I shook it I
massaged it so we'll see we'll see like
what happens a minute
I could still see the white but Trey
here just told me he couldn't see it so
Trey what do you think I see it's like
nothing just yes nothing else nah the
dry shampoo like the residue is gone
there's like no white stuff anymore this
is what my hair would probably look like
whether I use jha shampoo or not it it
doesn't seem to look cleaner it
certainly doesn't feel cleaner can't
really tell the difference build a
difference
smells like dry shampoo smells like
shampoo which in my mind smells like
alcohol so it does it smells like the
IPA but I definitely don't feel like
it's something that I would use I don't
want to go around smelling like alcohol
we have some instant hair refresh
besties what is this
batiste yeah that's just cuz I can train
like this person looks white until I
don't know if I quit like by this if I
saw it just because it doesn't look like
my hair you pain propane centurion
chloride chloride I can't really relate
to putting any of those things ever on
my head and then it says not tested on
animals so like that's great
but everything else is like pretty scary
like do you think that was enough oh god
it's so white oh my god what is this
what I'm gonna look like when I have
gray hair so we're massaging through
this seems like a terrible idea like do
you see that like this is that's crazy
like I would think that this was
dandruff if I didn't just spray this dry
shampoo in my hair this would have been
a nightmare if my hair was curly like if
I had to massage this white stuff into
my curls I'd be crying and so sad right
away this is not a good time I haven't
really noticed a huge difference with
how my scalp feels I'm not scratching my
head any more than I would be normally
the one concern I have is that people
are going to see the gray spots on my
scalp but no one has said anything yet
no one has also noticed unless I've
spoken about it would you be able to
tell that there
in my head absolutely I don't know I've
tried sham Tomatoes looks like so I put
dry shampoo in my hair oh really and
like it doesn't look any different that
I did before really good would you have
known that I had dry shampoo in my hair
but it didn't tell you actually no I
wouldn't know do you even know what dry
shampoo does yeah I would be lying if I
said the only thing that I really
noticed with my hair is that it is so
super dry and flaky and my scalp is I
just look like I have dandruff I would
not recommend dry shampoo for people
with smaller hair like me this is dry
shampoo for curly hair specifically so
that's very interesting before I you
know I thought it was mainly to help
people with straight hair shake well
before use lifts curls and sections and
spray at the scalp and short quick
bursts alright so it goes on pretty
clear usually dry shampoo has like a
white residue but I'm not seeing that
here it actually smells a lot like their
other products yeah so it smells like
the no poo shampoo that I've used of
theirs before I also use their gel so
all of their products seem to smell the
same it lands on my scalp wet and other
dry shampoos that I've used I didn't
feel any wetness at all I guess it's the
water that's in the the no poo that I'm
feeling so we'll see how it goes once
it's dry nice feel to it and not tacky
completely drying I gotta say it's
looking better and better as time goes
by I think that kind of wet shiny look
has completely disappeared
and I've been getting a lot of
compliments on the smell people are
asking me what perfume are you wearing
and it's not perfume it's my hair I
tried not to add any additional product
just to see how the no poo held up I
definitely think that it had an impact
on the greasiness
at the base of my head overall I mean I
love the smell of it I thought it went
on very nicely it didn't have that
powdery effect I think it looks great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
