feel Wow
I feel great I'm ready to do this let's
go braless I don't actually know what my
bra sizes I just know that I'm small
enough to shop in the kids section I
used to really be about that full
push-up like two cup size because the
world couldn't know that I saw that I am
nervous that going out without a bra my
boobs have been this size since I've
been in first grade
nothing has been my biggest fear for not
wearing a bra is having my nipple
potentially show I think that's too
sexual
I don't know why this is one of my
favorite dresses it's just like falling
off of me without any type of support I
feel like wearing a bra shapes your
boobs better and I was a little
self-conscious of them just being like
kind of out there and like weirdly
shaped like not the perfectly round
shape that a bra provides but otherwise
pretty good day and I'm feeling pretty
confident about it yesterday I think I
was just kind of like excited to do it I
was like I'm so carefree but now I just
feel uncomfortable going to work I would
definitely try to like hide the fact
that I wasn't wearing a bra I felt like
I had to tell people like oh like I'm
braless cuz like I'm gonna get for a
video this has actually been a lot
harder than I thought it would be I'm
just pretty self-conscious about my
nipples showing I'm just doing my best
to cover it up going in singing I would
be really body confident and then
realizing that I actually am impacted by
how society views me it's been very cold
in the office today which has led to
nipple itis but on the bright side I
have been very comfortable all day it's
quite nice to not have wires digging
into my skin I'm honestly surprised that
I felt a little bit more feminine when I
wasn't wearing the bra which I did not
expect at all because a lot of times I
wear a bra to make me feel fuller more
put together more feminine I feel very
exposed
in this shirt so because I feel
uncomfortable I'm going to change my
shirt it's not as bad as it was I'm
getting at I think all of the
insecurities is all in my head I'm
getting over the insecurities like a lot
faster than I yeah power to you guys no
I wouldn't notice at all you go out and
now we're brought to like a Marty and
now we're brought but when you go even
though bras in general can be annoying I
have the ability to choose whether or
not I want to wear a bra some women
don't have that option having small
boobs I didn't experience any physical
discomfort or anything that kind of
impeded my lifestyle you know I can
still work out I can still wear pretty
much whatever I want to wear it was more
just the emotional insecurities of how
society perceives me when I first
started the challenge I like tried a
bunch of clothes on to like see what I
could wear and this was a shirt that
made me like very uncomfortable to wear
today was the first day where I could
actually picturing myself like going
braless and like this type of top when
I'm like not doing this challenge and
just like any other day without a bra I
felt like I was stepping more into my
natural sexuality and I could not wear a
bra and still feel feminine and still
feel confident</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
