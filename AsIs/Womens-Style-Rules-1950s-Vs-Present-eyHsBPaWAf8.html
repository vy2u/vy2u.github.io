sophisticated woman well it's quite
simple there are just a few rules one
must follow to achieve a respectable
level of stylish sophistication let's
take a look
rule number one a woman must always look
neat and clean this means new stockings
manicured nails and spotless shoes even
for housework
rule number two avoid colorful or gold
eyeshadow too much is a garish style sig
rule number three lipstick should be
lightly applied the more you wear the
older you will appear rule number four
dinner clothes are for dinner and should
never be worn before rule number five
any woman without a slim figure should
avoid wearing bathing suits at all costs
rule number six when it comes to
accessories less is more
too many accessories looks tacky and
unfashionable rule number seven stick to
a basic color scheme and style otherwise
you will have to spend a considerable
amount of money to have enough pieces
that work together rule number eight
excess hair is shameful and something to
be hidden
especially when venturing into the
public eye rule number nine only wear
feminine styles and colors no woman
wants to be mistaken for one of the men
and finally never be too bold or loud in
your choices the stylish lady is always
quiet and reserved in her beauty
simple as that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
