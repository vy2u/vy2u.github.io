hospital oh gee just had her baby and we
are going to go scoop up her placenta
hillarie asked me if she could film the
process of me eating my placenta and I
think the subject said oh geez placenta
and I said sure why not
you know I'm down to try something new
and different this is my second child
and with my first child I didn't eat the
placenta so I was curious to see if
there'd be a difference if I'd feel any
different the other day when I went to
the hospital they couldn't give me the
placenta so og and her husband got it
and I just came to their house to pick
it up it's me in the driver seat
placenta riding shotgun and we are off
on an adventure hi my name is Sarah and
we are in my placenta lab and we're
going to be preparing ouchies placenta
today I'm going to be preparing it in
the traditional Chinese medicine method
which is basically steaming at first and
then it will get sliced thinly and
dehydrated overnight
and then you put it into capsules yes
and then I will grind it into powder and
put it into capsules voila a hundred and
forty-four some women need more some
women need less why would a mom want to
eat her placenta the main reason is to
help prevent the baby blues but it also
helps to restore your iron levels it
helps to replenish your body from what
you lost after childbirth and it just
helps to give you an overall easier
recovery we're just leaving Sarah's
house that was way less gross than I
thought we'll be back tomorrow to get it
out I just had a baby I'm naturally
exhausted and I'm so excited I'm gonna
eat my placenta oh there's a pretty jar
it just looks like a little grayish
brownish powder doesn't smell like
anything
and I'm up no just kidding I didn't
taste like anything but uh let's see how
I feel so I just feel like really happy
um all of a sudden I mean not my it was
sad before but just like extra happy I
felt as if something should happen the
moment I ingested it there's all this
pressure of like are you gonna feel
what's it gonna do to you how you gonna
react one so far so good
I will be here continuing to take them
regularly and I'll keep you updated even
though I'm seriously exhausted I can't
relax I don't know how to really
describe it it's like having a cup of
coffee after a cup of coffee after a cup
of coffee I just look around the house
like oh I need to fix that oh I need to
frame that oh I need to clean that and I
just feel like my mind to shut down I
don't know what I got myself into I'm
just like uh I just feel so wound up and
I can't tell if that has to do with
taking care of a newborn and a toddler
or if it's these pills it was weird
because of my first pregnancy like
you're just so drained and this one I
felt like I couldn't relax I couldn't
stop doing anything so I'm tired as
can you hear that I felt very connected
to the animal world it's been two weeks
it tastes really bad now and they smell
awful I don't know how much longer I
could continue to take them did I eat my
placenta yes I did was it fun oh kind of
I mean the build-up to it and then the
like attention around it was really fun
but the actual taking of the pills
wasn't that great and would I do it
again I don't know I'm not gonna have
any more kids so I don't even have to
worry about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
