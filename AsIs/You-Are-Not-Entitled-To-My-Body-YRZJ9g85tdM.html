kissing her you know I'm automatically
attracted to beautiful I just start
kissing them it's like a magnet just I
don't even wait any when you're a star
they let you do it you can do anything
whatever you want grab them by the
I was at a fall festival in my town with
some of my friends and we were at this
haunted house we were talking to the
guys who worked there before we went
inside and I went in last and one of the
guys followed me and we got into this
enclosed room and it was just the two of
us and he grabbed my arm and he pulled
me into him and tried to kiss me and I
said I didn't want to I pushed him away
I was 13 at the time and I found out
after that that he was 19 and that was
the first time that I ever really felt
that somebody else felt entitled to my
body when I was 18 I was out of club
dancing with my friend and I was wearing
a fedora which a guy used as an
invitation to come up to me talk to me
and then pick me up by my butt and was
having me just straddle him and was
dancing with me like that I was so
scared I didn't know what to do he was
at least a foot taller than me
he didn't wait for a yes or listen to a
no he just went for it
and suddenly he was groping me kissing
me and I was laying there wondering if I
was about to get raped I was a freshman
in high school and a friend of mine came
over and I think he assumed that because
he was coming over that men we were
having sex and he pushed himself on me
he forced himself on me and I said no
multiple times he just continued to try
and try and I ended up picking him out
but it was a friend of mine
I started experiencing catcalling when I
was 10 I would be walking places alone
sometimes and men would say lewd things
to me from their car
I've always been outspoken so I flipped
them off or tell them off and I realized
how dangerous that was for me when a man
actually followed me home and threw
trash at me the whole time that's the
day I was silenced last year I was on
the Metro and I was wearing a legalized
gay t-shirt and when I got off of the
Metro a man came up to me and looked me
in the eyes and said I'd still eat it
and just his look and how he said it was
literally enough to break me down I went
to a high school that was up a hill by
the time I got all the way up I'd be
really tired and exhausted I'd had books
on me and there was a man that was
walking down and he walked right by me
he turns around grabs my butt really
hard let's go walks away and I'm just
there stuck feeling powerless disgusted
and just ruined I was walking down the
street one day and I noticed this man
was following me in his car and trying
to get me to come in I ignored him but
he pulled up in front of me and then got
out of his car and still tried to talk
to me I started shouting him and
screaming at him and he didn't seem to
care it was almost like me saying no
didn't make a difference to him

don't punch anyone without asking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
