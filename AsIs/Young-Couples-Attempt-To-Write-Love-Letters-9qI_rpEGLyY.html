emoji and gifts you text and bitmoji
that's good mojo is very age is very
important I am much more of a talker
like I'm texting I'll just be like quick
guys call you probably to send an email
it's like I'm thinking of you because I
love you so much it sounds right
we've never written love letters to each
other before kori writes me really
beautiful letters whenever he up
I write emails that explain myself a
little bit more now handwritten though
that's different that's different
he wrote me a card once like oh I did if
I'm just writing a love letter to like
write a love letter I honestly don't
even know what you put in it I feel like
I should be in a History Channel special
you know dear Reginald it's been 3 years
wouldn't be awkward if I misspelled his
name I'm gonna do my little emoji trick
and just throw some stickers around and
my notebook esque sort of mindset I'm
thinking how Ryan Gosling can I get
right now but I'm not gonna write too
much so she expects me to go over the
top with it plus I know her attention
spans like I feel like it's about to get
serious I think I'm just gonna write her
about the ways in which I think our
relationship makes me a better person
let me just go in side and find
something good or go inside weird to do
this with you uh here maybe we don't run
letters because it's kind of
uncomfortable to put all your emotions
on a piece of paper and like give it to
someone
okay you read mine first
I do the different colors I really hope
you can read it dearest Sophie so I love
you I can't believe it's already been a
whole three months that's like 30 years
in gay years I'm so lucky everyday to
have met you I want you to know how much
I appreciate all the things you do for
me just because you're deep and
thoughtful and want to do good things
but you're not knowing about it and your
hand is just the right size to hold in
mind hold on hold on to mine you're hot
wow that's don't look wait thanks man I
guess I just want to say thank you for
being my best friend don't think I could
have asked to fall for someone more
sweet or funding or caring can't wait
for all the times and memories we have
ahead of us you are loved you are safe
and you are doing big things
yours core oh that's a comical thing you
say all I know is you're damn close to
perfect for me love you so very much
Victor I guess that wasn't okay okay so
this is awesome thank you I love it
yeah when is it not fun to have someone
just take three minutes to tell you how
awesome you are
I'll be honest like I wasn't expecting
for this to be as meaningful as it is
you really don't have to always have a
reason to tell someone how you feel
about them it's like one of those nice
things that you can like touch in your
hands and be like this is yeah this is
something that somebody made for me I
mean I'm glad that we can talk all the
time and text all the time and you know
see each other and call each other but I
think there is something special about
having a letter
Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
