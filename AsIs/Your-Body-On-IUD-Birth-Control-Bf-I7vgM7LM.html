IUD stands for intrauterine device.
It basically means a device
that is inside the uterus.
The device is a small
T-shaped, flexible plastic.
They're over 99% effective,
making it one of the most
effective forms of birth control.
We'll be looking at the two main kinds
of IUDs available; copper and hormonal.
The non-hormonal IUD is the one
that contains copper wire
which prevents fertilization.
They're effective after insertion
and can be used as an
emergency contraception
within 5 days of unprotected sex.
It is effective up to 10 years.
The hormonal IUD contains
the progestin hormone
levonorgestrel.
It takes approximately
one week for hormonal IUDs
to take affect,
so it's not effective as
an emergency contraception.
It's effective for three to five years
depending on the brand.
- Hi I'm Doctor Allison
Hill and I'm a gynecologist.
This is a model of the female pelvis.
This is the vaginal canal,
followed by the cervix,
the cavity of the uterus,
and these are the fallopian tubes.
And this model is actually made to be
approximately the same
size as a normal uterus.
We're gonna place an IUD
which is gonna end up right here
in the cavity of the uterus.
When we receive an IUD
from the manufacturer,
it comes in an applicator
and it's already preloaded in here.
We start off by inserting
a speculum into the vagina
which is very similar to when
you have a pap smear done.
The cervix is then identified
and then we slowly guide the IUD
through the cervical canal,
into the cavity of the uterus.
Once it's about halfway into the uterus,
we pull back on the device here
and you can see that the arms
of the IUD start to open,
and then we push the IUD all the way
to the very top of the uterus.
Once it's there,
we then pull back further on the device
and this releases the
IUD from the applicator,
and then we pull the applicator out.
This leaves behind only the two strings
in the cervical canal,
which we then trim with a pair of scissors
to be about a centimeter
from the cervical opening.
- [Presenter] While the
IUD's being inserted,
most women feel cramps
or a small amount of pain
but many only have mild discomfort.
The IUD can be inserted
anytime during a woman's cycle.
Copper IUDs trigger the production
of a fluid that includes copper ions,
enzymes, prostaglandins,
and white blood cells from the uterus
and fallopian tubes.
This fluid is responsible
for killing sperm.
Hormonal IUD's release a synthetic hormone
levonorgestrel.
It prevents the ovaries
from releasing eggs
and thickens the mucus in the cervix,
which prevents the sperm
from reaching the egg.
With copper IUDs, possible side effects
are abnormal menstrual bleeding
and higher frequency of cramps or pain.
Women with hormonal IUDs
tend to have lighter periods
and have fewer cramps.
Some even stop getting periods altogether.
IUDs are reversible so
you can still get pregnant
after taking it out.
- [Doctor Allison] When
it's time to remove the IUD,
we insert a speculum into the vagina,
we then identify the strings
coming out of the cervix
and we grasp them with
a special instrument.
We then pull slightly down on the IUD
and as you can see, the
arms of the IUD fold upwards
so that it can fit
through the narrow cervix.
We then pull it out completely
and dispose of it.
During an IUD removal,
a woman can expect to
feel very small twinge
of pain as the IUD comes
through the cervix,
but it is very short and after that
she should not have any pain.
- [Presenter] Note that
IUDs do not protect
against sexually transmitted infections.
Use condoms to lower the risk
of contracting an STI.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
