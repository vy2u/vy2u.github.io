new stuff is really popular but I feel
like that you should check out his old
stuff uh I have I love them both
did you know your references like left
kina song my thoughts are a really
decent solo career but I don't think
he'll ever talk what he did with the
Fugees the biggest hit the Fugees ever
had is killing me softly which was also
a number one hit for a bird of black
index in 73
another one you're kidding but also
there's this Patti Smith documentary I
saw on TV how do you Smith who's Patti
Smith
punk poet laureate Highsmith sure
Felucia nightclub music oh cool cool
wave her debut album horses nothing
oh I think I've heard that
you're like Band of Horses yes yes the
funerals like so good the end of horses
what's the difference it's a band of
actual horses so what we call indie rock
now was once called college rock we're
college review in the late 1980s early
1990s are we going to a movie and they
were all influenced by the Blues based
attacks at the British papers like the
hope the kinks the Rolling Stone right
I'm not trying to downplay the
importance of the folk rock legends like
it the birds not the animal the band no
no no but earlier have you ever heard of
Dust Bowl baby boys good man I just made
up
but all those folk musicians were
inspired by Depression era blues
guitarists wow that's pretty cool yeah
there's these early recreated field
recordings of cavemen banging rocks
together it's honestly way more
contemporary than you think they're
playing Griff fests opening weekend you
want to go oh sorry I zoned out like
four hours ago
boy I forgot to talk about reggaeton we
mentioned reggae and dancehall earlier
but I could do it now it'd only take
like an hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
