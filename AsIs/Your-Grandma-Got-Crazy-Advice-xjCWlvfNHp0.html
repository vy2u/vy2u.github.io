invited a little attention goes on get
it hot
I never have to worry whether I'll have
a date but it's so good to know that you
belong to somebody what makes people
like one person and not another day
parking cars are not really popular not
even with the boys they park with not
when they meet at school it's sensible
to avoid strenuous exercise when you're
menstruating you can go to dances and
picnics but it's not a very good idea to
skate or ride horseback or play fast
games like volleyball and basketball or
do strenuous dancing like square dancing
I don't know what it is but there's
something about it you're like well she
looks nice to start with he is proud to
be with Carolyn because she looks well
for all through the day others are
looking at you how do you look how does
sue look
but then how understanding can we expect
a young life to be if Frank would only
take a little personal interest in his
attractive wife what a difference it
would make
truth is she'd probably settle for a
small compliment on the condition of the
house or the adequacy of her cooking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
