day with yours truly Daisy could I step
in leave a bundle of comments asking for
this vid so today I'm going to teach you
the top trending makeup trick on
Instagram that all of the celebrities
are doing zombie contouring what oh my
god wait did you do these zombie
contouring hey uh do me - stop the
camera is kind of hot sorry I forgot
when you're doing this now dance my legs
let's get started you want to start with
a naked face I know I look so crazy
without any makeup on no no no no you
look unrealistically gorgeous I like to
start every makeup application with my
natural nature all day cement pepper
using my one 760 l9t concealer brush on
the top lip what is that some sort of
nuclear weapon I wish you could just be
here with me and and smell how great how
great it smells it this is this you
never use it that our sink next we're
going to take our zombie contouring
palette no there's no way anyone just
has that lying around it's a must-have
essential I keep an extra one in my
purse
now take this depth charcoal a color
cream and use your app for keeps to miss
brush and apply it all underneath your
eye hey guys this technique is so easy
anybody could do it oh really
next we're going to take that rigor
mortis white girl color which is great
for you getting out your skin tone and
apply it to all your problem areas wait
your entire face is a problem area now
take this oh my god you guys
my favorite is it literally your
favorite thing and now that you have all
your base makeup on it's time to apply
the blood red lip hey babe do I leave my
cell phone in here oh and for our final
step we're just going to take our Beauty
blenders and blend away
who do you think you are Rembrandt
and just like that your zombie
contouring is complete what the makeup
is fun and all but you look amazing
without any makeup on makeup should be
used to enhance your already amazing and
unique features yeah inner beauty is way
more important anyways I was watching
