channel I have been wanting to sit down
and film this video for such a long time
so now I'm finally doing it in today's
video I'm going to share my top 10 tips
to looking stylish on a budget i budget
myself through an app called mint this
is not sponsored by mint I've just been
using this app for a really long time it
helps me budget my spending in certain
areas so I like to set my monthly
shopping budget to a certain limit by
shopping budget has not changed since I
was 18 years old you know when I was 18
I just didn't have the money to spend so
I had to budget myself in order to
afford groceries and rent and now that
my income has changed and I do have an
adult you know salary coming in as tight
income I choose to respond my money on
investing in my own business putting it
in my IRA and my savings on travel
memories stuff like that so that being
said I love it when you get started into
the tips
his number one is know what you own and
love what you owe and have a clear
closet don't just hoard things in your
closet if you can't see it you don't
know it's there trust me if you were to
go take out everything in your closet
right now you would probably be shocked
at what you found have a day spend the
day for yourself cleaning out your
closet sell the things or donate the
things that you do not want wait is no
what you have in your closet and only
key pieces that you truly love number
two is invest in great blends or basics
just know what your clothes are made of
for their worth so for example I have a
rag and one teacher that was a hundred
and thirty dollars that I absolutely
love I also have a gap t-shirt that was
$17 for both may be the exact same
materials one was one thirty one was
seventeen find a basic that you love
whether it be one thirty or 17 whatever
your budget is and invest in that
tip number three is save on your trendy
items definitely get your inspiration
from high-end designers that way you
know what to buy if you are trying to
stay on a budget just know that most
designer pieces are going to be kind of
trickled down into Zara H&amp;amp;M
Topshop so maybe they just hold off a
couple of months until they hit those
stores and you know by the time they do
hit those stores you might already be
over it so you never know it's good to
hold out on trendy items anyways I know
we all kind of fall for the trends
immediately but give them a couple of
weeks maybe a month or so before you
really decide to commit to it prints
versus solid if you have to be really
careful with your prints um I know when
you go into like forever 21 for example
at my fervor 21 there is just a room of
prints and you can kind of get locked in
what a good print is and what it cheaply
looking printed so definitely take some
inspiration from some higher end
designers maybe take some pictures on
your phone this is the print that I have
bought at Zara
I believe and I got at home and I just
hate it now I loved it at the time
because I was kind of in a room full of
prints and I was like oh I think that
when I guess kind of jumped the gun and
now I don't really love it I think it
just doesn't look good with anything and
then a print that I love is this one I
had this shirt for four years now and I
absolutely love it it's one of my
favorite prints and my favorite shirt so
just be mindful when you are looking at
prints you're dealing with solids just
know that black is always a safe choice
when you're dealing with sulfur or faux
leather black is always great you are
looking for a colored bag I would try to
get something that's texture I think it
just makes it look a little bit more
elevated because of the texture and also
look for something with a fun handle I
just recently got a red bag from forever
21 and it has gold ring handles on it
that I think makes it look a little bit
more special maybe a little bit more
high-end so definitely look for details
when you're buying
inexpensive handbags next tip tip number
five are accessories I'm talking about
five shoes and jewelry so if you do have
the budget if you do have an option to
save I would definitely save and invest
in a nicer designer bag you know it
doesn't have to be a $3,000 Chloe bag it
can very easily be a 3 to $400 fee by
Chloe bag you could be wearing a pair of
denim shorts and a white pea from
forever 21 but you know if you've got a
nice bag and maybe a nice pair of shoes
then it definitely elevates your outfit
I think the same thing for your shoes as
buffets are comfortable I know when it
comes to shoes comfort is key but I
always try to look for an interesting
shoe something with maybe some sort of
embellishment or some sort of detail in
it and when it comes to jewelry I will
attendance invest in jewelry all you
know spend a hundred a hundred and
twenty on a necklace if it's like a
really really cool piece because I like
dressing up basic tees and basic tops
with really fun jewelry you'll notice
this video of me in a basic white
t-shirt with simple plain white tee and
then add some jewelry it completely
transforms the whole entire look it's a
little bit cooler is a little bit more
stylish more interesting so definitely
don't be afraid to just go to the
jewelry section in forever 21 grab a few
necklaces I think the dainty R and the
smaller the work done said it looks so
trying to grab something like that layer
it on and you pretty much have yourself
a completely new outfit
my next tip involves your hair makeup
and your nails so when I go out I am NOT
the kind of person to get so dressed up
I'll usually do black skinny jeans on a
blacktop or some sort of all black
situation but I always like to do a red
lip or a super dark lip so I really
think playing with your makeup
especially in the nighttime really
elevates your outfit and this is a great
example of like a classic red lip with
just a basic black outfit it really
transforms the whole entire thing next
are your hairstyles and this can really
translate to daytime or nighttime I
think a really sweet slicked-back
ponytail it's one of my favorite
hairstyles I think it makes any outfit
look ten times better it just makes you
look sleek and chic and trendy I just
say sleek and chic I'm pretty sure I did
stupid just play with your hair and I
also love a good high but you know not a
creepy messy bun a sweet high bun think
of those two hairstyles are probably my
favorite when I'm trying to elevate my
outfit make it look a little bit more
stylish so yeah hair it does play a
factor and next are your nails one of my
biggest pet peeve is chipped nail polish
Oh
luckily looks better when you have a
French manicure you don't even have to
you know pay if you'll get your nails
done just buy a bottle of $3.00 polish
and just keep your hands looking nice in
your toes okay nice
tip number seven is tailoring I don't
care if your top is a $40 top from Zara
or at $300 top from I don't know where
don't be afraid to get bangs Taylor you
know you spend your hard-earned money on
a top even if it's $40 so you wanted to
look right you do plan on having it for
a while you invested $300 on top and it
you know you wanted it to be a little
snug in the waist or you wanted the arms
to be a little shorter you would
definitely get it tailored so do the
same for your more inexpensive items
because the better it fits the more
expensive it is going to look on you I
know that's so silly pay you know $40
for a top and then paying another 20 to
get it tailored but trust me you will
get your money for if you will wear it
more there are things that I bought that
I'm like I'll just get it you know
taking it in the waist a little bit it's
a little bit and I never do it and then
I never wear it and it just sits in my
closet and that's basically a waste of
$40 so and that's the extra 5 10 15
dollars to get it tailored I promise you
will be so much happier with the way it
looks
which also brings me to tip number eight
is to take care of your items treat all
of your items the same no matter what
the price no matter where they're from
take care of your items they will last
so much longer when you leave the house
make sure even if you are wearing a
t-shirt that it's properly steamed or
iron that there is no wrinkles dry
seeing them if they're necessary I know
I bought this top from Zara and I was
about to wash it and I read the label
and it said dryclean only I was like
hell no cinnamon place no I you know
this is my cup I love it I paid money
for it so I'm going to take care of it
properly if I put it in the washing
machine and just hope for the best it
probably would have ruined and again
waste forty dollars so definitely make
sure that you're taking care of all of
your clothes the same
fifth over nine is to layer layering
definitely elevates your outfit I love
nothing more than throwing a belt or a
scarf onto an outfit it just makes a
little bit more like you sought it out
for example I have this dress from
forever 21 I think this was ten dollars
it's basically a potato sack but add a
belt to it and it is a completely
different dress when I want to dress it
up I add like a sleek small chain
valveless meal or if I want to dress it
down I do more of a western-style or
wrote belt with sandals I get so much
more wear out of it so don't be afraid
to buy those random just kind of
shapeless items because you can play
with them you can belt them you can add
a jacket and it definitely takes it to a
whole new level
my last goal is more of a shopping tip
so definitely shop consignment shop sale
shop sample sale shop influence or
coupon codes but I do have one rule do
not buy something just because it's
cheap you know if you're shopping a sale
and a shirt was marked down from $500 to
$10.00 but it's like well I wear it can
I spit out this together don't buy it
don't clutter your closet you're going
to end up just giving it away just
because that's a good deal doesn't mean
you have to have it some of my best
pieces I got from sample sales and I
understand that not everyone is in a big
city and can go to sample sales if you
are definitely try to make that happen
often consignment I have found so many
bargain shopping consignment and
shopping in places like Saks office and
Nordstrom Rack but make sure if you're
shopping consignment that the clothes
are in good condition
so definitely inspect them make sure
there's no holes or stains because
you're just ended up not wearing them
and that's our influence or coupon codes
um I always try it by working with
brands like boohoo or Lulu I try to get
you guys a coupon code I know you know
these odd videos are annoying to some of
you but it usually comes with the
purchase you make coupon code attached
to it my number one online store has to
be River Island I got these flats
absolutely love these these are my go to
a slip-on flat and as you can see where
I was saying earlier about leather these
are embossed so they do look a little
bit more elevated and a little bit more
high-end like you could direct them up
but also just wear them with like a pair
of denim shorts and a t-shirt also from
River islands are these white patent
pointy toed slides and I love that they
have a little heel and this is also
embossed leather so it does make them
look a little bit more dressy just what
if I can't see myself spending investing
a lot of money in a pair of white flies
just because I don't think that I would
get that much use out of them there is
very you know spring/summer and number I
has great shoes they're always so
comfortable they're great quality so I
can always trust them when you use a
pair of affordable shoes and I love
River Islands prints they have great
prints I got in this ruffled Burley
skirt that I can see myself wearing just
like a black bodysuit maybe a cropped
off the shoulder top or like a textured
top but again I wouldn't want to invest
over $100 in something like this just
because this isn't something that you
wear on a weekly basis this is more of
like an occasion you know you want to
spread out your prints throughout the
week and throughout the month that way
you're not wearing this same print over
and over one of my next favorite stores
is Topshop I get most of my denim from
Topshop again I wouldn't mind investing
over a hundred dollars into a pair of
denim shorts or denim jeans because that
is something that you wear consistently
throughout the week and throughout the
year let's if they have a tall section
even though in five five I like to shop
my tall section for the shorts because
then they're not you know my butt's not
hanging out of them so I really like to
have the option of a longer pair another
place I love to shop is Target or so
what wear collection is always so good
especially if you are a business
professional they always had me best
work attire so recently I just purchased
these two tops again I would probably
invest over $100 in a good print but I
just happened to really love this one
from Target it's bright and I don't know
I just love it and then I got this top
this little ruffle baby baby doll top
this is not something I would invest
over a hundred dollars in just because
it is very um you can find stuff like
this everywhere a print if you fall in
love with the print chances are you will
not find it anywhere else but stuff like
this you can find out where so I'm
definitely glad that I was able to find
more of a trendy item like this at
Target that I can wear you know
throughout the summer and get plenty of
use out of their story I love going to
is forever 21 this is the handbag that I
was telling you guys about earlier the
big trend right now the ring handles so
for me to be able to find this
an affordable price I was really excited
and I love red I think red immediately
elevates her outfit it's a great pop of
color especially for summer and spring
but it is seasonless so you can do red
in the fall and in the winter
next is a tone so I get a lot of my
basics from ASOS they have great body
suits great little top places this is
just an off the shoulder top that I
always grab when I need some sort of
crop top but I don't want it to be super
tight you know this is like loose but
cropped which is what I always look for
when I'm buying a crop top so ASOS is
always a really good place to shop if
you are on a budget and next I was
telling you guys about consignment
stores marked down stores so I got this
one from snaps off six nice love is tag
on it I just got it when I was on the
west coast but this is by Tularosa which
is one of my favorite brands I love
Tularosa and originally this was 210 and
I bought it for 79 that they were having
a 20% off so I even got it for less than
that so when I can find brands that I
absolutely love but you know just don't
want to pay full price for I definitely
always check stores like that because
they usually have a pretty good
selection it's personally this brand new
alright so this video kind of inspired
me to do a $100 forever21 challenge that
I actually did yesterday and I got some
really cool stuff so that is going to be
the next video so stay tuned for that it
should be coming out within the next
week and really excited basically what I
did was I took $100 went to forever 21
and I'm going to put together as many
outfits as I can with those items that I
got for $100 so that should be fun so
definitely be on the lookout for that
within the next week with that being
said kind of bonus tips I guess my life
I heard lookbook is definitely like a
shopping it's like a magazine a shopping
situation where they're shopping links
but I do encourage everyone to shop in
their closet first
so I guess my bonus tips to you would be
to after you clean out your closet which
was my rule number one
look and see what you have put some
outfits together I promise you'll find
things that you never knew you had and
you can put together so many outfits
with your new / old clothes but
definitely do that first and sign
they're going to look book if you
haven't already it acquiesce like
fashion Bible for the whole month
shopping links inspiration photos a
really cool Facebook community of you
know successful stylish really cool
chicks and a we over there at light
mayor are all about looking stylish on a
budget and thrifting and consignment
stores and shopping in your own closet
so if you're into that sort of thing you
would stay right in with us but I will
leave you with that and I'll see you
guys in my next video my bull wearing my
free people like flowy its Tuffle it's
like a shirt but I just kind of wear it
open as like a little sweater but it's
buttons right here so when you wear it
as a shirt it's just kind of like you
know you can wear something on it Mesa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
