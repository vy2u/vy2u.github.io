I'm doing a 100 dollar challenge it has
100 dollars and I just went to I think
the two closest doors to me are H&amp;amp;M in
forever 21 so I just wanted to pop in
there and see kind of what I could find
that I liked actually I didn't bring my
debit card or anything I just brought a
hundred dollar bill and it ended up
being like 102 I think so I had to get
headquarters luckily like deep down hits
in my purse I just pay with Gortner so I
don't know how other people do this
challenges so I kind of made up my own
rules
I got these pieces and I wanted to
incorporate them into pieces that I
already had in my wardrobe well I was
going to have like an all top seam then
I have a dress that I liked so I was
like okay
tops and address whatever so that's what
it is I love the friends the surgery
so it's just finished up at hmm and
forever 21 so now let's see what we got
right so before we get start
cut my head off sorry I am wearing this
off the shoulder crocheted type top from
River Island it's so pretty it's got its
really pretty lace detail here and I
just like to wear a black strapless I
can banjo or something under first I
will start out with the one and only
dress and it is this guy right here it
is off the shoulder this really pretty
orange color and it also came in
lavender but I thought that the orange
was great because it makes it a little
bit more going into fall so as you can
see from the way I styled it I did a
black leather jacket and black booties
to carry it into the fall season first
summer I would do a really pretty gold
summery necklace so it got this star one
from revolve so I did this sandal just
to make it a little bit more summery
obviously you could do an open toe you
could do a flat sandal I don't know I
just thought that this dress was great
for daytime or night I did want to add a
classic white summery top into the mix
that was one of my goals going into this
and I was so excited to my pelvis I
think it's so pretty it's got some
uneven hem so it's very a symmetrical
and it's a little shorter on the front
long on the side got the detailing was
really nice as well
and I just paired this with some denim
shorts to make it really summery and I
did these red shoes from River Island
they look a little orange in the light
but they're good true red they're really
really pretty
then I love the gold block heel you
could also dress this up too if you were
going out you could do black skinny
jeans and like an open toed strappy
sandal I think would be nice so this is
a really good just basic white summer
topic is this top that you guys have
already seen a one-shoulder it just
feels like a t-shirt I mean it's like
a basic cotton situation with a really
cool cap sleeves excited to find this
because you know you see all the time
like one shoulder tanks
I thought they caps lead really made
made it look a little bit more special
but I paired this top two different ways
I did this embellished denim look and I
don't think I've ever asked with shoes
on with this look what I would do I mean
if I were going out I would do a black
bootie or if it was daytime then I would
do a slide or a mule or kind of a fun
sandal because the top is so you know
just basic black so I would do a bunch
shoe of fun necklace or just keep it
simple and do you know its statement
jeans I did this red skirt from Topshop
with a black top and then black booties
I'm still like wearing my black booties
all through summer they're just what am
I like stable pieces I just wear them
all year round but you can obviously do
sandals if you're more comfortable in
that because the duty to dress it up a
little bit so if you want to dress it
down do then so next is probably one of
my favorite items out of the whole
purchase and I did want to throw in a
floral top so I found as this one this
is still forever 21 and it's really
really pretty blush pink color style
beads with pair jeans that are one of my
favorites one of my go-to is my crops
cake flares from Zara I just bought this
really rich denim color looked nice with
the pink kind of made it pop and this is
definitely more I would wear this if
Brian and I were like going to dinner at
night I wanted to look kind of girly and
a little bit more casual I guess
definitely do this during the day with
sandals and I would do it with this kind
of really light wash denim to kind of
make it a little bit more casual with
some new colored sandals so next I
wanted to do definitely more of a trendy
item and I chose this one from H&amp;amp;M a
ruffle kind of frill sleeve with gold
Punky's were pulled it off with our
apples I was in the cat I was on the cab
going back to my apartment and I was
like
had my head down and I was like these
are Apple while my shirt and not pulled
it off but that's fine apples are fine
what I grab this multiple times during
the week probably not the best with
trendy items or for just did this with
some plain white denim jeans you can do
denim shorts you can do dark denim you
can do light denim this is pretty much
kind of an all color denim top but I
thought it was really pretty with white
so I did it with some white jeans for my
last item I wanted more of a basic more
of a classic piece that I'll have for a
while so I found the best white tank
from forever 21
it's like gives the effect of burnout
but it's not see-through so I was like
oh my gosh this is like the perfect tank
I'll try to link it below I already
threw the tag away because I wore it
yesterday but I will try to figure
something out because everyone needs
this tank not high Mac and it's not you
know super low it's like a really good
and happy medium the arm tips are not
super snut undo everything just kind of
fits how it should be this is my
definition of the perfect summer tank so
I was really excited to buy this
it's a lit two different ways I did this
is one of my favorite skirts really
pretty army green color and this one's
from Zara so I just did this I went for
more of a girly look obviously you could
do some sneakers with this and make it a
little bit more tomboy a little bit more
casual but with this I would do some
black sandals and just keep it classic
if you want to add a third piece or a
little bit more black to your outfit I
would do a denim jacket I think it takes
the place of a leather jacket for
summertime is a nice denim and you can
still wear this in the fall as well so I
did this one from River Island it's like
the perfect amount of strutting it's got
like minimal shreds on it it's not super
crazy and then on the complete opposite
end of the spectrum I did more of a
tomboy look a little bit more edgy so I
did the denim shorts and sorry I bought
Adam and then I did my combat boots from
Zara last year I believe so obviously a
completely different look from the skirt
and there I mean honestly right now
there are so many different ways to
style the same top it's insane so I just
kind of
to that I was feeling at the moment I
wanted to pick two that were complete
opposite girly edgy so as that is what I
did with that that is all I have for you
