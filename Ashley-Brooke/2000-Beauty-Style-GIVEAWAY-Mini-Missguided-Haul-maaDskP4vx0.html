starting out Saturday night sin are
making so but why why break it now yes
Ryan's doing lunges in the living room
don't laugh at him you ready for the
luncheon
if you go
through the dinner tonight is we decided
we would make light of bomb salad so
that is what we're doing this is the
start of something that's great
step number two just added some avocado
we had the lettuce the avocado we have
beyond meat with salsa and right here I
did a cauliflower rice zucchini and
squash mix with a little taco seasoning
black beans and then I'm probably going
to crumble up some chips right there I
just haven't done now it's time to play
the game of what's on Ryan's plate
well it's actually like not too too
terrible on me
are there flavors of this or is it all
just beyond me
like one flavor you yeah there's an
eagle like a feisty crumble I think it's
like a spicy one you're a feisty crumble
we're going to go eat our taco salad and
maybe watch a movie getting crazy on
Saturday night it's supposed to rain so
you know you know we're out pretty much
all day today we were shooting a little
bit and we went to juice generation got
an acai bowl we went to Whole Foods
because we ran out of like a few of
staples so we're just going to kind of
show tonight eaten or watch a movie okay
so yeah I'll see you guys tomorrow I
think we're going to try to go to the
pool if the weather is nice and see
anyone I might see you for dessert and
rabbit so maybe see us now or maybe
dance mom or I'm gonna grab stock for
dessert then I was amazing for dessert
I'm doing I did a whole mashed up banana
so I just got a banana and mashed it up
really good into a bowl almost like
liquefied it then I did one scoop of
vegan mac protein powder and vanilla and
then a scoop of peanut butter and then
my dairy free chocolate so I'm
going to put that in the refrigerator
for about 30 minutes and then I'm gonna
eat it would be good on top of that it's
like a little bit of Rimmel the morning
Sunday morning and we are going to the
school almost done with my book I know
you guys were asking me how it's going
and I'm absolutely loving it it's this
one right here and a lot of you guys
were also telling me that you are
reading it as well so that's really cool
we should totally form a book club and
that's not a bad idea
alright so I am wearing this one suit
cover from I think it's from Roberta
roller rabbit maybe who makes this yeah
so shoot some really really cute like
swimsuit cover ups and stuff like this
so I will link that below and then I'm
wearing my mink pink bathing suit these
are the bottoms so they're like floral
outlined in yellow and then the top like
the same print just like opposite colors
and with the blue is like one of my
favorite swimsuit so yeah that's what
we're wearing to the pool today debating
and bringing the camera because I know
it's really really hot outside
I don't think we're going to be there
for long so I'll bring it I don't know
what we're doing afterwards kind of see
where the day brings us waiting on you

I need care okay do real quick no you
did it oh we get you a book more care
for your book now I just have to get my
paint on it doesn't sound like the most
practical way to be back nine
I'd suggest folding the page well it
ruins the PUD if you both paid like Mark
would appreciate people that would dog
ear and highlight portions of a good
hook just like an enema picking up the
pepper then you drop them off tap it in
visit borrow a given level but you need
to hold it all
