Oh
hey guys back to my channel I don't
know why I picked this up right before I
turn on the camera guess I'll just take
a drink so it's not I'll just have one
more drink so I have not done a style
video in a couple of weeks so I just
thought that I would round up some of my
top four favorite fashion week outfits
that maybe I didn't get to show you guys
on them vlog or film some of these this
morning so I'm have my hair is like
having a case of the crazies the frizzy
so I just put it up in a bun I'm
probably gonna go to edit this wouldn't
be like nice actually start with outfit
number one this outfit I did this top
from Zara I pretty much knew that I
wanted to wear this one from the get-go
so cool and if you guys saw the vlog
then you saw this shirt already but it
is lace with these really cool velvet
details this actually isn't beating the
gold it is like a metallic threading
which is really pretty on and to do
something kind of cool and crazy with
this I didn't want to be super magic
matchy so I did the opposite and I did
this plaid skirt which you're probably
looking at this being like um no but I
promise once you have it on it worked
when I was in the store I actually
picked this up first and just kind of
went around holding it up to random tops
and just like found a winner with this
one I just did look lack sock bootie
from Alice and Olivia these are my
pretty much my Germa can you guys tell
germaphobe right here these are pretty
much my go-to block booties in the fall
and winter maybe not winter because they
are suede but definitely in the fall I
always grab these they never fail me
they're comfortable and she makes them
every year so this year I'm definitely
getting the tan ones because I wear
these like crazy
I'll just go ahead and throw this out
there I'm pretty sure I carried this bag
for all four outfits no I did not carry
this the whole fashion week but this
just kind of went with everything a lot
of my outfits were not so much needing a
statement back so I wanted something
with a little bit of texture
and minimal hardware so this one I just
kind of grabbed with everything and it's
from Topshop they also have a really
pretty that where the faux shearling is
white with black and it's really pretty
but I just needed something that was
solid black next this the polka dot e
polka dot e top from zara which this is
so great for layering I actually bought
it for the purpose of layering it but
today I just wore it alone oh I just
bent over to grab this and just hit my
nose on the desk hey need more coffee
I thought top I kind of wanted to hide I
didn't want the look of a bra underneath
so I just did this sheer lace one from
Target
it's the Gilligan and O'Malley I've
never said that out loud I always read
the tag at Target but I've never
actually said it Gilligan and O'Malley I
love their they're intimates I think
they do really great PJs and bras and
stuff so I did this and you really can't
even see it did these really cool vinyl
pants from Urban Outfitters the brand is
light before dark kind extra small of
these but they're just um pretty much
like vinyl trousers it'd be great for
work also so if you guys are looking for
any pair of trousers these are great
because they're fun then I wore my white
booties by Jeffrey Campbell and I always
put these on and then I'm like no that
doesn't like something just to look
right now I just put them on and I
actually loved it um I need to start
wearing these more because I bought
these with the intention of wearing them
all the time but I have only worn them
like twice so I'm gonna start wearing
these more especially with like baggy ER
jeans I think is like a cool look or
like a dress or a skirt so I'm
definitely gonna start incorporating
these more next is this floral lace
dress from Topshop did wear it with the
combat boot and I'm sure some of you are
like no I slope and falling for
following you for a while and know my
style I know that I can't do like one
solid girl
we look I even tried I put booties on
with this I put heels on and I just
didn't feel like myself so I was like
I'm just gonna throw my combat boot on
and I think it worked I think with the
low bun and the dress and I just think
it worked it works for me at least if
you if you don't like it and then you
don't have to wear it I thought the
dress was really pretty it was giving me
Zimmerman vibes and I put this in the
life by her lookbook last month and
that's why I bought it because I was
like oh I would probably wear that with
a lot so um this is a great like event
like a daytime wedding or you know like
a baby shower or wedding shower I think
any time where you need to be like a
little dressed up this is uh this is a
good option my last outfit I did my
bermuda short I only wore them
I grabbed it out of my closet and I was
like you are making an outfit out of
these shorts you bought them and now you
have to show everyone an outfit I said
to myself okay I keep trying to not wear
them I love them it's just kind of like
you know you can't just throw these on
with anything like you have to actually
plan out and try on a whole outfit so I
think I did good I think I like what I
picked out and I was going to like a
dark like underground type of party so I
really wasn't too worried about it did
it with this really like sexy ish bra
top from Topshop it's got some
embroidery and some lace up top then I
just felt really bare on my shoulders
which I hate and like always seen some
things so I threw on this bomber from
Zara that I think was in my last haul I
was like mixing metals here I had this
gunmetal and then I had gold but then
again I was like it's fine the party is
gonna be really dark and it'll be fine
no one will notice and then we were like
in the middle of the party and Jenna and
I were standing there and the lights
came on my first thought was like oh my
god people are gonna notice I'm wearing
gunmetal and gold stupid no one knows
the shoes I did in my Alison olivia
booties again because I just wanted
something basic and plans because I was
wearing your shorts texture top textured
jacket texture
so I was like tone it down with your
shoes so I did these that is it I feel
like I flew through that and I feel like
I'm talking to this my third cup of
coffee so I feel like I'm like well I'm
gonna let you guys know my streets tea
