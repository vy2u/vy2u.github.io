style video who's a collinear so this is
better so welcome to another Sunday
style video in today's video I'm styling
denim Akula is for the people who want
that denim feel in that denim vibe but
it might be a little too warm to wear
full-on denims so I think culottes are a
good way to have the denim effect
without with a little breeze getting up
there getting some cool air I just think
that done culottes are a really fresh
and trendy take on a basic pair of denim
to excuse the video we were dealing with
a storm all day long super kind of
popping out when it wasn't raining I
think in the pink blazer look we we got
right not a little bit and then the best
look we just had to completely film
inside cuz it was storming it so bad so
sorry about that I'll go ahead and let
you guys get straight into the video and
also let me know the comments below what
you want to see next in the next styling

keep Zuma so good I don't wanna let you

that's the way everyday goes looking
back and always start falling

in the cellar but I don't wanna let you
