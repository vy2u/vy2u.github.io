those of you returning welcome back and
for those of you who are new my name is
Ashley Brooke and you were watching one
of my style Sunday videos and today I am
styling three different white basic
button-downs five different ways I'm a
huge fan of a white button-down I think
they're great by themselves depending on
how you accessorize them and I think
they're great for layering for the
weekends they're great for casual
they're great for the office so I think
like and I always laugh at myself
because I have like six different white
button-downs in my closet but they all
serve a purpose so I think it's okay
that's one of those items that you can
kind of like play with and get different
styles and it's okay you can find them
for really inexpensive or you can go all
the way and buy like high-end designer
this video I am styling three different
white button-down one from forever 21
pick a long super long one it's it's a
dress as you will see in the video or I
can layer it just to add some like
really long
cool layers to my outfit this one from
H&amp;amp;M and it is a short-sleeved one on
days where I'm wearing like tighter
layers or days that it's really not that
cold outside you want a short sleeve
that way it's not getting bunched up
under your layers and you're not super
hot you don't to worry about your cuff
sticking out and then the next one I'm
styling is just my good old basic white
one this one's from Target actually it's
Massimo and I've had this probably for
five years it's a really great one and
it just kind of shows that you don't
have to spend a lot of money to have a
good solid white button-down I will say
we did get rained out the day we were
shooting unfortunately it completely
poured I think we got like two and a
half good good outside shut up outfits
shot outside but um other than that
they're shot indoors so sorry about that
