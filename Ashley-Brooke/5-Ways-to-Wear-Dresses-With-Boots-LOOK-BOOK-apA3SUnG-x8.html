apologies for the really uninteresting
background we just moved and this is
what the other side of the room was like
yikes today's video I'm showing you guys
how to wear spring dresses with boots
and I know this isn't for everybody but
this is the look that I wear on a weekly
basis that's one of my favorite
combinations because as you guys know I
love girly and I love edgy and I think
just mixing the two koreas like this
really cool really effortless looks an
easy combo to grab any spring dress you
have in your closet grab some boots the
boots with it out of cold bag and it's
like you're good to go it's just so easy
so whenever I'm like running errands or
I'm doing something on the weekend I'm
gonna be out all day that's my go-to
outfit because it is so easy I think
then let's go ahead and get into without
this take off
our faces to bathe
start down
start
it's dark down below
stop
start down below
you
just to try
now
start down below
that's all for this book I really hope
you loved it and I tried to link
everything below of course you guys know
a lot of this stuff I've already had I'm
sure you've seen it before so it's hard
to link things that are super old I just
can't find it but I do my best to blink
very similar items so I really hope you
find something that you like in the
description box but if you want to see
more infos definitely sign up for my
online magazine a life by her Khosla
book you will get it delivered straight
to your inbox each month and it's full
of outfits and trends ages dedicated to
certain trends sometimes sometimes have
like four pages plus like a full list of
shopping links so that's a really cool
thing to have if you just want more info
with beauty and home and hair and stuff
like that fitness we interview our
favorite Fitness youtubers put that in
there so there's some really cool stuff
in the noxee but I will put the link
here and in the description box if you
want to go sign up guys in my next video
leave in the comments below what you
want to see next I'm at that time this
time of year where there are so many
things to do with spring so there's just
unlimited amounts of topic so you guys
let me know what you want to see next
and we'll make that happen
