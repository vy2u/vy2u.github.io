is your typical New York City bathroom
where it is very tiny and equipped with
shower sink toilet and tiny storage so
it is about 8:30 at night I am finishing
up a very long day so I just thought I
would share with you guys my nighttime
skincare routine this is something that
I take very seriously I wash my makeup
every night I don't care if I'm working
super late or if I go out with
girlfriends
I wash my makeup off my face every
single night and of course don't forget
to subscribe if you like my videos if
you like my channel just hit the
subscribe button and let's go ahead and
get to the video okay so I know you guys
are going to think I'm totally crazy but
since I can even remember I've been
taking off my eye makeup with Vaseline I
don't know why I started doing it I've
just been doing it forever so if you
haven't tried the Vaseline I just do it
once just do it once to say you did if
you hate it don't do it again
but you're gonna love it so I just take
a little bit of Vaseline and I rub it on
my eye makeup just like this so this is
what it looks like it's pretty scary
because it just kind of rubs everything
off so then I'm just going to take a wet
warm washcloth and I'm just going to rub
it all off so now that all of my eye
makeup is off I'm going to take the same
rag soak it in hot water and just kind
of rub the rest of my face makeup off
next I'm going to take my Neutrogena
acne stress control scrub to just kind
of clear out my pores get all of the
gunk and all of the excess makeup I love
this stuff so so so so much I actually
stopped I ran out of it and I stopped
using it for a couple of days because I
just couldn't get to the store and get
any and I actually got like two pimples
on my cheek so I mean I've been using
this stuff forever and it works so well
so now I'm just going to rinse all that
off next thing I'm going to use is my
rose petal toner I love this stuff it
takes off any excess makeup that I have
anything I left and I actually use this
throughout the day as well when I don't
have any makeup on it just lost I think
it just gives you a really nice and
clean feeling and it doesn't have
alcohol in it which is great it actually
has aloe vera in it which makes you feel
all nice and smooth so just take a
little cotton ball and I go over
everything smells really nice - it's got
kind of a floral scent but it's not so
harsh okay after that I just kind of let
that dry there we go
now I'm going to take my derma e
hydrating night cream this is I actually
got this in my Birchbox a couple of
months ago and I really really love it
I can tell a difference when I don't use
it when I wake up in the morning and my
skin just isn't as hydrated and it isn't
as soft as when I I don't know what I'm
saying I kind of lost my sentence what
I'm trying to say is I can tell the
difference when I don't use it than what
I do use it obviously for the better the
next thing I'm going to use is my
Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair
moisturizer I just take a little dab of
this and I mainly just kind of rub it
around my eyes and my smile lines my
grandmother always who gives the best
advice by the way she always tells me to
use wrinkle cream as a precaution she
tells me all the time so I started using
it and she says I will be thankful one
day that I started using it now always
so smart all right and the last thing I
use is my vitamin E oil so this stuff is
the best stuff in the whole entire world
I know where you say that about every
product that I ever use but he's take my
word for it this stuff is so amazing I
actually get this on Amazon because I
started noticing when I was going to the
store looking for vitamin E oil it was
first of all so expensive and second of
all it had other ingredients in it and
that I didn't know what they were I've
never heard of them before so I found
this on Amazon
it is 100% vitamin E oil there is
nothing else in it I'm going to put the
link down below so you guys can find
that it's so great I'm just going to
take a little bit on my finger and I'm
going to apply it to places that I just
feel like I get super super dry which I
get I don't know if any if anyone else
has this problem but I get really dry
like right here under my eyes so I'm
just going to dab a little bit on there
and I get really chapped lips it's
really gross I'm sorry so I'm going to
put a little bit on
lived fear if you're prone to breakouts
I would maybe take this up and do just
like a small tester spot on your skin I
someone told me one time to put coconut
oil over my face it was the worst advice
ever I think but I am not prone to
breakouts whatsoever i coated my face
with coconut oil and literally woke up
the next day with like a face just like
full of blank breakouts and I it was so
weird I knew it was going to happen
because the students like with the
coconut oil on I was like oh man this is
really greasy but this stuff is totally
different
I can literally coat it all over my face
and like no issues so give this a shot
alright that's it for my nighttime
skincare routine I hope you guys enjoyed
it I will put the products in the
