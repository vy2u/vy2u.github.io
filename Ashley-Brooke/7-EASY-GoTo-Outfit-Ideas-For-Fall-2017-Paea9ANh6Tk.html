channel first I want to say I apologize
with the construction it is so loud and
I really hope you can hear it we
probably can second if you are new to my
channel welcome I hope you loved this
video and I hope you loved the content
and I hope you are here to stay
my name is Ashley and I do predominately
fashion videos hauls how to Styles vlogs
some beauties some hair but mostly
fashion in today's video I am doing 7
easy go to a styled outfit so you are
gonna get out of this video is hopefully
some inspiration next time you're kind
of running late or next time you really
don't know how to style that trendy item
that you have hopefully you point you a
little bit in the right direction so go
ahead and get started
so with this first outfit I don't know
your guys's office dress code but I
thought you doin all the places that I
have worked this would have been perfect
for the office the slit was a little a
little on the high side but you can
always pin it tack it you're dry clean
my dry cleaner doesn't really ten
dollars started with this really cool
skirt it's tweed it's not a fringe
bottom then I added the Navy sweater to
it because there was mostly Navy in the
skirt already kind of wanted to bring
out the blue it was so pretty then I
just added some simple ankle booties and
a navy bag to it you know if you are
wearing it to the office you could do a
white button-down silk cream blouse with
it you could do a blazer over it if
you're wearing it casually I think a
really cool bootie or block heel sandal
in a graphic tee would be really cool
because the skirt is versatile can take
you kind of from the streets to the
office
this next outfit is very casual so I
started with the shoes because that was
my statement piece for the outfit kind
of styled around it my Kurupt flare
jeans and just a basic white sweater
because I wanted to do a red bag to tie
in the shoe so I was like okay I need to
just be as basic as I can on the top and
the bottom shoe you can't really tell in
the jeans but this shoe has a really
cool thick ankle strap so definitely do
a black dress and Navy sweater dress
would even be super cute so funny how
one pair of shoes can just take just a
basic outfit and completely transform it
into something really cool something
that you're gonna get stopped about and
you're like I'm pretty much just wearing
all basics in a cool shoe but you'll be
surprised at how many people will
compliment you because it does look like
a cool put together outfit when you have
one really awesome statement piece
whether it be a shoe or a bag or like a
fun fringy sweater it just can kind of
take your outfit just beyond so far
you
okay this is one of my favorite go-to
styles for fall and it's such a fun
boho outfit but yet all it is is just a
printed maxi dress so whenever I am
shopping or I'm looking looking online I
always look for these flowy printed maxi
dress but those if you would like a
bigger bust who can't wear flowy items
you know a lot of you guys tell me you
know I have a big chest I feel like I'm
wearing a tent can always belt it at the
waist and then that gives you more of a
body shape so you're not drowning in
fabrics bring a belt with you next time
you're shopping and try it on and see
even those cute little rope ties are
really great also my favorite favorite
outfits flowy dress ankle booties and a
cool studded bag it's just such a good
go-to it's so easy for I'm needing an
outfit really quickly I always go for a
dress because it's just one item throw
on head out the door
one of my favorites it's a good you know
if you're going to brunch or you're
going to like a cocktail with your
friends or something and with this
outfit I started with the shoes in the
bag because I knew I wanted to wear a
statement bag and a statement shoe so
again I just paired to basics I did a
faux leather mini the same top as before
red booties and just tied in the bag all
right actually I started with the bag
and then I tied in the shoes don't be if
don't be afraid to grab those printed
bags that you see that you're like I'm
never gonna wear that printed bag you
will if you have Basics in your closet
that's the perfect setup for a printed
bag go for the printed bag dress it with
basics and add a pop of color to your
shoe you can pretty much wear this
combination with anything the shoe and
bag combo you can do jeans you could do
culottes you could do trousers for the
office so it really is kind of an
endless opportunity of this style of
accessory
in this outfit the focal point is the
wide leg pant because this is something
one of my favorite pieces for fall even
pretty much all year round is the white
leg pant it's always one of my grab and
goes and I styled this pair of pants two
different ways so I dressed it down I
dressed it really down with a graphic
tee and a Baker boy hat made this outfit
you could throw in a pair of jeans but
you don't get the same effect as if
you're wearing this wide leg trouser and
they're super comfortable they're really
more comfortable than jeans don't get me
wrong I love my jeans but this is like
my go-to time you are dressing casually
and you're grabbing that graphic tee and
a pair of jeans try putting on a pair of
unexpected trousers and just see how you
like it think that's definitely a way to
step out of your comfort zone and you're
your own little style box and really try
to dress something up with a pair of
pants like this
and are also great for the office so in
this outfit I did the army green pants
with just a black bodysuit and again if
this is not your dress code I'm sorry
everyone's dress code is so different
but you could always throw a blazer on
you could wear something like just a
black silk button-down pants are the
focal point of the outfit dress around
there so again if you're doing casual
throw in a graphic tee and sneakers if
you're doing dressy it just some ankle
booties and a black blouse pull your
hair back you know when you have so much
going on you know you want to keep your
hair back that way the focal point is
the pant is the outfit although I don't
know I don't know what my hair is doing
in this this video I let it air dry last
night so it's a little bit on the crazy
side
with this next outfit we all have that
oversized sweater in our closet I'm
actually wearing that one right now
because it is so comfortable I've been
living in it I get so many questions how
do I style this oversized sweater anyone
can throw in a pair of jeans with it but
I love a flare Jean with an oversized
sweater I think it's like the most
perfect combination and you time I'm
wearing an oversized sweater that's long
I'm probably wearing flares with it not
why I like because wide-leg will just
make you look like you're drowning in
all sorts of fabrics so make sure that
it's a wide leg and that the sweater
stops where your flare is at its
tightest point you know you don't want
it to be so long that it like hits the
flare and you hate this outfit that of
doing black denim that kind of
camouflages you know you just kind of
look like you're wearing all black but
with the faux leather pants
it breaks it up and it gives you two
different textures which gives you two
different colors so you can actually see
where top stops and then the pants begin
and I did just an embellished bag just
because I didn't want to do an all black
bag which you definitely could but I
wanted some sort of embellishment with
it and this is a great casual outfit or
a dress the outfit just depending on how
you wear it
you
for my last outfit I could just live in
this tunic just all day every day I love
the color I think it's so pretty with
black or gold or black and gold so
obviously a dress like this I do like to
wear with my hair pulled back just
because the dress is you know actually
like a potato Zac so I don't want like
big hair big flowy dress semi hair back
I did an oversized tote my gold studded
booties again with this tunic you could
always wear jeans with it um if you're a
little bit taller you know it might be a
little bit short I'm five five and it's
to the point where if it were any
shorter I wouldn't wear it as a dress I
washed it and I was like please don't
please don't please luckily it didn't
just love the detailing on the sleeves I
think it's just so interesting it's not
your typical kind of just basic
oversized tunic dress it's got some
detail on it different textures actually
I hope you can see it in the camera but
but anyway back to the styling when you
are styling such a simple dress like
this go for an oversized tote or go for
a stud bootie again the shoe makes your
office so don't hesitate to you know if
you aren't a printed person I think
studs are a great alternative because it
gives you the print effect without being
so Printy it's a little bit edgier a
little cooler so alright guys that's all
