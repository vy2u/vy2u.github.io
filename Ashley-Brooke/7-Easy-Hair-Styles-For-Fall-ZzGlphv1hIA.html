channel today I have partnered up with
one of my favorite brands living proof
to show you guys my go-to favorite
hairstyles for fall I'm a no-fuss kind
of girl you know I think all of these
braided hairstyles are so pretty but
just not practical for every day so what
I really wanted to bring you guys today
was just some practical hairstyles that
are easy yet some are some are sassy
some are fun some are functional and
some are just really basic I love about
the living proof products is that you
are wearing hair products but you don't
feel like you're wearing hair products
you know I've had hair sprays before
that I spray and I'm crunchy for the
next two days that being said let's go
ahead and get started
now number one is just my go-to classic
way of saying this so natural hair I
basically just let it air dry so I would
have a clean slate to work with so when
I did dry my hair and actually just now
I use the living proof style lab blowout
spray this has heat protectant in it you
never want to put heat on your hair
without using a heat protectant first
and I kind of hold the heat over my ends
to straighten them out if I'm not going
for you know a voluminous curl look I'm
going for more of a natural soft wave so
I'm just gonna take my straightener
through my pieces and just put a little
bit of heat on the end so they
straighten out
I'll actually give your hair a little
bit more length
whenever you straighten out the ends it
definitely appears to be longer than
when it's all curled I'm gonna apply the
living proof style of multitasking a
styler depth is something that I like to
call styling smarter not harder just
because it kind of does the job of a
hair spray and oil I mean it just like
gives me that feel of not just
blow-dried hair it almost gives you that
lived-in look but without your hair
being
really simple style that I like to do
and I've been getting so many questions
about it in my last few videos about my
high voluminous ponytail and I really
love wearing this look when I'm wearing
a detailed collared jacket a chunky neck
sweater wrap my little handy jar I keep
this in my cabinet it's got my ponytail
holders my rubber bands some clips and
some bobby pins
$3.99 container store love this thing
either wear it a little looser tighter
however you like to wear yo ponytails
I'm gonna grab a piece from underneath I
kind of let it hang out right here I'm a
bobby pin
and I'm gonna grab this little crazy
hanging tail and I'm going to twist it
around my ponytail just leave this pin
it up in there nice and tight you might
need a couple of bobby pins depending on
how thick your hair is depending on how
the luminous you actually want it you
can take your pick art it down the
middle ease this bottom layer right here
that gives you lots of volume but don't
be afraid to put a little hairspray in
there my flex shaping hairspray is
perfect because like I said it doesn't
give you that super crunchy have to wash
your hair right off you're using it feel
like I've used this I take my hair down
brush it out and I never feel it again
so it smells like Miami a certain sense
trigger your memory this smells like
Miami to me
it's gonna be a high bun with a scarf
again just like the PBS slip gonna put
my hair up in a high ponytail with a
really tight I'm going to take my
ponytail and I'm going to create a tight
twist wrap it around our ponytail holder
but depending on how thick your hair is
you might need a thick one and I'm just
gonna hold the bun into place
make it really really small tighten it
up here I'm just going to double wrap it
in a little knot you can either leave
them hanging down or you can just
continue to tie them tuck your flaps put
tuck your flaps in there you go
and I kind of created a little side part
for this look look look I'm just gonna
grab the top of my hair and I'm just
gonna twist down and with each twist I
grab an extra piece of hair so every
time you twist you just want to grab a
piece like previously to create a bun
well you definitely want to grab your
like shaping hairspray and spray the
twist because throughout the day I find
that these do come loose if they're not
pinned properly so you just want to make
sure that layers fly way in
drain my hair and now I'm going to show
you guys three of my favorite straight
hairstyles for fall this is usually a
good go-to when you have like a little
dirty dirtier hair and I'm kind of
running late I don't have time to wash
my hair this style is definitely my
go-to going to just pull my hair back
and then I'm gonna grab a piece from
underneath I'm going to pull it out so
you wanted to braid this piece if you
wanted something a little bit more funky
we're gonna bring it under that way it's
hidden at the at the side going to wrap
it around your ponytail holder I am
wearing my hair in a straight a straight
style I like to use the multitasking
styler it definitely helps tame flyaways
for these no matter what I always have
something flying out of place so you
really want to make sure when you're
wearing a sleek ponytail that everything
bitch outlook is something that I like
to wear with a baker boy hat and I
pretty much will only wear it with a
baker boy hat or just some kind of hat
art down the middle
and it same flyways this frame really
keeps the rubber bands in place and you
don't have any hair is kind of
struggling I live to do this I'm going
to the gym when I do I'm gonna be
outside for a long time and it's windy
like the other day right and I were
riding bikes and I was wearing my hair
like this and it really stayed in place
at all times just a quick little tip
whenever I want a wavy look I will sleep
in the brave and when I wake up and take
my hair out I've got more of like a wavy
look rather than curls so um give that a
try if you are looking for kind of an
overnight fix
right now I hope you are too I hope
you're feeling excited about some new
hairstyles for fall and I hope these are
easy enough you know like I said before
I don't like to fuss with my hair but I
do like different types of hairstyles so
I really hope this gave you some
inspiration so these products from
living proof are no longer exclusively
available at Sephora you can get them at
all retailers Saks Nordstrom old blue
mercury so definitely check them out
living proof has been one of my all-time
favorite brand for a long time now and
they just never disappoint with their
products there are two living proves to
newest products is the TVD multitasking
styler the one that I used quite a bit
it definitely like I just did so many
different hairstyles and put this in my
hair so many different times but yet it
still feels silky and smooth newest
product is the molding clay and this is
something that Ryan and I actually share
but it's basically what it says it is it
stays in place all day long and this is
probably my favorite thing to use on my
breakaway is right here around my face
