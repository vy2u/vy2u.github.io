time here welcome I hope you are here to
stay if you want a lover of style and
fashion and outfits then this is the
right place for you I styled seven
outfits including plaid into each outfit
and I know plaid is a big trend this
year I'm second be a little bit
intimidating just because it is such a
busy print that sometimes people are
like you know I don't want to invest too
much into plaid what's best for my
day-to-day lifestyle you know if you are
going to the office everyday then you
might want to invest in some trousers if
you work from home then maybe like a
cute dress comfy kind of depends so I
thought maybe I would shoot this video
and help you guys help clear up any
issues or any questions you might have
on how to style plaid so get out of this
video is some inspiration for seven
different outfits even if you aren't in
supply you can always swap your favorite
print in place of the plaid you know if
you like florals if you like stripes if
you don't like print at all hopefully
you can still take something away
my first outfit I did want to do some
sort of office inspired outfit so I
started with these trousers that I
absolutely love they're really
lightweight they're high-waisted they
have a really cute detailed belt a ring
belt and I don't know they just fit
really great they're so comfortable
because of the material and you can
honestly style them so many ways then I
added a basic black mock neck
because you don't want to compete with
the print of the pant you know you want
to add something basic on top not a lot
of print goes with plaid when it comes
to mixing prints I always try to stay
away from plaid added a long blazer over
this is more of a lightweight Duster
blazer so if you need something a little
bit more dressy for the office
definitely add your thick structured
office blazer it doesn't have to be a
duster to keep things simple I just did
some black sock booties you know again
you don't want to compete with the plaid
you kind of want to work around it add
your basics to it
I saw standing in the street alone spin
for my next look I took the same pair of
pants and created just a complete
opposite look well I did my life by
herself made t-shirt which is coming out
next week I believe so be on the lookout
for that info will be in the description
box course I added sneakers because no
graphic tee trouser look is complete
without sneakers you could do flats or
booties but I just love my sneakers
because they're comfy and then I did
this really pretty burgundy faux leather
jacket over it obviously you can do any
color you want but I really loved the
black white and burgundy and all
burgundy is always such a great color
for fall so I always get excited about
it so that is why I
so for my next outfit I did this is more
of like a casual you could dress it up
if you wanted to just depending on your
accessories and your shoes
I wanted to show you guys this coat from
River Island and most plaid coats are
gonna have some sort of color
incorporated into the pattern and I fell
in love with this coat because it has
this really blush pink color inside of
the pattern which I love blush pink and
I especially love it in a black and
white printed coat and it's just enough
to where you can only really tell that
it's pink if you're wearing something
pink or blush underneath but it really
brings it out so you know you can still
wear it with other colors throwing on a
plaid coat is for people who aren't so
crazy about print if you don't want to
be someone who's wearing print all day
long you can definitely just throw it on
over your outfit that way whenever you
get tired of it you can always take off
your coat and you're still left with
your basics just said my black
high-waisted jeans and these are my
favorite pair of high-waisted jeans
these are great as well as the motton
bow those are my two favorite pair but I
wanted to keep this outfit just super
casual like if it were a really cool day
and I was meeting someone for lunch or
for breakfast and I wanted to keep
things casual this is the sort of outfit
that I would wear it's very basic yet
the sleeve is really fun on the top it's
got the buttons and then the really long
bell sleeve our trumpet sleeve so I
really love
for my next outfit this is questionable
and if you can wear it to the office or
not and all my old jobs I could wear
something like this to work but it's not
for everybody you can obviously switch
out things that you you need if you want
to add tights to it if you want to add a
more dressy ankle bootie with tights
that's totally fine
I wanted to kind of get the point across
of pairing a dressy white top underneath
more of a revealing dress so you know if
you were wearing this dress alone it
would be very revealing not great for
fall but just adding this piece under it
just makes the whole outfit completely
different so you could do a top like
this you could do the black mock neck
top that I showed you earlier any sort
of basic black or white top you can
definitely throw on under this even red
or yellow with me so pretty also then I
did my over the knee boots just because
I just wear these any chance I can get
and I love them with dresses but again
you could do booties you know whatever
you want for work the whole point of
this outfit is to show the layering
aspect of the plaid and a solvent
next outfit I love plaid and I love
floral so when I saw this I was like oh
my gosh
obviously the key focus is the blazer
hood this in a style video last week but
you guys were begging me to style it in
other ways because a lot of you went and
bought it and you were like wait I don't
know how it's a stylist giving you two
outfits here persimmons bows so this one
is basically just a white button-down
dress love a good white button-down
dress I love it with sneakers with
booties with over-the-knee booties with
military style boots
there's also another outfit for work if
you wanted to add a trouser under it a
legging under it or wear it as is or the
next outfit I was also kind of going for
a work by because this blazer is so
dressy that why wouldn't you wear it to
work
I did this basic black dress a studded
belt to kind of compete with the blazer
but in a good way I really love the
whole look of the blazer and this does
on the belt I think it's just kind of a
clashing of clashing in a good way a
mixed metal and print and in both
outfits I just kept the booties and the
bags pretty simple just because you know
when you are dealing with plaid you
don't want you know a jeweled shoe a
printed shoe um I would just keep it
simple leather suede patent
this last dress is for those of us who
and just don't feel like putting a whole
plaid outfit together like you want to
incorporate plaid but you don't want to
deal with it so you just buy something
that has plaid already in it a one-piece
that you don't have to deal with
I love this dress I think it's so fun
the colors are great a slight yellow and
red I just love it and the fringe I love
the French on it my dog loves the fringe
on it I think there's a whole patch
missing because she got a hold of it
while I was shooting it added a military
boot to it just because I wanted to make
it a little bit more edgy sweatshirt
dress with some tweed some plaid
tweeting at the bottom so you could do a
sneaker you can do a bootie
military-style bootie but I didn't
really have an edgy look in this
lookbook so I did want to throw
something in there like that you guys
noticed I kept the bags and the booths
and the shoes pretty much all the same
just because you guys have such a wide
wide range of bags and shoes that I kind
of you know incorporate your own shoes
in your own bags into it I'm just kind
of showing you the outfits and how I
would style them and because like I said
plaid is such a bold statement print
that you don't want to overpower it with
a printed bag or a printed shoe you just
kind of want to start with your plaid
and just work your way around there have
one but a plaid Baker boy hat or a plaid
ray any sort of head wear for plaid is
also great because then it's like you're
just not into it completely but you want
a little bit I think that's a good
option or about like a wrap like a wide
wrap belt around a white button-down
would be great also this is the second
video in the series and I and you guys
loved the first one I was so happy so if
you are still loving this let me know
and give me suggestions on what you want
to see again I said this last week but I
