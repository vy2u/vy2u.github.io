you're new to my channel my name is
Ashley and this is my seven outfit
series this is where I take one one
trendy item or one item one topic and
make seven different outfits out of it
today I did eight outfits I don't know
what happened in the process of picking
out seven but one not added so I'm sure
you guys don't mind where they'll get
out of this video is hopefully some
inspiration when you're getting ready
for work I had someone comment on my
video a while back and they were like no
one gets this dressed up for work and I
think some people do I think a lot of
people like to I mean if you're watching
this you obviously love fashion so you
want to put stylish outfits together for
a work even if you don't love the whole
outfit you can definitely take some tips
some pieces some certain items and
incorporate them into your own lifestyle
and your own work environment if you
want to just say it really quickly that
everyone's where I know I say this every
time but everyone's dress code is so
different so you know if some of these
aren't up to your dress code if they're
a little too much a little not dressy
enough you know just kind of take this
as a whole you know don't don't say that
I'm telling you to wear this exact
outfit you know I just want you to get
some inspiration from this video and and
kind of all trip to your dress code
or in this first outfit I was busy
excited about taking an all-black outfit
and just adding a printed jacket to it I
live in all black obviously most of the
time so a lot of my closet is black and
I feel like when it comes to the office
all black is safe it's if it's like your
first day or you have a big meeting all
black is always a really safe option and
you can do like an optional printed
jacket on top of it did my all-black
obviously I did my Alison Olivia
button-down top now I really loved the
bow on the neck I just felt like it was
kind of a girly twist to just a classic
black button-down top did these trousers
from Topshop I styled these in many
different outfits in this video
they are my favorite they fit me really
great in the waist they're a little bit
baggy ER but not too baggy they still
look nice they look professional and
they show a little bit of ankle which I
know some of you guys don't like but
that's the look that I always love or
braid your own pants
if you don't love this look I wanted to
add something on top of it I wanted to
do kind of a cool bomber the whole point
was to do just a print over an all black
to have you know a printed blazer that
you love or a printed bomber that you
love it doesn't have to be you know
plaid or gingham or anything like that
just whatever you love try adding a
printed printed jacket this way if you
get tired of your print throughout the
day you're not stuck with it you can
take it off and then you're safe and
you're all black outfit
this look I really love the casualness
of it I like the idea of pairing a
sweater with some trousers and I really
love this sweater from Topshop because
it's cropped so you're not like drowning
not cropped where it shows your stomach
but it's cropped where you could wear it
with trousers and you don't look like
you're drowning in an oversized sweater
I think it's nice and tailored it is
thick so I mean unless your office is
the kind that's like a nice box inside
of it I would maybe get something a
little thinner because it is pretty
thick but I just love the look of this
it's casual it's comfortable but yet it
still looks put together at the same
time you're not drowning in material you
can find trousers like this pretty much
anywhere depending on whatever your
budget is they make these out forever21
all the way to you can find them on
revolve you know or all the way up to
designers spine trousers like this
anywhere it's just kind of getting the
inspiration to style around
a lot of you guys look at this and
you're like I would never wear that into
my office but I put this outfit together
and I thought it was really fun so I
kept it give me a break but I just
basically took this this is a dress from
Zara
just a regular blazer dress I have worn
and opened before as like an open jacket
but I thought it looked really nice
clothes because I was wearing the
leather leggings but I just added this
cream just a one of top shops like a
basic spot a really cute detailed neck
as well as a trumpet sleeve so when when
your arm sticks out of the blazer sleeve
you get this really nice like flowy
effect I think a white button-down would
look nice too it might kind of take away
from the button detail but I think you
could probably get away with it if it
were simple enough did I add it I wanted
something very slim on the bottom just
because the Blazer dress is a little
longer you know you don't want long on
top flowy on bottom because then you are
drowning in materials so I did some faux
leather leggings on the bottom and
called it a day and if you aren't crazy
about it you can definitely recreate it
in some sort you don't have to wear
frilly frilly top underneath you could
just do a regular mock neck long-sleeved
whatever you guys want I just thought
again we're back to a dress that has
kind of contrast to it so this dress
almost looks like you're wearing a tunic
top with a white button-down dress
underneath I love this look there's
something so like chic about it it looks
really cool I don't know I love it so
much but I paired it with the boots
again and this dress is a little bit
longer than the other one so that way
you just have a little bit of your leg
showing not a whole lot of leg which I
love that look um I even love like a
longer dress with boots so it's
professional it's chic but but you could
definitely you know do a heel you can do
tights you could add tights under this
with the boots and I love that it's Navy
I love doing Navy and winter I love Navy
and black in the winter and in the fall
I think there are two dark colors that
go so
the outfit is a little bit more on the
girly side you know you've got a skirt
you've got your bow neck top I started
with the same top as before with the tie
neck this top really it just goes with
anything you can do it with skirts
trousers I mean you can even wear it
with like jeans for the weekend so I
think this is a really good top to have
it's just basic with a detailed bow I
love it so much and I did it with this
skirt from Topshop and because I felt
like I needed something in the middle I
did a stun belt well it was like from
forever 21 but I know BCBG makes really
are they used to I haven't looked in a
while but I know they make really cool
stud belts but yeah this skirts so
comfortable this skirt is like
sweatshirt material I wear this with
graphic t-shirts and booties and like a
leather jacket for you know when I want
to dress it down but then you can also
dress it up when you're going to the
office or running to a meeting so I
think having skirts in your closet like
this on are very versatile will kind of
save you some money and having to buy
you know your off day skirts and then
your workday
we've got these trousers again and I
think it's good I think it's good you
know you you want to you don't want to
wear a new outfit like you you want to
reuse your items if you know what I mean
you know you don't want to have ten
pairs of black trousers obviously you
need enough to where you can keep up
with like the laundry so I think having
a variety but not going over the top is
isn't necessary just have a small
variety of trousers here at these with
just a basic camisole and I think this
is a very comfortable a very easy outfit
to put together they sell these
camisoles pretty much everywhere you
know you can buy them anywhere from
forever21
all the way to you like sex you know if
you want 100 percent silk or if you want
a different kind of material you can
find them anywhere and they're great for
layering again being versatile layering
them with a leather jacket on the
weekend airing them with a blazer for
work then I love this duster I think
this is such a fun take on a structure
just regular blazer sorry
okay well Stella will be joining us with
the video again this might not be dressy
enough for some of you guys some of you
guys might need to wear more structured
Blazers but I think this is very
versatile as well wearing it on the
weekends with the graphic tee wearing it
to work with a camisole and trousers um
I think items like this are really good
to have
so I absolutely love this dress I love
this outfit I actually wear this to a
meeting the other day at my office and I
just I love so much and I know obviously
a lot of you guys can't wear a cold
shoulder but the whole point of this
look is to kind of buy one piece have
that one dress that has something
interesting to it so it almost gives the
look of a white button-down under a
dress but it's not just has the
contrasting sleeves which i think is
such a good look it's a good color
blocking for black and white I paired it
with these knee boots and obviously you
could do tights with it if it's cold you
could do an ankle bootie a heel with
tights you know it doesn't necessarily
have to be a boot I just really love the
look
I love this this look is obviously very
masculine
it's very tomboy it's kind of men wear
menswear inspired which I really love
that look even if it's just adding
little touches like even if you just do
like a really girly outfit with just the
loafers I think that's such a cool look
as solid white button-down with the
black trousers to start with because
that was a pretty good starting point so
I grabbed this khaki jacket from Topshop
it's not pleated sleeves it's really
cool it's cropped which I love because
then that way you're not losing the
effect of the outfit you're not losing
your waist you've got a nice crop jacket
on and then I added the shoes to make it
menswear and these are so comfortable
I only out of heel if you want to make
it a little bit more girly because the
jacket is still pretty menswear when it
comes to work and getting dressed for
work and I'm the same I work from home
but I still like to get up and put an
outfit on for the day I just don't feel
I feel more productive I feel more
creative if I put a little bit of effort
into my outfit when I did work at my
office job I would put together my
outfits on Sundays I would try to put
them together for the whole week and it
was fun it's kind of like a fun thing to
kind of see what you can create
especially if I mean if you love if you
hate fashion and styling then that's
that's probably a terrible idea you
probably would hate that I'm assuming if
you're here and you're watching this you
love fashion and you love putting
outfits together so try to make it fun

go out and buy this whole new wardrobe
