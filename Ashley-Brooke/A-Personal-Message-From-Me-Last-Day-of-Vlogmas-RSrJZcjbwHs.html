all right when you need to vlog you have
no hands all right ready let's rock and
roll
my sweet us right first pretty sure I'm
out of gas

out of gas over here and Christmas Eve

Starbucks drive-through line right now

hard for Christmas dinner
okay how'd this it got my coffee in the
bag daily greens green lemonade green
aid it's only 15 calories in this whole
thing that's cool what I'll see what
I've been listening to so this is a
podcast that I like a lot
and this episode is pretty good so far
this guy is a productivity master giving
tips on how to be more productive and
not tax
want done
versus just sitting on a list
incomplete somewhere so that's good and
after that is done I'm gonna go back to
listening to this book that I've been
listening to on the drive here called
captivate by Vanessa van Edwards but
like a screen shot or something
that's pretty dang good I definitely
recommend that it's about like hacking
social not awkwardness with this girl
the author was like socially awkward and
she wrote the book on like how to hack
that punch of tests and I was like
research to back it up
basically tips and tricks on how to
better navigate social settings
relationships body language all that
kind of good stuff
very cool just drop my phone down here
at all hi so the first thing we had to
do when I got here was come and look at
the tree we're gonna go see Elf on a
shelf where could he be where we're
gonna be on the Christmas tree we there
wasn't much I could eat but I somehow
managed to eat a bunch of chips
we are hanging out and they're watching
football

Corpus Christi to go be with his family

grandparents number one done Christmas

when you touch jalapenos and then you
touch your other body parts getting a
laugh a nose where did radar you burning
your eye one time I was heading home
with piñas and got it on my armpit it
was so clean I answer that I do
we're about to go into church and Jael
there's Santa Claus and mrs. Claus and
froggy
I said a word zing you might be like hi

gonna come back get in our jammies watch
Christmas movies stay up till midnight
Sam till midnight and we have to put
cookies out for Santa we're gonna go now
all the doggies are asleep we were gonna
take you to look at Christmas lights
with us but we were walking around the
neighborhood and no one had hands we all
had like apple cider and candy canes
think Ryan got some footage he's using
his iPhone here's our fourth little elf
snowman pants I have an idea why don't
we get out that ice cream that we had
last my okay sure sure - see you later
it may give the end us well but
Christmas movie are we doing
a Christmas story wait Ralphie I've
never seen a Christmas story you have to
mom I swear the whole thing through I've
never seen I think I've seen because

seen the full Christmas Story movie how
do you feel oh no Rafi are we all having
a sleepover on the couch or no we watch
the 24-hour marathon of a Christmas
story this is like the third time that
it's played in a row we also read the
Christmas story I'm going and the girls

doll I got a bone for Christmas
I already ate all of it a boy from aunt

you got KY yeah we've had an eventful
day so far we decided we're not leaving
you want to my surprise mom has a shout
out all right yeah
what's your shoutout hurry up there on
the suspense is killing me
this is all Conner Blake Conner Blake is
your phone ringing wait hi Conner
hey Christmas Merry Christmas just just
stay well thank you I can't believe this
is the last day of vlogmas it has just
flown by but it was so much fun I just
want to thank all of you guys who
watched all the vlog myths and commented
and we're so sweet and it's so crazy
because today is my 100th vlog which is
insane I just feel like it's flown by
like I haven't even been doing YouTube
that long and I already have 100 vlogs
like I feel like I just started my
channel yesterday but I guess that it's
been 2 years almost 2 years now I'm
crazy
vlogging is something that is so almost
a little strange because it's almost
like you're letting people into your
life and into your home it's a lot
different than just shooting a hair
tutorial or a style video like you're
really opening up yourself to anybody
who wants to watch of how you do things
where you know the places you go all of
your family and friends a little scary
just kind of you know putting yourself
out there for people to see
and I just you know I just want to thank
all of you who are who are so sweet and
who laugh with us and are sad with us
and see our struggles and our
accomplishments it's really something
that we've enjoyed sharing with you guys
and we're gonna continue to do so
because it's something that we do love
to do we like to take you along with us
with places we go and really share the
experience so it's really cool so I want
to end log myths and in my hundredth
episode from my very first clips
actually my very first clips in front of
the camera like you can't actually
I know I put him at this one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
