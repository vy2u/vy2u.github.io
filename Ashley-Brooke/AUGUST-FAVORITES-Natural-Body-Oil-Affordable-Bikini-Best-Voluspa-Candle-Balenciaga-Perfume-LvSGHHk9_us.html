doing a favorites video today because I
haven't done one in a while if even ever
gonna be mostly a beauty products with
like a few little random things here and
there so we'll just go ahead and get
started into the first product my first
product is covergirl makeup primer and
this is for dry skin I have combination
skin but my drier parts are drier than
my oily parts are oily if that makes any
sense so this is great for underneath my
eyes which I get really dried I can
honestly tell a huge difference from
when I put this on and then when I don't
put it on I just feel like my makeup
stays on so much longer so this stuff is
awesome and I just got it a couple of
weeks ago and I'm like already half way
through because it's awesome my next CD
product is my Maybelline BB cream and
this is a medium sheer tent so this is
the medium color and it just like blends
right into my skin it's my perfect shade
i it's so hard me to find the BB cream
that isn't too like orange I don't know
I keep buying these beauty creams that
are so orange and I look like an oompa
loompa I have been living in this stuff
all summer long because it's so hot and
my foundation just melts right off my
face still covers up any dark circles or
imperfections that you might have but
it's light enough like a lotion so you
barely even know that it's there I love
you baby cream I will put some of my
NARS powder on top of it just to keep it
from creasing or you know smearing
mirror my next two products are actually
oils and I am in love with both of them
equally for different reasons my first
one is just a plain coconut oil and I
found this a t.j.maxx and then when I
got up to pay the bottle looks like
craft at the tops so I had to put it
back and I couldn't find another one it
was like tragic
googled it and actually found it on
walmart.com and I use this for my body
when I get out of the shower it smells
amazing it's not one of those like yucky
coconut smells it's like a delicious
coconut smell smell it looks really
pretty on my counter it's a really
pretty bottle it's got a squeezy one of
these squeezy things I'm not really sure
what that's called what's this called a
dropper yeah it's got like a dropper and
I will warn you it's a little greasy
when you put it on but once you get it
rubbed in and it sinks into your skin it
feels really nice so just give it a sec
to like warm up and sink into your skin
it says for face body and hair but I do
not put it on my face or my hair because
it's got ingredients that I just don't
know about I mainly just use this for my
body and the reason why is because I
have discovered this stuff and this
means the oil in French and I am not
even going to try to pronounce it I
practice before this this video but I
literally cannot say it the guy who
makes it Jordan is amazing he's a genius
for creating this it is all that sin it
is 7 all natural oils I use this on my
ends before I go to bed at night and my
hair is just so dry that it soaks up the
oil and I can tell a huge difference in
the morning so I put it in my hair
before I go to bed I put it on my skin
on my face it's like the only oil I
trust on my face otherwise I'll break
out this is the only oil I have found
that does not break out my skin anything
with all natural oils is one of my
favorite things because I think that is
the key to aging and just the key to
like flawless or just skin so so happy I
got this I am it exceeded all my
expectations and I'm so excited for this
next I
a hot spoon Balenciaga this is my that's
upside down wait nope my blend spiaggia
perfume
I am almost out of got a little bit left
and I've got a backup in my nightstand
so this has been at my scent for last
winter all the way through the summer
and will continue to be through next
winter because I'm obsessed with it so
good it stays on all day I can wear it
to work and when I get home wearing
tickle is so good did you just spray
your perfume and I'm like no so this
stuff actually laughs obsessed with it
my next favorite at the moment is a
Pandora and this is a value spa candle
this was my favorite like years ago when
writing my first met and then
anthropology just like stopped selling
the scent and I panicked and had a
moment where I didn't know what I was
gonna do but I was at Ricky's not that
long ago I was so happy this is I keep
going through them like this one's
almost empty but here is the name of
this one is ebony and peach and it is
the best value of all Kendall that
exists another one of my favorite
products right now is my babe hat from
Urban Outfitters and I've just been
doing so much traveling lately and I
need to be covering up my hair because
airplane hair is not cute and it's
usually dirty hair so this has been a
lifesaver the past few weeks for me like
running errands and stuff like I don't
want to like fix my hair to go out to do
that so I usually just throw this on
over it and I love it just be done with
it my last favorite is this bathing suit
that I got from Target here is the
bottom it's black and then it's got the
crocheting on the side and it's just a
basic triangle top with the same kind of
crocheting
I thought it was so pretty because these
are normally so expensive that have this
detailing on it but this one was like 30
something dollars for the whole thing I
believe so I had to have it and I loved
it so much I would totally try this on
you guys right now but I just ate a huge
omelet three waffles then I ate a pack
of Junior Mints so I will not be trying
this on really cute take my word for it
