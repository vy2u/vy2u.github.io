somewhere
good morning guys happy Sunday hi what
time is it it is 7:30 and I'm finally
able to vlog because it's daylight but I
was up in about 6:30 this morning
getting some last-minute things ready
for the video that goes live today and
watch the news had my coffee I like my
morning routine just kinda check in with
you guys this morning I've got a call at
10:00 and then I have a Facebook live
with my life by her girls on our
Facebook group at 11:00 and then I will
touch back touch back in touch back in
check back in with you guys then just
let you know like what we're doing for
the rest of the day cool things to talk
about one kind of like a big thing that
I'm excited about
why are you like why can't you just let
me talk to my people here
later than when I last talked to you
guys
I just went did a quick workout showered
up and now I'm about to have a cheat
meal because it's Sunday and I'll
explain to you after I cook and eat my
food why I have a cheat meal and what
exactly this means to me so stay tuned
but I'm about to make something I'm out
to be chef Ashley and I'm gonna make
something really awesome and I wasn't
gonna do this until later tonight but
this actually got here sooner than
expected so I'm gonna do it now and son
basket actually sponsored this part of
the video and here is my lovely box
basket is a meal kit delivery service
Mayson organic and sustainable produce
right to your front door and the reason
I love this is because for the first
time I don't have to substitute anything
because they offer vegan options I think
they do
paleo vegan vegetarian so like any type
of meat that you might have for your
lifestyle is met which is really cool
but before I've had to like take the
cheese out I'm just kind of ruins the
whole thing so it's nice to have like a
vegan option I know everything is
perfect for my diet so all good
you also do gluten-free and like family
style as well so you can order for your
family if you have a larger family
obviously it's just Ryan and I so it's
just this is just for two people that
being said there's actually like 18
different recipes to choose from so
you're bound to find something that you
like out of 18 I had such a hard time
picking but I actually picked these
little this little catalogue of
everything eggplant lasagna with white
beans and baby greens
I mean I'm starving so I cannot make
this fast enough so there might be a
change of plans I actually just realized
that they sent me pita pockets too and
so I don't know but you think right
eggplant lasagna or the pita pockets
via Waga pita pockets hold on I'm gonna
go
that's all beer back decided to go with
the pita pockets because the Brad looked
just so good so that's what I'm doing
but I mean like how good do these
veggies look they actually work with the
best organic farms to provide like the
freshest and organic produce that's out
there so it's really good kind of
knowing where all of these fresh
vegetables are actually coming from
it's what they look like and I'm cannot
wait I already tried the the filling
earlier and it's just so good you can
either go to the description box below
or go to some basket comma slashes I
just need to get / Ashley that's a
tongue twister
to get $35 off of your first order I'm
gonna buy it just picked up a little bit
apartment is so smokey stole from the
food that I cook Thai coconut oil
every time I burn coconut oil like it
doesn't smell as bad as olive oil but it
makes my apartment ten times smokier so
I don't know so I turned the fan on
until I get again it's circulating and
yes this is the third time that I have
changed clothes today sir about to go
for leaving so I had changed before we
leave I thought I would just tell you
guys that I hired a trainer / nutrition
coach and I am on my first full week
you're probably wondering why I hired a
trainer / fitness coach how I found out
about him and what gave me the
motivation to hire this person Ryan
actually hired him about a month before
we went to Mexico Ryan worked his ass
off for a month straight gym twice a day
eating tons and tons of food just like
kicking ass like and his I mean his body
like transformed within a month it was
insane how hard he worked and like his
results so I decided that I would reach
out to this person that Ryan's working
with and work with him also and you know
when he asked me what my goals were my
goal is I want to gain I want to gain
weight
I want to gain muscle I want to make
sure that I'm eating enough I want to
know my macros and make sure that I'm
hitting them every day I hired him to
and I started a week ago today and I am
doing fasted cardio in the morning 3
times a week and I know that this is for
fat loss and people are like why are you
doing that why are you doing fasted
cardio and you know he says it's for a
basic digestive health and just Oh
all health I am eating so much
throughout the day it is insane I'm
eating four large meals plus three
protein shakes a day and no sugar no
sugar at all I can't even have berries
like it's so hard for me because you
guys know how much I love sweets and I
love cupcakes and stuff like that so on
Sundays I get to have like sugar and
unhealthy stuff okay I shouldn't say
that I don't get a cheat day I get a
cheat meal so that is why I did some
basket today and why we're going to get
cupcakes because I'm putting all the
stuff on insta stories and everyone's
like why do you have a trainer why are
you doing fasted cardio and I was like
oh my god I guess I just need to like
come out and explain what I'm doing but
I'm really really excited you know I've
always been a little self-conscious
about my weight just because I am so
skinny and I literally I eat so much
food and I just don't gain weight and
I've always been like that and it and of
course you know when people rub it in my
face in the YouTube comments is it sucks
but that's not the reason that I'm doing
this I'm doing this for my own my own
well-being and my own personal help and
personal development and I hired someone
who really knows what they're talking
about and it's really really really good
and so attentive seeing his results
before and afters so I bought the
three-month plan from him and I did a
lot of research before I chose somebody
but after seeing like Ryan's results and
what Ryan's doing I just was like
copycat and and grabbed this guy from
Ryan first of all today I can barely
even move I'm so sore
just from lifting weights I'm like so
sore and I'm just constantly so full and
miserable every single day but I feel
like your stomach gets used to that much
food after a while it's a lot of like
rice quinoa greens tons and tons of
proteins tofu tempeh a lot of PT b cuz
my stomach gets a little weird if I had
too much soy so
alternate between the two so yeah you
will be seeing some more workout videos
in the vlogs you will not be seeing a
whole lot of cooking because I am eating
pretty much the same thing like every
single day yes so I just kind of wanted
to tell you guys like what I've been up
to in that fit in this world how it goes
I will post a before and after at the
end of the three months so you guys can
see hopefully there's some you know
weight gain and all the right places and
so but now it is Sunday I've been
looking forward to this day all week I'm
going to get some damn cupcakes hey I
don't care if it's raining or not we are
going to storage Brian Ryan
fine I'm gonna go by myself all right
ready we put that in your backpack do
you like how I have my boob pads right
here my back was brawl I was four I
guess oh no I just washed it I just set
it here to dry it's cleaning day
just open the door to our groceries okay
all right why is there a benefit dog
food this 100% is not ours yeah we know
were that but this is ours anymore
what um toilet paper this is ours but we
didn't get our paper towels so when you
order Amazon fresh they use a reusable
tote so you just set it outside your
door and on your next order they pick it
up for you thinking you're super cool
a leopard jacket
you know bro I saw this chick image in
the other day in a leopard onesie
jumpsuit but it was gym clothes yeah
yeah maybe she was doing yoga
she was very ready to workout like like
look at me because she just sat there
for most of the time well she you gotta
wear your leopard onesie somewhere and I
like where her head was at though she
was there to work like an outfit not so
much in like actual practice are your
calves so sore the calves are always
sore I guess you just have to learn to
live with daily sore calves I can barely
reach the top shelf anyways so now I
double can't reach it because I can't
get on my toes
a table
better horses
I was like oh we get to see more of the
city

napkin but maybe I want to play I don't
