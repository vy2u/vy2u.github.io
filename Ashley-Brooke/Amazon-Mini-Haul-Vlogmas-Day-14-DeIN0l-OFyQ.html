started shooting how to style and it's
what time is it 2:30 so two hours a day
light four outfits we don't know what's
the top one it's castor oil
the subscribers mention in the comments
that she mixes castor oil with coconut
oil and it's really good for your hair
you just knocked it out
I know it's numb oh let me open those
boxes what you got here you've got some
avocado hummus carrots in the suja nice
let's grab these boxes I already opened
one sorry I couldn't wait so this one is
the castor oil that you guys were
telling me about in the comments I know
she said she got it at Whole Foods but I
just went ahead and ordered it on Amazon
and it's home health capture oil gonna
be mixing this with my coconut little
treatments for my hair so I'm excited
about that
next is a hard case or my computer
excited about this
my gosh this isn't like ten different
rappers perfect so pretty how do you
know what's the back what's I like that
it's math like it's not one of those
super glossy covers it's like a very
matte finish it feels really good I've
got a keyboard cover also I ordered the
pink one and I also ordered a gold one

looks like

whose laptop is you guy no clue what
this is so really good healthy stuff
here by vital proteins the collagen
beauty greens premium reserves beauty
collagen marine collagen you could put
this like in your tea or in your coffee
and it's unflavored so and then we've
got some collagen peptides brochures on
all three to kind of stay like what they
do what they're for some recipes this is
really cool I've actually been looking
for stuff like this
so I'm gonna give this a try and I will
get back to you guys on the situation so

pretty fly for a right thigh so someone
asked if Ryan and I have friends and if
we socialize with other people no why
why would we why do we why would you
talk to people but seriously okay a
minute choke hold for a second do you
have friends we do socialize but steps
to remember you've only gotten kind of
this vlogmas peak in the month of these

of November and then we're gonna be gone
for the last half of December's so it
was like we had so much work to catch up

right now is really busy most of my
friends are in Texas and other places I
do have friends here in New York I just
haven't seen them this month because
