Merry Christmas you filthy animal hi
guys so this is my first time walking
today and it's 5 o'clock but I have been
in bed all day long I just felt so much
worse today than I have any of the other
days that I've been sick so I just
stayed in bed I'm like I worked on the
lookbook a little bit but that's about
it
like my body hurts like my skin on my
hair I like my muscles hurt but Ryan
went to the store and got me some cold
and flu medicine and that helps a little
bit no not too much though I think I
just need to like go to bed early
tonight and just rest but I don't want
to skip a day of vlogging this so I'm
just kind of blog I'm gonna make some
soup for myself because I need to get up
and do something so I'm gonna make some
soup and then we'll answer some comments
and then I'm going to go to bed no and I
was gonna open packages today but I'm
gonna do that tomorrow we'll open some
packages tomorrow but I keep saying this
but I'm tomorrow I know I'm gonna feel
better every time I say that I just feel
worse so for like five days now it's
gotta be I've got to be almost over it I
don't know how these things work but
thank you for going to get my medicine
today you see and you made me lunch
you're just gonna cost you one for
everyone in LA there's like crazy fires
right now so everyone's okay looks
insane like straight out of a movie very
very crazy so I'm gonna start my soup by
filling up not filling up but putting a
few cups of vegetable broth in there and
then while Ryan goes and gets the
packages I'm gonna chop up all the
veggies and show you what I'm putting in
I forgot to take the camera with me but
I've acquired the packages I wouldn't
have been able to get the packages up
here I just take the camera so that
worked out but you guys did miss like a
five string quartet fits in the lobby
right now playing Christmas music it was
pretty exciting are you very interested
yeah I would but I don't want to also I
just want you know that it's pretty dark
on the camera right now success shall we
open the boxes
take longer to cook so I've got potatoes
celery carrots and cauliflower so I'm
just gonna dump this in alright here is
my lamb that I ordered like clear with
golds and then it's got a dark wood
stand we'll open it up it looks like so
for my soup toppings I'm gonna do I'm
cooking a cup of super grains I'm going
to steam some chopped kale also gonna
grill some filled feel gross who makes
this
I guess the field roast makes this right
yeah yeah so this is like what the
packaging looks like so I'm probably
just gonna cut off these two right here
I've got the quinoa going here and then
the soup here Oh dinner's ready
here's my new lamp it's very bright
because there's obviously no like cover
but I thought the glass was really cool
see how it looks during the daytime I
don't know here's what dinner looks like
we've got the soup on the bottom and
then the quinoa and then the kale and
then the sausage I didn't get a whole
lot of sausage because I don't know I
just still don't really have that much
of an appetite summoning the rest for a
rye rye yes more sausage for you it was
soup that suit was delish
it's one it's going hard on that cashew
milk snickerdoodle that's what my phone
keys Capeman big news
did you see big news big news Oh big
news I was like not fake news I took the
plastic off all right well first of all
we got oh all right I'm back so I guess
the first thing I wanted to address in
the comment section was how cool you
guys are about the Christmas thing you
know you were like oh we don't need to
see Christmas stuff every single day
that's unrealistic and I totally agree
totally agree I'm not to crop out all of
these kaufe tax Oh too dark too dark
friends joining me for comment answering
we're both like this yeah it's very
awkward I wonder how many jets yeah
Ashley valid point getting sick is a
classic Christmassy thing to do
how true is that most if you don't get a
cold between November and December and
then I don't know what my life you're
living check this out from Hellena
my boyfriend I've watched every single
one of your vlogs from the beginning
with us I find so many cute things it's
our own Top Shop but find it so hard to
justify spending a hundred dollars on
one piece because what if it's not in
style the next season yeah I totally
like I get that if you see an item you
like and you just feel like you can
justify spending the money on a trendy
item then definitely don't
there are dupes you know out there over
21 it's specially trendy item just
because they come and go but if it's an
item that you think is is you know kind
of like a classic piece that you would
wear never go out of style then
definitely save or invest something like
that rather than a trendy item oh my
gosh best wait oh my gosh I already read
it wrong cutest street ever what's its
name gonna be oh man what does she look
like to you don't be cryin she heard
that stops no you know what I kind of
feel like it's a boy it's Melvin how
about like an old name like from the 20
to 30 seconds kind of related to trees
Blanche
no what do you guys think we'll let you
name the tree do most New Yorkers use
storage units when we got our storage
unit the guy said that like most people
there everywhere there is storage units
all over the place I mean we don't we
don't know I don't like there's like 12
million people tell 12 million meeting
in 12 million dollars million people in
the city

jail for that actually people you talk
more about lip injections what type of
fillers and how often do you get them
done when's the last time I had fillers
years ago like five years ago yeah long
I think I've had them done like twice
once before I met Ryan and once after I
met Ryan like five years ago five and
six years ago I got wrestling one time
and then I got Juvederm the other time
and I remember liking them both and I
honestly it was so long ago I can't even
remember the difference like I know one
of them looks more plumping and the
other one lasts longer but I can't
remember I always tell people when they
ask me and they just need to like put
their finger here press their lip down
like this and it'll you'll see what you
love what you might look like see what
you would look like with lip injections
