favorites video I haven't done one in a
little while so I decided it was time as
I have accumulated some new things so
we've got like bra some food food always
some hair products of makeup and some
really random things - because it
wouldn't be a favorite video without
some random things I will start with my
hair products first so I will do these
two together my stylist Bianca who is
amazing I will put all of her info down
below I Bianca recommended these
products to me is an anti breakage serum
that I just spray all over my hair as
soon as I get out of the shower right
before I blow dry and then I also have a
heat protector spray that I spray on my
dry hair before I straighten and on my
wet hair before I blow-dry says that
she's just seen complete hair
transformations with both of these items
so I picked them up and loving them both
so far she almost had a heart attack
when I told her that I didn't use a heat
protectant she was like why since whit I
was like I know I know
next I have my rose hair elixir by the
innate life and I usually do this before
I go to bed so my hair can really soak
up the oil there can get pretty dry so
if I put this on before bed I feel like
I wake up a little bit more with
moisture moisturized ends rather than
dry in and I also do it right after
right straighten just to add some
additional moisture so it doesn't look
so dry you like rose rose scented things
and you'll love this because it's
definitely rose nted hence my my and my
humble samples along right now pretty
sure ryan use to actually infuses it
because he always smells like roses next
is one of my random items it is my
grapefruit all natural oil that i like
to put in my shower and the person that
takes a shower before i go to bed and
when I wake up so I like to alternate
between is kind of what I'm going to
move forward but any oil will work I
recommend lavender before bed and pepper
and grapefruits in the morning I've got
a nail polish I've been getting so many
questions about my nail polish that I've
been wearing lately it's just like this
blushing nude pink color is Sally Hansen
color therapy argan oil formula in the
color chai on life I always have the
hardest time keeping the more expensive
brands on like butter I feel like they
flake but Tam the Sally Hansen always I
can always challenge Sally Hansen if I'm
going on vacation or something I know my
audience is going to ask all my nails so
I love this color it's a great intro to
spring very nudist very classic
let me back next I will jump into my
lipsticks because I've been getting a
lot of questions about my lip color
lately so I've been pretty much rotating
3 for the past couple of weeks so the
first one I have is by Tarte and it is
the purply purply color that I've been
wearing and it's called salt life I'm
gonna focus there we go
no as I move I like these lipsticks by
heart because they aren't so pigmented
so therefore when I just kind of want a
hint of color like you can do I do one
layer if I just want a little hint and
then I can go ahead and go over it again
if I'm wanting something a little bit
more dramatic so that's why I like these
Tarte lipsticks because for me
they're quite buildable on my mouth my
next two lip products are biased ela and
they are the stay all day liquid
lipsticks I'm actually wearing this one
right now it is called firenzi and then
this one is called caramel oh and I love
these to go on liquid and then they dry
matte a lot of you guys have been asking
me how do you keep matte lipsticks from
cracking and from you know making your
lips chapped and I'm putting my other
makeup on I like to put some coconut oil
on my lips and it really gives the
deathlike extra moisture that I need and
then I'll kind of down my lips and then
put the scylla over it and it usually
locked me about 6 hours until it's
start to notice kind of a chat look and
then I have to wash it off but yeah
that's my little tip my little ash tip
for you sure you guys are you know so
next I have been loving bralette
I don't know why I go through these
phases where I only wear bra less and
I'm going through one right now so my
first one is this little black one with
cream lace trims really tiny but it's
not as like folded them so this one is
from Urban Outfitters and I find that
urban Free People and forever 21 is
actually come out with simulated bra
Leslie so that's where I get most of my
from Calvin Klein makes great ones but
this one is just so comfortable the lace
is really thin and soft and then my next
one is from forever 21 and it's this
really pretty dusty rose color and it's
a lot going on obviously this is kind of
what it looks like in the front I feel
like this is a very basic bra less of
some fun details so you know there's no
padding there's no wire it's basically
just like the best stretchy material
ever it washes nicely dries nicely so
that's easy when you can just the room
in the washing machine next I have to
buy that's for the fact I have been
carrying on repeat I go through those
phases as well where I carry like the
same two or three bags on rotation and
switch out the first one is this little
chain almost like a chain wallet from
Zara and it's got gold on one side and
rose gold on the other side and it's got
silver hardware so it pretty much kind
of goes with everything because it's got
all three colors on it that I would need
to match any of my outfit very small
it's definitely hold possibly maybe two
things definitely not a lip gloss or
definitely not my keys let my phone in
my wallet for short I next bag is this
one from who what where so cute I love
it it's a little mini bucket bag with
gold ring handles just the cutest little
thing and I think the color is so great
this color goes with you know my dark
brown boots my tan my light brown in my
face
so this bag really has been going with a
lot of things that I
wearing and I love that it has a long
strap as well no closure so it kind of
have to be careful on you know if you're
like upside down if you like walking
through crowded streets I'm always like
carrying my purse like this like a 90
year old woman it's so cute
so I've been loving this my next item is
food mmm as most of you know Ryan and I
went on a plant-based diet I deafening
burgers - potato burger quinoa burger
but they're such a pain to make food
processor I have to have ladder to get
it so it's kind of a pan but when I want
to make a burger and I have to like do
the whole measuring and all the
ingredients so I found dr. Frager who
has completely changed my life
plant-based burgers obviously at
gluten-free vegan non-gmo all the back
good stuff and I love you so much this
is my favorite flavor
it is the kale veggie burger but I also
like tex-mex they have an Asian style
and I have something else
Oh like a colored greens one but the
camel is definitely my favorite so weird
because I don't like to eat them as
burgers like I don't use a bun I like to
put them over like shaved Brussels or
like a taco salad I'll put the tex-mex
over taco salad or I'll just smother it
and ketchup love these if you guys are
on a plant-based diet go on the hunt for
a doctor burger love dr. Berger love
salient so it wouldn't be a proper haul
if I didn't throw in my favorite candle
I am obsessed with candles that I
usually have about six spread around my
apartment at once usually only one of
them going I like to burn one down and
then start a new one keith was having a
volume spa candle fela buy one get one
half off not good for me I got so many
crews three or four now and I have found
my favorite and I actually repurchased
it again because I full price that says
a lot because I hate paying full price
for expensive candles I thought the
pomegranate blood orange I lit for like
five minutes
and then the whole room smell so works
really
well and when you blow it out your
apartment your room still smelled like
that bird until the end of the day so I
really really love this next is
something so silly but I promise you're
going to love it and it's a silk
pillowcase and I'm sure a lot of you
guys I'm probably late on the train
getting into this sleep on this side of
my face and I started noticing that I
was getting breakouts right here I
looked it off googled it I do not get
breakouts anywhere but on this side of
my face and I was like what's happening
I don't talk on the phone so it's that
it could be if you sleep on that side it
recommended to get a silk pillowcase
because it doesn't collect oil on your
face I ordered this one from Amazon I'll
link it below for you guys I ordered
this one only has it cleared off the
breakouts on my face but it also has
helped my hair so much like I said I
sleep in oil so sometimes I'll wake up
in the morning and my hair it's like
knotted and tangled but I wake up with
this smooth hair now that I've switched
to a silk pillowcase when I'm sure there
are so many other benefits to it but
those are my main two and I bought Ryan
one too and he like loves it so funny
like gonna buy silk to Logan do you hear
yourself right now is it for my
favorites I love doing favorites videos
because I love talking about my favorite
things so I will definitely do more of
these I know you guys like those or
you've at least told me you like them
don't forget to like this video if you
liked it that way you know I should keep
doing favorites share it comment what
you loved about it comment if you use
any of the stuff because I kind of like
to know you know if somebody has a
different opinion or if somebody else
loved the two so let me know if you use
any of these products so as that is all
I have for you guys today I hope you
loved it
and I will see you guys in my next video
