I'm in Texas today and I know I always
put out a style video on Sunday but
today I am putting out and ask anything
QA because it's it was my sister's
birthday so we really didn't have a
chance to step out in film outfit so
it's the Q&amp;amp;A day which is good because
you guys have been asking a lot of
questions first let me just say there
are a lot of questions in this QA about
YouTube and the way I do things just a
disclaimer you know if my answer is kind
of contradicting to something that
another youtuber is doing kind of going
against what someone else is doing this
is just kind of how I do my thing so I'm
not passing judgment if somebody does
anything different everyone has their
own way of doing things so I just wanted
to let you guys know that if you guys
want to follow along I put all of the
questions in the description box so and
I'm gonna I think I'm gonna try to do a
time stamp so if you want to fast
forward you can definitely do that but
I'll also put the question on the screen
right here in case you forget who are
all of the new team members and what do
they do I don't have all of you guys in
the comments always refer to people as
my interns I don't have any interns
I have zero interns Jenna who is my
editorial assistant so Jenna works on
the lookbook the life by her lookbook
with me and that's all she does Sam who
works on the back end of things for life
by her so no one works for me on the
YouTube side of things that's just me
ryan films and I have Caroline my agent
who manages my inbox that is completely
it on the life by her side I have Jenna
and I have Sam no interns we have two
paid employees Jenna and Sam you guys
were asking about Dara Dara got a job
which is great you know we were so
excited for her we kind of hired her you
know with the understanding that she was
also looking for a job so of course when
she found one we were so happy for her
so now we are just down Dara but we
still love her very much and keep in
contact with her I know you guys miss
her because you always ask about it I
also have misty who was a subscriber but
now she manages the Facebook group for
the life by her Facebook group funny how
things work out you know she was a
subscriber I had no idea who she was and
then we
friends we text every day so she is
definitely part of the life by her team
so she manages the Facebook group and
does an amazing job at that all right
question number two
speaking of misty this is from misty if
it could work with any brand what brand
would it be oh my gosh um I haven't
worked with a lot of makeup brands and I
would love to work with tarte just
because they're products i use mostly
only tarte and their products are vegan
and cruelty-free which i love and they
just work really well and i love the
packaging and i just love their overall
brand so probably tart i know there's
probably more but that's just what comes
off the top of my head oh my god do you
rather read roller coasters all day or
lick the bottom of your shoe after
walking around the city like that
question just giving me anxiety i don't
know because both would make me throw up
and I have like a phobia of throwing up
so I'm just having an overall panic
attack right now I can't answer that but
motivated you to start your YouTube
channel I was working retail on the
visual merchandising side and I loved
doing it because I really loved creating
beautiful window displays and creating
outfits for mannequins but I knew that
there was just something more I wanted
to do I wanted to inspire people through
my own personal style and I remember
every day on my lunch break I would just
have my computer and I would go sit on a
park bench I would just think like what
can I do what can I do I know there's
something I want to do I just can't
figure it out they just wanted to be
myself and create something and put out
there and hopefully reach people and
help them and help them understand their
personal style and you know throw along
some product recommendations and it just
kind of fell into YouTube you know I did
my first hair tutorial and kind of loved
it I was very scary at first I was like
I don't know this was kind of weird but
ended up just kind of snowballing from
there and here we are you yeah what
makes your style different from other
fashion youtubers and bloggers um I
don't know about different but I know I
always stay true to myself I wear
something in one of my videos and it was
so last year I'll still wear if I love
it
I'm gonna wear it if I see something I
love I'm gonna buy it and I'm gonna
style it even though if I see something
on the hanger and I'm like uh I'm not
gonna put that in a YouTube video
because it might not appeal to everybody
know if I like it I'm going to wear it
so I really try to stay true to my own
style no matter what and that's why if a
clothing brand reaches out to me and
they're like oh we would like to partner
up with you and promote our clothes if I
don't like their clothes I'm not gonna
do it what is your go-to nail color
anything dark even in the summer I'm
always doing like Navy or something I
like a nude every now and then but I
mostly live in darker nail colors as I
don't have anything on right now I just
peeled it all off next what would you
say your is your biggest inspiration and
motivation to work each day and stay
positive my future probably I have I
have so many goals and I have so many
things that I want to accomplish and I
think that's what keeps me motivated is
the end goal you know um I don't wake up
every day and say oh I can't wait to get
this video edit or I can't wait to get
this blog post out you know I wake up
saying oh you know in five years from
now this is what I want for myself so
that's kind of what keeps me motivated
and keeps me going is knowing that I
have future goals in mind and that if I
get up and work hard every day and
really put forth effort into everything
I do put a hundred percent then I'll
reach those goals so much faster have
you ever struggled with any mental
illness or personal obstacles and how
did you overcome them
mental illnesses no I've never struggled
from a mental illness so no obstacles
just not knowing what I wanted to do I
mean there was probably like a four five
year period where I just had no clue
what I wanted to do there are people who
go into schools saying I'm gonna be a
doctor I'm gonna be a nurse and they
just do it you know but there's so many
people that just have no clue and it's
so scary because you think about okay
where am I going to be in five years if
I have no clue what I want to do with my
life so that was definitely a personal
obstacle and it messes with your head I
mean I'm not an emotional person I don't
get emotional I would cry about it like
I would actually sit down and just
my eyes out because I just like was so
scared of seeing myself in the future
because I had no clue what it looks like
what is your usual day like and how do
you structure it to get work done and
stay motivated I think it's about
getting into a routine yeah no one wants
to wake up early that's actually I do
like to wait really but there are some
days where I'm like okay I just want to
stay in bed but I do think it's about
getting on a routine I think it takes
maybe two weeks to get on a solid
routine so you know if you want to wake
up early set your alarm early every
morning and I promise you in about two
weeks you will see your body will start
waking up on its own same thing with the
gym same thing was eating right once you
get into a routine and get into a
lifestyle change
then it'll just start to become who you
are my usual day looks like it's my days
different every day but for the most
part my routine is you know wake up
write in my journal coffee gym breakfast
emails and then I have a to-do list that
I have just it's just a simple Google
Doc I know Ryan uses an app for his
to-do list but mine's just a Google Doc
and I just try to time increment myself
so I'll work on this for one hour this
for two hours and I'll just mark it off
as I go and in the next day if I didn't
complete the day before I'll just drag
it down so it's all about to me time
increments because I can sit there and
work on the lookbook for five hours and
I'm like oh my god word at the day go so
I really try to break everything up into
like one two and three hour increments
much money to you and Ryan put away in
savings each month we put away a certain
percentage each month and we actually I
so recommend a financial planner a
financial advisor for savings wise so he
always tells us like what is what is the
least amount that you can put away each
month like what would you just not even
notice going out of your bank account
each month the number of like what would
you what was what is the number you
would set aside that you would be like
struggling to pay rent like barely
getting by and then meet in the middle
and then put that amount away in savings
each month that's just what our guide
tells us but I really recommend you know
if you're really serious about saving
and all of that find a financial adviser
what are your key tips to develop a
personal style spending your own
personal style is pretty much just kind
of you just knowing what you like and
you don't have to just like one certain
thing like don't think you have to just
like girly things or edgy things you can
like whatever you want you make it your
own that's what's so great it's your
personal style so don't be afraid don't
be afraid to love something even though
it's not on trend or it's not in style
or you know any of the above just know
what you like read is your new dog she
is an English cocker spaniel I'm gonna
do a plug go follow her at it's Stella
girl you and Ryan what kids and when are
you planning on moving back to Texas yes
we definitely want kids no plans to move
back to Texas as of right now we we just
come visit family and we love it so much
but we're we're good in New York right
now are you and Ryan deal when you're
upset with each other and your number
okay there's two questions actually girl
you asked a lot of questions in this one
I'll start with number one and Ryan deal
when you're upset with each other try to
work it out write that in there you know
if something's wrong and we're just
butting heads we try to stop arguing
like okay what is the deal like what's
going on why are we like what's the root
of the problem and sometimes if it's
just like a little too heated we do have
to walk away and it's good you know you
wanna one person go in this room one
going the other clear your head think
about it meet back in ten minutes and
discuss it and usually you know if
you're calm you can come to a solution
we have a role like no yelling no
cursing at each other it's just
disrespectful it's rude and you're not
gonna get anything done that way so
those are my tips number one tip to grow
your audience as far as SEO analytic
tricks I don't have any like tricks but
you know growing your audience I think
is just finding a niche that you you
know belong in you feel like you belong
in and really just staying consistent
and giving your audience what they want
when I'm looking for a new topic for a
video I go to my comment section like
what do you guys want to see and that's
what I always ask you comment below we
did it ended up that's because I want to
know what you want so I can give it to
you because this is this is my youtube
channel but this is also your YouTube
channel so I want to give you exactly
what you want to see you guys are my
boss a little bit kind of kid me what
you want one more she's like laughing
because she has so many questions do you
ever use Instagram hashtags no I don't
think I've ever used hashtags I'll use
funny ones that there if I think if I
think they're funny maybe they're not
but I use them to grow my audience um I
mean that's it's not a bad idea but I
personally don't when are your life I
heard t-shirts gonna be available so uh
yeah I didn't really like we kind of
launched a t-shirt low-key without
really doing any marketing or any kind
of announcements oh whoops um I am
launching a t-shirt line just because I
love graphic tees so much and I can
never find any that I like so I was like
you know what I'm gonna make my own and
I'm just gonna put them out there into
the world so we launched a t-shirt I'll
put a picture right here it's the
streets of NYC et that's the first
launch and we're gonna try to do one
every month so a new t-shirt lunch every
month or maybe every other month we're
still trying to find a balance what
works for us but the streets of NYC tea
is for my top favorite streets in NYC on
a t-shirt and the t-shirts are super
soft really comfy link below um if you
guys want to check it out but we have
one available now and I have a girl gang
tea but that's exclusive to my life my
heart community but the streets of New
York is available to everyone put an
icon up here I think it's on this side
maybe if you want to check it out you
can go click on it how did you know for
sure you wanted to go vegan I'm having a
hard time committing but I really want
to do it
I have digestive hi TMI I really do well
with meat or dairy anyways so I'm just
you know I was like I understand the
health benefits I understand the animal
rights benefits but also for my own body
this is probably something that I
wouldn't try out so I tried it and I
loved it I never craved meat I never
craved cheese dairy anything so it
it was like a really smooth transition
for me so that's how I kind of knew I
wanted to stick with it is when my body
was really accepting to it and just
makes me feel really great how do you
suggest couples handling finances
together when they're living together
there kind of just comes a point where
you need to have the conversation of are
we ready to share finances or are we are
we ready to even talk about each other's
finances and when you are at that stage
again I recommend getting a financial
advisor you really need that third party
to kind of because I feel like finances
is some is some topic that couples fight
about a lot so when you have a third
party it's kind of like your referee at
least that's how I think with ours you
know he's like uh you know maybe you
should do this
so it's always good to have somebody to
come to step in and say this is what you
need to do this is what you don't need
to do it's about being honest with each
other and really finding when is the
right time to discuss those are big
things it's a really big step so
communicate with each other and see see
where you both are what is your current
role in the fashion industry I've
watched your fashion industry bids and
wondering if it's changed since then
yeah so you know I when I worked in the
fashion industry which is what I did
when I moved to New York I was visual
merchandising for intermix and
operations for Alice and Olivia was
really really hard to quit my job to do
youtube full-time because I loved my job
I loved waking up early picking out an
outfit going to work it was I loved it
it was really hard to leave knew that
there was that I wanted something
different for myself and I don't just do
YouTube I'm not I don't consider myself
a full-time youtuber um I do half
youtube and I do have life by her I
don't think people understand how much
we work on life by her because we're
really we're growing this as a brand and
it's something that means the world to
me because it was literally just an idea
in my head at one point and something
that I wanted it wanted to do and now
it's coming to life and leaving it was
hard but this is something that I've
wanted for such a long time and I'm
really happy that I chose the path that
I did fashion industry I don't do
anything I am no
a part of a company I do miss it but I'm
so happy where I am right now and I
wouldn't change it for anything no
regrets I I definitely made the right
choice with that yeah it's so funny
because people are like why do you need
interns or assistants or employees when
you're a full-time youtuber I'm like no
I don't I am I do YouTube myself I don't
need an assistant or an intern for
YouTube and no-brainer but for life by
her you know in order for things to run
smoothly on both sides I do need help I
can't create the whole lookbook by
myself and I can't run the back end of
things I can't run customer service I
can't be fulfilling orders alone that's
way too much for one person so of course
I have a team and of course the team is
gonna grow just like with any company
your team's gonna grow what were you
like in high school and any tips for
high school seniors I was probably super
awkward in high school um I don't know I
probably just was I can imagine just
stay true to who you are and and don't
stress too much you know for high school
seniors now it's not the time to be
stressing I know you're like oh where am
I gonna go to school what am I gonna
major in save this dressing for when
you're out of school and you're trying
to figure your stuff out just have fun
you know work hard have fun at the same
time make so many friends you know don't
take life too seriously just get your
 done and have fun while you're at
it
the guys have a Trader Joe's near you if
so how come you never go there we don't
have a Trader Joe's near us um it's
really far I used to work by a Trader
Joe's and so after work I would always
go and get a bunch of stuff but we live
close to a whole food so that is where
we go now I wish we lived close to a
Trader Joe's but if you're go to vegan

minutes and it's like eating cookie
dough so good have you in Ryan ever gone
ring shopping
if so what engagement ring
you want um no we've never gotten like
specifically ring-shopping but you know
if I'm on Pinterest or something and I
see something that's pretty I'll be like
oh that's cute
his mom knows everything so that's
what's important she goes how do you get
free samples
um this is interesting sleeve from PR
companies so a PR company has clients
and their clients or brands so what PR
company might send you a big goodie bag
of samples like hey if you like this let
us know we'll send you more hopefully
it'll get featured you know so you can
kind of sort through what you like what
they want to be featured which is you
know hello understandable that's kind of
how things work that's good advertising
what is each of your favorite thing to
do and your mean me time
solo time apart I can't speak for Ryan
but I'm sure his is probably like going
to the gym you know he loves his gym
time I think it's where he clears his
mind and you know feels good afterwards
so that's definitely his and same for me
I love going to the gym I like going to
get a manicure I'll go sit in the sauna
I'll get a massage I like to take Stella
to the park and play with her it's nice
and quiet so you know you guys don't see
Ryan and I apart a lot but we do a lot
of things apart
it's just when the cameras on we're
always together because that's you know
we work together throughout the day but
you know we we don't we're not like
glued to the hip we do do things apart
why don't you do how to style videos
anymore um I do I actually did one not
that long ago but you know this summer
we've just been traveling so much seeing
family you know we don't get to see our
families a lot because we live really
far away from them so when we are with
them we want to spend time with them so
that's why you really haven't seen them
in the past couple of months but now
that we're gonna be back in New York
summer's over we will be back to work
filming the how to style videos for fall
what is your number one beauty secret
mmm not so much a secret but I think my
number one beauty tip is to drink so
much water like all the water you can
throughout the day and you'll see it in
your hair and your skin it's just like
water is the miracle of the beauty world
I think how do you get your fashion in
spoke
probably Pinterest you know if I buy
something and I'm like mmm I'm really
kind of like lacking in SPO and how to
style it I'll type it into Pinterest and
I'll usually have three outfit ideas
like that so Pinterest is like a
lifesaver
but toothpaste are you using tops oh
it's Tom's you afraid of what people
thought about you when you started
YouTube no actually I never was I've
never been the kind of person to care
what people think and not in a rude way
not in like oh I don't care what you
think I just genuinely kind of do my own
thing and not really I don't get
bothered by what people like negative
things that people say about me or care
what people think about me I don't know
I just that's just kind of how I've
always been yeah like if people comment
on my video and say oh you're you're
deathly skinny like okay what's new yep
that's already even said or oh your lip
your lips are fake yep I've had fillers
so that's accurate I don't know what do
you want me to say like I've I've heard
it all so we can yourself look like an
ass like why are you yeah I do i used to
get embarrassed when I was vlogging like
walking down the street I would get
super embarrassed when somebody would
walk by I'd be like lalala oh my camera
tell h-how'd anymore I'm just like yeah
hi I'm know I'm talking to my camera and
my giant Jovi's dick please don't stare
have you always been so confident about
your personality yeah I guess though I
mean I've always just kind of been
myself no matter what and I was raised
you know to just be yourself and you
know if someone doesn't like it then
that's fine you're you're not not
everyone's gonna like you you know just
be yourself be happy and they can just
suck it yeah deal with in how do you
deal with insecurities um honestly I
really think insecurity is is a mind
trick that's the thing I've never felt
insecure in my entire life
I think everyone suffers from insecurity
it's just human nature no matter what
age no matter how confident in yourself
you are no matter how happy you are
everyone suffers from insecurities like
I'm to be totally honest I was at why I
walked into a Fashion Week party during
Fashion Week
and there were bloggers there and
youtubers there that were huge like
I mean like millions of followers and of
course I felt a little like a little
sting of insecurity and told myself like
hey they were they were where I was at
one point you know they're just because
they're huge or you know these
celebrities that are here doesn't
doesn't make them any better than me
doesn't make meaning less than them
please go by giving yourself a pep talk
if you have to go in the bathroom or if
you have to just close your eyes take a
mental break and just give yourself a
pep talk and just say where is this
insecurity coming from you know you're
who you are we're all people we know
what's better than you um just you know
find a way to calm yourself in
situations like that Oh dealing with
insecurity is totally normal so don't
think you're weird or don't think you
have a problem or an issue just know how
to cope with it and know how to deal
with it
mental pep talks I promise you it works
do it
I mean hours you sleep per night and do
you both go to bed at the same time I
try to get like like six seven hours of
sleep sometimes it's like five if I'm
working late but I'm usually somewhere
around there we usually get in bed at
the same time together because we watch
like TV and stuff just kind of our
routine but you know if one of us has
something else to do we don't like
stress about it is there anything you
regret about moving to New York no I
don't I miss my family a lot but there's
really nothing I can do about it and
unless I just see them I try to come
down as much as I can but no I don't
regret anything you ever consider
yourself famous no huh night oh not even
a little bit you say to your 17 year old
self oh my gosh I would have the longest
conversation with my 17 year old self
don't try to please people don't try to
be somebody you're not be nice to
everybody work hard stay positive oh I
try to tell these things to my sisters
because I wish I could go back and tell
myself so I really try to you know brush
it off onto them by telling them love
young girls I think they're they're the
future of our our world and I really try
to enforce positive positivity on them
to love themselves and you know so much
I would say so much how do you manage to
keep everything in control I don't I
don't think anybody has it under control
I think every
okay it's just like a little bit out of
control I don't think there's one person
that's like I have everything in my life
under control you just do the best you
can you just find a way to manage your
life and stick to it you'll probably
fail a thousand times but that's fine
awesome tips for becoming a youtuber um
I think I kind of answered this in one
of the other questions is to just kind
of find a niche that you enjoy and that
you feel like you belong in and just
post videos stay consistent I love
watching you so much what exactly does
Ryan do I love seeing him in your videos
but he always seems to be with you so
how does he work this is a great
question now that I'm working from home
I can kind of give you a better
understanding of what Ryan does for a
living it's like a huge huge question on
my channels all the time what exactly
does Ryan do but Ryan has a digital
marketing agency with a specialty in
Google AdWords advertising I'm an
example because I think that would be
easier so for example one of Ryan's
clients who he's had for years is one of
the largest cabinet stores online so if
you were to go into Google and you were
to type in buy cabinets you will see
like the top three advertisers on there
and you will see RTA cabinets doors and
that's Ryan's client but Ryan does is he
manages their advertising money to make
sure that they're making money through
this ad that's on Google oh there are a
lot of people that do what Ryan does
it's not like Ryan created this like new
thing where he like does this for people
there are tons of like huge companies
that do this I think one of them is
called util little or yodel I think
yodel I don't know
but Ryan does the exact same thing as
this company does but he does it for
only a select amount of clients so it's
not like he'd created this new thing I
mean he a lot of other people do it he
just has his own he does it on his own
with um you know more of like a boutique
yodel I guess so he has his own clients
that he has so yeah so another example
is a lot of not a lot I think Ryan has
like one or two maybe one dentist so if
you were to go to google and type in San
Antonio a dental implant
you know he makes sure that they're
getting leads from their ad that is
showing up so he's managing their money
and making sure that it's spent the
right way to make sure that they're
getting leads and clients sent their way
by me because one of Brian's clients is
a bright pink who was like a breast
cancer awareness nonprofit and actually
I am partnering up with bright pink to
show you guys their new a brush that
they came out with Sigma a collaboration
and I was like wait Ryan isn't your
client bright pink and he was like yeah
and I was like that's so funny because
they sent me a brush and I'm going to
collaborate with him on this because I
used Sigma brushes so they sent me that
so it was funny he had a call with him
and he was like so my girlfriend is
working with you guys too and they were
like no way so small world right you
asked why he's with me all the time so
you know Ryan started this business a
long time ago so he obviously has built
up a team as well who manages the
day-to-day stuff so that's why he's with
me all the time because he's built a
team to do the day-to-day and he's nice
enough to help me and to film for me and
to help manage um you know when I have a
contract making sure that everything
looks good and making sure all of it is
signed and in the right place and
sometimes he stays up till two o'clock
in the morning doing his own emails
things that he needs to catch up on you
guys email life buy her for customer
support that's Ryan that's helping you
out so he's doing the back end of all of
us so have fillers in your lips they
look so good um but fillers do you use
and how much so I got fillers in my lips
I believe I got Juvederm I got them four
years ago and I've been accused multiple
times of getting them recently and I'm I
haven't you know I'm very transparent
about things I get done I've never had
Botox I've had my boobs done I've had
fillers in my lips but I haven't gotten
them done recently and I don't know what
to tell you if you're not satisfied with
that answer I would get them again I I
like them I guess to run should last you
to two or three times I only got a
little bit put in at a time I got them
done three times one syringe and there I
don't know if they're still on my lips
or if they're gone
I don't know
but if I get them again you guys will be
the first to know I'm not you know I
wouldn't tell you I got them done and
then not telling you I got them done
again so is the ring you wear on your
marriage finger a promise ring no my
little gold ring I just wear it on this
finger because it's the only one that it
fits so how do you get Ryan to help you
record so many of your videos in the
beginning of your channel when you were
both still working so yeah
Ryan still works I think you know we'd
talked about that in the last question
he's just nice enough to help me film I
mean and he's actually kind of fallen in
love with it he's actually he used to
hate it at first he'd be like oh let's
hurry up and do this I mean he was so
supportive and so nice about it but now
he's like into it so he's like oh I like
this lens oh let's save up for this lens
so he actually really likes it now
reading how not to die and considering a
plant-based diet do you recommend easing
into it by cutting out a little bit at a
time or going all-in on the first day so
I went all-in on the first day and just
didn't look back and if you're having a
hard time try cutting it out a little
bit of a time a little bit at a time I
went cold turkey and I was just fine but
um you know if you need to ease ease
into it and you know do what's best for
you you could go back in time what is
one thing you wouldn't absolutely do in
one thing you would I wouldn't have
wasted so much time on a dead
relationship and I'm just saying this
because it bring any of you guys out
there that are struggling with the same
thing you know if it's not working do
not waste your time just don't do it
there's better things out there there's
but not better not like you're better
but there's better out there for you
that's just me giving my advice from a
personal experience
one thing I would do is I would have
started my youtube channel sooner it's
something that I wanted to do for so
long and it took it took me like six
months to actually do it and I regret
not doing it immediately so it's more
advice for you if you're thinking about
it just go ahead and take the plunge you
know six months a year is gonna go by
whether you have started it or not so
you might as well take the plunge and
give it a shot if you're if you're
really wanting to do it alright guys so
that is that is all the questions I got
I just wanna thank you guys for
the painting in these you know I
couldn't do these without you to ask
questions and if you're ever curious
about anything just ask I like to share
things with you and um you know I don't
want you to think I'm ever keeping
anything from you or anything like that
so I always try to be transparent with
you guys and give my best advice
