today I'm gonna be showing you guys my
on-the-go beauty bag ever been at work
and you get up during lunch go to the
bathroom look in the mirror and you're
like woah I need I need this is what I
have this trusty back or it is my top
products for freshing your face for
refreshing yourself up and making you
feel a little bit better go ahead and
get started first of all and this bag is
from Target I really love the blue
velvet I just thought it was so cool
very like fall and winter but I'm gonna
rock it in the summer and spring because
I don't care cuz I love it first I will
just grab the first thing that I see it
is the way texturing and hair spray I
absolutely love that stuff I have the
full size as well but it's just really
great for those days where you're on
your like day four or day 2 whatever
dirty hair is to you for me I'm
embarrassed and I'm gonna say it this is
perfect it gives your hair some life
some volume some texture or if you have
super clean hair and it doesn't want to
do anything as well this is also good
for that it kind of gives you that one
or two day old hair find my other hair
product kind of a big product to carry
around with you but I freaking love this
stuff now it looks like I haven't used
much but it looked like a drop lasts so
long so it is hair and body oil of the
combination I have a couple of hair and
body oils but this one's the easiest
pack skinny if you guys that have really
oily hair I'm sure you already know this
but I would not use this product because
it's very oily I only put a little bit
on my ends and it's good for my body as
well I just like put it on any sort of
skin that's exposed to smell good or for
your dry patches this is a perfect like
body refresher and I here refresher
all-in-one it smells nice oh my gosh I
always forget how good it smells until I
put it on and I'm like of like
multi-purpose we have let's move into
like skin boys keep a lip liner in no
matter what I actually hardly ever carry
a lips
take just because lipsticks are kind of
bulky and the top always pops off and
then stuff gets in the lipstick I don't
know I have a little worse I need to
tape and just take my lids on my
lipstick but better carrying a lip liner
so I will do a lip liner it's actually
what I'm wearing right now is this
Milani
um the color is called nude always carry
this guy with me that was not helpful in
going into the next product I will put
my milk hero itself and this kind of
creates a lipstick so it makes this
really creamy I'll put this all over
mine my lips fill it in and then I'll
dab a little bit of this to create like
a lipstick feel it's also multi-purpose
because it's just skin self so if you
have any dry spots on your hands or on
your face you can just literally do a
little dab ruski and put it on smell it
smells nice but at all there just was
like Vaseline so it's unscented it's
just good like body yourself so I like
to travel with this I my camera just
died I have no clue where laughs ha i
shadow okay so I know it's super
unrealistic to travel with the full-on
eyeshadow palette I travel with this one
just because I have room for it if I
didn't have room for it then I would do
something like this I would just most
makeup brands will sell singles so I
would just grab your most important one
your key one and grab this that way you
can just work during the day feel like
it's this kind of uncommon to touch up
your eyeshadow during the day I'm using
a good makeup setting spray or a good
primer on your eyeshadow in the morning
you really don't need to unless you're
going out for drinks and you want to add
like a darker color little tiny baby
Beauty Blender and these are for your
cheeks but I carry this around you're
making kind of breaks up sometimes you
get to the office and you're like wow I
did a terrible job blending my bronzer
this morning Beauty Blender to the
rescue and I would go to work and look
in the mirror and I'm like okay I must
have gotten ready in the dark because my
bronzer was literally like a harsh line
I always carry one of these even a
full-size ones fine I mean they're
pretty pretty comparable in size
actually they're not
it's like a pretty big difference
although this one's wet because I just
used two very important things that I
always carry with me is number one
my Tata luminous dewy skin mists have
the full-sized one for my makeup bag but
I love it so much that I have the travel
size as well basically just gives you a
dewy skin look without being wet or
greasy this is one of my favourite
products in the whole world and I've
been buying it for two years now and I
remember the first time I bought it I
could not afford it at all but I heard
such good things about it
and I bought it and I was like okay this
is so worth it but I don't know if you
can really even like see but it just is
the most like do we moisturize it at the
same time so I'll do a little spray of
that get my Beauty Blender kind of
blended and a little bit so I don't have
any big splotchy splotchy pieces always
happy one thing I do not travel without
is my caudally beauty elixir this is
just for if I need like a freshening up
if I don't want a dewy look but I want
kind of the misty
kind of look mouth and eyes it kind of
wakes me up even it really doesn't
change the look of my makeup I do feel
it adding a little bit of moisture it's
not long-lasting but it is nice to just
spray on your face if you need like a
refresher smells like peppermint and
greatness you don't love that product or
you are just looking for something
different this is always a good go-to of
mine this isn't the travel size but they
do make a small travel sized facial
spray with aloe herbs and rosewater and
it's just as refreshing just their kind
of polar opposites like one's very minty
and refreshing and this one's very like
relaxing and like rose scented
one kind of shot out a little funny and
I've got kind of a big water spot here
so if you just take the Beautyblender
and kind of blend it in it goes away so
again vert back to the beauty blunder
next I always carry a brow product of
some sort with me so I usually carry my
gimme brow by benefit and I really don't
find myself using this often this is
mostly if like I get to my destination
or if you get to work and you see that
you just like totally like missed a
piece of your brow or you messed up
somehow this is kind of a good way to
just kind of go over and fill it in a
little bit cause your brows can get
unruly throughout the day so I find that
this almost acts is like a brow hair
spray like a gel or something time is
this empty did I even just put anything
on I don't know which is so important
for me is my deodorant wipes I carry at
least three of these everywhere I go I
think when you wear natural deodorant
you just have to be prepared for
anything
I get nervous my pets will like smelly
sweat I don't and even when I'm at the
gym I don't smell a sweat but I get
nervous it's like I mean my wife okay if
you just want to get these little Whole
Foods but and they also make travel-size
deodorants that you can bring I just
think deodorant is always something that
everyone needs to carry around all the
time everyone knew that especially on
the subway then of course I carry a
travel rule on perfume is good if you
leave the house and forget your perfume
or it's like the middle of the day and
your perfume is kind of gone my Chloe
disappears on me like that so I carry my
Chloe rollerball as well going out after
work or if it's gonna be a super long
day this is always a good thing to have
our three little dangling items just a
q-tip for makeup purposes and for I
don't know whatever all ponytail holders
I always have like six of these in my
makeup bag I try to keep it under
control but somehow they just keep
getting a hang they have babies in my
get back and they just produce more
because I'm not putting them there
someone is a nail file because I every
time I don't have a nail file I always
bring my nail in need one so this is
always good to have because there's
nothing more annoying than having a
broken nail all day and you're late cut
your face and it's just annoying so one
of these and lastly always floss and
cocoa cloth actually sent me this and
it's strawberry scent it and I love it
so much it smells delicious but I big
flosser I always like to floss after
every time I eat I'm so prone to getting
things stuck in my teeth
I don't know if it's cuz I have big
teeth or what but something's always
stuck in there you want to eat a lot of
chia seeds and like spinach and they
just like worm their way in so that's
probably why no matter what always floss
after I eat alright so that is it for my
beauty makeup bag I know I'm forgetting
something because I just traveled so I
switched to a bigger one and then I
transferred it all back so I know like
my wet wipes
cariann tobacco wipes because I wipe
everything down because I just I'm not
person unfortunately nothing I can do

some good ideas and I'm kind of
interested to know what you guys keep in
your go to a on-the-go Beauty back so
