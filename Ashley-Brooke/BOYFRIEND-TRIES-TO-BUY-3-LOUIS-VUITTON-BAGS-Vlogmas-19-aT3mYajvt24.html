lunchable in it I see the bagging I'm
like oh it's 200 bucks like it's kiss
three and she asked the prices the dude
he's like oh it's 5,200 it's like Shh
retract my statement
apparently I looked at the bag again the
200 is really far away from the comma
and the five before it so got misled
so anyway earlier we didn't buy that
thing hi truffle instead dad you didn't
even play it off for like all the blood
drained from your face when he said 5200
he did and he said 5200 Brian's face not
snow white I thought he was in a faint
so you know it's funny it's like walking
around the streets if somebody just
heard us talking about the number of
5200 maybe like oh they just went it's
all like a two-bedroom that's the price
like no we went to look at a bag

and I get a really bad headache which is
weird and almost like not just a little
bit you might be able to get that or am

hopefully that'll help I did think it's
not even pretty it doesn't even look
good i grilled some shaped Brussels some
avocado and then a beast burger patty so
yeah I'm gonna eat that and that helps
I'm really sad I didn't get to go out
for a drink because I really wanted to
go but I know there's nothing worse than
like getting ready and going out to do
something when you have like a pounding
headache which I have button to eat this

don't matter but not a few guys in a
little bit the tree live it's live let
