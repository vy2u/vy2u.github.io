you know what I'm gonna say happy Sunday
this morning I woke up about 7:00 got a
little work done then I went to the gym
I just had a quick workout but since it
is Sunday you know what that means it is
cheat day sorry if you guys can hear
Estella chewing on her toy she's gonna
be like right all up in my business
sorry I actually put my hand on your
hand tonight for cheat meal we are
making enchiladas and Ryan wanted the
carrot cake again that I made last week
I was like what like you could have
anything why don't we try to make
something different and he was like no I
want that so we're gonna make that again
which is great cuz I need to get to show
you guys the finished product last time
cuz we were beyond sickly full so Ryan's
at the gym actually right now he's a
little bit behind this morning he went
out last night so he was a little slower
than me this morning bought him some
coffee who got up some breakfast now
he's he's an he's a new person so he's
good to go I'm gonna go get today's
video I just have to do a quick quick
finish do anything outside today been
pouring rain all day there's fog it's
just a really yucky day but it's perfect
for like a lazy Sunday in your
sweatpants watching TV I'm gonna go work
I'll see you guys in a bit
alright so I'm pretty much done with
today's video the only thing I had to go
through and do was create like where
each thing is from and that can
sometimes take forever
pinpoint everything because I think
there's five looks and each look has
like four or five different items so and
I created my thumbnail this is what it
looks like right now but it will
probably end up changing I always change
the thumbnail like 14 times before I
actually post it but I like to keep them
all lined up just to make sure that I've
got a theme going I just kind of
recently started doing this use to my
thumbnails we're all over the place
now I'm trying to keep them like the
aesthetic the same but I'm gonna export
this and I think I'm gonna go make some
raw bars
I made some last week they were okay but
I just saw on Pinterest that on me song
has like a really good Rob our recipes
well I'm actually gonna try that out
today so um I'll post the recipe for you
guys below and
stop stalking me how do you feel it told
everyone that you had a great time last
night
excuse me what percentage are you at
right now would you say figured that
your breakfast and coffee helped oh yeah
yeah
percentage will you be at after
enchiladas yeah okay then after carrot
cake watching my video that I'm about to
post he's always my toughest critic and
my last my last no that's good I think
everybody needs somebody who's like
because you notice things that I don't
notice so I think it's I think that's
like a good thing yeah well now that you
said that no we're done so enchiladas
I'll start getting the recipe pulled up
in there I think it's a solid plan turn
good I'm kind of annoyed with you though
because you got home you got home at
like midnight and you cost me like a
couple of hours of sleep because you
were banging in that round in the
kitchen
I was admitting Lee drunkenly gorging on
food banging in the kitchen my raw bars
are in the freezer I'm gonna start my
enchiladas and let's see I got my recipe
from the savory vegan you love
Oh No start by making the enchilada
sauce which is like for those of you
guys who don't like vegan cheese this is
why she created this recipe because it
kind of replaces
company
and they look so good oh man they don't
look good on camera though I swear they
look better in person you'll report back
in just a second
oh wait I will show you my plate it's
very important okay here are the plates
this literally looks like terrible okay
I'm probably not gonna put this in
update on the enchiladas are so good
Ryan robbed ours actually the raw bars
we've eaten like over half the pan in
our characters in the oven that's yours
yeah Sunday dinner making is usually
like a teamwork partnership type thing
like fun project but we were one man
down today
that's just what that's just how it goes
when one of us is hungover in reality
the other ones just gotta like you pick
up the slack
push through actually that's pretty much
our life history picking up slack
everybody now and then I'll have a
moment make up for a lot you know what
though you would do the same for me over
and you would call by flowy so fast
ready we're honest and halfway through
episode two of seven seconds still great
here's the carrot cake oh my god so I
did a double layer yes you heard that
right I did a double layer if I had more
counter space it would be filled with
like cake stands and cupcakes and all
that fun stuff but you build me a bigger
kitchen you built in with the bare hands
we're ending the vlog 9:30 and it's past
our bedtime Ryan where I am you know
what we you know what we have that we
forgot about till just now The Walking
Dead and I feel like I'm 14 months
pregnant right now this cake and more
cake I'll see you guys tomorrow I have
some errands to run tomorrow but I will
fill you in a little bit more on that
because I'm not gonna be here this
weekend I am going out of town and
leaving these two maniacs but I will
catch you guys up tomorrow

cute it is with ankle boots we like this
I feel like I like it it's like very
flowy I also love this I just tried it
on but I forgot to film it you just love
the colors like the red and the blue in
the black heel so I love the sleeves I
love the sleeves on this but like like
why does this have to be so long I mean
what are we doing at this I don't know I
feel like this might be a fail not meant
to be right so for jackets it's between
a beast year and I feel like I already
have something like this I have that
like brown and burgundy one and then
there's this one it's like lemon and I
love this color so I think I'm gonna go

to go to the airport to go to Texas for
Taylor's bachelorette party and I know I
told you guys that there was gonna be a
Q&amp;amp;A at the end of this vlog and I
actually spent about 4 hours filming it
yesterday and my memory card was on my
nightstand Stella got a hold of it and
it no longer reads when I get back from
Texas I'm gonna take it somewhere to see
if they can extract the files because
there was like a lot of good information
on there I answered so many questions I
just spent so much time on it so I
apologize that this happened and that
you're expecting a Q&amp;amp;A and it's not
gonna be here I am so pissed that is
what's going on I'm so sorry but I'll
keep you updated on a situation with
