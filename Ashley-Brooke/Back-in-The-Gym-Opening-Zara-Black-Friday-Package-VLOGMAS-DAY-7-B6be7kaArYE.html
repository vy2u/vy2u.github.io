this is what it looks like
like this is all velvet and this isn't

it's got really nice texture
are these shoes and I really really love
the color and the two different material
this is like a satiny finish and then
this is velvet and the inside is faux
fur but they're a little too small I
have such a white foot that I always
need to go up a size and flats and I

pretty blush gray it's got a pretty big
funnel neck like turtleneck here and
then the sleeve is rose gold this like

I think we are having like a grain bowl
with quinoa and veggies and maybe for

some Tony's sauce seasoning this stuff
right here on top of those Hey dinner is

the purple comforter so I don't get it

anyways we are gonna step right into
comments but chore you noticed that this
vlog is going live the next day and I
think that's just how it's gonna be
honestly because I go to bed so early
and I've been staying up so late
trying to get vlogmas edited and out and
I'm more of an early riser so I feel
like it just makes more sense to me to
do it first thing in the morning at like
6:30 7:00 I've been making it a habit to
watch your vlogmas while on the
elliptical so keep the long blogs coming
I do the same thing it's like makes
elliptical time go by so fast when
you're watching YouTube I remember well
back you said you were moving into a
different unit in your building what
happened or am i imagining things we
actually did move into a different unit
we are in our second unit in the
building there was like a whole moving
vlog over it any tips on vegan protein
for someone just starting off you use
the lifetime fitness vegan protein plate
plant-based protein powder that I just
say words I like garden of life and
vegan smart has really great vanilla it
tastes like cake better where is the
long black coat that you've worn in the
last few vlogs I believe it's from Zara
it ever happened to the other intern you
guys had dara now works at Trachtenberg
and she sent me that blow-dryer today
I love Dara like I've said before we
hired Dara and knowing that she was like
looking for another job we just kind of
needed some help with life by her and
she was really really great
but um you know she got a job and she
left you look the cold of my own and
have a horrible sounding cough yeah I
mean I feel you whenever I cough it
sounds like an earthquake and like you
can hear the length a little like the
gurgle the richesse lot my sister just
text me this show we're watching they're
in Manhattan in New York and at Central
Park
we are watching something called elf
something
Oh Susie 17 from Florida she's obsessed
with the vlogs and watches it every day
when she gets home from school your
videos that taught me so much as if you
were the older sister I always wanted
but never had
that is so nice
I do a Q&amp;amp;A with Jenna and talk about
what she does for you I'm curious whoo
should we do a Q&amp;amp;A with Jenna Jenna was
supposed to come on Tuesday she comes
Tuesdays and Fridays but I told her not
to come because I was like I don't want
you to get sick my germs are everywhere
do not calm basically helps me with the
life by her magazine and she's my
editorial assistant basically she's
great if you guys wanna see Q now Jenna
we can talk like volunteering her she's
probably watching this like what is on
your Christmas wish list this year any
tips on presents for friends I think I'm
gonna do a gift guide let me know if the
okay if that's something that you guys
would like to see to answer your
question on my list I need new house
shoes and I would love a new gym bag
simple gal I really am easy with gifts
like I remember one year for Valentine's
Day all I wanted was a heating pad where
I got me I was so happy and having a
hard time lately and watching these
everyday blogs have made me feel so much
better
so nice Presley I hope you your times
get better just stay strong I don't know
what's going on but stay strong cool I
love getting to know you guys do the
comments it's really cool everyone wants
to know where my phone case is from so
I'm gonna link it in the description box
below this one and then my old one it's
from the same company you use boxed
broths always yes I always Christina hi
Christina yes I always use the box kind
and just get them from Whole Foods
because they're like most
offensive your vlogs always make me want
to be so productive so I clean out my
closet and my bathroom pass tight whoa
Sarah that is a lot of cleaning good for
you
you should show behind the scenes of
vlogging like setting up the lights
camera what you set up in equipment what
your setup and equipment looks like your
editing process basically all I don't I
don't set up like lights or anything
when I'm vlogging I just have my Joby
stick and my camera um I was joy I could
show you my editing process if that's
something that you guys want to see if
you're still sick can use things smelly
cat from friends I think it'd do you
justice if you remember that episode
where Phoebe gets sick and says phlegm
makes her sound sexy not trying to be
cruel or anything please do more cooking
preparations on the vlogs I like to copy
healthy diets cool I love filming
cooking so works out perfectly for both
of us we go again
where can i see the Victoria Secret
photos I will post one on Instagram and
next week I don't know it's gonna be at
Instagram though just wondering where
you got your glasses from I'm looking
for large frame glasses like these
everywhere Nicole
these are from readers.com and they
always have like promotions and sales
and coupons and stuff so readers calm
are your plans for the fusion with Ryan
would you both want to get married or
have children yes we definitely want to
get married and have children one day
random question love all your mini crop
tops rather than lounging around are out
and about the girl how do you not freeze
especially in cold weather oh I think I
said yesterday it was like 60 but almost
warm outside and then it rained so it
was hot muggy warm a very hot natured
person I just I always have been ever
since I was little even when I got back
to the apartment I was like sweating
yeah just a hot natured
person I think you're the prettiest with
less or no makeup on Anna
that's so nice eyes are so sweet in the
comments like I'm so lucky to have the
best subscribers ever everyone's telling
me how thick they are also like everyone
else has a cold and I hope you all feel
better because I know it's not fun at
all
I like ornaments on your tree or is it
part of your minimalistic New York thing
Ryan was hilarious today
though I would like giant love ornaments
I have so many favorite ornaments back
home in Texas but again I just don't
have anywhere to put them I wouldn't
literally have to throw them away I just
don't have anywhere to put Christmas
ornaments that I would trust them not to
get broken to be honest I'm not actually
interested in the questions at the end
because it seems to me more like a Q&amp;amp;A
than a vlog maybe if you could separate
it into two kinds of videos for those
who are not interested well here's the
thing like when I start answering
questions just in the vlog because it
kind of is separated it's like the vlog
and then the questions so as soon as you
see me sitting cute and PEG with my
glasses just I feel like it's just kind
of nice to answer questions because I
get asked so much of the same questions
so I feel like it's kind of courteous to
everyone who
as questions that need to be answered as
I mean thank you for your feedback I
always love getting feedback but you
know I try to come up I try to come up
with a solution to everyone who you know
isn't interested in something or thinks
you know one way so my solution is to
just cut the vlog you're probably not
even watching this because you don't
like the question you feel better and
also Ryan you're rocking the air pods
Ryan does not take his air pods out of
his ears ever like ever how did you get
so lonely at the Christmas tree alone I
have a puppy and I'm scared to put up a
tree because he's terrible tella like
snips at it but I always make sure to
just tell her like no when I point to
the tree and I'm like no and she knows
no like she knows that that's bad and to
stop so you know anytime she's kind of
close to it I'll just tell her no and
she's pretty good listener she is she's
picking up pretty quickly on about
should not cook your vegetables with a
high temperature because it kills the
vitamins really cuz Rachael Ray's day I
convinced my brother to give me my
Christmas gift early and it was a
subscription to life by her I love being
a part of the community oh my gosh that
is so cool Camilla welcome to a group
