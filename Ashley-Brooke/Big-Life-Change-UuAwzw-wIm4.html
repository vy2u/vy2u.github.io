so much
Stella girl
whoa we are now a family of three so
tonight we were supposed to go to this
we were supposed to go to this event for
Lulu's but um I don't know what happened
we we were working and I looked at the
clock and I was like I have to be there
in an hour and I had showered
I'm literally still in my comfy clothes
I've been working all day we are gonna
hang out here tonight I'm making some
more soup like I did the other night
it's gonna be good so I'll tell you guys
what's in that again when I go back over
there but I've got a special surprise
for you for deserting that Ryan I make
almost every night so we're gonna make a
good dessert for you guys and it's also
good for like a snack during the day too
so how big these bowls are yeah the same
soup as I did I think like two blocks
ago it's veggie broth carrots potatoes
kale celery green peas some like garlic
seasoning onion powder salt and pepper
top it with a little quinoa all right
guys it is time for dessert so I
partnered up with 310 nutrition they
actually sponsor in this part of the
video yet sent me this I've been trying
and I'm actually almost out of the whole
entire bag this is a big bag and I'm
almost out of it I hated it no it's so
good I actually wanted to show you their
starter kit so it comes with a shaker a
$10 gift card inside a have been wanting
to dive into this but I can't because I
had to show you guys first so now that I
show you I can finally use it three
different protein powders you've got the
chocolate and the vanilla which are both
is to our vegan plant-based protein and
this is whey protein so this is not
vegan all sugar-free so that's really
great try their superfood cleanse black
berry lemonade he which I'm excited
about you get all of this for $9 and I
think that's good to kind of try out the
proteins to see if you like the
chocolate or vanilla better
what I'm doing like a strawberry banana
and peanut butter I like to do chocolate
but then when I'm doing almond butter I
like to do vanilla so it's nice to have
both haven't tried the vanilla yet the
chocolate is delicious
obviously it's almost gone now you can
use this different ways you can use it
twice a day for weight loss you can use
it once a day for a meal replacement or
if you're like me I do it for my protein
shake for before after the gym one of
the coolest parts about it is it has a
Facebook community 140,000 people where
you can go and get advice and support so
that means that I'm gonna make my
dessert usually I mean you guys all know
how to make a shake you pretty much put
whatever you want in it along with the
protein powder no my favorite things to
do especially after a workout and I'm
craving like food something to actually
eat I like to do a banana and mush it up
really really good towards almost liquid
it like will almost liquefy if you mash
it up good enough with peanut butter and
a scoop love the chocolate protein
powder and let it sit in the fridge for
20 minutes and it's like eating cookie
dough and especially if you put some
cacao nibs in it those do
when my heart beats true my heart beats
free Sigma hey
all right don't alone it two bananas
which is why it's kind of really full
now these guys to it very free chocolate
dream chips let's just I'm about to
munch on it in bed we'll put the link in
the description box so you can go and
get your starter pack I'm gonna make you
one yeah you love it vanilla or
chocolate all right Stella do you want
one I have a very sleepy puppy oh shoot
say good night say it like you mean it

photo of a sleeping or I guess it was
this morning but she pretty much is in
the habit of sleeping on top of my face

edited today's vlog and it's got this
craving for like a breakfast taco so
that's what I'm gonna make but Ryan just
informed me that we're out of tofu so
