makeup tutorial made some mimosas for
the occasion for the occasion goodness
cheers darling
and just brush my teeth though so this
does not taste good - grapefruit and
Ryan's is orange juice drop 50 he's a
basic bitch started by wetting my beauty
blender because there's no other way to
do a beauty blender all right I'm going
to get all my products out don't look at
them don't study them don't even think
about it
blueberries look fancy but they're just
getting in the way that Cole
he'll regret that decision yeah okay
guys so first what we're going to do is
we're going to put on you get five
seconds to read it and then I have to
show the product to the camera all right
so first we're going to put on true true
blend
brown stuff true blend and face the true
blend face primer for dry skin it's
perfect for the dry winter air
you have to start over I'm sorry daddy
some deodorant so first we're just going
to rub it into to our faces with our
hands very aggressively we're going to
use dermablend not sponsored hashtags
and this is for the most smooth and even
the foundations so a minute I'm going to
dab it on my finger and then I'm going
to dab it on my face in different places
there's really no rhyme or reason to
what I'm doing so I'm going to take my
my kabuki brush f80 take my my Sigma f80
brush and I'm going to buff my cheeks
and chin in a in a circular pattern and
then you do both sides don't forget the
other side tips and tricks I'll make
sure to get behind your ears
nobody likes non-foundation behind the
ears space some pixel Becca praline and
ultimate coverage concealing cream by
Becca in the color praline and I'm going
to put that and you'll notice it's on
its below my nose I'm going on my chin
and this is to make sure that that I
hope dropped it and it's on my shirt now
oops guys then use your sponge to dab
around all the areas make sure that your
going super fast and really aggressive
like you need help on application just
try to punch yourself in the face with
the sponge don't worry about black eyes
that's what BEC is for hashtag not
sponsored pro tip dig into the creases
between your eyes next time on the laura
mercier secret brightening powder and
dab a little bit on my sponge I'm going
to put that under my eyes and the
purpose of of this stuff well it's a
secret we can tell you Kat Von D snack
light shade and light I'm going to
point gently at the one I'm using and
I'm going to go ahead and and
a little bit there and I'm going to
throw it on my nose if you've ever
wanted a skinny nose follow this these
tips the point was a really fatter brush
to the to the same color and I'm going
to work on my cheekbones and make a
really weird fish face so that I can get
the most surface area of my cheeks I'm
going to take a smaller brush than that
one but bigger than the first one and
I'm going to point to this top color and
as you can tell it's a lighter color and
what what that does is it it puts
different colors on my face if you guys
didn't know the name of what we're doing
right now it's contouring so now I'm
going to put some lemonade on
color-correcting eyelid primer and with
this I'm going to use my finger tip and
I'm going to put it on my eyelids it
makes it makes a make some wider than
everything else next I'm going to put on
this box called sink
Sigma now I'm going to take one of these
little brushes and I'm going to get this
cream color that one I'm pointing out
with this mini brush and I'm gonna I'm
gonna dust myself across my eyelids next
I'm going to take the purple color and
I'm going to I've got a smaller brush
you can see you know and I'm going to
take purple color to put it over the
white color and it's going to it's going
to create the effect of tired eyes but
not in a bad way I just picked up a
different brush you notice that good for
you making sure everything is blended on
what I did was the mini brush next I'm
going to be putting on it in the round
case with the silver top and there's a
mirror in it
surprise I'm going to put on the NYX
dark dark dark brown eye powder eyebrow
powder
you can see it looks it looks like a
pencil sharpener it's got its own it's
got its own brush inside of it which is
smaller than any other birds you've seen
so far brush my eyebrows up with this
mini brush I'm gonna use this little
this little small paint brush this
little brush looks like a paint brush
I'm gonna put a line under my eyebrows
to make sure you know where they begin
don't forget you have mini brush if you
need it it's at your disposal and you're
going to take your top line all the way
to the end of of where your eyebrow
should be mini brush again when you
think you might be done you're not keep
going next is this little round guy gets
the its what it's a it's pinks look at
this brush I'm going to put this as
lining the eyebrows and just make sure
that there's no no eyebrow powder
outside of my lines you have two eyes so
you got to do the other one Oh sometimes
you got to brush down don't always think
you have to brush up mean you brush
again it's that's your staple that will
always be there for you sometimes you're
just confused when you're looking for
your stuff I've got a head mini brush
the next I'm going to put on a a
screwdriver head give me brow bye bye
Beneful by benefit it's the sister
company of Beneful as you can see this
looks very much like mini brush but
don't you get confused this is not mini
brush and sometimes you just get too
much so the easiest solution is you just
use your fingers and you you wipe away
up see all fixed tada so now we're going
to use this this box
and as you can see there's two smaller
boxes inside of it with color just over
your cheekbones and then back to
punching yourself in the face because
you can also get an arm workout two
things in one
now I've got this hint this jar of
dermablend cotton swabs and there does
dirty wait now I just put on I just put
on setting powder you probably didn't
know that you probably thought that this
was just a dirty bunch of cotton swabs
but you might be wrong and now I'm going
to use it how many use a telescope okay
now if you might you thought it was a
telescope surprise it's not it's it's a
way to do it is to go like up up up and
then every now and then go down you
might think you're done up again after
one coat of eyelid stuff but you'd be
wrong hey welcome back it's me you gotta
wipe off the most of my face I took a
chug break hash tag party and you you
brush under your under your lip
beginning position like we were with the
eyebrows we're going to do the same
thing with our lips to make because I'm
going to take Milani in number 61 naked

exactly where it goes we'll put him to
the test don't you guys wanted to see
