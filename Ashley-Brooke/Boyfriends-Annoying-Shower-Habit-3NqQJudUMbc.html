lunch and I decided that I think I need
to have like a cleaning day maybe like
an organizing day so I am Brian's in the
shower and he listens to podcasts what
he's in the shower
it's slow paced so I think I'm gonna
clean how it like I'm gonna shut the
bathroom doors on the street and so if
you have some compassion you think well
gonna do more for the poor just I'm
gonna clean out like my t-shirts my
sweater is my jeans I'm gonna start
there because it was getting very out of
hand so
I'm gonna take a small break I just got
so much stuff organized and cleaned out
I'm feeling good but now I'm gonna make
a protein smoothie Bowl and I think our
Whole Foods crochets just got here cuz I
heard the phone ring but alright so
finish my smoothie bowl like a very long
time ago I just have forgot to turn the
camera on but I'm making progress in the
closet I can't really see hold on so
what still can't see so I went through
all my scarves folded them here make up
the tear went through all of my like
comfiest sweat pants and sweatshirts got
rid of probably half of them so proud of
myself put them here got all the socks
made sure they all had matching friends
with them and then I dumped out every
single bin underneath my bed and got rid
of a bunch of stuff and just completely
reorganized it two trash bags that I'm
taking to the donation bin doesn't seem
like a lot but that probably took me
like two and a half hours to do like you
underestimate how long it takes to do
that I remember I was like I was sitting
in my floor wall ago with just clothes
everywhere and I was like oh why did I
do this I'm glad I did I'm glad it's
over okay I am going to go like sit down
