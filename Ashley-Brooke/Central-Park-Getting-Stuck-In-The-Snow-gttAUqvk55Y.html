snow it's melting a little bit because
the sun's out so I think it's just kind
of warming up and melting

ice from the floors above us kind of
like falling and hitting our window it's
so loud I hope it's not hitting people
down below I'm not sure how that works a
bit like disintegrates before it gets to
the ground I don't know like scared to
go outside now but I'm going out to run
some errands so I'm not sure what to
expect so I guess
where my sunglass
think it's at night but I change the
word we actually Brooke what right
