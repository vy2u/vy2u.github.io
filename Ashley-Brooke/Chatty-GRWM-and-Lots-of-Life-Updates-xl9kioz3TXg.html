hi guys good morning so I just sat down
to get ready and I thought you know I
haven't talked to you guys in a very
long time I don't think I've had a lot I
haven't had a vlog since vlogmas it's
not - bear with me because I have such a
hard time doing these two things at once
blogging and putting my makeup on like
for some reason something is not
connecting and it does not make me feel
good about myself
after a vlog miss was over I just really
wanted to enjoy the rest of the time
spent with my family and it was so nice
we you know spent one whole day watching
home videos we watched like my parents
wedding video and it was such a good
time I had such a great holiday with my
family and help you guys the - I hope
you guys had a good holiday break I know
everybody's back to work now and back on
the grind but holiday break comes at the
right time knots for sure and I haven't
really had another video since then I
really wanted to spend the first week of
the new year kind of replanting content
I started to feel like I was at a place
where I was bored with my own videos you
know I was like nothing has really
changed
since I started YouTube you know maybe
it's time to come up with new and fresh
ideas so I literally spent the whole
week kind of going over all of my series
and just being like okay what can we do
that's new and cool and fresh do you
guys ever put your foundation on and
then realize you forgot to put your
primer on every day I put my makeup on
that always happens to me so anyways
that is kind of where I've been what
I've been doing I've also been trying to
teach myself Photoshop and I've also
been trying to teach myself more
advanced coding for life by Haruko
because again I refuse to hire a web
designer a developer because I
I know it's something that I can teach
myself and I've actually learned so so
much so it's been nice that's pretty
much where I've been what I've been
doing but mainly the content part that
was really kind of like what I've been
doing and why I haven't been doing
videos because I really wanted to take
all of my videos dissect them look at
them and just be like you know I like
this style but what would be more
helpful to you guys like how can I show
more outfits and where the videos not so
long and so drawn-out
and I think I've come up with a pretty
cool concept and of course it'll take
you know a couple of months to really
get it the way I wanted trial and errors
it's gonna be a lot of testing and stuff
like that so bear with me and always
give me your feedback and let me know
what your what's your thinking of course
while I was at home for Christmas I did
not work on the January's issue of life
by her magazine like the whole time I
was home so as soon as we got back to
New York I had like three days Jenna and
I to just complete the whole entire
thing so I mean I was like staying up
til 3 o'clock in the morning waking up
at 6 or 5 but yeah Ryan was so sweet and
after the look the magazine was sent out
he booked us a couples massage and then
he took me to the movies that night
because I really wanted to see downsize
so he took me on a little date he
surprised me and had Jenna come and
watch Stella but it was really sweet and

a nice little day for us girl so for
everybody watching this is the Fulton
Street Seaport and I always got a cool
thing set up here
we came and there was like a bar and
like checkers yeah this whole thing
behind us was a big bar yeah
hey how'd you like the movie oh good
it's not what I expected it was gonna be
but I liked it it was cute and it was it
was very good like story yeah anything
with Matt Damon I just loved so much
I loved him how do you think Jenna's
doing with cells I bet he still is like
this is the best day of Stella's life if
she gets to hang out with Jenna very
long the best day of her life so then
after that day was when the bomb cyclone
freezing cold snow hit in New York City
and that is pretty much I mean that word
sums up exactly what it was it was
insane so I was kind of trapped in my
apartment for four to five days because
it was like blizzard outside the high
was like five Oh
so at the end of the month at the end of
this month we are going to Mexico are
going to Punta Mita and I'm so excited
we're actually going for so Ryan is a
part of this group call it the
Brotherhood and it's just entrepreneurs
all over the world and a few of them
live here in the city so they'll have
dinners where they go and like talk
about business and strategies there's
going to be like I think 70 of the group
and their spouses and their kids and
stuff and we're all going to Mexico so
it's gonna be a huge group of people and
it's gonna be so much fun we have like
activities planned
and I'm really excited yesterday I
decided since I have a few videos coming
up that I would go do a shop here in the
city and I usually if I have a bunch of
videos coming up and I already know what
the topic is I'll shop online just so I
can have like new fresh items for you
but I was like I've got to get out of
this apartment and go outside into the
world now that it's you know back to New
York so I'm wearing my long super long
cable knit sweater the little mock neck
so my next day's warm my faux leather
high waisted leggings from H&amp;amp;M these two
the best things ever and my pearl
studded boots because this is like my
warmest combo here got to stay warm
today and then I'm gonna do my puffy
coat over and my round embossed shoulder
bags and Stella girl is crazy
shortly
we were there for getting our and hops
now I'm a juice for us getting a late
lunch and then I'm gonna head down to
Soho I am eating cute pensive raw
literally looks like baby food but it's
the best oatmeal ever and then they do
their homemade jam which is so
I just got back from shopping yeah I
didn't buy one thing I know that's so
strange and so not like me but it was so
weird every store I went into I went to
Topshop I went to Bloomingdale's I went
into Lord and Taylor and I just feel
like everything is so weird right now
and in between the seasons like this
sales section was so crazy it was
overwhelming me even though there wasn't
really much people there weren't many
people out I was I just thought so
overwhelmed and just like went home I
was like forget it I'm just gonna shop
online for Mexico so as soon as I get
some stuff together maybe I'll do like
go what I packed for mexico video or
something but I'm really excited to
start shopping because I've been in
sweaters and layers for months now so
time to get some shorts on see so today
I'm getting ready to I just have kind of
a day of filming today so that's what
I'm getting ready for right now also
something else is going on that I don't
know if I'm ready to share just why yeah
it's more of like a personal thing
rather than a business or like YouTube
things so I will share it soon it's just
kind of still in the works so I'm not
gonna share anything just quite yet but
I will figure out everything let's just
say once I get it started once I start
doing it for my video that goes live on
Friday I am filming a kind of like vlogs
style how to put a complete outfit
together I mean I know that sounds kind
of like silly but when you break it down
into like what you choose first and then
like what follows and then how you how I
choose my accessories and my shoes and
stuff like that I think it's gonna be
pretty cool I've never shot a video like
this before so we'll see how it goes but
I think it could be cool so what I like
to do is kind of before I film I like to
sit down and plan exactly like
storyboard exactly how the video is
gonna look and even down to like the
last like edit like a swipe in here just
so I can visually see it on my computer
before I film it that way I kind of know
what I'm talking about
when I'm filming I think that's all I
have my bat my stupid camera is getting
hot it's the worst thing about this
camera is that it gets hot so quickly
but I will finish getting ready and I
will see you guys a little bit later
today I'm glad we got to catch up
because and I feel like now we're caught
up now we're back to where we were when
we left off so oh my brows my brows are
doing good I shade them in just a little
bit I do need to go get them
touched up I think I'm gonna try to do
that before we go to Mexico so I'll take
you with me if we do that but so far I
am absolutely loving them I actually
didn't have any scabs or any flaking or
peeling or anything like that or itching
so that was good but we'll see what
happens there but I'll see you guys and
limit so okay I'm done with my makeup
sort of do you remember when I told you
guys like last month or so that I had
this lip liner that it was literally
like my new favorite color but it's
plastic and as soon as it ran down I
didn't know how to get pencil it doesn't
roll up I was like what do I do and you
guys were like go ahead and sharpen it
so I sharpened it and it worked
obviously but now the pencil the color
part is super shaky I don't know why
someone would make a plastic lip pencil
instead of just like a wooden one like
everybody else but yeah now it's really
hard to line my lips because it's super
shaky what the hell like all over the
life ah yeah I don't know hey it's like
a loose piece oh
just pulled it out okay wait so maybe
maybe I just need to sharpen it again
thing like really tests your
intelligence like just really makes you
question first of all how is anybody
gonna line the lips with something that
fat in short
second of all it's still loose
feels like a loose tooth right what else
you can't fall asleep when you're
counting stars got it together
you might say wait
No
take a battery will tell you what I saw
would you break it
Frane just went down and got the
packages and I'll show you guys a couple
of things we got a new tripod which I'm
really excited about because ours right
where'd we get that tripod like when I
first started doing youtube videos and
sometimes it like falls on its own it's
missing a bunch of pieces I don't know
why we have an ordered one sooner but
this is the one we got and I'll link it
below on Amazon for you but I like it
because you can like rotate it up and
down and side-to-side like ours right
now the cameras on it and it's just
stuck
and sometimes it films kind of crooked
so like my style videos or sometimes not
level which is super annoying so got
this I ordered a 4-pack of Stella's
favorite dog treats which are called
fruta bowls and this one's pumpkin
cranberry sweet potato and pecan pumpkin
and apple and pumpkin and blueberry and
they have pretty clean ingredients like
I recognize everything that's in there
so I like that got her some shampoo
because I just needed some I got the
buddy wash it seemed to have really good
reviews and I got the lavender and mint
awesome shoes but I ordered a size that
was too small so I just ordered another
pair so when they get here I'll show you
those but they're really cool you got a
package from one of my favorite packages
to get from origins and look how cute
this is the poor perfecting cooling
primer is in this little bag of like
crystals and then the cleansing makeup
removing jelly cleanser has jellybeans
in it Jonah and I just squirted some of
this on our skin and it's cooling it
feels like you're putting dry ice on
your hand
TRAI yeah oh my god and it's so cold I
love it it feels really nice yeah that's
interesting
it dries it's not like greasy it sinks
in like it was absorbs really nicely in
your skin seems then is overhead all of
a sudden it's getting redder and redder
are you getting pinkeye have you had
pinkeye before does it itch
I mean like saline solution I said
cooling because it last time it sent the
cleansing makeup removing gel aid and
I've actually tried makeup removing
jelly before and I really really like it
yeah it's just basically like jelly both
of them smells so fresh and clean only
problem I have with the kind of makeup
remover that I'm using now is that it's
liquid so it's like cleansing oils when
I'm in the shower and I squirt it in my
hands
it just like runs all over the place so
the good thing about this is that you
get like a glob and then you can take
your makeup off and you're not wasting
any a glob abdullah abdullah this olive
of cleansing jelly on the back of your
hand that's work that's the worst don't
ever no i will not have a sort of
anything alright would you like a squirt
i think that's all we have for right now
thank you origin for sending some really
cool new products I always love testing
their products because I always end up
putting them like front and center in my
beauty routine so always love their
stuff
[Laughter]
we just made dinner we did Mandarin wait
no this is like pulled pork hold on the
Gardein pork 'less bites and I did brown
rice carrots broccoli and the Gardein
it's gonna be bomb diggity I am headed
to run a few errands it is 8 o'clock in
the morning and Ryan is going to the gym
into the trash we just happened to get
ready at the same time so we're leaving
together wonder how cold it is I think
I'm gonna walk over
I brought my gloves do some wearing my
big grey Cobra Zara and Andre I just
have on my active 90 90 flex leggings
when they called from Amazon just like a
white turtleneck and then my layers I
don't think you have a white turtleneck
on I mean
and then black don't like white scarf
Evan have coffee this way I Selene toad
and my take boots Oh
for all of you guys asking me about
these chain boots that these at Zara a
while ago but Steve Madden just came out
with like the exact same boots so I will
link them below I've seen them a person
and they look exactly the same like it's
crazy crazy
well this snow still on the ground
and that's that cold today though so I'm
guessing it's gonna melt at some point I
don't know if you guys remember a
fashion week last year around this time
that a huge Blizzard came in I'm like
praying that doesn't happen again
I just wanted to share with you guys a
podcast I'm listening to right now my
friend Ryan Moran who lives in Austin
Texas his podcast called freedom
Fastlane really good really really good
for those of you interested I am in Lord
&amp;amp; Taylor right now and sure I found this
olive colored skirt it's really high
waisted so I think with like a cute bra
