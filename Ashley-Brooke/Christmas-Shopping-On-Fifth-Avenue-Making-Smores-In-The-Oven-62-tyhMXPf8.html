conditioner and open the window because
it's a beautiful today finally actual
New York weather right now it's 44
degrees and cloudy and basically just
wasting time while I'm waiting for Ryan
to get ready he was on a business call
so he's still getting ready and I'm just
kind of waiting for him you've probably
seen these things in the living room as
I'm vlogging and stuff this is my light
setup for when I do a makeup in hair
videos and they just kind of live here
because I don't know how to put them
down and Ryan says they're a pain in the
ass so we just leave them here and you
know when we have people over we have a
wave so ugly what's up guys it is Friday
December 18th and we are about to head
out to go Christmas shopping we are
gonna go down Fifth Avenue to a few
places and then we have to buy me a
suitcase because mine's broken and I'm
going home for Christmas in a few days
and one wheel is like on its last leg no
pun intended his last meal so I gotta
get a new suitcase and we are getting
some sunglasses fixed I had some tom
boards that somehow became Ryan's tom
boards and so now we have to get Ryan
tom boards thick because the lens popped
out and they were just too expensive to
not get them fixed so that is what we're
doing today ready
you need to add anything some coffee and
get some coffee because Ryan's in a bad
mood because he hasn't had enough
caffeine today he's in a bad way
Hey okay let's go wait really quick come

cut yesterday this looks so good by the
way but who else gets their hair cut by
the same guy that cuts your hair

from The Walking Dead Ryan has sat in
the same chair as Daryl what your but I
probably got some in his butt on my bud
Lee yeah your butt touch the same chair
but gross okay wait do you feel a little
bit cooler now that you shared the same
chair it's Darryl it feels somewhat
dirtier because he's kind of a
disheveled guy you know life from what
I've heard yeah brother

song

like I just had my purse where is it

like you had it last no you had it last
it's always easy to blame other people
when things go wrong right
pretty

we're going down Fifth Avenue and the
thing about this Avenue is that there's
snow there aren't any like restaurants
it's mainly just shopping so it's hard
to stop in and go find something to eat
