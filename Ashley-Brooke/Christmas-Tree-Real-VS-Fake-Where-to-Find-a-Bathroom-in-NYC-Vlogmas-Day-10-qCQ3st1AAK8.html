we just got done with dinner wait why is
it hard okay so now we're headed home
shower up I'm gonna get in bed and then
we're gonna do a little comment
answering which is kind of like become
my favorite part of the whole entire day
I'm like I can't wait to get home and
read all the comments and stuff I'm into
them to walk through times to bear
hearing a little bit so I had to put my
camera away and like laser focus on
where I'm going and I run into someone
hey babe
how was your date today
what's your favorite part of the day
waking up so you know you're not dead
that's deep
like that I'm just being grateful to be
alive I'm totally grateful but let me
just make sure everyone knows that we
love whenever we're out walking for a
long time we always find a hotel to say
have heaters outside that overhang so
it's nice the quick tip for you and you
can always also go to the bathroom and
them too if you permit that the city and
you have to go to the bathroom usually
hotel lobbies will do you right no boobs
out we are answering questions right now
all right let's start here so I've seen
lots of comments about shameless I'm
saying it's great some saying it's good
but they've seen better so climate Hugh
and it was so funny faked being from
Ryan yeah I told him to stop doing that
but he just kept you guys meal plan for
an entire month what is your secret hmm
I don't like I don't meal plan I just
basically we make the same things
between if you want to be in the comment
section just tell me did you okay okay
let's try it on this little furball
beside me atilla there is no time to
waste
we are on 7% battery do you understand
the Severinus of this situation I don't
think you okay Tara pop just like
resting on my leg oh she got embarrassed
meal planning yeah we just basically
make the same things every month you
know we do burgers we do lots of bowls
so we just kind of buy the same things
and just make different dishes with them
you just kind of have to feel out what
you like and just kind of go from here
like we have usually the same things for
breakfast every morning we usually have
oatmeal tofu with like avocado and salsa
so it's been a long a lot of time trying
to figure out what we like it to kind of
get it down to to where we don't
overspend on groceries
we get the right amount for the month my
hubby and I watch our vlogmas together
every night and we just moved from New
York to Dallas that's cool I like Dallas
now this is cool okay Stella we're on
five percent battery now hey Siri how do
I get Stella to leave me alone
free Stella or leave her I can't leave
her I know she's my girl tell me buddy
do you wear a wedding band
no this is a little gold ring and I've
got one here too that I've been wearing
for about I don't know six years maybe
and this is just like the only finger
that it fits on on this hands I wouldn't
already informed you but I'm still
laughing that you couldn't sharpen those
lip pencils thanks misty you know I
should just text misty for any makeup
issues I ever have because she just
knows everything she's kind of like Ryan
like Ryan knows everything about
everything any time I have a question I
ask Ryan and he just knows the answer
and I feel like Misty's kind of like
that too so I had no idea that you could
sharpen that plastic like it literally
feels like just hard plastic that blows
my mind so tomorrow I'm going to get my
sharpener and I'm gonna sharpen that
damn lip plastic pencil dr. jart is a
Korean brand I am Korean dr. jart was my
favorite brand I'm happy to know that
you're using a Korean brand oh my gosh I
love dr. chards products his she masks
are probably like my my favorite sheet
masks that I've thought I've ever used
I laughed are you saying you weren't
gonna put Ryan at the end of the vlog
after you answered questions his
reflection was in the window the whole
time we'll have a diffuser what are your
fav Orioles so since I've been a little
stopped up I've been doing eucalyptus
but I really love lavender when I'm
going to sleep oh no she this girl threw
away so many plastic liners before she
realized that you could sharpen them
that sucks cuz I was actually about to
throw throw that one away I thought that
jeans were from Zara
let's get Ryan the man Cape poncho thing
for Christmas now I feel like it kind of
have to recommend for someone who is
wanting to change their eating lifestyle
to more of a plant-based vegan clean
eating where would you start I would
start with meat um I don't know it just
depends like I cut out eating meat and
dairy just cold turkey and then just
kind of never looked back but if you're
a big meat-eater I would just kind of
slowly start cutting it out I mean try
to stop cold turkey you know I'm gonna
gosh I really hate for you to throw away
like good groceries so maybe just kind
of start introducing it into your diet
and just see how your body reacts to it
at least switch out your milk to almond
or coconut if you use a lot of butter
they have smart what is that brown that
makes the good butter that's the kind
that I use and I can't even more smart
balanced a pink and gray scarf is from
Urban Outfitters Urban Outfitters
actually makes the best big cozy like
wrap wrap like scarves you and Ryan are
such old souls I love that we really are
old souls you know as I'm in bed with my
glasses at nine o'clock anybody know
what coat Ryan is wearing I believe his
gray coat is from Zara all right here's
an interesting comment from Samantha so
I posted I think it was in yesterday's
vlog miss I got this comment on my
Instagram and I addressed it in the Q&amp;amp;A
in the in the comment answering section
person and on my Instagram said that
ignore all of the other stuff that she
says like I don't even understand it but
she said that uh you know something
about trees being bad which I get how
many trees are cut down for Christmas I
get that but then you know I have people
saying real trees are more
environmentally friendly than a fig tree
fake trees are terrible for the
environment I kind of agree with that
but then when you think about it it's
like well if you have a fake tree and
you literally keep it in your family for
twenty years
then is it really or I don't know
I just you know this is kind of an
interesting topic could be it's not
interesting maybe you're like watching
this and you're like really doesn't
matter Ashley oh no people just seem to
get so hyped up about it especially that
Instagram commenter I was like
jakku attack like you know commented the
weird comment you also going to other
people's instagrams who have thousands
of presents under the tree are you you
know making comment to them wondering if
they're gonna recycle it where's all
that wrapping paper gonna go what about
all the plastic you know that that the
toys are in and that's just kind of
curious I just want to know if I'm the
only one here yelling at about a tree or
if you're yelling at everybody else you
know what though after all that said and
done like I'm not the kind of person to
judge if you want to fake a real tree it
doesn't bother me growing up I've had a
fake one my whole life like I think our
family has had the same tree for just
like years and years and years I buy
real ones for my apartment who freakin
cares it's Christmas just be happy be
thankful be grateful um enjoy the
Christmas music put on some Michael
Buble have a glass of wine wrap presents
with your family go Christmas shopping
enjoy just being alive bear burger is my
favorite when I lived in Hell's Kitchen
it was right around the corner Oh bear
burgers so great if you guys come to New
York you gotta try bear burger
especially you have if you have people
who donate meat or anything like that
they have options for both parties
clothes from life I her are gonna be
available outside the US yeah so all of
our T's and sweatshirts are available
worldwide and we do free shipping
worldwide so it looks like taking taking
the whole sharpeners situation here it
looks like I need the right kind of
sharpener hmm Ryan's collars up wins
yeah Ryan won Ryan won that Joey stick
is so giant tell me about it have you
ever thought of visiting Seattle oh my
gosh I would love to visit Seattle and I
can't believe I never have there an even
if vlog yeah
I feel like I'm cheating you guys cuz
like 20 minutes of it is cool answering
questions perfume are you using stuff
for the past few days I've been using
Elizabeth and James the black one gosh I
never know what it's called I should
probably figure it out
Ryan eats most random things Raven yep
no idea like I don't even film like 90%
of the things where I need think
sometimes I look at its plate and I'm
like what are you do you guys remember
the vlog where he where I made noodles
with like Brussels and I don't know it
