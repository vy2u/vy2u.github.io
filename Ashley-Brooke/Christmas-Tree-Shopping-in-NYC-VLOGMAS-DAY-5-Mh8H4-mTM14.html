by the situation Merry Christmas you
filthy animal so little update on my
cold sinus infection whatever I'm
feeling like my body feels better and
that was the look worst part of being
sick it's when you just have no energy
and like your body just like your your
body aches and like your skin hurts um
my head and like my throat it's still
hurt but like I feel better so that's
good hopefully feeling better and not to
get my Christmas tree tonight I was
really hoping to go get it yesterday or
the day before but um I don't know I
just didn't want to like I hate it when
people are sick and they go out and do
things you're just spreading your germs
so I just tried to stay home I know I
went to the grocery store but that's
before I knew I was like sick I thought
it was just allergies so I've been
trying to be a nice citizen of New York
and not spread my germs to some like
little kid or old person or just anybody
now I'm going to film a video for Ulta
it's like a holiday makeup look so I'm
really excited they let me pick some
really cool stuff off of their site I'll
show you what I got before I start
filming
I need to do it now while the Lighting's
like nice this is the best kind of
lighting for filming honestly like the
overcast because then the lighting in my
apartment doesn't change it just kind of
stays the same to start filming this
I'll show you what I have right here
guys Tarte cover FX Tila Becca Anastacio
Beverly Hills this is blush these three
colors but I love these lip colors
let's see Jolie and Bisou Bisou
really liked this but I was ordering
online and I got this like purple color
and I really thought it was gold but
online online it looks gold but then
when you when I got it I was like oh
this is actually a very very purple top
even looks gold we're just gonna roll
with it we're gonna see what we can come
up with all right I'm gonna go film next
time you see me I'll be so very
beautiful huh let me show you my makeup
so I did a like gold gold eye right here
gold on right here they did an ombre lip
I did like a burgundy in a pink combo
then cut a little bit of contouring and
suddenly shimmer on my cheek I feel like
I'm going somewhere I really put a full
face of makeup on we're United gorgeous
gonna get our tree all right they're
gonna give me the best deal ever that'll
be like licking that ombre lip you get
$10 off nice looking broad at the
treehouse tree five free shot tree farm
treasure trove a tree treasure trove
thank you
look at you and all grave oh my gosh
Marie isn't taking such a good care of
me thank you just a caretaker that's
what I do you are a caretaker here ooh
color what is this this holiday she
booked our flights for going home for
Christmas
good oh man you guys want to see some
Christmas decorations wait till you see
my house I'll show you all my mom Santa
Claus almost Simpson's house is very
good very Christmassy misty was texting
me and she wants to see a challenge of
either you putting my makeup on me or me
doing my makeup without a mirror but I
just
that that would be a disaster I like not
even a funny one they both sound like a
disaster so I think I'm gonna have you
do my makeup I'll shoot for tomorrow
okay per Thursday no wait we have to
shoot videos tomorrow I don't dress for
Thursday okay we'll do it on Thursday
then comfortable nope that's my leg
trying to hold myself up okay so I don't
normally walk around in the middle of
the day in PJs but today I am because I
am shooting an Instagram photo for
Victoria's Secret promoting their
jammies and damn he's a really comfy um
so I'm kind of trying to create like a
comfy cozy bedroom set up here I thought
that this great blanket kind of matched
the PJs but I just kinda have to come up
with the concept so I was thinking you
know like shopping for the holidays like
lounging in bed in your PJs shopping
online so I think I'm gonna kind of
Center it around that maybe have my
computer Ryan's on a call right now with
one of his business partners so as soon
as they're off he is lucky enough to get
to take exercise just hi hi cutie um
film the video for Ulta I edited it
makeup videos are like the easiest thing
Ted and it takes like no time so I got
that done in like an hour and a half
since it over for a review to make sure
everything's good make sure they like it
and I'll probably have to do a few
changes but that's normal
I'm gonna wait for Ryan and we're gonna
take some photos Hey it is 4:40 and
we're taking a break from work so go get
our trip but
I'm just so mad okay so last year when
we got our tree no the year before it
was freezing and it was like 30 degrees
it was so perfect I just look at the
weather 16 what kind of BS weather
Christmas tree vines situation is that
needless to say I'm not happy about the
weather situation but we're getting the
tree so here's the thing we have to go
take we have some bags to take to
storage we're gonna go drop the backstop
and storage get the tree stand from
storage and then go grab the Christmas
tree I think there's a little Christmas
tree farm like right by my apartment and
you're doing this backwards that's why
that's so difficult see how you're going
into weird directions do you just want
me to show you what to do I see how this
thing pivots let me do this in the front
and then you guys just let me what are
some little-known headache remedies
and the tylenol silence hey do you think
somebody's gonna try to get in there's
so much space we have
so we had one taker
go get our tree but first I got two
boxes from Zara my Black Friday stuff
that I will show you tomorrow and it's a
little bit more light it looks like a
lot but it's like shoes and like two
coats so it is too much it's doing the
three thing is because they're big
things when I was a puffer coat so it's
like very large like this story okay hey
tree time tree time so wow it's dark
call the police
is it Christmas tree time skinny skin Oh
already
that one
that guy what do you think yeah he's
pretty thin
really want this short little chubby you
want a short chubby
so far I have my eye on now what do you
think what speaks to me I will tell you
what speaks to your eye the two we just
saw all right so it was that one or this
one I kind of liked that one because I
feel bad for it because it's got like a
lot of branches missing right here okay
we decided we're gonna go with the
smaller one because we don't really know
where it's gonna go so it needs to be
super small
I love it it's nice and skinny
whoa look at you okay we're back boy
that was a disaster it started pouring
rain on our way back so we were like
running rime of the tree mule Estella
that was a disaster so I'm gonna get
Dinner started actually and while
dinner's cooking we're gonna put the
tree up I think I'm gonna make burgers
this is like the first time since I've
been sick that I've had like an appetite
and I know it's probably like not a good
idea but I want a burger so bad so I'm
gonna do burgers and then probably like
a side of veggies
what driving a car wash donut party down
the stairs we can't eat those doughnuts
I'm real good they were not the trees in
the hallway Ryan's about to go get it
I had to put Olivia here honestly like I
just think that's where she's gonna have
to go like I I'm at a loss because
there's really no other room anywhere
else
now I'm stopping my baby's welcome back
here's our tree oh my gosh look at it
it's beautiful new york city apartment
life small apartment life oh I love it I
think it's pushed a little too far in
this corner though hold on oh I love it
and they in might just need time to
settle I have to play with the lights a
little more we have white lights not
like like white cords oh it's so pretty
oh my gosh laughter make fun of you for
talking to mouth full of what I'm doing
yeah go burger with avocado and follow
my heart go out and then Miam roasted
broccoli with garlic and salt pepper I
really am gonna not feel me eating
anymore hey guys here we are in bed
again it's a little dark
I'm sure to bring my flyaways to bed
tonight I just took a shower and like I
just couldn't be bothered with my shower
cap so um these little pieces of hair
get wet and then I fly out feeling a
little bit better gradually slowly
hopefully tomorrow I'm like 100% gonna
go to the gym I don't care about
anything else

gym and like I know that's gonna make me
feel better it is time for answering

as much as you seem to that's so cool um
you know I never want to like push my

people but if it's something that you've
been wanting to do and seeing me do it

with that stays at the end of my bed my
comforter was in the washing machine

reason um I actually have never used
loving tan but misty like swears by
loving Tam she uses it and says it's
amazing I just have not
I've never gotten my hands on something
but I would love to try it oh I totally
forgot someone commented earlier it was
a really long comment and she was very
concerned that I didn't bring my
shopping bags to Whole Foods that I used
the paper bags and it's so funny that
you said that because we were that's the
morning that I was like not feeling well
at all we were in Whole Foods done
grocery shopping and I was like Ryan we
forgot our bags like I swear I almost
went home and got that meringue was like
no just let it fly this one time so just
know that I always bring my grocery bags
those of you guys who watch my vlogs do
you know I always bring my grocery bags
have you changed the mic settings on the
camera yeah I turned it down a little
bit but obviously if you know like can
you hear it maybe I'll turn it up just a
little bit more if you guys can't hear
it I'd love to see some workout routines
when you feel better yes that's one of
the thing
you know about Blahous last year I that
goes you know go into the gym and stuff
so but I feel better you'll definitely
see me at the gym I just like it's hard
to like get through my weekday without
going to the gym cuz it's just part of
my routine and it makes me feel
energized it makes me feel good I'm a
guy and I have to say I enjoy watching
your vlogs what's up rod thanks for
watching the vlogs how do you keep your
place still clean but yes like I have a
very small living space so it's really
easy to tell that something's out of
place and I made a rule to myself like a
long time ago
cuz I'm such a neat freak if if I get
something out I have to put it back as
if you let I just pile up in the pile up
and pile up like laundry like as soon as
I take it out of the dryer I just
immediately put it away otherwise it'll
just pile so I really try my best to
just like keep everything put away
obviously there are crazy days where I
kind of clean up at the end of the day
but I cannot go to bed with my apartment
like a mess like I can't have dirty
dishes in the sink the floor has to be
clean oh my god I'm still annoying you
look back on 8:33 in the video it sounds
like you have a British accent oh come
true oh no this stuff your face girl
I said I see your name it's really
pretty I didn't mean to be rude by
saying stuff your face with food but you
guys always have so much food in your
mouth while filming haha I mean it's
true I guess oh I didn't take it
personal like don't don't
I was joking it was a joke let's just
please see more of your actual life like
dinner ryan workouts yeah like i will
definitely do that once i'm like better
I just I have to pour misty watching it
for I am because she's sick I got misty
misty said when she came over here I'm
so sorry Missy if I don't know and I was
sick I would have told you not to come
over sometimes Stella looks like the
cutest sloth ever true whoa whoa whoa
this is a long-long threat what's going
on here
vlog max equals vlog plus Christmas
Christmas so where's your Christmas
related content don't do vlogmas just
because some of your viewers asked for
it you don't seem to be one of those
people excited for Christmas at all you
decor you do nothing related to
Christmas and that's okay you don't have
to but don't pretend this is vlogmas I
mean your vlogs are okay not what
vlogmas is about dot dot dot yeah okay
I'm gonna start at the top you don't see
one of those people excited for
Christmas girl it is day five I mean
your vlogs are okay I'm decorate alright
so here's the thing about decorating I
would love to decorate like I told you
if you guys saw my mom my mom and dad's
house you will see their house I grew up
with a fully decorated Christmas house
here is the thing though where am I
gonna put the decorations once they're
done I don't even have like every square
inch of my apartment is packed my new
storage unit every square inch like I
don't know where I would put I wouldn't
trust me I would love nothing more than
a fully Christmas toute apartment but I
just can't like it's just not possible
with my storage space person who did
this comment lle you could be like
totally right I guess I just thought
that vlogmas was vlogging everyday up
until Christmas and then showing things
here and there like going Christmas
shopping setting up your tree you know
going home for the holidays spending
time with your family so I could be
totally wrong because this is what I did
last year and no one corrected me so and
I don't I haven't watched anyone elses
vlogmas so I truly really don't know so
if I'm wrong you guys let me know I
don't know if I could do like Christmas
stuff every single day that just seems
like a lot of Christmas stuff don't
pretend this is vlogmas and all caps
I feel like you're yelling at me I don't
know why don't do vlogmas just because
some of your viewers asked for it well
yeah I feel like that's like the perfect
reason to do vlogmas is because viewers
asked for it why you do certain videos
is because you are entertaining your
viewers and if your viewers ask for
something you give it to them I could be
wrong about that do though I don't know
everyone asking about my cardigan
yesterday um MSL five
kind of responded to all you guys mostly
but it's from Urban Outfitters it's
probably sold out but earlier this year
it was too urban
god this is amazing my girlfriend enough
my for the night went back to an
after-party with these guys would night
after 1 oak which is the club and in the
midst of our drunken haze I realized
that guy lived in your building because
they recognized the lobby ah
alright guys I think that's it for me
Mentos starting to like it like sore but
I will see you all tomorrow
hey and fYI I did do something
Christmassy yesterday I watched elf and
I told you about it and if I'm not
mistaken that is very Christmassy
kidding we'll do some Christmas stuff I
mean I'm not gonna like I can't do
Christmas stuff every single day but
like obviously we're gonna go Christmas
shopping and I definitely want to like
show you all the cool holiday windows
and the lights and the tree um I want to
go ice skating so badly you'll see my
family we're gonna go home for Christmas
