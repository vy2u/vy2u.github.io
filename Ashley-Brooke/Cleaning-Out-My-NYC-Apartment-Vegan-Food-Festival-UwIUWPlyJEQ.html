sorry yeah all right we're having a
we're having a team debate No okay we're
debating on what a dropkick is because I
just told Ryan that I was gonna dropkick
him and now we all have different
meanings of a dropkick no you know
there's one meaning what is your
definition of a dropkick
okay wait wait so that's a person yeah
the soccer balls in prison okay you drop
and the person just flies on the windows
the elbow you like someone behind you
and you let go of that whoa whoa
that was way too advanced can you just
break it down for the lips and lay
people that are watching the person is
in front of you and you run up you got
one by the neck and you know that's
certainly not a dropkick okay let's try
this
what's the drop kick Ryan why don't you
just YouTube it and you can see exactly
that I'm right
what a drama kids kick this WWE style
run again somebody jump up two feet kick
fall to the ground that's all right then
that's why it's a drop getting a flying
dropkick that's what I'm on the
compilation is it good are you watching
it wait I gotta come over there
I don't know I'm gonna be dropped
yeah exactly Oh Brian yeah let me
dropkick you please I'm making dinner so
