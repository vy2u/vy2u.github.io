channel today I'm doing a haul and I've
got quite a few things going on on my
floor oh I've got clothes I've got some
candy it doesn't shoot and I don't know
I start here like staring at everything
like what's going on you're requesting a
zora sale haul so I do have some stuff
to show you from that so I will nope you
know what I'm going to start with shoes
because they're right here easy to grab
for my first pair of shoes I got some
adidas Stella McCartney sneakers my
third pair of sneakers I'm starting to
become obsessed so this is not good so
this is what they look like and they are
super cool there's so much print and
color going on I saw these and I was
like I have to have them got so many fun
colors and they literally weigh like
nothing so they're super easy to work
out in next we have two pair from Steve
Madden and my first pair it got to be
kind of embroidered a rose flat and I
thought the colors were so nice it's
texture and print and this is kind of
like define my style in one shoe it's
comfortable casual we get like print and
color and stuff so I love these 5:7 a
white foot so if you guys have a wide
foot definitely off the size because
they are real narrow
so they still fit like in the links part
which is weird
next from Steve Madden is a pair of
loafers little white socks for loafers
they are these gold metallics platform
loafers
I love these they are so lightweight too
usually all my platform loafers are so
heavy and there's such like a burden to
just carry around all day but I love
these because they're really light but I
like that it's a darker metallic gold
it's not so bright
it's bright but it's not like blinding
metallic right okay and these I got a
size six and normally I'm a size six but
sometimes my back foot needs a little
extra whoo okay I will go next with the
candy because I'm like a little hungry I
went to a sugarfina and if you guys not
know sugarfina and you should definitely
check it out they have the funnest candy
things like champagne flavor gummy bears
and sweet cute gift items and fun stuff
like that for my first candy I got
Mediate peanut butter malt ball already
had a couple of these with an imaginary
one mmm glam yeah you might have
montbello your soul them there's
chocolate that I got are the single malt
scotch chocolate balls and it says
either Ryan's he got these there's
actually scotch in the candy still it's
like a really cool gift for like your
dad or in the toilet
there's actually liquid scotch in
science them it's not like cooked into
the chocolate so I'm shocked texts are
the long-stem roses gummies these are
obviously mine it's so cute
well this for fun you definitely taste
like floral way better than the stock
one moving on I'll start with my random
ish items first that don't really have
friends from the same store this bag is
from century 21 and I thought it was
very pro Enza looking and love Proenza
and so I had to have this I'm going to
get a another chain for this because I
think this kind of makes it look a
little cheap but I got this one for
eight dollars and forty eight cents so I
thought that was a pretty good steal for
helmets I'll be using this in next I got
this bra workout top from forever 21 and
I got a medium that way it's a little
bit longer so I can wear it as a top I
thought the marble print was really
pretty as well as the coral-colored
spectrum and I actually got it to go
with my ello a yoga pant II most
comfortable pants like I'm so mad at
myself for by me because now I want to
buy every color I've been looking for a
pair of white workout leggings for so
long that aren't see-through try these
on disability' prisoner and all good not
see-through at all they're high-waisted
they're nice and thick and like what
feels like it's holding you in like
you're amazing so yeah I thought this
was a cute little outfit it's from what
is this urban else Urban Outfitters I
only got whoa whoa you know a few
accessories from Urban Outfitters the
first one is this candle
you know who floors lane
love the packaging and the details on it
but this is the Williamsburg since and I
can't really explain a sense like oh
wait
tobacco into chewy that's what the scent
is and yes it's different sound like it
would be great but it's good I promise
and it was on sale for $9.99 so I loved
it I'm going to put like my makeup
brushes and stuff in this once it's out
next I've got little perfume by a thorn
and it's the rose quartz rose water
Lotus and musk and it's really nice I
got it and then now a bunch the other
scents kind of smelled typical you know
perfume kind of scent but this one
really stuck out to me so I grabbed it I
think the packaging this really cools
you wasn't it hey Janice hmm I thought
this little layering top which I thought
was nice I love the colors so the colors
were really really cool and interesting
they got this to wear was like
high-waisted jeans you know it's a
leather jacket kind of a layering piece
or I mean I think it's cool by itself
because the sleeves are some really cool
detailing on them probably my favorite
sign from H&amp;amp;M and it was this brown and
navy blazer and I got this on sale for
$15 had to get a size 8 you can test all
there was but I think it looks really
cool oversized it's like got a good
oversized respect to it so happy to find
at these high-waisted straight leg jeans
from H&amp;amp;M I think they're just really
good classic high waisted straight leg
jeans I mean I think the color is great
it's going to be good for spring I like
the rip placement so I think these will
be a good kind of go to everyday Jean to
wear with flats or slides or like a
lower ankle bootie something on way I
have what do I have my Zara sale stuff
you know what actually I'll start with
the one non sale item
got her basic sweater but it's got like
a little bell sweep to it a little
tighter here with the Bell and it's one
of those really really really soft
sweaters but I thought it would be
pretty tough tin some high-waisted jeans
with like a cool belt even though I'm
kind of wearing something simpler next I
got this little layering top because I
don't have a Navy
mock neck basic top and I think this was
like $12 and I've been looking for one
still feel like I'm having it I got this
little chain denim backpack couple of
years ago I really wanted this Stella
Stella McCartney's in a backpack but it
had it was just so much going on it had
all of these different colors of denim
on and I just wanted a solid color so
then I saw this as Laura sale and I was
like what I've been looking for so I
grabbed this for spring and this was $19
marked down from 40 yeah 40 so I was
happy to find that I thought it was
really cute
next I got this olive green cardigan
that I think was in my latest tab style
video but I'm such a red person and this
cardigan is piped
red piping on it so I was like what I
grabbed this I've got so many bags and
stuff that'll go with it and it's really
cozy and comfy and it's kind of heavy so
you know I can probably stop start
wearing it place it 70 and I got it for
40 so that's a pretty good deal I have
to get a medium though because they were
out of smalls but you know it works kind
of oversized and cool so next I got this
coat because I thought the colors were
so cool it's yellow gray white in the
black so I was like I don't really have
anything with this color tone so I
grabbed this and this was a hundred and
it was marked down to 49.99 so that was
a steal for a good coat and it's kind of
shaped less and just
basic this would kind of take me into
spring as well I can see it you know
kind with the space grunts to wearing it
as a blazer instead of a coat so that
was kind of my thought process behind
that and laughs it's probably one of my
favorites Aras Dale purchases and it is
in this suede like jacket it's like this
really pretty blush pink color and Ascot
started andromus on it and also the back
is the same also it's no hard to find a
jacket that has stuff on the back of it
you know you always see stuff on the
front but then the pattern doesn't carry
to the back so you're like what so I was
excited to find this and I think this
was 190 or 200 and I got it for 60 so
this was a good find I'll wear this a
lot during the spring I like the way it
fits - kind of cool fit to it I think
that is it for this haul we've got stuff
everywhere I'm sure I'll find stuff
after I stopped filming and I'm like
wait stay tuned for the next hauls so
yeah I hope you loved it and I will try
to link everything below if I can't find
it I will link something similar so
don't you worry and I will see you guys
in my next video bye
