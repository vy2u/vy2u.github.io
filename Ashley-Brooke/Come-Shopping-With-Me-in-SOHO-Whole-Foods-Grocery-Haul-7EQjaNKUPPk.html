and then need another one every yeah
hey guys so today we're gonna do a
little exploring in Soho I'm gonna take
you we're gonna go do a little shopping
for some spring items because I don't
know I just every store that I've gone
do lately I just can't find anything
that I love so I'm really gonna focus
today because I do need some new stuff
for new style videos so I think we're
gonna go to our rid Thea I think I want
to go to the glossier showroom so we're
gonna have some fun so I like to get
there super early I like to go on a
weekday it is Friday so that kind of
counts as a weekend and Soho it gets
kind of crazy on Friday but we're gonna
go early that way we can beat the crowds
and when we get back to my apartment
I'll show you what we got
okay I love these they're like elastic
waistband this skirts really cute girly
and I love this dress it's super
comfortable it's like cotton and it's
got these not cut up the fold stripes
and haven't bought anything Paisley and
so long like years but I think this is
really pretty for like working around
the house
not like housework but like what I'm
working from home it's really
comfortable
we're leaving Zara I think I'm gonna go
to urban Theon across the street
and then resuming the
he to update you guys in a little bit on
something that annoyed me I'll tell you
later let's remind me this is mine this
is not mine
justice
all right so here is the glossier about
to pop in there I'm gonna see if I can
film but I doubt it we'll see
my millat CA goodies show you guys what
I got when I get home I'm going to
Sephora to return something and then I'm
gonna go to what dome and then we're
headed
all right this is my favorite magazine
store in SoHo this is where I get all of
my coffee table books I'll show you guys
more when I get home
I am back from being out and had
actually been back for a while so I took
Stella out after I got back and I'm
usually really good about watching the
sidewalk and making sure that we're not
stepping in anything weird because it's
New York and you know that it's just
disgusting we've rounded the corner and
Stella stepped in the biggest pile of
dog poop and it was sorry that this
grows like it was mushy anyways I had to
grab her and carry her up to the
building and give her a bath immediately
so that's what we've been doing for the
past hour first of all with the
Bloomingdale's I tried on a few things
the two things I liked I really loved
the polkadot dress that I tried on the
white one with the black polka dots but
they didn't have my size so I'm
definitely gonna order that online
because it was so cute and I just didn't
get anything there that's the only thing
I really loved and it just didn't fit
but then I went to Eritrea and I'm
always going to tell you guys something
that annoys me so bad about her it's
yeah so if you have shopped it or it's
saying you know exactly what I'm talking
about but you walk in the fitting room
and it's literally a tiny box like if
you bend over you hit your head on the
wall and it's been second problem is
that there are zero mirrors in the
fitting room which I get you know they
want you to put the clothes on they want
you to come out would be nice to have an
option to have a you know mirror in the
fitting room and then I get that but
then they have dresses like the one I
bought which is completely sheer it
doesn't come with a lining underneath
and you've got people's husbands and
boyfriends and dads sitting on the couch
right there so you're kind of forced to
be like hi here's my paintings I ended
up getting this dress it is by Wilfred
and I just thought this was really
pretty it's like this textured
completely sheer midi dress and it's
white long-sleeved I just thought this
was so pretty a pair of probably with
some booties if I want
rested up maybe some heels or some like
a wedge sandals just love this bike to
Zara and I got this dress as I was
walking to the checkout Bessette
happened to anyone else i grabbed at
least one thing on my weight let it we
have had the t-shirt it's just this
really long t-shirt dress and I thought
it would be so great for you know
walking Stella in the morning just like
throwing it on or even belting it with
some booties ended up getting this dress
which I love fine you guys know where
this one with the knots in the front I
don't know I just thought the colors
we're so neutral and it's so versatile
and I just love this
but this skirt I'm going to get the
matching top to it they just didn't have
it in stock in my size at the store so
I'll probably get the matching top to it
and wear it as a set and I've got this
bag how cool this is it kinda looks
orange in the camera but this is like a
true red color but it's all beets how
fun is this I don't know I just thought
it was like very retro
oh my gosh wait a second I have a bead
problem and get these shorts because I
just thought they were fun and cute and
they were so short I hate super short
dozen shorts so when I find a good like
length I buy them I'm pretty sure I had
these when I was also eight but I love
them they're so cute and they're
high-waisted with wash too there's no
rips just like I like it and the B
problem is Steve Madden and let's see oh
I got these little slippers because they
were $7 and well I just thought the
color was cute they're just good for
like around the house but I love these
and I've been looking for just like a
pair of lake house slippers I guess that
I can let go take the trash just like
slip on and like run down the hall two
pairs of shoes from Steven
the first hair they're both Steven by
Steve Madden the first pair are these
pointed toe mules I just thought they
were so cool they've got really neutral
colors in them stop black gray tan
they're awesome and they're super
comfortable these guys like clearly
should metal knock off but you know what
though Chanel wants are way out of my
price range so I'm just gonna go with
these and they're really comfortable too
I went to gloss CA Oh see when we got
there so I couldn't fill in the glossy I
even asked the girl if I could and she
was like no get up taking some instant
stories you walk into the building and
you take the elevator up to the
penthouse and then from there it's just
just showroom so you can't buy anything
off of the floor everything's display
you can try everything there's a sink
you can wash it off and have a ticket
and you write down everything you want
you hand it to one of the ladies who
works there and then they grab it for
you and call your name and then you can
go so it's a pretty it's pretty cool the
way it was set up so I got the bomb.com
skin cell just in the original there was
no scent to this one then I got the
priming moisturizer really excited about
this I did another priming moisturizer
and it was called like the ultimate or
something but it felt so nice but I
could just tell it would break my face
out like it was a little too heavy for
me but if you guys like it that's not an
issue for you then I would go with
deluxe or the old cement or whatever
it's called got the milk jelly cleanser
I think this pretty much strips your
makeup off and I'm almost out of my BIOS
on so I do want to try something new
even though so far nothing beats the bio
songs but we'll see I've got the
solution exfoliating skin Perfector
just like an acne treatment which is
great you know you know I'm always down
for a good acne treatment
so we'll try this out Oh Brendan here
what's this oh I got the boy brow in
brown I think that's what you guys told
me to get in on my Instagram when I went
to their headquarters I went to their
headquarters I asked you guys what I
should get a new all said boy bra so I
got this in the color brown got the
perfume gloss see you because have you
guys smelled this yet whoa probably
explain it to you what it smells like it
is so are you guys know I'm not like a
florally scent person - my replica lazy
Sunday morning but this is so spicy and
oh my gosh it's just so great and I'm
pretty sure I mean I don't know this but
it smells like masculine as well like
either men or women could wear it but
wolf it is so good and what I love about
it is that it changes on my skin all day
so just smelling it like a couple of
hours ago smelled completely different
this is also Topshop I grabbed this coin
necklace I'm always on the hunt for a
good coin necklace and I thought this is
really interesting it kind of comes to a
point and then down favorite magazine
store in Soho oh my god you guys have to
go they have the best coffee table books
the best magazines and here's a little
tip for you I buy these magazines and I
tear the pages out of them and I frame
them as are and his prints can just be
so expensive this is 30 bucks for the
whole magazine so you get a cute coffee
table book and you also get tons of
editorial prints to frame so I got this
one right here I actually didn't mean to
get this one um it's fine it's cute
I pulled out my back I was like what
we've got is this one right here
well yes I should turn it around and
then this is the actual book right here
this magazine store the guys they're so
nice they know me when I come in and
everything is always in plastic wrap or
some sort of cover that way you know you
know it's protected and nothing's ripped
so but they always have one open that
you can flip there just to like see what
you're buying and then I by s magazine
it's pretty big and then I got this one
is really pretty so I love this for the
coffee table because it's got some
really pretty
you know gold and some like blush color
brown and some black I'm gonna go I have
to edit a video and try to get it out to
you guys today cuz it's Friday and I
have not even started editing just did
about three hours of work and now I'm

Mandarin chicken balls and I'm really
excited because I haven't had these in a
long time and I've been wanting it all
day let's get a dog food she wanted me
to let you know and here's my bowl I
always try to make things look super
nice and presentable when I'm showing
you but then like dirt
Oishi the longest tongue should we call
her being so bad where's the vlogger I
tell everybody that you tried to fight
Jenna and me and then you got
embarrassed because you blacked out
