is obviously a little bit of a different
style video this is a more of a blog
style video but I have a few meetings
coming up some events and some really
cool style videos that I just need some
new stuff for so I am gonna take you
guys with me out to go shopping for some
new stuff I'm looking for things that I
like as well as things that I think that
you guys would like to wearing this
ripped comfy t-shirt my redone denim
some suede booties my clear bag little
tip that I have is whenever you are out
shopping a be comfortable but be always
wears some jeans that are gonna be like
one of your staples throughout spring so
I'm always wearing this style like a
high waist mom or straight-leg Jean and
then I always wear some sort of bootie
so that's why I'm wearing this when I'm
trying on clothes I can really get an
idea of what things are gonna look like
so if I have is to always bring your own
bags I'm bringing two of my reusable
grocery bags just so I don't waste
shopping bags I'm gonna get my stuff
together and let's go Emily
like shopping downtown in like Soho in
East Village but it's a little too far
for me today I have some other stuff to
do today so I'm just gonna head over to
sit back because it's really close and
hit up some of the high street fashion
stores I always like to grab a coffee
first and I'm trying to make myself
coffee this morning so
I'm gonna grab some coffee at Starbucks
and then get going first I'm gonna stop
at forever 21 because it's on my way and
it's really early still and they're the
only ones open right now and I like to
buy my lounge clothes from there like my
comfy sweat pants and sweatshirts
I'll definitely pop in there and kill
some time to see what they have it's so
dead this early in the morning no this
is kind of basic but it's just like a
cute little
and gray stripe t-shirt mini-vacations
that like okay with this be for like a
beach vacation these are just some lycra
wide-leg pants it's like brothers
colored and I have this little bra top
that would be super cute with these for
just like super comfy look
all right I love these pants
they're like this olive green high-waist
super cute so got back with like flats
or girlfriends
and then they're also goodness like
booties
oh it's like textured and it's really
cute I love all the glue but he died
all right I just stopped it Sephora grab
some things that I needed some things I
didn't need I'll show you when I get
home but now we're gonna head over to
Zara they looked online it's our last
night and I didn't really find anything
I love so this might be quick quick pit
stop
it's like a cute little top with like
jeans or shorts the lats are cured
they've got like white stitching this
toughest care is just a little too
fluttery for me like bottoms are cute
this is an accident wait I really didn't
find one thing that's it meet you
depressing actually ended up finding a
tank top and on the way out so that's
good news I'll show you guys when I get
home oh my god oh my god
urban outfitters right now I feel like
they have cute like little sweaters and
sunglasses and skin and hair care
products that I've never heard them so
go in there here's urban lots of
scaffolding going on right now some
construction
I didn't really venture out and my color
story here but like how cute are these
top number one
corrupt flowy thing but I think I'm
gonna try to tie it see what happens
much better I love this all right these
are cute but the length is just like a
little weird it's like not short enough
but not long now I'm heading into Lord
and Taylor it's this giant building
right yeah
okay one of the things I love about Lord
and Taylor is that everything is always
marked down like crazy so I've got a few
free people things a dress for rehearsal
dinner and I thought this was cute so
let's try this on this Free People
sweater is pretty cute it's a lot of
fabric in the arms but I kind of like it
with maybe some shorts for spring we're
kind of into it
okay I love the print on this French
Connection dress bread what's going on
the sleeves it cares this one and then
this one but I love a good like
different sleeve dress but this is a
little strange why can't they both look
like this
all right guys I'm gonna hold food
grab a couple of things and then I'm
gonna head home I'm so sorry that I
didn't really find anything today
just kind of like a hit-or-miss thing
today it was kind of a Miss but I did
get a couple of things I'm excited to
show you my skincare products from
Sephora huh some are just replacements
of things that I ran out of and some are
new that I'm gonna try sitting down now
to show you guys what I got
yesterday I totally meant to go to and
other stories and a ritzy others are two
of my favorite stores but I ran out of
time I didn't get to get quite that far
but I would like to know if you guys
like this type of video of me taking you
shopping and then showing you what I got
because next time maybe I can shoot one
of these in a couple of weeks and we can
start with those two stores had the
worst luck yesterday I felt so bad
because Here I am taking a guy shopping
and I really didn't find much I'm really
trying to condense what I'm buying and
only buy things that I absolutely loves
or day just wasn't my day but you know
we all have those days but I'll still go
ahead and show you what I bought we did
end up going to Topshop on my way home
my camera battery was literally on the
verge of dying so I didn't film in there
but I will show you what I got I only
tried on these two things and I ended up
getting these two things so the first
thing I got is this little leopard dress
it's really cute I definitely plan on
layering some sort of something
underneath it I just think this is a
really great print so many different
leopard colour combinations out there
and I really love this wasn't like a
mostly brown with a little bit of black
in it okay next I got and I never do
this but I got this skirt and it is
severely damaged like I'm just gonna
show you split all the way almost to the
bottom this whole thing is split but I
fell in love with the skirt there was
not another one in the city it was sold
out online in my size and they said they
were not restocking so they gave me a
70% off of this skirt and I was like
okay I can get this tailored I'm
actually going to the tailor right after
I film this video to get this fixed so
I'll give you an update on that but it
seems like a pretty easy fix next I'll
show you forever 21 which is so weird
because I just went in there to get some
sweatpants and I had the most luck there
which never happens but I'll show you
what
I got this cute little nude patent bag I
love little micro bags and I thought
this was just perfect for spring and it
also has a long strap as well and it's a
great color I think it'll go with a lot
of a lot of things cuz it's so neutral I
grabbed this top and I just liked it
because I thought it was kind of boho
looking and I got it to wear with just
like jeans when I'm working at home I
just think this is a cute top to kind of
work from home in but two bras which
obviously I didn't show you in the
fitting room and they're kind of sheared
so I got this one it's got these cute
ruffle II sleeves and it's just black
lace and it fits nice it's really snug
and it feels super secure cool cut it's
an off-the-shoulder
bra which is nice because I do have a
lot of off-the-shoulder items like
there's no way this is gonna stay off
the shoulder so I even did like arm
raises and like I Here I am in the
fitting room leg flailing
but the olive green pants that I tried
on I just loved these
I thought they fit so cool I might get
them taken in a little bit in the ankle
so they're not as like wide in the ankle
I might get only like tailored a little
bit I actually might take them today
mm grabbed these if you remember these
they're these like super comfy just
culottes great for lounging around the
house I love the color I love like the
tie-dye I like the pink in it so I
grabbed these as well know if you
remember the set that I tried on but I
actually ended up just getting the
shorts and because the top was like a
little too I don't know they're just
like a lot of ties going on and I feel
like that's a that's an outfit for like
an occasion like a festival or something
I wouldn't just like wear that out can
you see me like at the grocery store and
that outfit okay I just love them I
think there's such cool colors you can
do a denim shirt you can do a little
white tank and some sneakers I just
thought they were fun ended up getting
two things at urban and you didn't see
either one of them I've got the way
memory mist right on before you style
your hair and it's memory mist but it's
also heat protection which is really
cool and just like all of their other
products smells
mm I've been looking for a graphic team
with red in it so I found this and loved
it because it's long it's really soft
and I know it's gonna wear really nicely
Levi's always makes a great tease so I'm
gonna definitely wear this a lot and you
remember my terrible Zara trip
that poor girl at the fitting room I
took so many things in and didn't buy
one thing and I told her I was like I'm
so sorry and I hope you put these back
she was like no no it's fine
wait out I ended up grabbing this tank
top because how perfect is this color
grab this for the color it came in other
colors but I really just needed this and
it's really nice material it's pretty
soft this hat for summer I have been
looking for a hat a straw hat this color
with a black band that's not a floppy
hat that's just kind of a little bit
more structured so when I found this I
was like yay next we will do Sephora up
we have the sundae Riley sulfur acne
treatment mask I love Sunday Riley I
have three or four products of theirs
and none of them disappoint me their
acne stuff is so great I don't have acne
I don't suffer from acne but I do get
breakouts like with no rhyme or reason
just on the most random spots on my face
so I'm gonna plan on using this once or
twice a week mixed with their UFO oils
I've got the herbivore pink cloud or
rose water moisture cream his stuff was
advertised as like the perfect dewy
moisturizer for pre makeup so I was
really excited and I put it on my hand
and it was awesome it just felt like
silk and let it sit while I was walking
around Sephora and it was really like a
dewy silky feeling without being oily or
greasy so I was like that's perfect I
just ran out of my tart there h2o
like gel cream I'm so I've been looking
for a replacement for that I wanted to
try something new before her before I
put my makeup on so I thought this would
be perfect for that I will keep you guys
updated on that
you know in case you were wondering what
this Sunday Riley looks like it is this
you go look for it on the shelf this is
what it looks like I got some vitamin C
serum and I did use the drunk elephant
but I ran out of that and of course I
wanted to try something new and see what
the ladies at Sephora recommended and
she said that this is like their Holy
Grail vitamin C serum my old Henriksen
and it is their truth serum and she said
it's like the best C serum out there so
I didn't want to buy a big one because
it's kind of expensive so they actually
had the travel size so I'm gonna try
this for a about a week drunk elephant
one is amazing so if this beats the
drunk elephant one I'm gonna be really
impressed
it's got my Tarte Amazonian clay brow
pencil in the color and medium brown I
ran out of this so immediately had to
make a mad dash actually went into
support for this
I got me bye bye breakout it cosmetics
full coverage treatment concealer
because I actually don't have concealer
I have concealer that I put under my
eyes as a highlighter but it's like
obviously four shades lighter than my
skin so I got this stuff to actually
cover up any breakouts that I might be
having that matches my skin tone views
were awesome on this so I went ahead and
grabbed it and I used their CC cream and
it's like my favorite thing in the world
so I know that this is gonna be open to
candy then I got okay I don't know about
these but I wouldn't got them anyways
because I was chatting with a girl at
Sephora about them for a while they are
the cover FX custom cover drops and you
basically put drops of this in your
foundation to make it more like full
coverage or if you need to create like
your custom color you can do that as
well which is awesome because I always
buy my foundations in two colors so I
can mix them depending on if I have
faced a neuron or not this in two color
my lighter color my lightest color in my
darkest color and that is what we got
yesterday such a random mix of things
next time if you guys like this style of
video I will go to those other two
stores first because I always
really good things there but just let me
know if you like this and we'll keep
doing it try to make it a once a month
type thing forget to sign up for the
life I heard lookbook oh my gosh I can't
believe I'm saying this but Mays
magazine is coming out in like a week or
so which is insane so definitely go sign
up for that we're getting so far into
spring everything is spring and fun and
girly but also edgy because you guys
know me and there's always gonna be like
leather jackets mixed in with everything
but I'll put the link here and you can
get it down below as well all black
everything sweatshirt is going to be
available to you guys on Sunday it is
going live for you to purchase so my
life my hair girls already got their
presale and I think almost everyone is a
grabbed one so size sizes are gonna be
limited so go ahead and grab one while
