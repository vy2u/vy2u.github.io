good morning it is Wednesday and it is
so rainy I'm going to start the vlog and
I don't think of what I'm gonna say
before I turn the camera on mmm you guys
saw last week's vlog you will know that
we are moving and as of today we are
moving in less than a week so we are
heading out today to do a little
furniture shopping we have a couple of
extra rooms to furnish like an office an
extra bedroom
you guys remember over Christmas I
partnered up with Express and got the
love of my life bomber jacket that I
wore and you guys loved it - my favorite
bomber so I am collaborating with them
again and I picked a couple of things
from their site and I want to show you
guys what I got I'm gonna wear it out
today first we got these awesome camo
joggers I love camo so much but it can
be a little seasonal it can be a little
fall but this is like a linen material
so it's perfect for spring a good spring
camo but this denim jacket I love
contrasting sleeves on denim jackets and
I just thought that this metal eyelet
detail was so cool of course I grabbed
one of their 111 t-shirts because they
are the softest thing I've ever put on
my body time to decide what I'm gonna
wear today I'm gonna wear the t-shirt
for sure but I'm trying to decide
between which one of these pieces I'm
gonna wear see it's super gloomy and
rainy and gross leaning more towards
these because whenever your eyes know in
this material gets wet it looks like
dirty cuz it's just like wet splotches
all over and I'm gonna try it on for you
we're gonna pick out which outfit we're
gonna wear then we'll get ready it puts
the makeup on I like to pick out what
I'm gonna wear first because I hate
putting on my makeup and then trying on
outfits because I end up getting makeup
all over everything again thank you to
express for partnering up with me for
this outfit today I love shopping with
Express because they have a petite
section which is awesome because I like
my jackets a little bit more fitted
express was so nice enough to give you
guys 15% off of your next purchase in
store or online so use the code 3 8 1 4
5 31 18 and thank you to Express for
sponsoring this part of the video and
giving you guys a really awesome
discount for your next purchase ok so
now that I've got the direction I want
my outfit to go we are gonna do a little
makeup to moisturize my eyes I'm using
the cuddly soothing eye serum they dry
skin around my eyes and I know I've told
you guys this a thousand times but
getting my makeup done once for a
campaign and the makeup artist was using
the stuff and she said she swears by it
that it's the best eye cream she's ever
used for dry eyes my moisturiser for my
face I'm using the herbivore pink cloud
rose water moisture cream and I got this
up for the other day I showed you guys
and I'll let you know how I liked it and
I really like it it's a great pretty
makeup moisturizer it really gives you
that do we but not greasy look and feel
it feels nice alright so I'm not gonna
put on a heavy foundations because I'm
gonna be out running errands so I'm
using the it cosmetics your skin but
better CC cream this is prot like I
almost favor this over my foundation
a little under I I'm doing my Becca an
ultimate coverage concealer this is a
little heavy actually I don't think I'm
gonna use that
I'm gonna use my milk it's a little bit
lighter the back guys like pure tar but
it's great for if you need a full
coverage under eye concealer and you're
gonna be like out for a long time it's
like not going anywhere let my term a
blend loose setting powder so it doesn't
crease
my lipstick I'm probably just gonna do
something nude gochu is my Milani color
0-3 I think it's called nude I knew it
was like a little bit of color to it I
really liked it
see it's just like a light new color and
then I'll just fill it in a little it's
called nude embrace who makes this is
one of my old ones
Maybelline thought this thing from
Amazon by the way look at this it's so
cool umm I got it for the new apartment
cuz I think I'm gonna have some room for
it so I'm really excited to use it but
it just like holds all my makeup it's
awesome and it's got a lid a case you
want to close the top but I have like
all this stuff here so I'm not closing
it but it's good to have an option it
was like 60 bucks on Amazon and I'm so
happy with it I love it I thought I had
way more makeup than this so I got only
the I think it's like a 5 drawer for
drawer but then five including this but
it like isn't even halfway filled out
that I don't know I was like I have so
much makeup I need five drawers really I
could have done with like two drawers
but it's gonna start out with like a low
ponytail and keep the ponytail pretty
tight and then I'm just gonna twist it
like that loop it around now that
ponytail this is the outfit we decided
to go with I've got the 111 t-shirt on
the linen camo pants my black booties
and my duster a duster blazer so that's
what we're doing super rainy and gloomy
outside but it's not super super cold so
we're just gonna do a little light
layering but my key piece is obviously
my camo joggers you ready
