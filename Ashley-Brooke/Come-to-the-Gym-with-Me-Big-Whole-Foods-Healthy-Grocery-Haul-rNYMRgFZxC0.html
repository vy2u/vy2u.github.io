then to the gym in a few days because
I've been super busy but we are going
party been pretty productive today I got
a couple of things
films edited Rocking I cannot wait to
the gym today because I got a really
cool package from fabletics last night
but I really tried to wait and unbox for
you guys this morning but it wasn't
happening and this such a sucker for
cute workout clothes though it has open
it but I'll show you guys what I got
really quickly to this matching set
which is so adorable bra top super cute
prints matching pants and these pants
are high waisted you know I love my
high-waisted workout pants so I love
this then they sent me just like a good
basic pair of workout capris I ever
shoot a video without a siren blasting
in the back room not see-through which
is very important on this little bra
let's look at the back how cool is that
and my favorite part about this outfit
is this bomber now we wear this with
jeans and like a white tee and some
sneakers then I got this top and I'm
actually wearing the outfit that it goes
with right now here is this outfit and
it's the white with black print bra lips
little bra top and then be kind of like
the opposites and I love that when
something's matching but opposite colors
with the same print they sent me this
really cool jacket but it's super thick
super comfortable and I like how its
kind of tailored so you know gives you
like a waist
this is my outfit but I'm going to go to
the gym and today I think we're going to
do a little time I do an ab sir but I do
it'll oh okay we're doing at all you're
ready to go
I do a group play guys ball fabletics
really quick while I'm waiting on Ryan
and now if you sign up for their
flexible VIP programs you get two of
their best-selling leggings for $24 I'm
a huge legging person like I could wear
the same top for every workout but I
need a good printed legging or the basic
leggings they are super thick and not
see-through like I would feel
comfortable doing squats in them and not
worrying about flashing everybody in the
gym which I have done before is quite
embarrassing with the VIP membership you
get up to a 50 person off free returns
free shipping it's not like a membership
where they take money out of your
account every month you can opt to skip
a month or shop a month so it's really
really flexible kind of with your
finances and your lifestyles I think
that's really cool and starting in
January they actually launched where you
get free workout classes with online
trainers so if you you know are your
finance and someone allow you to have a
gym membership or you know you're more
of a stay-at-home person that's a really
great option for you as well so yeah I
guess really ready um yes it really
quick just wanted to say thank you to
fabletics for sending me this package
you guys no one loves us with Q workout
clothes and this is so mean like
black-and-white print so yeah thank you
