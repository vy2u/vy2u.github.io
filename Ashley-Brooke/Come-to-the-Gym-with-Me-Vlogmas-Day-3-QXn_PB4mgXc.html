style today woke up this morning and it
was 38 degrees so we were like okay
let's just hold out for a few hours and
see if it dies down a little bit so I'm
just gonna get ready put my makeup on
try to turn something around and vlogmas
you're gonna see a lot of this because
this is me but my hair air-dry last
night and this is what we're working
with so I have to do like a full on
transition before I get started
let's put that under my eyes that would
have been disaster you see the confusion
that would be terrible
see there so much stuff now wow this is
why a Beautyblender is so important
it's just
always and my hair now we are going to
pick out some outfits I've got like a
lip treatment on because my lips were so
chapped I think it's because it's all of
a sudden like so cold outside so
nothing's like less cute and like mega
jobless hi hello come say hi take your
shoes off going to the gym later for
sure how was your workout that's good
have you been outside yet no that's
frigid I think it's Bridget
like how frigid me a number 41 degrees
frigid mmm I think I'm styling leather
like faux leather leggings pants so
those are pretty warm at least okay be
bundled yeah we usually try to find cool
places in the city to shoot but I don't
know if we're gonna be able to do that
today with it being so cold we might
just be shooting like the wind is pretty
strong today too
Sam really absolutely good it looks bad
on 42nd but not all of it you know how
those gust of winds sometimes come out
of nowhere though I'll just have to go
into the city there's eight something
are you hungry
hmm kind of not really I better I should
eat though
thanks you're making eggs eggs all day
eggs all day
oatmeal sounds good to me so I'm styling
these faux leather leggings they are so
tight on my way it's a good thing about
these is that they're really warm so um
I should be good today I should be
pretty warm wolfy
oh babe here you are right we are
getting ready to go shoot got half an
outfit on right now all black go figure
doing the lookbook a little different
today you'll see when it goes live I'm
going to do the lookbook portion first
and then I'm going to do the explaining
of the outfit because
I feel that you get more of a sense what
I'm talking about once you've already
seen the outfit so that is what I'm
doing you need to put lipstick on I
don't feel like it's so easy to drag up
leather leggings like you just throw on
a blouse and some boots or heels so I
want to do something a little different
so I'm going to do more of like how to
dress them down versus dress them up
shoot I need to get vlogmas posted hello
finish editing it this morning and I
messed up nicholae once you mess up no
going back
alright I'm gonna make it go live okay
weather is looking a little better it's
up to 43 so we're gonna go give this a
try
hope I don't freeze my buns off I've got
just like giant toad on right now so

through yesterday's vlogmas for spying -
a bunch of comments and you guys are so
sweet I honestly was so hesitant to post
yes yesterday's vlogmas because I was
like this is so boring all I did was
stay home and clean and I don't want to
bore you guys or waste your time but
your comments have been so nice for
those of you um you know saying super
nice things about me about your giving
me compliments of how I look without
makeup on and saying that you wish you
could look like that but just know that
you do like you absolutely do look so
beautiful without makeup
everyone does because it's your natural
state and trust me I was terrified the
first time I posted my YouTube video
without makeup on oh my god I was
terrified I almost deleted it right
after I posted it so you know your
comments are so sweet
everyone I think has a little bit of
insecurities when they don't have makeup
on and they're posting it for the whole
internet to see it's kind of a scary
thing yeah it makes me sad to hear you
say you know you wish you look like me
without makeup or you're scary without
makeup because you're not I promise
