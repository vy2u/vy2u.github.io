where I said I was going to go run but
then I actually went to forever 21 but I
just blew my cover because where I'm
sitting right behind me yes so but I'll
just keep these clothes on until I go to
the gym tonight so then it all works out
this shirt is from Target it's got like
a little cutout in the back bra is from
forever 21 these are also from forever
21 their workout gear game is strong
because I don't have anything to film
today I'm just gonna do like a no makeup
let my skin breathe don't you love those
days where you don't wear any makeup
your skin just gets to breathe I'm going
to whiten my teeth and I'm going to put
a face mask on and probably coconut oil
mask because it just put hair color on
my hair we have a lot to do today um
workwise I have like 3 videos to edit
and 1 to plan out so in a couple of
calls I'm not going to be vlogging a
whole lot but we are going to answer
some questions tonight that we've been
getting in the comments guess what
not you you already know my Black Friday
approaches came one Black Friday
purchase Oh Cyber Monday
wait Cyberman you need to open the box
take a look one cyber monday purchase
because I forgot about cyber monday
because I was working on the life by her
look book so let's open it I'm so
excited it's not that exciting but it is
more excited about that than anything
else can we just take a moment to see
Ryan
sitting on the couch next to his one
true love
I'm so excited
are you ready tada
so I just open my stirrup see here's the
thing I love my Kohana coffee but I like
this syrup so now I get to have both
things that I love in one amazing cup so
mad at myself because I just realized
Ryan was like wait why didn't you get
sugar-free vanilla because I like
regular vanilla so I just went on to
order him a sugar-free vanilla and I
just realized that I didn't get any
specials on Cyber Monday that it wasn't
a part of the specials so no cyber
monday deal on either one of these even
though I thought I was getting such a
good deal then I go to order Ryan a
sugar-free vanilla one and now they're
on a special $9 each now instead of 12
the link is below for those of you guys
who like um their syrup Starbucks tarts
I got coffee nut obviously um for my
iced coffees and I got vanilla for my
iced coffees and for my like lattes and
stuff ooh now I get to get a latte

tell you something would you like to

um everything about my business peaceful
experience in that department and I am
not so I am so grateful and I just
wanted to tell you that well I

help in any way that I can but it's
always up to the person to do the work

and I've been very very proud of her for
that
can we just not make this about me right
now nice jacket hey crazy amount of work
to make this all come together and it's
it's really impressive honestly thank
you thing that's hard to see from the
outside is how much work actually goes
into everything that she's doing and
it's a lot I just wanted to say that you
you're amazing and yes Ryan does some
people are asking if we did this
together if Ryan had like a job because
he's you know we're together all the
time cuz we worked together a lot but he
does he owns his own business he um has
a digital marketing agency that he's
started eight years ago in his parents
house when we met he was still living

because I am so excited okay
no dinner
dinner is almost ready I started out by
making this black bean salsa and all it
is is black beans corn red pepper
cucumber avocado cilantro salt pepper
and some lime juice
how do people put diced tomatoes but I
don't like raw tomatoes so I put red
pepper instead so the salads that
they're going to go in this is mine
mine has romaine lettuce kale cold
broccoli boiled egg and some what kind
of cheese is this pepper jack Ryan's is
the same thing - the kale and then he's
adding um meatball he's still on
evolving your thing meatballs meatballs
so you still want me a ball to be going
on I your meatballs aren't burned out
all backwards I move forward okay I'm
going running a meatball world right I
not burned at all you know what if I was
hungry for meatballs these would be my
dream meatballs
I loved anything that's burned your
dream balls my dream balls all right
hand me the dream bowl that's you know
to the dream balls
as for dressing I will probably just do
a little bit of lemon juice and a little
bit of olive oil and that's it I'm Lea
in the mood for our like me because I'm
still kind of full from my dill chip
ginge ate the whole entire thing I said
I wasn't really that hungry we've been
getting some questions on the vlog
really hard to answer because I usually
try to answer all of the comments and
respond to all of them but during
blackness it's been a little difficult
to get on and respond did we talk about
what you did oh yeah so we talked about
a lot of people are wanting to know what
Ryan does for a living but we talked
about that earlier in the vlog I think
yeah she Ray Murray always comments on
my videos I love her oh yeah she wants
to know how I learned to edit videos and
is there anything that I recommend to
learn we downloaded Final Cut Pro there
are neighbors like what are they doing
cuz he's right there
oh yeah the ruse what's he doing oh my
god you saying eye contact yes she did
say eye contact
what if him and his girlfriend
subscribers hey it's Final Cut Pro and
it's pretty self-explanatory like the
basic now if there's something that I
want to do that I don't know how I just
YouTube it and it's pretty easy because
once you learn how to do something it's
pretty much second nature once you do it
a few times
um it looks intimidating when you first
open it but it's really not everybody
horrible my water bottle is from
Nordstrom Rack and it's actually linked
in another video but I will link it
again for this video oh the gray bomber
that I wear to the gym is from Zara I
got it a few months ago so I doubt that
they have it but I'll try to find it so
would you guys remember my best friend
Taylor who came and stayed with us um
want to go with that like a month ago
she is coming back to New York I'm so
excited
she's coming at the end of this month so
you'll get to see her in vlogmas
Taylor's the sweetest
yeah we love Taylor so much so I'm gonna
go do my cope re coconut I do not like
walking this close to the TV I feel like
it's very unsafe I'm gonna do my coop re
coconut oil hair mask and I actually
think I'm gonna sleep on it and then
wash it up tomorrow sweetie will you do
a face mask face mask yeah that's not
for boys I know but I feel like there
are quite a few things you do that are
not specifically for boys that's fair
it's a fair statement the question is
should I do my hydrating masks for my
clay mask all right
not my mask on guess who I talked into
getting a mask sometime just gotta go
with my ass man sometimes you just gotta
get hydrated hydration is key you should
never be ashamed of your hydrated skin
absolutely no I'll show you guys what I
put on and then what I put on Ryan so
this is the one Ryan has on it is the
hydration mask and his skin gets a
little dry during the winter so he is
using this one I am using the skin
detoxifying clay mask because I've been
out and about in the city for the past
couple of days and like I don't know
many people like smoke here and I don't
know I just feel like my skin gets
clogged up so I am detoxing it detox
detox mine's like I can feel you and you
can just feel something working and it's
like I am a diet root beer and hallo top
now that your skin's hydrated who do you
think you are there's obvious hydration
and all three of these items do you need
me to educate you
and on what hour of hydration of ice
creams that are little okay that's
enough bad dog
I let my mask sit for 20 minutes and
it's feeling really tight so I'm gonna
rinse it off and see what happens are
you gonna run through this queue yeah I
just can't leave it on all night oh it
go so let's think in your skin lipid
bond forever give it a little with the
pillowcases oh I just what I just washed
my mask off and then I put my raw serum
and then I put my skin oils on top of it
so um my skin feels really really nice
it's pretty oily because I just put all
my oil lon but it feels nice how was
your mask it's fabulous do you feel
hydrated most hydrated not as hydrating
as halo top and root beer
hydrating nonetheless yeah feels nice
alright we are gonna go watch Westworld

a lot so we're gonna go get a bed until
tomorrow
