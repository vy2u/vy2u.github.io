you know I love a good full eye shadow
as long as it's kind of subtle and
neutral colors I feel that Browns and
neutrals and you know colors like that
suit me a little bit better so I am
going to show you guys my go to fall
eyes shadow look today in this eye
shadow look I'm creating something so
simple you guys like this just involves
three colors maybe two or three
different brushes that I have so this is
just something that's a good every day
kind of like your school routine your
work routine and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel I will put a
link right here that you can just click
on to subscribe in today's tutorial I'm
going to be using my morphe eyeshadow
palette in the color 35 and I would open
it and show you guys but I don't know if
you saw my last video where I opened up
my eyeshadow palette and they all fell
on the ground I am using my naked so I
learned my lesson I am no longer doing
that so you just get to see the cover or
now with my little smudgy little
fingerprints all over it as you can see
I'm not wearing any eye makeup right now
so I'm just gonna get straight into the
video let's go so I'm gonna start by
using my primer I'm using eliminate by
benefit
I used a primer just so nothing goes
into my creases trust me it makes a huge
difference if you plan on having your
eyeshadow on all day long
next I'm just going to grab an eyeshadow
that is kind of like flesh tone so
actually no color you want to put this
base on so your skin tone is the same
and your skin texture is the same gonna
use the same brush and try to use as
little tools as possible because you
know I know makeup brushes are expensive
and not all of us have you know eight
different eyeshadow brushes that are
just readily available to us so I'm
gonna try to use as little brushes as
possible
so next I'm just going to use this color
right here it's kind of like a natural I
would see like a burnt orange color
Beks I'm going to take this guy right
here just kind of like a little mudroom
brush I'm gonna take if it's color right
here which is a little bit darker than
my first color now after I did that I
just kind of like to go and blend
everything in together so I'm just gonna
take this same brush that I used the
first two times and just kind of blend
it in so then I'm gonna take one color
darker this color right here and I'm
gonna do a little bit less of a spot
right over the darker color that I just
put on then I'm going to take my naked 2
palette
and I'm going to use this color right
here called teeth I'm going to go over
my eyelid I'm also gonna go up under my
brow
I'm gonna take the other end of this
brush right here and I'm going to dip it
into the darker the darkest color one
more time and kind of create an eyeliner
effect now to do a little bit of cleanup
I am going to take my cover FX palette
and I'm going to use color number one to
kind of clean up under my eye so I'm
going to take this little guy dip it in
so now I'm just gonna finish off the
look by adding my mascara
so that is all I have for you today I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial you know
like I said it is a easy kind of no fuss
fall makeup fall I shot a look which is
kind of my go-to when I am wanting
something a little bit more dramatic in
the daytime so I really hope that this

amazing so if you're looking for kind of
