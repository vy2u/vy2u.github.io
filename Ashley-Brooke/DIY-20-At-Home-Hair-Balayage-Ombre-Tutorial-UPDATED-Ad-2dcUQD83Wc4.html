channel today I'm doing a DIY and
foliage technique and I posted one
before but this is more of an updated
version a little bit quicker a little
bit better so updating is always good
the color I'm going to be using today is
the L'Oreal wild ombre color kit I am
using the color zero six zero for medium
to dark brown hair so the reason I like
to do this myself sometimes is because I
have to come up I have trips come up
meetings come up and if my stylist can't
get me in in time if I can't get an
appointment in time then I like to pick
up one of these and just do a few little
touch-ups myself to kind of brighten up
areas that I think are a little too dark
I also just want to say thank you it's
so much to L'Oreal for partnering with
me this is one of my favorite hair color
boxes so I'm really excited that I'm
able to partner up with them and show
you guys my techniques so look I'm
trying to achieve today is just a little
touch-up kind of around my space right
here where it's pretty dark and a little
bit underneath here and underneath here
definitely feel free to do with your
whole head just a few pieces around your
face the good thing about doing this
yourself sometimes is that you can
control where the pieces go and do it
exactly how you would like it that means
that I'm going to set up my color and go
ahead and get started quick tip put on a
sweatshirt that you don't mind getting
haircolor on cleaning a piece or careful
or sweatshirt with all got one to put it
on right now
I'm going to start by clipping my hair
up depending on where you want these
highlights and you know the placement
that you want them feel free to click
your hair wherever you like alright so
I'm going to show you guys the technique
that I'm using I will walk you through
with the first piece so that you know
how to follow along for the next pieces
so depending on how big you want your
pieces you want to grab however much you
think you need I am just going to do
what this little guy right here I do
like to grab bigger pieces and smaller
pieces just I kind of mix things up I
think it makes it look a little bit more
natural so first I'm going to dip my
finger in the color like that I'm going
to soak the end completely with the
color and then I'm going to lightly
brush up
just plagues up this brushing right here
is what gives you that faded love to
wear it start start and then say Vince
Wyatt I always like to keep a towel
right here when I'm done with this
finger I wipe it and then grab another
piece again I'm going to do the same
thing soak the end and then lightly
I'm going to let this sit for about 25
minutes 25 minutes is up and you still
think you need a little bit longer we
apply the color to the Strand got you
thinking more color and let it sit for
five more minutes and you should begin
alright so here are the results of my
hair and I said I really just wanted to
brighten things up underneath here as
you can see we got some nice color going
on the end right here a nice blonde then
I said I wanted to brighten up around my
face on the top I really like how this
color did not turn out brassy or orange
or yellow it turned out to be your
really pretty soft blond color that is
it for this video I will see you guys
next time I ha try'n of a laser and he
points it at me
and clear dude okay shootin laser at me
like all the comments so annoying okay
