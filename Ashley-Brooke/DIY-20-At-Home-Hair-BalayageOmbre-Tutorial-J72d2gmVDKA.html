today I am shooting a video over me on
bring my own hair I actually win Willy
call it on bring I think I'm just gonna
do like a very light balayage when I
think of ombre I think of your full hair
starting at one color and lightening up
and when I think of balayage I think of
just like more like a natural look to
where you just kind of have little
wispies of wispies yeah you know what I
mean like little wispies of hair color
throughout your hair I just kind of do
it myself whenever I need just a little
bit of color like right now I just kind
of feel like underneath this very dark
and I just want to lighten up a few
pieces myself okay so just a couple of
things before we get started really
quick before you commit to a hair color
do a test strand just to make sure that
it's the color because our hair takes
differently to different colors and
different brands even so make sure
you're doing even just like find a piece
of hair underneath and do a little test
strip to see what it's going to turn out
I am using Clairol's
frost and tip it is a very blond color
but that is because my hair does not
take very well to color I've even tried
using like the blondest blondes and my
hair it just doesn't take it for some
reason I don't know and definitely wear
an old t-shirt because oh my god that's
like really see-through sorry your
Tapley gonna get hair color on you um
put a towel over your shoulders but um
definitely wear an old t-shirt and don't
be around any of your nice things
now that I'm getting towards the top of
my hair I'll go ahead and explain what
I'm doing so I'm basically just grabbing
small strands not big strands so I mean
like very very small strands of hair
take your color with your glove on I'm
obviously not wearing a glove and you're
just going to kind of coat it on to the
end just like that and then towards the
middle of your hair where you want your
fading to start you barely barely clamp
your hands over your hair and just
quickly kind of go over it you can
already see because the hair color is
white kind of what it's going to look
like
so nobody made my finishing stages this
is kind of what it looks like as you can
see it just got random pieces that have
just little strands of color on it I
said before you're just going to get a
small strand of hair on zoom in so you
can see get your hair color soak the end
of the hair
and barely clamp your fingers together
and kind of do this motion to where
you're just kind of massaging it up to
the top I like to kind of spread it out
and do just maybe the ends on this next
one so don't go as far up as you did on
the one before that way some of them
look a little bit more grown out than
the others Oh
so whenever you're done I'm applying the
color that you want you're just going to
want to go through maybe and find any
strands that need a little bit more or
that don't look right that you need to
fix after that you're just going to want
to maybe grab your blow-dryer and put
some heat on it because that kind of
helps it develop a little bit faster if
you're already starting to reach the
color that you want
don't put heat on it just wait maybe
five or ten more minutes and then rent
it out
two square knot I should've been
you
stop all right so it is time for me to
wrap up this video and I hope you like
my new hair um I like it I feel back to
myself again um I left it on a little
bit longer than I wanted to only because
I was talking to you guys and just ended
up rambling and leaving it on so um I
wouldn't want to go maybe this blonde um
I don't know okay I'm so exciting one
quick tip that I have for you is to use
the conditioner that the color comes
with it is a correcting a color
correcting conditioner and it tones out
any brassiness that you might have um it
I find that also makes your color last
longer because you know boxed color can
sometimes not last as long as if you go
to a salon if you liked this video which
I assume you did or you wouldn't watch
it this far go ahead and give it a
thumbs up because that's how I know you
like it and makes you want to keep
making them and I'm thinking about least
three people right now that I know would
want to see this video after having
major hair disasters so go share it with
them and let them know the greatness of
doing your own hair and that it can be
done and I'll see you next time honey
you know this is my new hair
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
