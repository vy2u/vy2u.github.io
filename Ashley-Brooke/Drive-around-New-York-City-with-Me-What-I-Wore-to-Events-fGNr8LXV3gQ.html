before this blog gets started I just
want to give a huge thank you to Jaguar
I've partnered up with them for this
video to drive around the X e for the
week and so excited because it is
summertime here in the city it is hot
there's so much going on so it's going
to be so nice to have a car to drive
around in um I'm going to go finish
getting ready we have a few press
previews to go to today and I can't wait
to take you along with us
alright we're packing up to head outdoor
I'm wearing this striped top from
Topshop strapless with a little tie
these flare like super flare cropped
jeans from Sahara and then my Zara shoes
so we're good oh look how good gentle up
in the skirt yeah why don't we look like
that in the skirt
Oh
starting Saran had it owned apart so
long so I'm trying to get used to this
touchscreen it's really cool there's
like you can control almost everything
in the whole entire car with the
touchscreen got the radio right here and
you can actually connect your phone
through bluetooth which is nice it's
what we always like to do you can
actually tap here to connect your phone
that way you can go hands-free and then
this right here will give you the
weather outside and you can pretty much
control everything down here as well
which is really cool so these are the
side cameras which can come in really
handy especially in New York when you're
driving so close to everything and then
this right here it controls the climate
of your seat how do I turn your speak
either all the way up right now I got
half of Saturday L we are headed down to
Soho we're going to drive the Jaguar to
Soho and we're probably just going to
walk around for a little bit because it
is so nice outside and then we're
probably going to go to dinner I think
we're going to try to find a new spot
correct it's hot in here we just turn
the a/c off and it's hot Bellary Rico
I'm looking at traffic right now out the
window and heading downtown is really
crazy so we decided to up okay this is
the route to get there we're going to go
through Central Park
how many minutes is it going to be
toilet let's do it since up six we have
40 minutes together
we are driving across the city through
Central Park one of my favorite ways to
go skiing and driving through Central
Park is summertime so beautiful all of
the trees are just to die bored so
pretty

movie tickets we're going to go see what
the hell what is the minister at these

buildings in this area I've never been

place downtown a really cool place I
think they've taken you there before but
I can't remember got really cold sores

the coolest partnership I've ever done

one all the time no but you know it was
nice being able because you know we
travel from like event to event to
shooting locations that was so nice to
have a car to be able to get into and
drive around from place to place you
know that she's ly how cars work but
true
you have wheels yeah we also like the
engine sounds good but it's really quiet
when you're driving it's like a quiet
smooth nice ride our street has so many
potholes on it but driving down it it
was so smooth I was like this isn't
saying usually when I'm in a taxi I'm
flying all over the place so it was so
nice and smooth the seats are so
comfortable as we've been sitting here

taking pictures of the car kershel right
