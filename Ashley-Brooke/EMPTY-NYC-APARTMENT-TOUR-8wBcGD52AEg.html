in the new apartment speaking of new
apartment we are getting settled still
we're still building things and putting
things together this is what the office
looks like I know I showed you guys less
blog and it was a complete disaster zone
so it's getting okay it's a little
disaster don't eat that
still a disaster zone but it's a little
less day I have some stuff to do in my
closet area and in my bathroom so I'll
show you the closet first so Ryan and I
each get our own closet that's Ryan's
that is mine and this is my issue here I
need to do something with all this this
thing and I've you guys remember this
from the last closet it does not fit
doors are so high like this is as high
as I can reach I can't even reach up
there but I pretty much got my tops in
right here my dresses are in another
closet and my jackets and I have another
one here and then I just threw my boots
up there to get them out of the way but
I put my jeans and these things here and
I already did this one so I just need to
fill up those well you don't know what
I'm gonna do with my shoes I ordered
this need to fill this up and possibly
order maybe like two more I don't really
know these are my skirts I need to fold
those so we we have a lot to do today
why is this not opening
oh stop moving on to my bathroom there's
like zero storage you know on the old
apartment my mirror opened in my
bathroom this one does not ordered these
drawers and I think I'm gonna put some
gold legs on the bottom and maybe put
some gold knobs instead and I somehow
have to fit like all of this bathroom
stuff kind of just on this thing and
then underneath here so we're gonna do
that too cuz
this is crazy I'm probably gonna go
ahead get started with my closet first
and maybe do some things in Ryan's - I
ordered him a shoe why am i standing
like this damaged shoe a hanging over
the door because I stole his his other
one so like a little better he realizes
it's also in my bedroom that I can't
talk about
so I was wrapping up my jeans put them
exactly where any of them to be and then
I found a pile of jeans in the bogs
but my two denim shorts up here blue
denim and this is like gray black and
white and then some just like fun
printed shorts up there I've got my kick
flare jeans my dark my light denim pants
and trousers here long skirts here and
short skirts here this is a little snug
so if I have room at the end of all of
this I might grab another one of these
shelves and like oh now I'm gonna tackle
the shoe situation and see if I can
figure something I'm definitely gonna
need to order another shoe shelf I was
just kind of ordering that when to see
if it would work before I went hadn't
ordered too
figured it out I Oh
there is really no rhyme or reason as to
the order well actually we've got like
black ankle boots here all of my heels
are here oh it's all like winter's stop
I've got like suede boots here and these
you're like my pants and stuff so I'm
gonna go put these in a different closet
sunglasses socks a bag $20 and sticky
boobs that's a good Instagram handle $20
and some sticky boobs they're like a
good blog name someone take them okay
finally have a clean face the people
before me left this really ugly orange
hook but you can't really see it because
it's in this weird cubby hole but all
right moving on to the bathroom okay
we're gonna ice a little of your closet
for you why is my house shoe on the
windows steel Stella all right I'm gonna
make more coffee and then do did you
make coffee thanks
right this looks so much better I've got
all of our stuff in here
I'm about to put up a little glass shelf
from Ikea that we can kind of put our
straightener curling iron on because
this isn't really enough room and then
they are coming to remove all the blinds
today so so yeah bath tub here this is
the deepest bath tub by the way when I
stand in it it comes to like my
mid-thigh it's crazy deep I'm scared I'm
gonna drown if I take it back that is
what's going on here after after I'm
done I'm probably gonna go through and
like clean up all this cuz all of our
stuff has been sitting here and it's
just kind of left little marks but now
I'm moving on to the bedroom we've got
TV on Stella's kennel right now because
we're waiting for Ryan's dad to get here
because he is the expert mounter this is
just all of our IKEA stuff that we've
been building clean clothes so I'm
probably gonna go through and take care
of all of this right now hey you found
your spot in the Sun you love it are you
gonna lay on the clothes I can't
okay I'm gonna tackle this room for a
little bit I don't think my bags are
gonna fit in my closet but I'm gonna
utilize this closet I buddish show on
the Amazon it's like a wire thing I
don't know it might be a total fail but
we're gonna put together
first I'm gonna clear some of this out
then we'll put that together and see
what we're working with
way more intimidating than it actually
is it's like really easy to put together
so about that and this seems like it
would be super easy to just keep
building on to if you needed more space
hey guys welcome back be i walking in
the street ma'am ma'am sorry so we are
headed to a last-minute movie it really
starts in four minutes and we're a
six-minute walk away
yeah we're gonna get there really wanted
to see adventures like really badly but
I was told out and I actually feels
really bad for you because I know how
bad you wanted to see it but we are
going to see the one I wanted to be
excited I love a good scary movie
and we're going to our favorite movie
theater
I know that's huge
can I get an assignable to go no because
we're gonna be late picking out
apartments for Jenna if she can't live
by
the apartment but at 50 baht and fine
we start at 6:00 now we're here
who's on edge the entire time hold are
about to walk top so many people I'm
putting the camera away like happy hour
like afterward crowd and I legitimately
look like a potato in my stead of
walking film oh so we're gonna walk home
now and then we're gonna grab the Stella
and go for a walk before it ran look at
these clouds it's really dark I think
yeah that's cute
but we do need to show that to Jenna
Stella is very excited

good morning big Mira cleaning problems
very dangerous job have a certificate of
insurance to be able to do that just
like everything else you ever clean it
since it showed up
hello we are about to deal with
something that's been coming for about
two weeks three weeks three weeks
we ordered a mirror that's the size of
double this oh yeah a new camera hello
we ordered a mirror that's the size of
double this so like that over here and
it's gonna take up this whole wall the
only thing is that the elevator we're
not sure if it's gonna fit the elevator
and it's about to be delivered so we're
gonna find out so my friend Adrian
thinks that they can do it in our
service elevator so we're gonna see
then you get a block traffic to is NYPD
right behind this
lovely that's the mirror
I am about to do a Facebook live with my
life by her Facebook group and it's
gonna be fun we usually do this the
Sunday after every magazine goes out but
oh I think I was traveling oh yeah was
that the wedding last week so we're
doing it today we just kind of go over
the magazine well what they liked about
it what they didn't like about it just
random questions announcements on
products and you know at the end we have
like a Q&amp;amp;A where we just kind of chat
and stuff like that so it's really fun
and something that I always look forward
to it's pouring rain today and it's
really dark and the apartment doesn't
get a ton of light when it's really
cloudy so I'm gonna go prep for this I
just need to make a couple of notes so I
stay on topic it's always so easy to get
off topic with these girls because we
just started talking about the funniest
things like I think that one time we
were talking about like our worst
hangovers and like how we're always in
bed super I know it's just we get on
topic like the hour goes up and I'm like
oh we didn't talk about Maddie hey
and then afterwards we're gonna get
ready and we're gonna go over to the old
apartment show you guys that I'm just
solve a bunch of stuff in there so we
just really need to get a u-haul van at
some point and just make the trip my
plants are there because we just didn't
have room for them in the u-haul and
Olivia is just overweight and she's huge

super frizzy we're almost at the old
apartment really close it's like right

I think there's like some furniture I
don't know so this is our hallway and we
are all the way at the end here here's
the bathroom
you've got our giant table in here right
now
but then in here it's just like a double
closet this is what we kept our coats

are actually still in here basically our
coat closet - it is the washer and dryer
where all the laundry went down everyday
everyday then you just turn this corner
here's our bedroom still have all of our
stuff here our two closets view right
