tuning into my eyebrow tutorial I'm
gonna be showing you how to fill in your
eyebrow with a pomade versus a powder I
used to use the NYX eyebrow powder but
now I use the honest dog dia pomade and
I am so in love with it a month ago I
was trimming that I don't even remember
what happened but I took a chunk out of
my eyebrow and as soon as the clip I was
thinking in my head oh my god I just
took off half of my eyebrow so that's
why I switched to the pomade because I
needed something thick to cover this
huge gap that I had in my eyebrow so let
me just give you a little bit of
background when I was in middle school
my eyebrows were one shape this big and
just like one eyebrow straight across
I always asked my mom look what were you
thinking not helping me out with my
eyebrows when I was in middle school
like I didn't know any better I just
thought these two like catapillar like
crazy for things above my eyes and then
when I got into high school it's like I
found a pair of tweezers and I was like
who
and then I just tweet them all off and I
had to like lines just like many thin
lines like right across my face so I I
feel like I'm finally like getting it
right now that I'm in my adult age I
just kind of what I know if it was just
me or if it was like a same back then to
just not have your eyebrows in your
makeup routine because I like literally
I didn't even think about doing them
back in high school I probably should
have looks they were terrible so let me
just go ahead and give you a breakdown
with the products we're gonna be using
they're also going to be linked below if
you want to kind of get more detail
about them so the first thing I'm going
to be using is kind of your basic
grooming tools I'm going to be using a
pair of tweezers I'm also going to be
using a Sally Hansen grooming brush and
Sally Hansen eyebrows scissors which are
very important to my I brought routine
know these are also really good to late
trim your ends oops just got a Carroll
suggesting I'm going to be using is the
Anastasia brow pomade in chocolate this
stuff goes a long long long ways I've
had this for a couple of weeks now and
it's like it looks like it hasn't even
gonna use second thing I'm going to be
using is my Mac 208 eyebrow brush it
doesn't matter what you're putting on
your eyebrows but you want to use a good
brush it's something that you have to
invest in because using of the tool is
so key to having great shaped eyebrows
and what else I'm gonna music I'm gonna
be using the Anastasia Beverly Hills gel
this is kind of just like hairspray for
your eyebrows it's so great makes your
eyebrows also kind of stay in place all
day long they're building like a fifty
six storey building right behind me so
I'm so sorry you can hear it through the
video I hope you can't but
you can so sorry
next I'm just going to connect my arch
to the end of my brow just kind of draw
another straight line down
so now that I've got my whole eyebrow
done basically everything except for the
center part I'm just gonna take my brush
and I'm going to grab a paper towel or
anything and just kind of wipe off any
excess homemade dots on the brush and
then I'm gonna take the brush and just
kind of fill in
I'm just gonna take a simple concealer
and a skinny brush and I'm just gonna
kind of clean up where I lined my brows
so now that that's done I'm grabbing my
Anastasia eyebrow gel and I'm just going
to brush up once again keeping the shape
of my eyebrow
so let's start a chat in the comments
below I either want to know whether you
use pomade or brow powder or please give
me like your worst or story ever of
plucking or trimming your eyebrows I
just like I love beauty horror stories
it's thick but I like I do I love them
so please tell me alright guys that is
the end of this tutorial so I really
hope you enjoy and I love see you guys
next time bye oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
