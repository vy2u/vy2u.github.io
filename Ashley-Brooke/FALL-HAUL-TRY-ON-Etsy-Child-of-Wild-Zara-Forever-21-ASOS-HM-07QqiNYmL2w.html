I'm shooting a haul really love shooting
hauls because then you guys can kind of
get a glimpse of what I'm gonna be
styling and my upcoming videos so it's
so frustrating when I post a video a
style video and the item is already sold
out so this can kind of give you a
glimpse into some things that I'm gonna
be styling that way you know if you
already have it or if it's something
you're like oh my gosh I need that then
you will already kind of be on the
lookout for for the outfit or for the
styling process so welcome to my home
let's go ahead and get started I've got
all these brands these stores brands
right here that I'm gonna be showing you
a lot of you not a lot of you okay like
four of you have messaged me saying that
you want me to venture outside of Zara
and I will totally do that so thank you
for bringing that to my attention
because I do have a lot of Zara and
defends though Zara is right down the
street for me so it is so accessible and
it's like the best are in the whole city
so you got to give a girl a break Love &amp;amp;
Other Stories I love mango it SIA is
also great so yeah I will start
venturing out and trying trying to
incorporate new stores new brands into
my style videos for you first I have one
item from a brand called 20 and I love
these so much they are sweatpant
material culottes but they're also
dressy at the same time which is amazing
no weird like sweatpants tie they've got
this really nice waistband that kind of
holds everything in sweat pant a say
that enough times but also nice see
myself wearing these you know if I want
to dress them up going to a meeting or I
can see these you know on a Sunday
morning just rolling out of bed so
versatile sweat pant culotte dressy
pants I love these so much next I have
one pair of shoes from and other stories
and I love these so much they are these
patent pointy toed loafers and I mean I
am obsessed with these love this love
this love all of it so I usually wear a
36 in and other story shoes but I got a
third
seven because that is all they had and
they fit fine like slip off they don't
fall off when I wear them they actually
fit pretty well maybe go up half a size
if you're gonna order these because you
know if you have patent shoes that are
too tight this will rub you such a mean
blister so be careful when you're
ordering these next is some jewelry that
I have and I will start with this one
not this from Etsy and I just love coin
vintage looking of things and so of
course I love this but it is basically
just like this coin bracelet with a
leather band right here wish this came
in black it doesn't I don't think it
comes in Burgundy which is really nice
for fall but I got the new to kind of go
with more things you guys have been
asking me about my coin choker this one
right here and this is from child of
wild and oh my gosh I love their jewelry
so much I have too many things in my
cart right now it's insane um but I
don't mind spending a little bit of
money on some jewelry I don't mind
investing in really cool pieces because
those are pieces that you'll have
forever that you can pass down to your
children so I just think investing in
jewelry is always an okay thing then I
got a sort of dupe for you guys if
that's a little bit out of your your
price range or your budget right now
this one from forever 21 it's kind of
like a choker built in layering necklace
which I love layered already necklaces
because then you don't have to do the
work it's kind of already done for you
and I was worried about tingling or does
this look right so I thought this was
like a pretty cool piece especially for
forever 21
they sometimes surprise me and have like
really cool jewelry I will move on to
forever 21 I have two things so the
first thing is this plaid Baker boy hat
and I've been wearing the death out of
my black one so I was like alright it is
time to invest in another one can see
this with like just basic white tee
black denim
this just kind of mixture out but it's a
really cool accessory to add next from
forever 21 is this sweater dress oh my
gosh this is probably one of the most
comfortable things that I own and it's
basically just a black maxi sweater
dress with a balloon sleeve always a
plus
potato sock with two slits up design I
work from home so this is kind of
perfect for me to throw on layer on some
jewelry throw in a hat and just be like
cute / comfortable for the day on days
that are a little bit warmer I'll throw
in some motorcycle boots wear it out
it's not like one of those thick sweater
dresses it's pretty then it's more fall
not so much winter but if you're in a
warmer climate and you want like a cool
sweater dress without you know sweating
your brains out then this is a really
good sweater a dress to have I will do
Topshop and I'm tangled but Hirst is
this black MIDI I guess it's a mini
dress I don't know if you remember my
floral dress that I shot a while back
with the chain military boots this is
the same dress but it's black and it's a
MIDI so it has these ruched asleep
sleeps which I love I think that's such
a cool detail and then the back laces up
which is really nice it just kind of
adds a little something any sort of
black dress I can get my hands on I've
already shown - we just got started and
last thing from Topshop is this harness
belt I know this like looks very sexual
but it's not this is the front and then
this is the back so the belt goes in the
back and then the straps go in the front
oh cool with like a t-shirt I don't know
I just think it's kind of like a cool
alternative to like a piece of jewelry
or even a belt but I don't know a lot of
you were probably like I have a snows
and first I will show you this top which
obviously I love because the sleeves are
balloon and I love contrasting sleeves
and it's even better that it's blue and
black because that is one of my favorite
color combos for fall and winter and
pretty much just all the time really
love how it's got this
attachment right here with a little
ruffle detail mock neck the the
materials pretty thick it's not like a
thin flimsy t-shirt material I just
thought it was really cool with like a
pair of jeans
I just love anything with pair of jeans
I don't know if you guys have noticed
that oh look another black dress this is
me admitting I have a problem I was a
little disappointed when I got this one
because it is so thin like it's a very
very thin but again working from home
this is a great dress for me to have
because it is another potato sack dress
that I can layer necklaces over at a hat
and I mean you could do some tights with
it and a long coat if again your
climates a little warmer this is a good
like fall dress for you to have it's
fine I can definitely save this for
springtime with some flats oh I love
this my favorite item from ASOS the
sweater colors are just amazing they're
black burgundy
pink red pink again can't go wrong with
any of these colors and I like them
together again parent black jeans this
would be cute it's very oversized so you
could do this with like some faux
leather leggings some booties even some
jeans and sneakers I don't know I just
love sweaters like this that a have cool
colors or a print or that aren't itchy
and this kind of checks off all of my
boxes and oversized lastly I will do my
Zara stuff I will start with my
accessory and I got a beret I don't know
what I'm doing so I'll show you that
later and just another accessory layered
not layering piece but an accessory yep
I don't know what else I pop it I met a
loss for the first time at all
that's I love these so these are my
Becky crotch pants soccer right Ashley
where's baggy crotch pants I just think
they're cool they're like one of those
statement pants that you just really
don't need to fuss about your top or
your accessories because all the detail
is in the punch
and saloons right I have an extra small
here you guys always wonder was like
bagging your items what size I have
these are an extra small they were a
little bit big when I wash them they
shrink quite a bit so just be mindful if
you do get these they will shrink after
you wash them a pair of velvet pants and
I almost bought a pair of these at
rag-and-bone last year for like two
hundred and thirty dollars and I'm
really glad I held out because these
actually fit me ten times better they're
high-waisted
which yay and they're velvet and I've
been looking for a good pair of velvet
jeans for like two years now without
spending 230 dollars because this isn't
a jean that you can wear I don't think
it's an investment piece it's not just a
basic black pair that you can wear all
the time
velvet is very seasonal and obviously I
will not be wearing these in the
summertime so I didn't want to you know
spend a whole lot of money so I was
really happy to find these at zara next
from zara is a sweater that i've seen
like six people wear since i bought it I
haven't even worn it yet but I'm really
excited to Jenna has it also I think
everyone has it but it's just this
really pretty camel color I think that's
why everyone has it because the color is
so great and the fit is like perfect
it's so oversized really that's all
there is to say about it it's an
oversized camel sweater mm-hmm
is this floral MIDI dress again another
one of these things that I will wear
with ankle booties like moto boots I
love taking girly florally things and
kind of making them edgy with a leather
jacket break a go total opposite you
could do boho with this dress and do a
fedora so either way I just absolutely
love this it's got velvet details like
these dark pieces are velvet so that's
fun
Lance fun next is hey this isn't from
Zara
this is from H&amp;amp;M but I'll show you
anyways this is the dress I wore in my
Instagram picture and everybody loved it
so here it is I actually got it the day
before the event so it's pretty new just
love the colors and I love like dark
florals like I love black with like
sparing florals on it and then the
sleeve happy
I wore it with over-the-knee boots which
is a look that I love midi dress with
over-the-knee boots I think it's
something very like chic about it I hate
using that word but that's what I can
think of to describe like that situation
my next piece is something that I have
been looking for for about like a month
and a half I've been looking for a fall
kimono and I found one I found one at
Zara and I just love the colors it's
this really pretty royal blue with a
velvet rose floral patches on it and
this really does look like a bathrobe
when you close it I'm sorry don't close
it I will wear it open just jeans and
booties and like a high-neck white or
like cream top I think would be really
pretty but highlights so happy to find
this and it has pockets which I just
learned right now and it's floor-length
perfect so if any of you girls they've
been looking for a fall kimono here's
here's your guy so next I have a
bodysuit this is a velvet bodysuit and
it is I just love this I love the
colours in it it's got this really
pretty salmon color it's black it's got
teal green I just think this is like if
fall were a bodysuit this is what it
would be I normally don't like love body
suits because look at that like why
would anyone want to wear this it's a
body's do it and I got over it because I
really liked it
really cool prints are it just sometimes
makes like the best prints and this is
one of my favorite prints ever from Zara
the material the color the print
everything is just right lastly is the
bomber jacket that I got in the men's
section of Zara got a lot going on there
are so many colors and I love it so much
it's got this little patchwork right
here of this Tiger and then the back
also has the tiger on it and it says
pure change which I would normally think
is super cheesy I'm not like a fan of
this type of thing but I don't mind it I
just love everything about this it just
flows really well so um way to go Zara
men's section hope you guys love this I
hope you found some new items
or if you already have these items be on
the lookout for styling them in the
future
