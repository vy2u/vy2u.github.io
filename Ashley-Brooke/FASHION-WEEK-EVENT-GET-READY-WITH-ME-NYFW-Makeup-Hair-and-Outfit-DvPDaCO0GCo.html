woke up and showered now I'm gonna make
some coffee and then we'll start getting
ready
it's my little setup that I've got going
on this morning hey I am actually going
to my first Fashion Week event of the
whole season though a lot of people
think Fashion Week events are at night
parties know sometimes they are showered
let's do my hair my makeup and I haven't
even picked out an outfit yet oh this is
kind of a daytime event I'll probably
keep my makeup to a minimum maybe it's
just like a little bit of eye shadow
to get my eyebrows micro bladed a couple
of months ago I actually got it for my
mom for a mother today because it's
something that she has always wanted to
do we ended up having to cancel our
point she liked me she was like I don't
want to do it by myself do it with me so
I was like fine so I'm a disappointments
and then we had to cancel our
appointments because we had to take my
sister to school clothes shopping we
just kind of ran out of time I mean if
you already have thick eyebrows what
would that look like
I don't know I you know even though I do
have like naturally thick eyebrows I
still would like to not feel fill them
in everything was really common like
when I mentioned it and I left by her
Facebook group a lot of girls were
talking about how they they had their
stuff and they looked so good I was like
I would have never ever known well then
I'll just stick with my Tarte gotta take
so long to do my eyebrows I just think I
just have filled in eyebrows all the
time I just think that would be one of
the greatest things I swear though I've
had this Tarte Amazonian clay for my
eyebrows for probably four months and it
has not even like moved what I think I'm
ever gonna run out of this a little bit
of shimmering not a lot I always feel
like when I put this on if I put too
much on I always look like I'm sweating
or I'm like wet on my face
really really you have to be careful
what I do with like how I just said that
and then put it on like all over me
no sir may I shadow I'm gonna do my
tartlet palette not useless yet
gifted my favorite got so many messages
on Instagram people being like okay you
were so right about the tarp mascara
it's the best lashes always get so
tangled in with each other you don't
have some longest eyelashes in the whole
world is Brian and I always beg him to
let me put mascara on him because I just
want to see like how long his eyelashes
mackay and he always says no makeup is
done except for my lipstick but I'm
probably gonna do that like right after
I try still drinking my coffee so I want
to finish that before my my lipstick on
I let my makeups done I'm gonna do my
hair and since my outfit I think is very
floral and Bizzy prints I think I'm just
gonna do like a sleek straight behind my
ear kind of look to kind of tone down my
outfit then do you might heat protectant
spray always talking to my stylist
Bianca and she mentioned something about
doing like a keratin treatment around my
face because this is where I get the
most breakage and she said that if I
were to do a keratin treatment then I
wouldn't have to put so much heat around
my face so I think I'm actually gonna
book an appointment with her and get
that done and then I'll take you with me
so you can meet her I think a lot of you
guys have already booked appointments
with Bianca to get your hair done she's
so great I mean if you're coming to New
York and you when I look treat yourself
definitely make an appointment with her
but she books really really far in
advance so got a book on high healthy
are getting ready going that's the best
are you filming and get ready with me
negative why not
don't want to watch it I would watch it
would you guys watch it i ryan film to
get ready with me that makes me sad that
you think none of us would watch it no
you watch your own finitude
what would you like what would you talk
about and you're different with me do it
right deodorant doing it fasting you
would talk about your breakfast coffee
socks pants dirt cheap boom done don't
normally get ready right here right in
my kitchen area but since I'm filming
this and it's really dark outside this
is the only place I can get good light
I put on some hair oil
he is looking not like frizzy I'll
probably spray some of my living proof
humidity shield stuff works like so well
if you guys have frizzy hair and
anything activates your frizzy hair I'd
really suggest getting the living proof
a humidity shield spray it's awesome
right so now that my hair makeup is done
I'm gonna go in an outfit to wear and I
usually try to pick out an outfit the
day before or at least when I'm falling
asleep the night before be like okay
wear this with this with this but today
I have no clue I just wield my rolling
rack and here actually have like a
fashion like rolling rack that I put
some of my like favorite pieces on or
like things that I bought for Fashion
Week
just so it's alright they're easy for me
to see and I just keep it in the hallway
that way I can like roll about try
things on as a big marriage
here's my rolling rack
I just put like a few things on it right
now but really loving this top it's
laced with like golds this these aren't
beads they're actually the threading
like metallic threats with some velvet
patches so that's cool and I really
really like it with this plaid skirt
actually it's kind of one of those mixed
print miss mismatched situations so I'm
gonna try this on see what we think of
it got the outfit on and I actually
really really love it
one common color and kind of tying them
in like both of these tops have this
like like Mavi rose-colored for my
lipstick I did her sensational plum
liner by Maybelline and then I did my
Milani rose femme for like the inside of
my lip so it got kind of like a purpley
rose Dusty Rhodes kind of to match my
shirt all right Ryan and I are gonna pin
my skirt really quick okay so for my
perfume I'm gonna do my here we go my
jaw it's probably one of my favorites
right now because it's really really
strong and it lasts all day favorite is
my balloon Sayaka but I feel like I
leave the house and I can't smell it
anymore after like an hour so meisje
wall I can count on all day
it's why I'm gonna end it get ready with
me right here we're on our way to the
event and my fist
I'm gonna vlog the event and it'll be
light on Wednesday so go check it out
and I'll see you guys in minutes see you
first you go on sale wait for a
promotion and shop tiger will let you
know and I'll actually show you a quick
demonstration of how easy it is and what
it looks like on Free People quite a bit
so one of my faves see we'll go to new
and let's find something we love this is
beautiful so and it's $350 so I would
never pay 350 for this because it's so
specific and I don't know I just don't
