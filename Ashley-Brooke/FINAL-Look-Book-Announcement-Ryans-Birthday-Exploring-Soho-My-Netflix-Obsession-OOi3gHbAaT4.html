needed eggs so she ordered some eggs
just just a couple eggs when she for
sure knows that our fridge is fairly
tiny how does one-fifth sixty eggs in a
fridge well this is the first way that I
thought of she's probably gonna get home
and be like nope that doesn't work hey
guys so I just wanted to start off this
vlog by giving you an official update on
the lookbook
then I've got coming out on September
1st I'm wearing a jacket even though
it's 100 degrees outside the apartment
is 62 so always gotta stay cozy in here
so here is what you're gonna get in the
lookbook it is gonna be a full month's
worth of looks every single different
kind of look you can imagine it's gonna
be daytime nighttime casual dressy you
will not see one outfit repeated it is
all going to be shoppable online so
anything you see in the lookbook you
will be able to click a link to go
purchase this oh it's almost gonna be an
online magazine you're gonna be able to
flip through it on your phone or on your
computer one page are gonna have the
outfit on the other page you're gonna
have a description of what the outfit is
links to every item gonna be a video of
me describing the outfit how I would
style it alternatives I could use where
am i wearing this outfit to so it's
gonna be very detailed and very cool a
week after the lookbook has come out I'm
gonna create like a Google hangout or
some sort of place where we can go to
meet up online and you can ask me any
questions you have not like I'm gonna
say here's your lookbook good luck good
bye so you're gonna be able to ask
questions and you know we'll have it
hang out for about an hour and see how
that goes so it's gonna be five dollars
a month wanted to keep it super
affordable for you guys being five
dollars that's a lot
a coffee if you think about it that way
it's like okay that makes sense I
suggest just setting setting it up
monthly that way every month you just
get it emailed to you at the first is
each month
it'll come right to your inbox nice to
have inspiration right there in your
phone when you aren't quite sure what to
wear so that is coming September first
