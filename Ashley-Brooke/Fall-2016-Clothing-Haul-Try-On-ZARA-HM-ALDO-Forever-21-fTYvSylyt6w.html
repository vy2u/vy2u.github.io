hall is going to be a lot of jewelry
that I recently found from forever 21 I
have a small stack of clothes one purse
and three pairs of shoes and I'm so
excited fall is here so I'm buying all
my darker things my Dark Prince my legs
velvet studs so I am so excited and
instead of doing like one huge haul you
know that's 20 minutes long I'm gonna
start doing like smaller hauls even
though this is really not a small haul
so I don't know we'll see where this
takes us let's just go ahead and get
sawed it oh it's got quite a bit of
jewelry that is actually in 15s not
the first necklace that I have is this
leather choker from forever 21 and it's
really good like thin obviously faux
leather it's one of those ones that
wraps around and then dangles down on
the sides and it's got this really
pretty green stone in the middle so I
thought that's kind of nice if you're
wearing like all black and you want a
small pop of color and this one was five
dollars and ninety cents so this is a
good purchase my next one is also from
forever 21 another choker this time it's
got a little bit more of a chain um kind
of coin looking detail and I love this I
thought this was almost vintage looking
with the coins on it I just thought it
was super cool some was also five
dollars and ninety cents so another
steal tell this is in the same how did
this get so tangled this one is also
from forever 21 and I just loved the
layered look of it and I've been so
obsessed with these coin looking things
lately I think they're so cool and
vintage lucky but this is good for when
you do want you know when you're wearing
like a low-cut top or um you know just a
basic t-shirt and you want a cool yet
still kind of delicate necklace I think
something like this is so perfect
and this one was $7
ninety cents so another good steal from
forever21 okay is my last one from
forever 21 and this is I just thought
this was super cool looking and seeing
these horn looking necklaces around
lately but they're the ones I've seen
are like two or three hundred dollars so
I opted for a less expensive one because
I don't think I'll be wearing this a
whole lot just because this is kind of
specific it's not an everyday necklace
so this one was six dollars and ninety
cents
six is my last piece of jewelry from
Zara and it is a three kind of a three
in one saying this is $22.90 and the
first one is just a basic delicate chain
the second one is a velvet choker with
some beading on the top and on the
bottom and then surprise surprise
another coin looking necklace that I've
been so obsessed with I mostly just
bought it for the coin necklace because
I thought this was so cool it's like a
thick chain the coin on the bottom I'll
probably take this little like sparkly
thing off I don't know how I feel about
that it's kind of random why would I put
that there and also kind of digging this
velvet one olive green color so I think
that can match a lot of my warmer tones
and even blacks if you have one person
that I got from Aldo and I've been so
into stars and stuff lately so I was
like hit the jackpot when I found this
one this was only $45 got a super simple
silver chain you can wear it long ways
or you can shorten it if you're going
out and you want kind of a shorter
shoulder bag but you can fit quite a bit
in there super easy to get in and out of
and it's got a class B's so we just
stuff the space and what I love about
this is that it's not so long I'm by
four so I don't think that's you know
ridiculously small but for some reason I
have an issue with purses going to my
knees the knife's like where's my purse
so I have three pairs of shoes to show
you I'll start with these boots from
forever 21 I thought I mean Sarah
pattern here what's happening to me
right now they are just basic black
ankle booties with silver buckles all
the way down
they're so cool on I just think they add
so much to any outfit you could do what
black jeans and kind of an oversized
t-shirt and these boots and like a cool
bag and it's like a cool girl outfit you
know I love the cool girl outfit they
are very similar to the Chloe
susannah boots that are I believe $1,200
so I thought these were a good
alternative because you know living in
New York I'm walking around constantly
my shoes get absolutely ruined so I try
not to invest too much money in a single
pair of shoes because they just get so
dirty I step in like and it's like
literally and these were $39 and so
worth it I'm gonna wear these so much
during fall my second pair of shoes are
these from Steve Madden
I am so obsessed with these io4 socks in
them yes they're mine don't worry I
think these are so cold look at the heel
look how thick that is it's you know one
of those heels that gives like a skinny
effect from the side and then gets
fatter and it's pointy toe which I love
I think a pointy toe looks so nice and
so modern and so I don't know just a
little bit more stylish eight are
actually tighter around my ankle which
is great for skinny jeans and dresses
that way you know you don't have a whole
lot of material swimming around your
ankle or I'm gonna be honest they're not
the most comfortable shoe if you're
looking for a good pair of booty to just
kind of head out in like run errands
day-to-day going out these are great
because you won't be on your feet all
day but for work you're standing most of
the day I don't recommend them but they
do actually come in a really cool gray
suede and they also come in a burgundy
velvet which are so amazing I opted for
the black because I just saying
I'm gonna wear these with more but I
would love to get the velvet ones they
were so cool these were 140 I believe so
a really good price for super simple
ankle booties that I will probably have
for a very long time
my next pair of shoes are from Zara they
are a super fun heel how cool are these
they're like a coppery gold color
they're crackled awesome love these love
the heel I mean I think these are just
the coolest thing ever
and you guys who subscribe to my her
life lookbook will have seen these in
the lookbook I think I paired them with
just um a mock neck black long-sleeve
shirt and a pair of light washed denim
how cool is this outfit like your shoe
is the whole outfit so I love these
super low heel I think it's like a three
and a half inch heel so they're very
comfortable can't wait to wear these I
think will be a great addition to my
phone so okay now let's get into the
clothes first we have I think this is my
favorite things wait maybe I should save
it for last is my favorite yeah not
being enough it's got this skirt from
H&amp;amp;M and oh sorry and I can see this the
fall with an oversized sweater tucked
into the front kind of slouchy with some
ankle booties I thought this was like
the perfect fall skirt it's a MIDI link
so it goes below your knee but it's not
so long to wear it covers up your booty
so you can still see a little bit of
your leg in between the booty and it's
pleated it's not super thick but it's
also not thin so I think it's great for
fall and it also comes in a cream color
which I didn't get because I already
have one but if you guys who saw my kind
of style video can't remember what I was
styling um skirts bulls-eye styling you
guys were loving that cream skirt that I
had which is sold out at forever 21 so
this is the alternative in the cream
version so I will link these below so
you can check this out so my next item
from Zara is this bodysuit
and it is just a plain mock neck shear
sleeve and it's got this really cool
detailing at the wrist I am obsessed
with this I feel like I will wear it so
much I mean there's so many things you
can do with this it's actually going to
be in my Sunday's how to style so stay
tuned the bass this was only $25 zara
sometimes blows my mind at how
inexpensive their items are because this
feels like such good quality it's really
soft it's not cotton with more of a
dressy material so you can wear this out
I am obsessed with this they did kind of
an unseen finish so you won't have that
panty line it's like gum and if you've
ever had gaps underwear how they just
like smol to your butt
it doesn't have like a seam or anything
so it's like kind of a no panty line
situation so this is kind of what this
is next from Zara is this red sweater
and it's kind of a batwing II sweater
that kind of gets smaller here with the
zipper in the back and on camera it
looks like really really red but it's
not it's one of those Tom down muted
Reds it's so pretty I've been looking
for a good color red sweater for the
longest time and I found this one and I
was super excited about it because the
color is so beautiful this was only $39
I will be wearing this so much
throughout fall and it's so soft like
how love this with denim was black so
there's just so many things you can do
with this and it's not super long so you
can wear it with skirts also what I did
getting it out of the closet though next
is a slip dress from Zara and I must say
this is my first slip dress that I've
ever purchased how I'm really excited
about it and it is so cool it's just
plain black with gold boobs felt like
gold patches here and then the lace is
actually a gray in gold intertwined so I
thought this was so pretty and I can
layer it and I can wear it in the summer
and also in the fall thought this was
the perfect first slip dress that I've
bought and I also ripped this hanger as
well I got really aggressive getting
this stuff out of the club like it was
in the back and it was stuck and I just
started ripping and then I heard a bunch
of crafts and then all my hangers bro so
next is this basic just kind of layering
long-sleeve shirt from Zara I won't
spend too much time on it cause you guys
saw this in my how to style over the
knee boots video that I posted last
Sunday so you've already seen this but
it's cool it's just kind of warm neutral
stripes with a pop-up black and it's got
metallic um threats inside of the cream
so I thought this was really cool great
for layering good for like overall
layering under dresses under leather
jackets you know it's just a good
alternative to like a basic black and
white stripes t-shirts to just add a
little bit more of your neutral colors
next is also a sweater that you saw in
Sunday's video and this is just a basic
sweater from forever 21 it's lace up
goes down really far
so I suggest where I'm like a bralette
or something under it I got this in a
medium because they were sold out of my
size but it's nice it still fits kind of
oversized and slouchy which it's a good
look I probably would have bought it in
the medium anyways I love this I think
it's just so great to throw over a pair
of jeans and like moto boots when you're
going out to run errands the goods comfy
errand running sweater that reminds me
Ryan we still need to go to Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond next is my second to last item my
favorite item wait I've got two
favorites what do I do
I am so excited to wear this I'm so
excited to put it in a style video let
me button it let me button it so you get
the full effect it's a cold shoulder
lace dress from Zara look how cool this
print is I am
black and white red orange green pink
all the colors when it's like I know you
like obviously can't tell what it looks
like right now but I hope this video of
me wearing it and it is gorgeous
actually so I forgot I bought this
because I put it in the back of my
closet so I could put it in the hall
today and I saw a woman walking across
the street the other day and I was
thinking oh my god that dress is so
beautiful and I got it close and it was
this dress and I already owned it but
was like yeah I have that so I love this
dress and now that I finally put it in
my video I can start wearing it and I
can't wait look at the detailing right
here how pretty is this I love it
so I will be wearing this a lot in the
folder and my last item my baby item is
this flowy romper from Zara and it looks
like a big ball of fabric right now but
you'll see when it's on the screen below
exactly what it looks like but it's got
super wide sleeves so that comes to an
end and it it looks like a dress but
it's not it's actually shorts so this is
so cool I plan on wearing this with
over-the-knee boots ankle boots tights I
don't know I think it's just a really
good transition like fall piece so we
love this alright guys that is it for my
haul I tried to keep it short I don't
think it was but that's okay right
longer the haul the better I hope you
loved all of these items I will link
them below hopefully none of them are
sold out if they are I will link an
alternative but they're all fairly new
