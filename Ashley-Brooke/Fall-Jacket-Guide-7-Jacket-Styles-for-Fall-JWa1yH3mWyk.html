favorite jacket styles for end of fall

coming probably in the beginning of
winter then I love jackets so so much is
because there are great layering pieces
um if you're from a warmer climate you
know you just need a lightweight jacket
and you're good to go
and if you're from somewhere that's a
little colder you can layer your coat on
top of a jacket and you've still got
your put together outfit underneath when
it comes to buying outerwear you know
fall in winter is such a more expensive
season than summer you know summer
you're buying dresses and skirts and
lighter top center you're buying coats
and jackets and sweaters and especially
jackets and coats can really add up so I
just thought I would share with you guys
a Chrome extension that I've been using
to help save money I know you guys love
it when I share these types of tricks
and tips when you're online shopping Jen
it's called honey and it is a free
Chrome extension club honey because it
does all of the work for you like I have
spent so much time looking for coupons

does for you is basically finds them all
for you so all you have to do is
download the free Chrome extension shop
at the store that it complies with go to
checkout it scans it for you and adds
the coupon that'll save you with the
most money and all I get to do is just
go to the link that's in the description
box and the link right here you can type
it in and it just takes you straight to

browser I basically use this for all of
my Black Friday shopping I'm going to
use it for holiday season it's just
perfect especially for this time of year
when you were doing so much shopping for
others and then there was Black Friday
Cyber week honey actually has over 5
million active users and test over 1
million coupons a month and it's so
funny because when we were at
Thanksgiving Ryan told me his sister was

much research on coupon code and
hopefully you guys will get some jacket
inspo out of this video and be able to
create some really cool outfits whether
you're going to work or to brunch or out
or just kind of a casual day at home on
how to incorporate these jackets into
your everyday life
my first jacket I have this one from
ASOS and I know you're like okay that's
the coat Ashley that is not a jacket but
I do wear this as a long blazer
definitely can wear it as a coat but I
really love it as like an actual third
piece
this is my favorite one from Urban
Outfitters those of you guys who watched
my vlogs are probably like I never want
to see that again because I wear it so
much but I wear this when I like wake up
in the morning and I'm getting my coffee
checking emails and then I also wear it
when I'm going to run errands with jeans
and sneakers or jeans and boots so
having a cardigan like this can really
just kind of take you throughout the
whole day no matter what you're doing or
where you're going perfect for the
holidays when you're traveling you know
you want to be comfy during the holidays
you're just kind of hanging out with
friends and family so I think pieces
like this are great for traveling for
the airport but then also when you're
just kind of hanging out
so my next style is the bomber and I
just live for bombers they are probably
one of my favorite jacket styles that I
own for bomber number one it is this one
by who what where and I love this one
because you can dress it up I've worn
this out so many times I've worn it to
meetings to events but then I can also
wear it with jeans and sneakers so it's
just kind of one of those things that it
is very versatile it's casual it's
dressy at the same time and I also love
that it has a pop of purple in it which
i think is really cool I always look for
like subtle pops of color when I am
looking for a jacket bomber is a black
textured sleeve bomber that's really
like more brightening my face this is a
great nighttime jacket the sleeves look
so cool when they're pushed up because
then you've got so much texture kind of
on your shoulders but you know for those
of you who don't want to wear like a
leather jacket or a blazer at night this
is a good alternative and it really adds
just some like texture to your outfit
this bomber is zara menswear bomber I
like to shop sometimes in the mid
section at Zara because their men's
bombers are so cool like they're way
better than the women's and the small
fits me so works out I would say this
one's just like a casual chill bomber
it's got this really cool tiger print on
the back so this is definitely a more
out there bomber colorful I think it's
like super stylish really trendy you can
wear it off your shoulders right open I
don't know I just think this is really
cool with like a dark denim
jacket is a kimono and I wore the like
my kimonos to death in the summer time
so I looked forever for one for fall I
just couldn't find one they were too
lightweight finally I found one and I'm
really excited about it it is heavier so
it's not like your typical silk
lightweight kimono this has actually got
some weight to it so the material is
very fall the color is very fall it's a
great layering piece for those fall days
that you know the weather is kind of
gonna be a little warmer in the
afternoon and you don't want to wear
something too heavy but you still want
to have that fall look I think this is a
really great option for those types of
days it does have a tie honestly I'm
probably just gonna take the tie off
because I'm never gonna use it it looks
like a robe when it's tied and it's kind
of distracting in the back so I will
probably be removing that and just
wearing it as is X style of jacket is
the Blazer and the bomber and the Blazer
are probably like my top two favorite
jackets it's something that I grab all
the time throw it over basics and it
just makes your whole entire outfit
a first style of blazer is the
structured blazer and I don't know that
I would wear this I think I would wear
this more dressed up than I would dress
down it is very structured it's got some
weight to it it's very thick perfect for
fall and you know you're still looking
professional with a structured blazer
but you're looking stylish at the same
time because it's like this plaid and
then it's got these floral patterns all
over it so you know it's a little edgy a
little girly but still professional
which is like everything I look for when
I'm looking for like going to a meeting
or going to my office and you want to
look nice this is a great item to have
next is the boyfriend blazer and this is
something that's a little bit more
oversized this one is from H&amp;amp;M and it's
Navy and brown a color in combination I
would never expect to wear in my life
but I saw this and I was like oh that
that's actually pretty cool so this is
great when you're wanting to do
something kind of cool and casual when I
think of oversized I think of like
sneakers and jeans and a t-shirt and
maybe like a Baker boy hat I think
that's the perfect outfit to do an
oversized blazer with next is the
metallic blazer and oh this is probably
one of my most favorite items in my
closet that I own and even though it's
pink you can still do this in the fall
it looks so good with grays and blacks
so definitely I would do this with a
pair of black skinny jeans maybe
high-waisted basic tee and some gold
jewelry I think is the perfect way of
styling this for fall I think it's just
kind of like the vibe of the weather and
the season there's metallics everywhere
there's Gold everywhere so don't be
afraid to make a statement and a blazer
like this X blazer is a tweed blazer and
it's pretty thin it's not like your
typical tweet and it looks really ugly
in the video but the colors are not
showing up properly I don't know you're
gonna have to go online and look at it
but I love all of the colors in this
especially this pop of royal blue I
think it's so cool I think all the
colors are perfect and bring out any of
your like your oranges and your Browns I
think is great for this
next is the denim jacket I like need to
stop with the denim jackets um I'm just
talking about basic denim jackets I'm
talking about denim jackets that have a
little bit of a flare to them so first I
have this one from Zara and it's got the
faux shearling collar it's black it's
belted it's got this really like
oversized look here but then it kind of
cinches at the bottom which is cool I
think that's a cool look having
oversized but then still showing that
you have a shape on the bottom that way
you don't lose yourself completely
really cool tie up the side
I just love any sort of detail like this
in a denim jacket next is what I like to
call my Texas inspired denim jacket also
from Zara they just make the coolest
denim jackets at a reasonable price I
love this one because of the sweater
sleeve I don't know it's just something
different this is very oversized but
yeah it looks good with just like black
skinny jeans and some booties you can
even do it over like a black flowy dress
in booties basically very casual I would
never dress this guy up but I just think
the colors are so fun so you know when
looking for a denim jacket definitely go
for something that has contrast sleeves
a built-in hood you know faux shearling
collar cropped ties some sort of fun
detail that make it stand out over your
basic denim jacket
I just think that this color is so
perfect to wear this time of year
because it goes with Burgundy's Black's
Browns like you can literally wear this
color with everything and it just kind
of almost gives you a pop of color I
think cognac is like a good pop of color
when you're doing like an all-black
outfit even first I have you guys have
seen this jacket so many times but I'm
gonna keep showing you because I love it
a pleated sleeve cropped jacket it is so
good with black so google it dark denim
you can wear it to work you can wear it
casually it's even like kind of cool
it's got like some cool detail to it and
this is definitely more on the khaki
side rather than like camel or cognac
but it still gives you the same effect
as if you were wearing a camel humor
pregnant camel you know what I mean
next is this which is a true cognac
camel color and this is actually a dress
from Zara but I just unbuttoned it and
made it a lightweight jacket and this
really is perfect for if you are from
the south and it's still blazing hot
this time of year during the day but
it's very lightweight and it's nice and
flowy because it was a dress but you
know just look for something so simple
like this as a shirt dress or like a
button-down top and open it up and wear
it as a jacket and I think this is so
great with high-waisted skinny jeans
even like a textured Jean maybe like a
velvet definitely booties with like gold
detail gold jewelry so those are all the
jackets I have to show you guys the
reason I love jacket so much is because
you can throw them over just a basic
outfit and then you've got your outfit
depending on your jacket cuz if you
aren't familiar with the life by here
lookbook I will put the link here and in
the description box below we um
do a page almost every month on jackets
and layering and outerwear so go check
that out go sign up for that like I said
I will do coats in the winter this was
just jackets no coats I'm not quite
there yet with the actual coats there
have been some cold days but um I think
a lot of us are still kind of in the the
light layering portion of the season so
end the video now and I will see you
guys next time
