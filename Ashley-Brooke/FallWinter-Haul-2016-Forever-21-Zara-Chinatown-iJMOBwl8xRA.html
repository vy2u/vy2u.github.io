feel like this is appropriate what else
can I do with this scarf I just continue
like this distracting or no brainstorm
yesterday Oh mm-hmm
and I rose my eyeball it's thought I
like these but then when I look in the
camera like are they too big for my face
mmm they fit how about I'm looking at
them today with my grain boots tell me
about it huh what's up guys welcome back
to my channel today we are doing a fall
slash I guess you could say winter haul
because I do have a few coats so fall /
winter haul I do want to get regular on
doing hauls because I know you guys
really love the haul so I'm gonna try to
stay consistent may be doing them once a
month maybe more so um yes let's go
ahead and get started this haul is
predominantly Zara forever21 I have some
chinatown goodies in there that I got um
a few days ago couple pairs of shoes so
I think it's gonna be a big haul it
looks big but you know how these things
just like fly so let's get started I
will start with my Zara stuff you guys
probably saw this beauty on my how to
style dresses for fall it is just like
an oversized tunic sweater we'll just
move over here tunic sweater thing
batwing sleeves oversized I have worn
this thing with ankle booties with
flares with leather pants like by itself
so this is probably one of the most
versatile items in my closet I know for
every weather occasion I can just like
grab and go sets with this like that
it's gray and it has little specks of
blue in it so you definitely can wear it
with a lighter blue denim for fall next
I have this turtleneck um double layer
shirt from Zara
I love the layered look but I hate
actually layering because you can always
feel the top underneath like turning to
the side and I feel like I'm finding it
all day long so I thought this top is
perfect because it's already got its
built in layer and it actually buttons
down the side so if you want to show a
little skin make it a little bit more
flow
we you can always unbutton this also got
this like weird like I don't know I'm
like never wearing it like this I don't
know what that for I actually got a size
large in this because first of all it's
the only size that they had out and I
believe the small sold out online as
well but I actually like it large you
know it looks a little oversized it
doesn't look like too big for me
it makes the length good I can wear with
like a leg or leather leggings and it
looks good so I'm gonna like run this
thing for a while this next dress is
also from Zara and if you watch my vlogs
you would know that I was on the hunt
for this dress for so long and I finally
found it in a size small I'm so excited
I feel like this dress just like defines
my style because it's you know
sweatshirt serious and then it's got
like a fun built in metallic unexpected
thing at the bottom is like the
definition of business on the top party
on the bottom I'm obsessed with it Ryan
or like when I brought it home he
thought I was joking he was like wait
you're gonna wear that like out like
hair yeah I love it I'm obsessed with
this it's definitely not boy friendly
though boys do not like this dress who
cares my accessory from Zara is this
little pom-pom hat I love this guy I
don't know I saw it and I was like I
have to have it it's the coolest thing
ever so it's basically just like a plain
grey knit with a little puppy ball with
different colors on the top not like the
warmest thing but cute oh I've got a
bunch of different colors in it so it
definitely goes with a lot of things now
hop into my forever 21 haul this one
I've had for quite a while I just
haven't put it in a haul yet it is a
basic embroidered sleeve just plain
black sweatshirt from forever 21 who's
giving me major Gucci vibes with the
sleeves so I had to have this this I
small just think it's good layered with
overalls or just jeans I don't know the
sleeves kind of like make it to where
you don't have to style it crazy you can
just kind of throw it on with jeans and
it's like this is your like cool part of
your outfit so
I love this I'm gonna stop saying I love
this because obviously you guys know I
love this because I wasn't on it hey
body suit from forever 21
it's a floral body suit size small I
hate trying on body suits at the store I
don't know if you guys are like me I
cannot stand trying on body suits
because the fact that sub ones like
crotch has been so close to this grosses
me out and I can just only hope that
everyone wears underwear when they're
trying on clothes had to make like a
t-shirt Sheils on my head when i tried
this on will not wear it until I wash it
I don't know I'm such a germaphobe but I
feel like any normal person would be
scared of this crotch it's like a mock
neck basic I thought it'd be so perfect
for layering because you know it is like
just a plain bodysuit tight but it's
also like very floral E and colored and
printed so I thought this was a good
fall print to have just to you know grab
and layer and get a close-up of what the
print looks like it's really pretty
it's amazing blazer this just plain long
line blazer that I got from forever 21
it is really hard to see when I'm like
lifting it up but in the photo you'll
see what it looks like oversized double
button I like to wear it open or closed
super soft but it's like a very dressy
material so it is work appropriate I'm
just obsessed with this I got a size
small just one of those pieces that you
can really just like grab and layer over
anything um I love layering pieces like
this that just kind of make your whole
outfit um jeans and a t-shirt oversized
blazer and like that is my uniform when
I'm looking for something to hurry up
and go out of the house but I like to
call just the most perfect plain black
sweater in the whole entire world it's
oversized mock neck plain black doesn't
get much easier than the got a size
medium because I did one a little bit
more of an oversized effect really
doesn't matter with oversized things I
feel like you can go up however many
sizes and it's still gonna look
oversized so I got a medium so you guys
know I have been looking for a plain
black moto faux leather vest and I
finally found one so I will stop
complaining and talking about it because
I finally
one I found this guy from forever21
exactly what I was looking for I'm so
excited I found it I got a size medium
just for the oversized effect so I can
wear it over sweater as a length is
perfect it's got a felt oh my gosh I was
so happy to find this it was one of
those where it's like the only one on
the rack so I knew it was meant for me
it was practically calling my name it's
just like perfect I'm gonna layer this
over so much during the winter in the
fall this was a good deal so I really
hope that they still have these online
when I do this haul because I think
everyone needs a faux leather moto vest
to just like layer over whatever really
not much explaining to do it is just a
crop striped sweater it's textured it's
not just striped so let me see if I can
kind of show you guys look for layering
good for just throwing on with some
high-waisted jeans I think we all need
just like a good collection of basic
sweaters and I think a black and white
striped one is something really good to
have because it's not so basic but it
still is basic if you know what I mean
and I got a size small in this guy next
was one of my most favorite things that
I got and it is this cropped faux fur
jacket is Navy is Han in the site cognac
Brown a little bit of black so I mean
this just goes with everything I'm so
excited for this I love little faux
leather jackets but it's hard to find
some that don't look so cheap this one
is really soft nice not scary faux scary
faux fur is so scary and this one is not
scary this one is a size small next I'm
like fighting the Sun you guys see the
Sun coming in right now because if I
just film right here hi blind I have
been looking for a super long black coat
finally found one from forever 21 I'm
not I'm going to show you guys because
it's like you don't you can't see like
what it looks like so I'll just focus on
the video right here it is a size medium
hooded super long duster coat I just
think this is so great for throwing over
you know when it's super cold outside
when you're heading out pretty heavy so
those of you who are in colder states
like me this is so great
maybe layer like a sweater
are under it and like a scarf and it's
so warm it's so heavy it's pretty thick
yes belt holes but it didn't come with
like a bell I don't know if there was a
belt supposed to be attached to it but I
sure did not get home with a belt but
whatever I wouldn't use the belt anyways
I would probably just always wear it
open we loved this hoop and I like that
there's a hood because sometimes when it
snows don't want to have an umbrella
because I don't want to like deal with
an umbrella so I think it is good to
have just kind of throw over your head
when it starts snowing or raining and
then you're good to go next item I have
is my teddy bear coat from forever 21
and you guys sold it in my last vlog a
lot of you were asking where it came
from so forever 21 size small it looks a
little red in the video but it's not
it's like a pretty true kind of kamilly
color and looking for kind of a cognac
brown coat but not like a tailored one I
wanted something fun and kind of shaggy
so I saw this and I was like ah exactly
what I'm looking for so of course I
snagged this button closure so you know
if you need to close it you can all that
good stuff let's go into the forever 21
accessories I've only got a few I've
been looking for some bigger um
rimmed sunglasses and I found these guys
I love them so much they've got just
like a thicker rim and no hardware
they're super light on my face
and I don't know I just thought that
they fit really well and they're very
comfortable so I got these obviously I
got them in Brown as well because why
not I actually got the brown first and
then I kept finding myself wearing so
much black that I like went ahead and
just got the black one so these were 5
dollars and 90 cents from forever 21 and
I honestly like cannot have expensive
sunglasses like Bryan has Tom boards and
Ray Bans and I have forever 21 H&amp;amp;M ASOS
because I don't know I think when you're
a girl and you have a purse it's so easy
to just throw sunglasses in your purse
and they get scratched and so I stick
with the inexpensive
laughs I had a pair of Chloe's
sunglasses ones that I was just so
scared to even wear that I never even
wore them so next I feel like I totally
hit the jackpot with this purse because
I have been looking for just a basic
black leather small bag with like
minimal hardware minimal stitching
something just very simple that I know
will go with everything and I found this
from forever 21 and I just thought it
was like the most perfect little black
bag I thought I'd like actually looked
pretty expensive it's just got a button
close your clothes like you're so right
ah just a simple button closure and it's
pretty big inside as I'll go into my
Chinatown stuff because I got this and
I've been wearing it on this bag these
two pom pom balls for my bags I got this
multicolored one because I thought it
was super fun I love the colors in it
and then I got this one this Navy and
blue one which I love very soft they're
faux obviously should I do a double no
that's aggressive next in Chinatown I
got this scarf which actually matches my
shirt kind of looks the same but yeah I
loved all the colors in the scarf I
thought it was really pretty um it kind
of looked like fall crayons one was only
$7 so she was asking 15 I talked her
down to 7 and I don't know if you guys
know this but we're gonna be melville
sells vintage scarves knew that they had
vintage Levi's but they now have been
tidge scarves I found this guy right
here again major Gucci vibes with the
scarf a whole bin they were like 10
dollars each so I had to get at least
one and I found this guy I love it so
much not you know thick or anything it's
just a little neck scarf I also got this
guy from Chinatown my little floral
league bag I was in a very floral mood
got so much floral stuff in this hall
it's just like a basic small black bag
from Chinatown I think it was like 20
bucks I wear so much black in
I just thought that this was like a nice
pop of print in color to my outfit since
- or wrap-up this Hall I've got two
pairs of shoes to show you first pair is
a floral bootie what is happening right
now it's Laurel bootie and these are by
Matisse of a good printed shoe they're a
little stiff but I think once I wear
them a few times and break them in I'll
be fine and you guys also know that I've
been looking for a leopard bootie for
months out and I grabbed these from
Kenneth Cole heel is like perfect height
small heel they're textured they've got
some leather piping down the side zip
closure closure or $200 but Kenneth Cole
has been having like these blowout flash
sales lately so I actually got 30% off
of them plus free shipping guys know I
don't like paying a whole lot for shoes
because it's I'm walking around all the
time in the streets of New York are so
rose hate investing so much money and
chews so this was like a good price
point for me because I'll be wearing
these so much and I don't want to
completely ruin them alright guys that
is it for this haul I hope you loved
everything like I said I'm gonna try to
keep doing hauls at least like once a
month and I like to cut a lot of the
stuff in my life by her lookbook you
