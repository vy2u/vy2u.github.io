mom and my dad and my brother are coming
to New York and I'm so excited they'll
be here in probably about an hour
I do have 11 year old twin sisters they
are not coming to the grown-up trip so
they weren't invited
sorry girls L'Oreal sent me like six
boxes of they're on break it and I
busted one of those out and used it it
was all in French so it's a miracle that
I knew what ingredients to mix with what
but I'm loving it I wanted a little bit
more blonde because like I was getting a
little dark so I loved that supposed to
rain today no it's not the Sun is out
Brian's on me it's gonna rain that look
like it's gonna rain no I have to show
you what I've been doing this is my
entryway I have been decorating tah-dah
enough oh cool they've got new pillows
got this guy these are just my old ones
I still love them I'm gonna go get ready
although I secretly and not even
secretly love doing touristy things so
that's what we're gonna do
yeah we love doing touristy things here
like we might pretend like we don't like
but really I'm like how much do you hate
them for as much as I hate
liquors flavor - that was one time I
accidentally ordered licorice flavor in
toothpaste Tom's to face that's how does
let me just tell my side of the story
but Ryan was lying to us
so remember how earlier Brian was like
it's gonna thunderstorm and I was like
no it's not because of sunny
you were right my mom and dad and my
brother were walking here when the storm
hit so they like ran inside of a random
pizza place and they can't get here it's
raining so hard and like a lightning and
thundering and it's crazy
take
I better bring my snacks with me
yeah
Wow
we're gonna take a little tour through
West Village and show you guys West
Village it's so cute and then we're
gonna get a tree

a continuation of this vlog because I
feel like it was gonna be too long if I
made it all when whole vlogs so I have a
really cool vlog coming out tomorrow

actually got a package from living a
