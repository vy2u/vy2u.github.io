want for Christmas balls please wait
that would be so great Brian
transportation people ask me why we
don't take the subway we do take the
subway
we just don't film in the subway anymore
because people when you're in small
crowded places don't like the camera
which totally understandable we take
boobers I'd say maybe once a week maybe
but we we mostly walk everywhere we have
city bike memberships we ride bikes but
luckily we live in an area where pretty
much everything we need is walking
distance
there was a two-hour wait at that place
so we're gonna go into Kiehl's before ok
before we figure it out
you get
on your feet regular real original black
Joe
real original morning it is Monday
morning and don't you on the table still
his vet appointment she's getting her
third round of shots today and then
we're going to I don't know we have to
be there in 10 minutes luckily it's

exam oh I know
Stella's appointment went good she was
crazy crazy mode getting some coffee at
cava aren't here today because we are
talking about life by her and I'm
getting some things in order kind of
getting organized so we thought we would
one of our favorite spots
you look more at it as like bigger
picture yeah it's like how would I make
this happen metrics need to be hit in
order for it to be a success or revenue
and we can go over it more tomorrow
during the actual meeting a little
kitchen time on the floor
no big everyone knows how clean our cars
are their city streets clean
Brian we have the cleanest floor in New
York oh I wish I can say that today it
was more eventful for you guys and I
wish I would have had things to blog see

vlogmas because I'm afraid I'm so boring
today I had three calls I got stylo
Jaques up and going which I've been so
excited about have blog post up but I
just have pictures I don't have like
actual blogging because I was just
trying to get it up so moving forward
I'll definitely like write out and like
eventful and informative but for now
it's just photos because I was trying to
get it up and live right to go it's so
funny because I just had a conversation
with someone at insa stories and she was
like are you a perfectionist you know
did that hold you back and I was like I
am such a perfectionist but you can't be
when it comes to like starting a YouTube
channel starting a blog getting a blog
post out and I told her by the time you
know you're done perfecting your blog
post or perfecting this someone else has
already produced three videos or three
blog posts what are you listening to
with your ear buds oh you just have one
in I see
you just have one right that's true love

haricot we talked about it for a couple
of hours I went really well I'm talking
about getting like my hair don't go up
and going for a while and you know
finally we decided to sit down and stay
like okay in order for this to be
successful what do you need to do like
you have to map out a plan you can't
just like fly by the seat of your pants

like you do need a plan in order to make
things work and run especially in that
capacity a lot of a lot of moving parts
