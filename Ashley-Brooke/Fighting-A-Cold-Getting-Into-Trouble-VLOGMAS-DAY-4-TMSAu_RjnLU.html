winter and I'm using bond a stands in
dark and I'm using my tart glove to put
it on I'm just gonna do my face and my
chest though since I'm sick I just feel
really washed out and I think this will
help me feel
alright guys so I am feeling a little
bit better today but of you give me so
many really nice like home remedies for
my cold and I tried a few of them and I
feel a little bit better today I still
just have like so much pressure in my
head and I'm not putting makeup on today
because my eyes keep watered and my nose
keeps running and I keep having to blow
it so today hasn't really been like a
typical weekday normally on the weekdays
I wake up super early go to the gym just
like getting all my stuff done but I'm
just feeling just like I shouldn't just
not great today so hopefully I'll be
back to myself tomorrow if not for sure

longer and so many of you are so nice
you're sending me messages like don't
feel like you have to vlog if you're not
feeling well I mean I'm not feeling so
bad to the point where I just like can't
vlog it's just probably not as exciting
as it normally would be although it's
really not exciting anyways because I'm
usually just sitting at home working
today I am going to kind of finish up
what I was doing with my closet
yesterday since I'm not really feeling
well I'm just gonna kind of do like a
short cut clean-out organized I know if

month normally at the beginning of each

something earlier and I said what is in
your mouth so I opened her mouth and her
little tooth came out look a little
puppy - she's lost almost all of her
puppy teeth I never found one though I
don't know if I vacuum them up or if she
eats them or what but this is the first
one I've ever found and so it's like
very gross like I don't know what to do
with it but I feel bad just throwing it

everyone keeps telling me about the
ravioli comment and I think we were just
confused because we got ravioli and they
were in the same container so we were
just like oh that's the ravioli
I totally I know the difference they
don't
even look the same so yeah just wanted
to clear that up that that was just like
a total brain fart just by judging what
it looked like
I don't member if I said it or rhyme we
were talking about us and we were like
well I don't often comment but I joined
the life of her community and I'm
obsessed I love the look book oh that's
so nice

had a whole bowl of ice cream last night
and it helped until I was done and then
I just had a sore throat and a stomach
ache you're blue are your side snout
blue jeans available they're from
Topshop and I know they're not on top
shop side anymore but I know last time I
checked that Nordstrom had them
available on their site dharak videos
are not cool please fix the lights tons
of exclamation marks so many ravioli
comments can you please mention in the
blog how using heels midnight recovery
concentrate has been working for you so
I've been switching out between that and
the drunk elephant serum that I got and
I just love both of them equally the
midnight recovery I've been using for
longer and it's amazing I used it for
like a whole month straight morning not
morning um
overnight and it just made my skin feel
very soft a little greasy but not not
bad greasy it's a good kind of greasy if
there ever is such a thing
it's Stephanie another relative visiting
know so Stephanie and I don't tell you
guys this I'm sorry sorry Stephanie
Stephanie is also another life by her
member who she was at the meet up and we
just connected there and her and her
husband were in the city so she her and
Misty know each other as well so she
just stopped by - I get vertigo on the
escalators and elevators - oh my god so
it's not just me I thought there was
something wrong with me every time I go
up an escalator at some point I almost
just fall completely over I'm like
what's wrong with me you guys seem to
eat so little how do you keep fit
alright so this is just kind of one of
those things where it's not always what
you see like just because I only film
myself eating one meal yesterday it
doesn't mean that that's all I ate
yesterday I
actually I had that's the only meal I
ate yesterday because I'm sick and I'm
not feeling well but after that Ryan ate
another full meal plus a smoothie Bowl
plus ice cream so you know don't don't
take things so literal
in in YouTube videos you know just
because you don't see me walk Stella
doesn't mean I don't walk her twice a
day we eat plenty don't worry no one's
going hungry in this in this apartment
everyone seems to love cookie and Kate's
blog it's the butternut squash soup
recipe that I made yesterday and I had
never heard of it so I will definitely
be going back and checking for more
recipes you guys eat vegan cheese if so
what is your brand of choice I like
follow your heart there mozzarella for
my pizza I like the Gouda for my burgers
I haven't tried any of the other but um
Ryan likes chow and he likes another
kind what is it I can't think of what it
is but I made the mistake last year you
have to melt it or it's just no no bueno
yeah right styles no bueno do you have
us maybe you have a sinus infection in
your face looks a little puffy and that
happens to me when I get one yeah that
could be it
um I don't have I don't know how this
works I don't have bad sinuses so I know
you get your groceries delivered yes
Whole Foods has like a $5 delivery fee
can't carry a hoss gostrey's home what
is with all of the long ads um I don't
know I don't control that ad some people
will people were saying that in my vlogs
there's like four or five ads I don't
know why that's I did not do that
someone was a little upset that I called
Don I didn't call Donald Trump President
Trump
um so it she was very nice about it just
used to hearing Donald Trump Donald
Trump Donald Trump so um yeah sorry that
didn't even cross across my mind
Ryan's coat was from Zara your
grandparents are adorable thank you they
really are so sweet so so sweet
I can swallow your food before talking I
agree an update on the Aztec secrets
mask I love it I used I've used it twice
now and I really love it I just hate the
smell of apple cider
vinegar so that's kind of tough for me
but I really love the mask and are you
still fake tanning today was my first
day fake tanning since like winter of
this year so yeah but I love Bondi sands
that's I've used three brands I've used
San Tropez Bondi sands and she was when
my brain is like mashed potatoes but I
like bought myself the best fix the
light it's very dark same person sorry
of the turtleneck with the holes it is
from brandy melville I love their basics
they have the like softest best basics
you can wash them dry them they never
like change lose their shape I've had
that turtleneck for like four years and
it is holding up strong why don't you
change the name of the lookbook to
online magazine I was confused this
entire time totally it's changed
Magazine it is here's so right look book
is so confusing and it is actually not a
lookbook at all you know magazine it's
no vogue at all but it's pretty great
that's just me though all you do lately
is stuffing your face with food and
mentioning vegan every five seconds I
miss the old vlogmas where you share
your day to day life or preparing
outfits for shooting and going to the
gym girl it's only day three wait she
posted this two days ago that was only
day one stuffing my face was rude I do
like to stuff my face you guys managed
to stay fit and build muscle when you
follow a vegan diet do you just take a
lot of protein shakes and such Oh
someone answered you'd be surprised how
much protein is in regular plant foods
like whole grains quinoa rice beans
lentils nuts
oatmeal yeah that's so true um Nikki
thank you for answering that that's I
love it when you guys answer comments to
each other it's really nice there's
surprisingly a lot of protein in all of
those things that she mentioned but I do
have a protein shake at least once a day
and I always put like spinach fruits
nuts like chia seeds black seeds so I
try to make a really powerful smoothie
at least once a day
any clothes on Poshmark um I used you
but I have been donating everything now
they put in my building they put in a
donation bin and so it's just I usually
just go and dump everything now there
have been a couple like I have a couple
of things in my closet right now I have
to Alison olivia dresses brand new with
the tags still on them that I've never
worn that I think that I would probably
list or just give to anybody who wants
them who maybe has like an office job or
something like that
oh yeah some lady said that she
unsubscribed because we were talking
about Stella's fart in the last vlog and
she she called me trashy and and said
she had subscribed I was like Bailey day
to vlogmas and I'm already getting in
trouble losing subscribers and I'm
pretty sure that Ryan's one that said
that Ryan got me in trouble oh and thank
you guys for telling me about the tart
shape tape remember I told you that I
literally couldn't find it anywhere
that is because everyone told me that is
it exclusive to Ulta but I'm loving my
milk makeup concealer it's very
comparable to Tarte but thanks for
telling me I would have had no idea I
thought they discontinued it cuz we
don't have old tests here in New York we
only have Sephora so um that's as far as
I can get tonight my throat's starting
to hurt so I'm gonna go work on this
January lookbook and watch Christmas
movies elf just came on one of my
favorites
Santa I know him thanks for bearing with
me through this super chatty not doing
so much sitting down day of vlogmas and
tomorrow I'm gonna plug in my calendar
some cool things for for myself for me
to do during vlogmas so if you have any
ideas things that you would like to see
like challenges or showing you different
things in my closet this is definitely
gonna be more of a fashion geared
vlogmas rather than a christmas vlogmas
but just roll with it if you're looking
for a Christmas Eve hugglemas you might
not want to watch mine you know if you
like the little um answering comments at
the end of the video I would really like
to start doing that if that's something
that you guys want to see just because
it's kind of hard to
through an answer everything by typing
and a lot of the questions are the same
so I thought why not just answer them
all here so yeah let me know those two
things that rely on you guys for
everything I will see you guys
manana I'm gonna go to bed 7:20 sounds
oh wait Vanderpump rules comes on
tonight I am NOT going to bed I have to
stay up and wait we got this we got this
bye guys see you tomorrow
