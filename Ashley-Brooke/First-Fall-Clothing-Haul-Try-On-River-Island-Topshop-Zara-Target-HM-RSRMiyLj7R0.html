today I have another haul for you I've
just been accumulating some things for
fall and I'm really excited to share
with you so I decided to film another
one so we'll go ahead and get started
with River Island so River Island is one
of my favorite places to buy little like
earring sets like this because I like to
I have two holes in each year and I'd
like to layer them on top of each other
big balls and in the little balls like
to mix my balls together next remember
island is a bailing float and this is
more of a fall bathing suit does that
make sense
yeah it's like a mafia really really
pretty color and as soon as I put it on
my instant story people were like oh my
god I love that color where did you get
it so river island love the bottoms they
are high-waisted kind of like a high leg
bottom and then the back goes to like a
little point it's really really cute I
will not be drawing this on
that's from River Island is this really
cool patchwork denim jean and you know I
love to do just like a basic t-shirt
some loafers and a really cool detailed
pair of jeans though these were really
really perfect and I was really happy to
find these I have three items from
Topshop and the first one is this green
and blue pink colored dress and it's
actually got cutout size with a ruffle
and then a ruffle down the sleeve it's a
little the ruffles are kind of crazy
right now because it needs to be steamed
it was wadded up in a bag of the links
and I love the cutout I think it's
really pretty for fall next is an
overall midi dress and I really love
layering like flowy sweaters and flowy
sleeve tops underneath this because the
stuffs been a little bit more snug so I
think a really cool pair of edgy booties
and like a really white flowy blouse
flowy sleeve blouse underneath it's a
really cool outfit if you wanted to do
just like a banty and some sneakers even
I think this is a really cool X is one
of my most favorite things that is this
really soft floral print flowy top
has these gold grommets on the front of
the arm and on the back so you know
you're not getting like those tops
that's like printed on the front and Zul
on the back print carries over the
grommets carry over so I think this is
giving me like Zimmermann vibes I really
really love this so next is some H&amp;amp;M
stuff and this was an online purchase so
I was like surprised amazing when
everything fit i was really excited this
top it's got a built-in like bustier and
it's this really pretty houndstooth
neutral colored burgundy and black print
again carries over to the back just
warning it runs pretty snug I got a size
of four and this part is it's fitted the
sleeve is the balloon sleep it's very
flowy but the boobies and the tummy is
it X is this basic sheer black balloon
sleeve top although I think this is just
kind of perfect with anything if you
wanted to even do like denim shorts and
booties layer it under something wear it
with jeans and like a bigger boy hat I
think this is just a really good top
that I'm gonna be go to grab quite often
so this sweatshirt because what's the
sweatshirt I love this it's got actual
embroidery this Tiger he's cute on the
back it's got his tail and some flowers
and then some flowers over here but I
think this is cute under overalls or
with some jeans and some sneakers kind
of casual you know weird around the
house but also kind of make it an outfit
situation during the daytime just a
dress that I did not need but really
really wanted because I love red and
black so much and I just thought that
this was so beautiful so the sleeves and
the skirt is actually pleated everything
is pretty much pleated except for the
torso but I think it's really cool flowy
sleeve the print is beautiful I
absolutely that's the back I've been
showing you sorry about that
oh cool and I mean you'll have to just
see what it looks like on because it's
kind of hard to sew and I'm just holding
it up but I love it X I don't
why I'm showing you this but I went to
Target and I got a new makeup and like
travel case so I thought that was kind
of a big deal is this one from a
burgundy it looks kind of red in the
camera but it's burgundy with these teal
tassels and then I also got the makeup
case too
so got a little scent here play mine
that means you're growing up right it's
really cool it's got like it's like a
book of slip sleeves and cases and pouch
it's limited edition to it so let you
know it's our favourite Zara got I got
two bottoms that I need to get taken in
in the waist chef-y and he went out
there who has a small waist maybe order
with caution know when you might have to
get it taken it is this embroidered
Aladdin magic carpet skirt it's so
pretty
it's cheer embroidery it's got this
really pretty gold and red with blue
tassels on the bottom I love this it's
got these pants and these were actually
like very free people looking but with
Zara price which was great it's this
really pretty soft denim almost like
cotton II but cool eye with this
embroidered pattern on the front and on
the back of the waist so these were cool
I like didn't even try these on I just
bought them and of course they're a
little big but definitely worth getting
taken in to this dress and it's like a
flutter sleeve really pretty soft floral
black dress the ties around the neck
I love tops the tie around the neck I
just think think it makes makes you look
a king shape make shit-shit more like
trendy you know when you've got like a
high neck and I don't know it just gives
you kind of an element of surprise with
a dress so I really really love this
this is a bomber jacket because I need
more bombers black with this a really
cool textured sleeve and I just tried
this on with like denim shorts and a
tank top I think I was boring and I even
like too
with that so I know this will be a good
grab and go for fall when I'm eating
some texture some dimension to my outfit
I think this is a really cool piece to
have I feel like I just sat down to film
this and now I'm done but um yeah so
that is it for this haul definitely more
