wash the coconut oil out of my hair but
I don't think I got it all out because
it's really greasy it's okay though
trial and error um I'll wash it out
tonight or sometime today I put a little
bit of my self-tanner on what have you
guys been asking what self-tanner I use
so first I put my Valenti appear glow
brightening moisturizer kind of soften
on my skin me like makes my skin pretty
much come back to life after I've been
sleeping and I put my San Tropez
self-tanner on and I put it mostly like
on my chest and on my shoulders and my
neck and then the rest I rub on my face
so that way I don't have a super dark
face I'm letting my skin breathe today
it's going to be a no makeup kind of day
because I feel like I've been piling it
on for the past three or four days so I
can film like breaking out a little bit
so I need it I just went to the gym to
get his like full workout in and I
pretty much just have a busy day of
editing planning out what my weekend is
going to look like so I'm definitely
gonna have to work through the weekend
because we're leaving Sunday morning I'm
gonna try to shoot a kind of like my
healthy hair routine because I haven't
really shot like a shampoo condition our
kind of product video so I really want
to shoot that tomorrow before I leave
I'm laughing so hard because you guys
are sending me snapchat clips of my blog
when I have serious rvv flare-ups and I
please keep them coming because
sometimes I don't know when it's
happening I am so annoyed that I didn't
wash out all my oil castor oil is much
thicker than coconut oil so I think
that's why I thought that one shampoo
was enough yeah I'm going to try to
shampoo it twice next time we got
cinnamon a raisin toast with a little
bit of unsalted butter
peanut-butter trying to shoot a halt
tomorrow before I leave so I'm going to
get some of my recent purchases and lay
them out that way everything is nice and
organized for me whenever I'm getting
ready to shoot now that that is done I'm
going to work on this hi mirror thing
until ryan gets back see if I can figure
it out so I can figure it out
against what we are having for dinner
tonight bone broth so excited
Ryan's going to be gone though so Ryan
doesn't get to eat dinner with us
tonight it's just you and me
sorely mistaken ma'am I'm going to eat
when I call oh you are you're not gonna
go out meat or doing happy hour with
oysters happy our oysters come bearing
gifts you come bearing gifts pears right
there
once you see gender stop it right now
holy guacamole did you find this our
local grocer but I thought our grocery
store stopped selling it he got it back
what just when we were starting to down
the sunna organic banana getting mashed
up is craving like a banana peanut
butter snack so he's letting me fear
because he's going to advertising when
you break it open
you did this it's like maybe there you
go your mushy banana in Bowl you know it
would be so good if we put the peanut
butter and banana mix like in the fridge
to let it get cold mm-hmm good let me
think of a new snack you need to scan it
live some my fitness app
239 calories we're doing we're in the
car thanks grams of protein love your
life some speaking of a life some I'm
almost done with my video that shows
like exactly how to use it so look we're
excited so what's going on
thank you ready to go friends leaving us
Ryan do this happy overtime Ryan's going
to happy hour with this friend Peter and
I'm kind of jealous but I'm also kind of
not because it's so cold outside
well you're gone I'm gonna go to the gym
I'm gonna go kind of early so I beat the
after-work crowd well for sure when you
leave I need to turn off paranormal
lockdown so I don't get scared yeah I
don't know why this is been on for so
long I'm not watching it it's just on
heading out are you gonna be warming up
I feel like you should zip up your coat
or something oh well I can't take away
the effect of the idea of sweater oh wow
how can anyone else so I'd see that I'm
wheeling me that's a great sweater Wow
that was it though what that love you
bye all right
dad's gone what are we gonna do as much
as I just want to sit here and eat junk
food and watch reality TV I'm going to
put my gym clothes on go to the gym come
back make dinner for us you and I then
I'm going to get all snuggly on the
couch and put a movie on the obviously
work because I can't just sit here and
not work I would feel weird go to the
gym ready go got my resting gym face
tank top hot pink sweater sweatshirt
these cutout leggings from forever 21
my own bra is
going out right now
yeah
my gosh I am deaf whoo I'm gonna paste
Oh Thor tomorrow and I put the heater on
before I left
ha oh my god this feels so good oh my
gosh it's so cold outside for Ryan had
to walk all wheels of way I'm going to
shower because I am quite sweaty I'm
going to ripping gonna make dinner I'm
gonna do my nails watch a movie work
let's go all right I feel like there is
no questioning my comfort level right
now I mean this is just ridiculous
Friday night oh yeah
wait
so I cooked the bone broth um I added a
little salt and pepper and a little red
pepper flakes and I squeezed half of a
lemon in there and then just kind of
threw it in and then in the other pan I
sauteed potatoes kale and then added
some cooked sausage that I cooked in the
oven then I just kind of mixed it all
together I know a lot of people they
actually just drink bone broth like
maybe for breakfast or for lunch kind of
out of a mug but this is kind of another
take on you could do like a hearty bone
broth I guess like an actual dinner
recipe there's really no flavor to the
bone broth so you know you want to add
lemon or some type of seasoning just to
kind of season it up a little bit maybe
some ginger then I'm going to watch
pretty in pink
because I am such a sucker for 80s
movies like I love them so much so I'm
going to watch pretty in pink eat my
soup just relax I don't know if I
mentioned before but the sausage is
turkey sausage I have been watching
neighbors too painted my nails and just
like relaxing on the couch with all the
lights out who just walked in the door
hello
want to welcome to you to Friday night
Ryan comes in goats jump straight on top
of me to get under my blanket because
it's so cold outside to get straight
into his comfy pants and needs food
what's your favorite part of the bone
broth soup I'm really not sure yet like
it's just a bunch of flavors in my mouth
that I like Ryan's not even done with
dinner yet he's like when are we gonna
make
halo top look need to be on the same
page okay all right so are we starting
over neighbors - so you can watch it yo
should have known that was gonna happen
I rent a movie try to have some alone
time

fashionable old rubber band Y to put
around it I thought it has to be
magnetic but I like do it send it back
