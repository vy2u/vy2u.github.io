my origins matte moisturizer and as
always I don't think my foundation game
has changed and while but I'm gonna mix
my two dermablend my cream and my camel
tan from the summer fading so I like I
like to do two different colors because
then I can kind of mix and create my own
color and kind of like match it to my
skin right now I'm using my Sigma f80
brush my favorite foundation brush to
buff it out or buff it in buff it out or
Buffett it r is it new it I don't know a
little bit lights I'm gonna be using my
bronzing powder so I think that'll kind
of make it blend in a little bit more
with my body and my neck
now if you guys like who all here's is
this it's probably my like go to every
time I open it it just spills everywhere
so I really have to wear like a towel
over my lap when I immediately put this
on otherwise my creases will start to
eat my makeup now I'm going to contour
and he used my hoola bronzing stick
rather than my powder I might go over it
with my powder but I am gonna use this
for right now
I just made that one up I don't even
know that's where that goes today though
yeah I feel like that service nope I'm
sure all of you like makeup people out
there watching me like palm in face you
really do try sorry that my makeup
routine literally never changes and you
guys have to see the same thing over and
over and over but at least you know I
swear by these products because it's all
I use now I'm gonna do a little bit of
blush using tarts sensual blush I love
this color I think it's a good all
year-round color it works for spring and
for fall and it's subtle enough to where
it's um kind of you know hardly even
noticeable it just gives you like a
little bit of color
so now I feel a little bit better about
my the color matching my neck I feel
like that definitely looks Fatah always
using my Tarte Amazonian eyebrow clay
swear by it I love it and using it a
very long time to have the little brush
that it goes with Mac also makes a
really good eyebrow brush it's a little
bit thinner I would say than this one so
it kind of helps you like draw a little
bit more but this one's good for filling
in because it's a little thicker
for my eyeshadow tart actually sent me
their new shadow palette and I'm really
excited it comes out 10 15 what it looks
like it's really really really pretty
gorgeous I really like this rose gold
kind of a pinky color right here I don't
think that's the right brush cool and
I'm gonna go over it with this color
called a sunset
I'm gonna take this color called cozy
and I'm just gonna go underneath my eyes
blame and I'm just gonna line the kind
of like the corners of my eyes as well
as the top cool ooh I like it yeah I'm
just gonna kind of blend it in do the
color candle and I'm just gonna go over
my eyelid it's gonna do underneath my
brow
just do an eyeshadow tutorial now for
mascara because I feel like no I shot it
was complete unless you have mascara on
to be a really careful with my left eye
because was having this really dry skin
problem um under my eyes and kind of on
my eyelids so I put this skin oil all
over my eyes and I woke up the other
morning with the biggest eye two of them
actually on top of like on my top lids
if you guys who have had stars before
know how bad they hurt it was supposed
to film a video for Nordstrom and I felt
so bad I was like guys we're gonna have
to push the deadline back because I
cannot even open my eye today and it was
just so painful and it looked disgusting
I read online to put a warm washcloth on
it so I had that all day but it hurts so
bad every time I bent over it was just
throbbing I'm trying not to wear makeup
the past few days no clue what I'm gonna
wear I feel like when I go to concerts
I'd like to just be super casual I'm not
one to dress fancy bronzer I don't know
I think anybody is but just Becca this
highlighter I always try to wear it all
the time and I end up seeing pictures of
myself and I end up feeling like my face
looks wet I don't know what it is I
think it's just me because it looks
great on other people so I like to put
it on my eyelid but I have discovered a
dewy stick and I have just figured out
that this is the best thing for me it
gives me a dewy look without looking
like my faces this is the final makeup
look - the lipstick I like to completely
get my like clothes on and everything I
do my lipstick last to kind of match the
tone of the shade to my outfit I'm gonna
fix my hair I'm probably just gonna kind
of leave it as is
I might add a little bit of curl and a
little bit of texture spray that's
pretty much it I don't really want to do
much to it somebody go get my tools and
it started it's not my frizzier pieces
and I'm just gonna kind of go through
them with a curling iron I mean a wand
and I'm just gonna make them a little
bit wavy not so curly just more waves
and I'm not gonna bring it all the way
to the end you want more of like a
natural curl also trying not to put heat
on my hair I'm really trying to take it
easy and let my hair kind of go natural
so I'm getting just breakage around my
face it's just not a good look
so I'm trying to lay off the heat for a
while especially since it's getting
colder and the air is a little bit drier
and kind of just like as
where we being kind of a lot of work so
we're gonna just kind of do the same
thing just make sure that all of all of
my waves and my curls are kind of even
do you like a natural messy wavy
ponytail as well I think that's one of
my favorite hairstyles just because it's
so easy and it's great for when your
hair is a little bit on the dirty side
you don't have time to wash I think like
a slicked back messy ponytail is the way
to keep it off to the side like this for
most of the night just because it's kind
of like the look that I'm going for but
just to make sure it sticks I'm gonna
use these two items are new so I'm
really excited I've used this and I love
it but this is my first time using this
so I'm just gonna run that through well
case you are wondering if it works there
you go you see flex shaping hairspray
and like I said I haven't used this what
I like about it is that it doesn't give
me the crunchiness of a hairspray I
spray it on and I don't even feel it but
it's effective and it does what a
hairspray would do so I really love this
see your hair can still move and the
curls can move alright so now that
that's done let's go pick out an outfit
so I definitely want to do jeans and a
top the question is what genes and what
top so I'm either gonna do like a cool
pair of jeans and just like a basic
t-shirt and tank top maybe with like a
denim jacket over my shoulders so this
is really cute from urban it's just kind
of a batwing cropped the only thing is
it's really like I would need to pin it
right here cuz boobies will fly or I
just like this kind of oversized
military jacket from Free People with
the tank and jeans and booties so we'll
see this is where we're gonna start so I
think I finally decided what to wear
potential reor anything yet but I might
not actually I might do some hoops but
that's probably gonna be it so for my
lipstick I'm doing a Maybelline
touchable taupe that's what we decide to
go with I've got on this bodysuit from
Zara this kind of like a green and navy
tie-dye jacket from Free People it's got
little wakes waters on it my snap jeans
from Topshop sock booties from Alice and
Olivia and then a little fun bag
by Chloe's for lunch
laughing it is the own joke I think this
is one of my favorite pages of a jogger
is Bruce you're sitting here working on
the lookbook it goes out in how many
days - it goes out in two</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
