serves as a really good primer because
it's very moisturizing so I usually put
my moisturizer my eye cream and excuse

for like my perfect skincare regimen
which you know I feel like sometimes it
just takes years to find something
that's good for your skin I've got two
new makeup brushes from Sephora and the
others day that I am about to use I
normally just use Sigma brushes trying
out these Sephora brand so I got the
pressed full coverage complexion brush

that we would let the season kind of
build up for like I don't know six seven
episodes so all of you guys who watch
shameless how is the season so far
compare it to like all the other seasons
wow I really really loved what that
means brushes like a lot this one
especially so I posted today's or I
guess it for you guys watching now I
posted yesterday's vlog missed a little
later than usual because I don't know
there was something about like Saturday
morning waking up and they're just
things snow everywhere I was like note
back to bed it just felt like it needed
to be that way oh sorry for that late
upload but we still got it and then I
uploaded it and then I got a copyright
claim so then I had to like fix that it
doesn't happen to me very often but when
it does it's like you have to go back
and like re-edit
and then re-export and then re-upload so
a little annoying
alright I've turned the camera off to do
my eyebrows because I really got to
concentrate and I'm probably still gonna
do them wrong time for lips and I have a
really important question wait where is
it I found this lip liner in my my
makeup drawer and I had a question about
this NYX lip liner and it's obviously
dead but here's the thing you can't
sharpen this this is plastic and it
doesn't twist up so like how do you get
more to come out say something so simple
I've tried everything
tell me because it's like really love
this color what are you eating lips I
did in white X in the color pale pink
and then I did start light start like
salt life by Tarte I just need to go do
a little stuff into my hair I don't know
what I'm gonna do but I'm not gonna do
too much because of the snow it's just
gonna get wet and crazy so
though we're gonna go to test the lender
horseshoe
here's groans right so close is coming
down yeah I don't think so yeah it's hot
girl all right
my hair is like oh that's what snow to
us what you go eras so sweet

so avid plosser any tips tricks how do
you deal with flossing and inclement
weather
well you how do you do a flossing when
you're sick how do you deal with
flossing witnessed traffic push through
don't include tripping I feel like it's
strawberry that is so cute I can't wait
to try this Tara hey thanks
good catch okay so since we're obviously
not going to shoot today I'm gonna make
lunch I'm gonna work a little bit and
then I guess we're gonna get ready and
we're gonna go meet his parents wherever
they are gonna meet up with them but I
don't know what I'm hungry for I think I
want bacon bacon and avocado and
provolone like grilled sandwich all
right my sandwich is done and this is
what it looks like this is a regular old
sandwich so I use an avocado and I use
this follow your heart vegenaise
mayonnaise and it's soy free and then
the bread that I always use like all the
time is this who makes this Eureka and I
like the speeds of the day because I
like a really C bread and then for my
cheese I do be a follow your heart
provolone I really love the Gouda but
this is my first time trying to
provolone they were out of the Gouda
then for the bacon I used
the smoky tempeh lightlife bacon bacon
and they also made just regular tempeh
but this like legit tastes like bacon
it's crazy it even burned saying it's
crispy like bacon in my opinion the best
bacon is this brand right here at the
sweet earth this kind it's been also add
I don't like tomato but um you could add
tomato and make it like a BLT with like
avocado so this is like the best
sandwich ever I go to the vegan what's
this uh being in restaurant cold all we
always go to I can remember but I always
pay like fifteen dollars to get the
stupid sandwich and I can make it at
home so I stopped to get again so making
it at home I'm gonna go eat my lunch
watch fixer-upper and work on the
lookbook a little bit I think Ryan's
parents are on their way here to the
apartment so we'll probably decide what
we're gonna do with the rest of the day

snowing so hard so I don't know I don't
know how they put lettuce on it I don't
know if I said that or not but hi guys

nolan ryan doesn't seem happy yo right
you happy you're right he's not happy
guys let me just tell you something
about my really quick Ryan is not one to
like jump around and like be smiley and
just ever since I've known him he's just
kind of serious and just because he's
not like laughing and giggling and
smiling all the time doesn't mean he's
not happy good question for you guys who
walks faster you are Ryan oh my god me
100% 100%
true true is your gray sweater from the
gray sweater is from Zara did I not tell
you guys where my outfit was from mr. de
grâce water was Zara faux leather
leggings are from H&amp;amp;M I've had them for
three or four years now no since we
lived in San Antonio I've happened yeah
for like four or five years they are the
best things ever ever
and they make them every year so I'll
link them below stylin already no I
haven't done it in a video it's actually
fairly new where's your great jacket
from also Zara you talk to yourself it
made me wonder if you have your ever
catch yourself talking to us when the
camera isn't on I've always been one to
like talk to myself like I talked myself
through things it just helps and I do it
in public too unfortunately I catch
myself where is the animal print round
bag you held up for a second I believe
that's from anthropology as well so I
will link that also need to do a handbag
collection oh that could be a good thing
for blood mist yeah I might do that
everyone sides got the song by City High
stuck in their head sorry and now it's
stuck in my head everyone wants to know
how I keep my white couch clean because
it never looks dirty so I learned this
when I worked at Michael Kors when I was
in college and worked at Michael Kors we
would recommend everybody to spray
Scotchgard I know some people are gonna
be like chemicals but I spray it on my
white chairs my rugs my couch my shoes
my bags and it protects against anything
any sort of stain and if something does
get on the couch it's super easy to get
off I've just used spray OxiClean and
OxiClean gets anything out of anything I
swear it's the best thing ever so that
which is crazy because we sometimes like
will eat on the couch or if we have a
movie to watch
we're very spontaneous with our couch we
drink wine like red wine on the couch I
know we are really living on on the wild
side are your pearl boots from Steve
Madden as a vegan do you wear leather
shoes or bags so yeah someone commented
I don't think they're vegan as in the
lifestyle just plant-based diet yeah so
you know I've never said before and I'm
gonna be really embarrassed if I have
said it but I would never say I'm not a
vegan I would never say that and I only
for those of you who are probably asking
why I just don't feel comfortable using
that term
knowing that with the life by her
lookbook and with as much as I shot for
YouTube videos I do support and give my
money to stores that make leather bags
just you know it's a personal thing and
I don't want it to even be like a
confrontation or a discussion obviously
you're you give your opinion whatever
but I don't want it to be like a thing
like it's just a personal decision that
I've made to not say that I am vegan I
just don't feel comfortable saying it on
my Instagram they were like you call
yourself vegan yet you buy a real
Christmas tree which result it's like
doesn't even make sense but I'm just
saying I've never called myself a vegan
Thank You vegan so yeah you know what
you're getting enough oxygen in the
world I want to you know I just don't
want I don't want any like trouble with
that comment or anything I just don't
feel comfortable that and it's a
personal choice and it's fine like you
know it's it's okay just I do not eat
meat dairy animal by-products so there
you run your heater though everyone see
everyone's asking the same questions
about my outfit see this is why this
comment is section is a great idea which
uncle Eddie's cookies are the best thing
about our chocolate chip traveling to
NYC for Christmas and New Year's you
have any coat and boot recommendations
oh my gosh like just the warmest
puffiest thing that you can find I mean
just with like a built-in heater never
mind how you look you know you want warm
shoes that are comfortable in a warm
coat that's comfortable like don't put
your cute outfit underneath by like an
oversized puffer coat and put the
cuteness under it I live my life in
January how much protein do you consume
on a vegan diet I know you only need
like 40 and all plant have protein just
curious how many macros you need for a
vegan diet that all depends on your body
I mean everyone needs different macros I
would recommend seeing a nutritionist or
there might be somewhere online you can
go to
kind of get estimated idea but
everyone's different the gym and sauna
in your building so amazing it is in my
building but it's the gym that I go to
so anybody it's just like a regular gym
so like anybody can have a membership to
the gym and come and use it and someone
taught me where I can get my hands on a

cat looking for small we put anything on
your brows at night to make them grow
thicker hood sometimes like twice a week
I'll get a little spoolie and I'll put
castor oil on and I've read that if you
do it on your eyelashes it'll make them
thicker also but I just put them on my
brows
