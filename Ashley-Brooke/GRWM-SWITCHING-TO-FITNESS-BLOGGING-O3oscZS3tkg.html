five good morning so today I'm headed to
a kids event and Jenna's actually gonna
go with me Ryan was gonna go with me
until he realized that they were giving
tennis lessons and he was like I think
I'll sit this one out
you don't want tennis lessons right it
hurts
tonight Ryan they're going to our friend
marks birthday party at this place
clogged bathtub gin it's a really cool
place kind of close to our apartment
actually but there's like this huge gold
bathtub in the middle of the place it's
cool so I'll take you guys along and
show you that but I am going to start
getting ready for this event because I
think we have to leave in like an hour
or so but I'll chat with you guys so
I'll put my makeup on make up time we
have a friend so remember we got this
marble table and like nothing was
allowed on it and now it's just like
wrecked it is really hard keeping up
with the marble table no one told us up
I feel like it's kind of
self-explanatory all right so first I'm
going to heavily moisturize my face Oh
No
womp womp does anybody know of a good
brand of rose hip oil I got on Amazon
get some the other day and there were
just so many brands that I was like ex
you guys have any recommendations of
like 100% rosehip oil so the first thing
I'm gonna put on today is the
colorscience total I three and one
renewal therapy and you guys were asking
what this was in my last vlog that were
actually partnered up with him again
just because I was so impressed with
their first product did this out for
like a month and I was really impressed
with this also so I really wanted to
share with you guys it's the total I
three and one renewal therapy with SPF
30 in it you always want to protect ease
skin around your eyes so thin and so
sensitive correct dark circles with this
peachy tone randomly get them I don't
know why I could have the best night's
sleep and I will wake up with dark
circles not even under knee that's like
my top eyelids get dark too just in case
you just have a really rough night's
sleep and your eyes are a little puffy
this is a cooling applicator you can see
it also treats long-term my concerns
like fine lines wrinkles puffiness dark
circles etc so that's always really good
when you're treating and covering at the
same time and I actually put this on
before my foundation just to cover up my
dark circles if that works best for me I
don't know I'm sure everyone's different
and how they like to put things on an
order but moving on I'm going to use my
dermablend in camel I'm gonna mix my
giorgio armani luminous silk foundation
the dermablend is really heavy and this
is really light so it's a good balance
it's a good kind of mixture of heavy and
silky Giorgio Armani I probably won't
purchase again this is just my opinion
but I heard the best things about the
Giorgio Armani
Foundation but it's not like to me it
just wasn't worth it I feel like I have
other foundations that I like a lot
better she's doing you fine
oh I think her rope it's like wrapped up
in the blanket she can't get to it you
got it all is right
I think good things about that found the
Giorgio Armani foundation is that it not
just my skin tone really well alright
just said he wants to read the comments
out loud while I'm doing my makeup for
myself are they good or bad I'm scared
you have awful fashion sense you look
like you're trying way too hard that's
the only comment you got for me I just
can't get over your hot doorman
concierge whoa Marlon arlynn is hot
Brian is a sweetie bear all right not
every day that you get a nice comment
screenshot folder but maybe he was
bitten by a spider actually went oh my
god I was a bitten by a spider what
video is that on Oh block 36 well good

think about it so now I'm like kind of
freezing I was just filming my mouth
since the day when I was bad
the end of the day and we were getting
ready to go to bathtub gin for Mark's
birthday but there's more than like 20
people going and about subject doesn't
accommodate that many people so we are
going to Mark's apartment and just like
hang out I'm gonna bring the camera in a
blog just cuz we're going to somebody's
apartment as weird but um I'll see you
guys either at marks or whenever we go
back leaving the apartment just now and
I always like like here like you know
I'm just trying to be like casual or to
somebody's house music yeah my casual ho
like so serious and so calm I was like
what it's a term of endearment in some
countries
anyways we're going to the liquor store
because I told Ryan it's like proper
etiquette to bring somebody a gift when
they're hosting at their house and he's
acting like he didn't know this I'm like
what did you do before you met me and
you went over to people's houses you
just like came empty handed and he was
like yeah that strike a pose this is
completely sober by the way I did not
have anything to drink should one drink
I did not have a drink I had too much
lipstick I had two sips of wine I think
we're gonna turn in for the night
that's correct yeah you do that bro hey

because we worked all day yesterday
so yesterday felt like a Friday
yesterday we filmed for most of the day
and I edited for the other half of the
day no we did you know we watched last
night we watched a movie called Veronica
on Netflix and people were saying it was
supposed to be so scary that people were
like having to turn it off and they
couldn't finish watching it and I don't
know I felt like it wasn't that scary no
and I get scared like I love scary
movies and I get scared pretty easily
but I only close my eyes like once on
that one I didn't feel like I needed to
turn it off but oh and I was on Spanish
so there were subtitles and I don't have
glasses but I can't see very well so I
was like this who movie trying to read
the thing so I don't know I go finish
