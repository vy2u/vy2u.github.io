bowl
oh here we go
you can always do I'm not that hungry
because I ate so much for dinner but you

coconut flakes pretty much whatever you
want but this is really delicious and
pretty much been having it every night
lots of protein YUM hey guys just got
back from the gym Monday morning it is
9:00 a.m. I went to the gym about 7:00
came home died a little bit because I
was so nauseous I did this circuit
workout oh my gosh I didn't take the
camera with me because I just feel my
workout so I was like I don't mean I can
double workout how so sick but it was
good I was sweating it was a good
workout so now that I have I'm like not
as nauseous anymore I'm gonna make a
protein Bowl watching Kelly and Ryan
while I was checking some emails I love
Kelly and Ryan one time I saw Kelly and
her husband on the street in Soho and I
got nervous man I didn't say hi I'm so
mad at myself just made on my bowl it's
fill to the top this is a lot of
smoothie but this is not for doggies for
sure where's your bro look at your prom
you have people through I love you know
what today I am filming I couldn't talk
long you know hey I am filming my
favorite hairstyles for fall I'm gonna
try to do like seven or eight partnered
up with living proof which is one of my
favorite brands I'm gonna finish up my
bowl go shower get ready for the day
start filming and then I'm gonna back to
you guys later really quick before I go
my battery's about to die I'm looking
for some new high-waisted black gym
leggings and I've been looking at Jim
shark like them but I was just wondering
if you guys have any other suggestions
Annalee high-waisted definitely black
where other colors would be great so you
had probably order
colors everything like that but if you
guys have any suggestions let me know he
really gonna go this time see you a
little bit I'm done filming anything for
the day
hey haven't even had a chance work on
the light bear look book so it's like
it's minor panic mode but I have talked
to Ryan into going to Best Buy because
my eyes are gonna think I'm crazy and it
just goes against everything I've ever
said but I have been like in college I
used to love Mario Cart so much so I've
talked Ryan into going to Best Buy with
me so I can get a Wii so I can play
Mario Kart used to be so addicted to the
Sims and Mario Kart and miranne was like
okay you can't do both because like all
of your time is gonna go and I was like
fine so I picked Mario Kart so excited I
feel like a kid yo girl have you been
being crazy all day because I think you
maybe have we were being crazy all day
really quick so in my last vlog I know I
was talking about how I was sorry that
my content hasn't been as the good my
fashion related videos just haven't
really been there and that I was sorry
and I cannot tell you how many messages
I got just how many like amazing
comments just easing my mind on the
worries that I had with that and I just
want to say that I wasn't posting like I
wasn't telling you guys I was sorry and
I wasn't talking about it you know for a
pat on the back or a no no you're doing
so good I really appreciate it but I was
genuinely being honest and you know I
know and my content is slacking and it
was definitely slacking but hey just
wanted to say that I really appreciate
all of the support and all of the
positive comments because just YouTube
can get very negative and very hurtful
and really just the Internet
so everyone who's just positive you're
special and you know it takes a it takes
more effort to comment something
positive and it does something negative
if that makes sense
I feel like negativity you know when
you're hiding behind a computer in an
anonymous username it's so easy to write
something so hurtful and remain
anonymous
but for those of you guys who are so
positive and it just makes makes my day
and I know it makes other people's day
also just reading positivity because it
spreads but lucky for me there's more
positivity on my channel then there is
negativity so you just want to thank you
guys should have checked the weather
thank you
you happy there's the festive dance so
excited I'm gonna stay up till 6 a.m.
like college and play who am i right
leaving bus fired just not the good
we are going to Whole Foods right now to
get some be on me for tonight for dinner
and I'm getting a bark

turnovers

leftover soup from last night it is
veggie broth carrots chickpeas potatoes
kale and then we just top it off with
some beyond me crumbles you kind of
little like beef stew effect for this
because it's so chilly outside and I
love having soup when it's cold
I love making big pops of soup because
they last for like three days
okay its Nintendo time I don't remember
if I told you guys we got a Wii but
apparently they don't make wheeze
anymore so we got a Nintendo switch
whatever that means going down you got
this
