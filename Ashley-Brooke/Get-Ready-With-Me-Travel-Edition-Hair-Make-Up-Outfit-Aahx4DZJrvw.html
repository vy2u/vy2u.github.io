Ryan and I this is our last full day in
Texas with my family and we are going to
dinner so I thought that I would fill my
hole get ready with me routine a really
quick addition because we only had an
hour so I'm gonna do my hair my makeup
and show you guys my outfit so let's go
ahead and get started so I'm going to
start with my Urban Decay complexion
primer hi outside and I will sweat all
of my makeup off the second that I walk
because I'm going to do my foundation
I'm using my dermablend smooth liquid
camo have the color camel and the color
cream because when I am even in the
summer my skin tone changes colors so
much so it's nice to have two colors
that I can blend together to kind of
match my own skin you're using BB cream
okay let's get o Emery's using BB cream
I'm going to use my Sigma f80 brush to
buff it all in okay I have a little
bigger how long's up in there for my
concealer I am using the Amazonian clay
by Tarte and it's waterproof so was
withstand all of my footing I'm going to
pick my beauty blender and blend it all
in
perfect
I do get creases under my eyes for my
concealer I'm going to use my dermablend
translucent powder and I'm just going to
let this sit there you go time to Braun
I'm going to use my hoola bronzer
I forgot mine at home
thank you so now I'll dust away my
dermablend my blush I'm going to use
tart sensual sensual and then blend
everything in I don't have any harsh
lines anywhere now time for the brows my
brows I am using tarts in medium brown
and the Becca ultimate coverage
concealer in creamy now I'm going to use
my Becca concealer to just kind of line
with this brush because sometimes I get
messy have this slit mm perfect
that's what you're using yes and not
using eyeshadow because I aren't really
a big a shadow person I'm going to click
an event or something I'll put on
eyeshadow but if I'm just going to
dinner or so for my lipstick I'm doing
color sensational lynxes even know I do
but I'll figure it out the color is plum
and I'm going to put salt life on bright
part like my goatee
for my mascara I am using gifted by
hearts my favorite my go-to actually a
brand new one I just so now that our
makeup is done how's your makeup so it
looks good
so are you did you start over no just
what would happen oh okay alright so now
that our makeups done I'm going to do my
hair I'm just going to straighten it
because that is the quickest route to
possibly go so go grab my straightener
all in my hair tools and I'll be back
alright so hard my hair I just
blow-dried it so it's still has some
puffy heat to it but I spray it always
with heat protectant so this is the heat
protectant I'm using today and I
actually already sprayed my hair but I
just like to let it dry for like 5 or 7
minutes because you're never supposed to
straightener foot Heat on while it's
still wet with this stuff especially
straight I'm just going to do it pretty
much in like inch sections very small
now that my makeup is done my hair is
straight I'm going to go find something
to wear okay
we going to do your hair quickly my
perfume I'm using my visual one of my
favorites right now alright so for my
outfit I'm doing this sheer dress from
forever 21 like this really pretty
embroidered floral dress
and underneath it I just have on a
random black slip dress but probably I
stole from one of my other dresses for
my shoes in my bag I just wanted to do
something a little bit more on the edgy
side because my dress is girly but it
also has some black in it so I thought
that I would bring out the block by
doing black and gold accessories for my
jewelry I just did my gold delicate
chain necklace and my suit
yeah all of the products will be in the
description box below and including the
outfit so stay tuned for the next vlog
it's going to be our final Texas blog
and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
