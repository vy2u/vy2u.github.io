today I am starting a new series about
office wear because I get so many
questions about office wear like what do
I wear how do I say stylish on a budget
so I thought I'd make a little
miniseries you know three to four videos
on Friday not like at a time but like
three to four videos like once on each
Friday so today's video is gonna be
super simple it is just some quick tips
and tricks that I were thrown together
on how to look stylish everyday at the
office and just feel a little bit more
confident in what you're wearing so grab
a pin write this down and let's get
into the video
oversized Blazers aren't in right now
the boyfriend look the kind of slouchy
look how do we wear this to the office
without actually looking at slouchy I'm
gonna take my trusty blazer that you
guys have seen a bajillion times but I
love it so I'm gonna use it as an
example two of my favorite tricks on
wearing an oversized blazer play either
either scrunch up your sleeves that way
you're showing a little bit of your arm
you can show up some of your arm jewelry
like your watch your bracelets your
rings and it just kind of makes it look
a little bit more tailored and a little
bit more laid back and cool the second
way to wear an oversized blazer is to
belt it what you want to do is just wear
some sort of solid basic top underneath
that you have like a little bit poking
out and I would just throw a belt on
over it and wear some trousers good to
go number two is to add some sort of
color or print so when you are getting
dressed in the morning and you've got
your cream top to wipe out that cream or
white top for some sort of print or pop
of color it's just a little bit more
eye-catching and you don't have to wear
this type of thing every single day I
think you should just mix it up a little
bit and wear some solids and then go for
a print or a bright color number three I
don't have anything to show you but if
you have a locker or a desk I always
used to keep a mini steamer and a lint
roller because sometimes if I was
running late or
like my jacket got buzzed all over me or
like I was sitting next to somebody on
the subway that has a shag coat on you
know we're all friends on the subway we
all touch arms get to work I would take
off my coat just have like all over
me and if you can keep a mini steamer
with you know when you go in the office
at 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. you have a three
o'clock meeting you've been sitting down
all day nothing is worse than those
giant wrinkles on the front of your
pants at cocktail hour after work you
have those wrinkles or the wrinkles on
your butt I think it's just good to kind
of go to the bathroom freshen up it will
make your outfit look completely
different once those wrinkles are out
there for when picking your shoe opt for
a pointy toe over a round toe a pointy
toe in my opinion just looks a little
bit cleaner and neater a little bit more
dressy a little bit more polished my
favorite style is something like this
looks a tiny little heel because I know
that I will stay comfortable throughout
the day and actually my arch on my foot
is so weird that I'm almost more
uncomfortable in a flat shoe than I am
when you are caring about to work leave
your slouchy crossbody bags at home and
swap it for something a little bit more
structured and a little bit more
professional-looking save save your
crossbody slouchy bugs for the weekend
and I think a nice structured bag looks
a little bit more put together and a
little bit more professional but I like
to do is put a little bitty crossbody
inside my tote that way if I'm just
running out to lunch or something I can
just grab the crossbody out of my bag
head out without having to carry my
giant tote around it comes the jewelry I
like to think that less is more you know
leave your big giant statement trendy
pieces for the weekend try to do
something a little bit more simple it
just looks a little bit more
professional it's not it's like eye
catching because I know we're all in at
the eye catching and we all look good
office is not the place where you want
to have a giant piece of jewelry to
catch people's eye you know you want to
keep your jewelry to a minimum something
a little bit more simple like a little
bar necklace or a necklace looks like a
little stone on it I think
perfect and just like their previous tip
makeup keep your makeup simple again you
don't want to stand out with your makeup
in the office though with a neutral
colored lip minimal eyeshadow blush
mascara and you should be good
it always likes to keep a small makeup
bag that I kept at work that had a
little highlighter and like a bold lip
for if I was going out with my
co-workers after work I could just run
to the bathroom freshen up a little bit
add some highlighter out of bold lip
head out the door
next I have it three swaps these are
just kind of three different swaps to
make your outfit a little bit more
trendy and fashion-forward
next time you throw on that black blazer
try swapping it out for a cool bummer
they do make bombers that are a better
work appropriate now I have some that
are not work appropriate like crazy
print just like all over the place and
like super fun I have some like this
that is actually perfect for the office
and who what where makes really great
bombers I feel like they make a really
great office wear in general so I picked
this up and I think this looks great
with a plain cream blouse and some black
trousers and it just gives you a
completely different outfit than just a
plain black blazer or what my next tip
is to swap your button-down a for a cool
sweater and I feel like this just kind
of gives you a more relaxed vibe it's
kind of cool it's great for a Friday you
know you're still dressed up with your
trousers and your really dressy shoes
the thing you cut like this cool chunky
sweater on maybe do your hair up in a
bun I think that looks a little bit more
professional when you are wearing such a
casual sweater but you know don't think
you can't wear chunky sweaters to work
this is like the perfect way to be
comfortable and dressed up for work at
the same time the next sock we're gonna
talk about trousers now I love my basic
black trousers but try swapping them out
for like a faux leather trouser or a
culotte or a wide leg pant I think it'll
give you a little bit variety in your
wardrobe and you can also wear those
three items on the weekends as well so
you're not just kind of tied to work you
know you're not wasting money on
something that you're only gonna be able
to wear to the office those are three
really fashion-forward pieces they're a
very trendy and they just go really well
with different kinds of blouses
even on the weekend for graphic tees
really freshen up any any office wear of
wardrobe next is your perfume
now perfume can really make a statement
and somebody's outfit I don't know about
you but I am a perfume person and I just
like don't feel like my outfit is
complete without a perfume so I think
having a signature scent at the office
whether you think so or not it can
really dress up your outfit I just know
that from working with other co-workers
who every time they come into work they
just smell amazing and it just makes me
happy being around them and I don't know
it's just like it's clean like very
put-together
type of thing when you have a great
perfume on at work don't overdo it
though don't get something that's so
strong that you're gonna like stress
everybody out just you know one little
squirt rub and you're good like to keep
a rollerball with me when I go somewhere
so like all of my daytime perfumes I
have little roller balls too that I just
throw in my makeup bag is hair you know
there are so many days where it's
nighttime or a morning time and I'm like
oh my god I have to wash my hair I don't
want to I would rather like read or have
another cup of coffee so what do you do
you put it in a little button my hair
gets dirty my ends get so stringy and
dry and it just does not look good like
the top is on point because the top has
dry shampoo but the bottom just looks
like a mess so do a slicked back low bun
and I think a low bun just looks so
polished and put together but it's
always like Thursday Friday when the low
bun happens like you know the weekends
coming because it's like all the girls
are like in the low buns but I think
that's just a really good way especially
if you're running late - it doesn't have
to be that your hair is dirty if you're
running late do a quick low bun pretty
easy to do and it stays all day and it
just looks so nice so those are my tips
and tricks I hope you guys like them and
