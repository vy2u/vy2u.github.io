wild card video I'm going to be doing a
DIY today I am all denim doubt today I
love it I'm wearing denim shorts not
picture you know I feel like a DIY video
is very light I just don't know what's
gonna happen like this could turn out so
terrible just never know so I kind of
like the thrill of a DIY video I'm going
to be doing a uneven hem in this DIY
super excited about it because I have
been looking for a good uneven hem denim
for quite some time now and it's either
too expensive or they just don't fit me
well so I decided I'm just gonna do it
myself
so I found these amazing jeans from H&amp;amp;M
they are a straight leg so they're
actually high-waisted obsessed they have
the perfect amount of stretch in them
and I kind of want to buy two pair I'm
like loving these the only problem is
the bottom is just a little bit too long
so I was like this is the perfect Jean
to do this DIY on this is a quick clip
of what the denim looks like on my body
so as you can see they are high waisted
I'm obsessed with the wash the wash is
so nice kind of a good medium wash and
as you can see it's just a little bit
too long I like a little bit of my ankle
to show when I'm wearing a boot so this
just does not work for me but I love
everything else a couple of things
you're going to need for this video
obviously a pair of jeans a ruler pen
tha's ours and I am using a knife but
you definitely should use a seam ripper
I ordered one on Amazon it did not come
yet so I'm using a knife because I feel
like it's the best alternative and
definitely be careful because it can get
like a little crazy so just make sure
you don't slice your fingers off my tip
so let's just get straight into the
video we're going to start by cutting
the bottom seam off of the jeans and I
actually turn them inside out so I could
get a better idea of exactly where I'm
cutting verses this side it's kind of
hard to tell so just a lot easier from
the inside
my
so now that we have our cut hem I'm
going to take my ruler and I'm going to
do mine two inches up so I'm going to
find the two inch mark and I'm just
going to mark it right here and same
with the other side and I'm going to
want to draw a line straight across
gonna turn back inside out so we can see
the seam what you're going to do next is
take your seam ripper if you have one
but I'm going to take my knife and
you're going to actually cut the seam on
both sides so all you need to do is find
the seam start ripping and then it
should pretty much slowly just start
kind of unraveling on its own and after
you find the seam and pop the first one
like I said it just it rips pretty
easily so all I'm gonna do is find my
pen mark and I'm just gonna rip until
the pen mark and then I'm going to stop
so this is what it looks like here's my
pen mark I went a little past but that's
okay and then I'm going to do the same
thing on the other side
you
now that the seams are ripped on both
sides up to my line I'm just going to
take my scissors and I'm just going to
cut straight across and it's okay if
it's not super straight because I think
the more distressed the better and you
know sometimes it's not perfect does it
make them a little bit more distressed
looking I'm going to take my knife and
I'm just going to grab the end and just
rip straight across
all right here is the end result of the
denim I'm so excited they came out so
great
exactly the link that I wanted was super
easy super quick it would have obviously
been way quicker with a seam ripper
so maybe order one of those before you
get started I think the one I ordered on
Amazon was around $4 yeah I hope you
loved it and don't forget to check out
my social media handles um I'll have
them post it on the screen for you and
share this tutorial with someone who has
also been looking for a pair of uneven
hem denim or just someone who wants to
cut their denim in general I mean this
is just a good way for you to kind of
get inspired to cut your own denim I
have probably six pairs of skinny jeans
that I literally just are too long and I
just cut them with scissors and it gives
kind of a cool effect to it without
having to take them to the tailor to get
them hemmed oh and let me know what you
think of a DIY how did I do
would you like to see more DIYs because
I really enjoy making this and I feel
like I have a new pair of jeans out of
it so bring on the DIY let me know what
you would like to see a lot of you guys
asked for this denim jacket from it is
from Nordstrom Rack and the brand is
Melrose and market and I believe they're
currently sold out right now but they
are constantly restocking this item so

best in a jacket I'll show you so it's
