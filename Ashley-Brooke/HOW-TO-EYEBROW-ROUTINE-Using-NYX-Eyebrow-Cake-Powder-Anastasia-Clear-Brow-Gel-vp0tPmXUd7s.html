York I am at home in Texas and I decided
that I would film a updated brow routine
because that has been requested a lot
and oh my god I have mosquito bites
quick Oh
for my body I'm telling you as soon as I
get to Texas like the mosquitoes just I
don't know if you know this if you put
clear nail polish over mosquito bites
they stop itching
I literally have head to toe covered in
clear nail polish and I don't even care
because it feels so good so here it is
updated brow routine let me just kind of
go over with you what I'm using the
products that I'm using because in the
tutorial is like up here at this close
so I don't know if you can even be able
to see what I'm using so let me just
kind of gather everything I need that I
need that I need that in my last brow
routine I use the anastacio pomade and I
like that but I don't like it for
everyday I feel like it's a little heavy
for every day so I am now using my good
old faithfuls the NYX brow cake powder
it is amazing in the color dark brown /
Brown and I use the dark brown color
because I just do and it comes with
still holding gel which I don't use
because it feels weird and it smells
weird but I do use the dark brown color
right here and I do use the spoolie
because it's it works fine I'm going to
use to apply my Mac brush and I don't
know the number that it is because it's
already worn off but I think it's 7:20
what are the face yeah so the 720 Mac
brush I believe is that's not right all
corrected in the description and to hold
the brow I use the Anasazi at Beverly
Hills clear brow gel which keeps my
eyebrows in place it's amazing and then
to line my brows after I'm done
special appearance it's Maggie's hi
Maggie
oh no you can't like maybe hi I am using
to line my brows and just make sure
they're nice and clean my Becca
concealer and to apply that I'm using my
morphe angled brush which is amazing so
this is awesome I will link all this
stuff below and let's get straight into
the video not sure with that one first
I'm going to grab my NYX brow cake
powder and I'm using this darker color
right here this is a darker Brown it's
gonna start with the spoolie that it
comes with and I'm going to brush
upwards and over I'm going to take my
Mac eyebrow brush and I'm just going to
dip it into the dark color and I'm just
going to line the bottom I'm going to
take my spoolie again and I'm going to
comb down and just get the top hair out
of the way then I'm going to line the
top
now go ahead and take my spoolie again
and just brush up next I'm just going to
connect the corner and then I'll do the
same thing on the top after that I'm
just going to fill everything in and I'm
just gonna I'm not going to dip my brush
into the color as much I'm just gonna
kind of use the color that's already
down here and just kind of blend it in
obviously if you see some patchy spots
like right here add a little bit more
powder to that but for the most part I'm
just going to use the bottom line to
just blend up the top I'm going to take
my um
Becca concealer and I'm gonna take a
bigger brush just kind of an angled
brush and I'm going to use that to just
kind of line and fix any mistake that I
made you can do the same thing on the
top
having an angled brush like this really
helps you get that straight line across
and it's also really really thin so that
also helps after that I'm going to take
my Anasazi at Beverly Hills brow gel
which is completely this like rubbed off
and I'm just going to lightly brush it
over this helps everything stay in place
so that is it for my brow routine it's a
super easy short snap brow routine kind
of no mess around just gets the job done
and be super easy if you have the right
tools to use so share with your friends
so go ahead and comment below let me
know what you think if you use these
products if you have new products I know
someone was telling me yesterday about
she uses the NYX brow pomade which I
didn't even know existed so now I have
to try it because I love NYX brow
products so thank you for that comment I
will put my social media handles right
chaf you can check those out have a
lovely day
