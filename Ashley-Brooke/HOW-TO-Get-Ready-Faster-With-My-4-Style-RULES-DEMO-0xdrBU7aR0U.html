today I'm going to be talking about my
four style rules that I constantly live
by I kind of came up with these roles
after I moved to New York because you
know I don't have a whole lot of clothes
but I have a small closet that my medium
amount of clothes don't quite fit into
very well so having these four style
rolls has really helped me put outfits
together get ready in the morning
because as soon as I open my closet all
I see is like a lot of material mash
together into one tiny little space so
we all have different budgets on what we
like to spend on clothes and fortunately
these rules apply if you spend $100 on
my bunk clothes or if you spend $2,000 a
month on clothes you know don't think
you need all of these clothes to look
look stylish and feel good about
yourself they work for me so I really
really hope that they work for you as
well alright so let's get this video
started the first roll that I made for
myself is always adding a third piece to
your outfit and it's still a little bit
chilly here in New York City so I have
tons of like lightweight little bomber
jackets that dress up even a pair of you
know t-shirt and jeans the green one is
from Zara it's also one of my go to
throw ons because it's a spring color it
just kind of you know makes your outfit
look a little bit more dressy and a
little bit more put together and the
black one is kind of the same idea this
one's from H&amp;amp;M and I've had this jacket
for like three years and I wear it at
least once or twice every two weeks
this next jacket I got at H&amp;amp;M this is
you know one of my go-to pieces if I'm
just kind of running around during the
day or I just need to add a little bit
of
prints or color to my outfit by next
play sir it's from Banana Republic I
like to wear it during the daytime when
I want to do like more like a casual
menswear look this color is great
because it's almost got like a denim
effect to it and denim is my favorite
neutral it just goes with everything
so my next role is adding a statement
piece this kind of ties hand-in-hand
with adding a third piece a statement
piece is for example a belt and necklace
a hat something that's going to stand
out and really make your outfit kind of
tied together my personal favorite
statement piece is always a hat this
black hat I thought God where did I get
this I think I got this one at forever
21 and you buy safe like totally stuffed
up there aking they used to stock and
now they're awesome so way to go forever
21
the next example of the statement piece
is like a really cool bag if you want to
dress your outfit up with a bag
definitely go for something with texture
or you know print or something hanging
off of it like a tassel or fur ball
these two bags are both from Zara the
red one I've got recently to take to LA
but then I ended up forgetting it so
that was annoying but um yeah so I
really love this red when I plan on
wearing it a lot during the summer black
one is actually also from Zara and it's
my go-to when I want to make my app it a
little bit more boho and just add a
little something to it you know ASOS
always has really great statement back i
was just on there the other day and they
had some really cool prints and textures
and even bags the plain fun designs on
them I think I saw one with like a
banana I don't know it's something cool
don't be afraid to do something a little
bit funky with your bag rule number
three is your shoe game a really cool
shoe can really take any simple basic
outfit and really make it something a
little bit more special I'm going to go
ahead and show you guys
some examples that I have in my own
closet for you to kind of see for
yourself so I like to substitute these
French Connection slides with my for my
just basic black flats I get so many
compliments on these and I feel like
they go with any outfit that you would
normally wear just your basic black
flats went for my next shoe I decided to
show you guys my leopard lace-up loafers
that I got from Lauren Taylor
seemed just basic leopard flats
everywhere but this is a little bit more
girly version of a just solid leopard
flat I think these are great for work
because they do have a little bit of a
heel but yet they're very comfortable
because the heel is like so small and
for my last pair of shoes I'm going to
pick these studded Azure boots that I
actually scored on Poshmark
I was so excited about these I think
I've bought them a bottom awesome girl
for like 10 bucks I was like oh I win I
win on that one
I've obsessed with these boots I've got
a little bit of a cool kind of Western
vibe to them so you know being from
Texas I'm like oh my god these look like
cool Texas cowboy boots so I had to have
these and again the heel is super low so
you're not uncomfortable all day my last
rule is called the cool factor roll this
is kind of adding something with a cool
factor to it so let me just give you an
example because I'm sure you're like
what are you talking about I'll just
start with the tops and then we'll go
into the bottom this blue top is just a
basic blue button down with a cold
factor to this top is the ruffle
detailing in the back you know you can
find a blue button-down anywhere but you
know to make it a little bit more
special and a little bit more
interesting buy something with detail on
it have like a little ruffle or a small
little detail of print or just some kind
of texture something to show that this
is different from any other blue
button-down
there and my next top is one of my most
recent purchases and I'm obsessed with
this top it's not a plain basic prenta
top that you can find anywhere else it's
got texture it's got detail its metallic
it's got a cute girly shoulder to it
this is kind of a good alternative for
any just basic printed long-sleeve shirt
that's out there and moving into the
bottoms one of my favorite pair of
bottoms that I own right now where I've
used leather culottes I feel like these
are so cool that you can honestly just
throw on a white t-shirt with it and
maybe a cool shoe and your leg good to
go you can honestly style them so many
different ways but you still look great
because it's kind of a unique cool piece
to have it's tough oh my legs looks like
something's on my head but it's just my
limp
those are my rolls I hope you love them
and now you're asking yourself okay
great those are your rolls now how does
that help me in the morning get ready
faster let me tell you whatever I'm
getting ready either pick out my outfit
the night before or that morning I
picked one of the four think you pick
one of those items in your closet and
then you build your outfit around that
one item for example yesterday I had no
clue what I wanted to wear so I followed
my roles I picked out my leopard shoe
I've built an outfit on side even though
it was just a pair of black skinny jeans
and a white crop top it was still put
together outfit because I had my shoe
game on point I threw on my black long
blazer that I showed you guys and good
to go and took me 10 minutes so before
you get ready in the morning trust me
apply one of these rolls and I promise
you will have an outfit
I'll pick picked out oh and I promise
you'll have an outfit picked out in less
than 10 minutes
I suggest before you know applying these
roles that go through your closet see
what you have first of all I think
that's what a lot of our issue is is we
don't even know what's in our closet
maybe once a month go through and see
what you have don't we
to get rid of stuff don't be a clothes
order take it to good well really have
pieces in your closet that you love and
picking out an outfit will be easy
breezy and you won't end up hating your
outfit by lunch and be wondering why you
chose to wear what you are so if you
guys have any questions about this
you're confused about something please

send me a personal message I love
