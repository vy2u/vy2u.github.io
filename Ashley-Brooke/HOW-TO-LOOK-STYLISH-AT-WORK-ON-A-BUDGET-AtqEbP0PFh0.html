welcome to the second video in my office
where series today's video is gonna be
all about how to look stylish on a
budget just wanna make this clear
everyone's budget is different people's
budget might be $500 a month and some
people's budget might be I don't know a
thousand dollars a month I am NOT here
to tell you what is expensive and what
is inexpensive I'm just here to help
guide you stay within your own personal
budget for some people a pair of $30
trousers might be a steal and write
right in their budget and for some
people $200 trousers might be you know
in their budget and something that they
would purchase so just use these tips
and kind of cater towards your own
budget and your own monthly spending I
don't know what your dress code is for a
work so I'm just gonna show you some
things that are in kind of a business
casual sense you know a lot of you guys
can't wear open-toed shoes and of you
have really strict dress code so this is
just kind of me showing you what I used
to wear whenever I worked in more of a
business casual office so getting into
the tips I actually read a study
actually a few studies online that said
you should spend no more than five
percent of your salary on clothing
something you know you have to follow
you don't have to spend any any of my
fun clothing if you want to save your
money and then do like one shop for work
clothes at the beginning of each season
that's totally fine to just kind of
wanted to share that with you because
people always ask me how much they
should set aside for clothing but I did
research and it says no more than five
percent number one is become friends
with your tailor you know if you are on
a budget and you found this really great
pair of pants on sale but they're just
like two inches too long get them like
if they fit you it great everywhere else
get them take them to the tailor but
don't forget to add that into your
budget I always set aside a little bit
of money each time I go shopping to not
hit my budget because I know I'm
probably enough to get
thing tailored if you love something and
it's a great deal you know it's gonna be
an easy fix
like getting the wave taken in a little
bit or just getting a couple of inches
off the bottom spend a little bit of
money on the tailor you will be so happy
you did because you can re wear them
over and over my next tip is to not over
purchase your accessories means whenever
you are out shopping for work clothes
you don't need to buy ten necklaces 10
bracelets 10 tote bags save that for
your actual clothes that you're gonna be
wearing first of all and no one paying
attention to you know if you're wearing
a different necklace today if you're
carrying a different bag today so I
would just kind of have your signature
necklace and you're a signature ring and
your signature tote bag for work
so put your budget towards your bigger
appearance items that make sense bigger
appearance items such as like Blazers
and trousers and tops and even shoes
moving on to the next tip kind of
relates to the previous tip so with that
being said when you are ready to invest
a little bit more money into certain
pieces a lot of people always say you
know invest in your basics like Blazers
and trousers and that's that's great
everyone has their own opinions but I
have amazing Blazers from Zara and
Topshop that I've had for like seven
years and that are super great fitting
and just amazing so I always say invest
in a really nice bag you know whether
you're you want to save up and invest in
a really nice product tote or something
a little bit less expensive like see by
Chloe or you know something even less
than that I will say that a designer
that will always make your outfit look a
little bit more expensive the next thing
I would invest in is a really nice pair
of shoes something that's comfortable
you do have comfortable heels from like
Steve Madden and from smaller designers
from like Nordstrom but I do think a
really great pair of black pumps is a
really great item to invest your money
in and just FYI i'm viviane lue makes a
really great high-heeled insert if you
guys are uncomfortable in your heels
my next tip is to rotate your trendy
items in with your classic items and I
know you're like how does that save me
money so I always like to purchase
multiple printed tops or bright tops and
then rotate your same basic staple
pieces around it so you could literally
do the same pair of trousers Monday
through Friday I don't recommend doing
this but you could do your same joggers
Monday through Friday alternating a
different top out different shoes a
different blazer and your outfit would
look completely different so don't go
crazy buying you know five pairs of
black trousers you really only need one
or two to alternate during the week my
next tip is a little silly but it has
worked for me in the past a lot of us
forget what is in our closet my closet
starts out super organized on Monday and
then by Friday after I pulled a hundred
things for shooting crammed it back in
there it is no longer the closet that it
was on Monday it does get lost and
things get stuck behind things fall on
the floor so what I like to do is every
time I create an outfit that I love I
snap a picture and put it in an OOTD
folder in my phone that way when you are
getting ready for work and you've got
your you know one basic piece on you're
like I don't know what to wear go
through your folder and be like oh I
wear that a couple of weeks ago totally
forgot about that top I'm gonna go find
that way you're kind of keeping tabs on
everything that's in your closet
and all the outfits documents together
when you are out shopping and you see a
really pretty yellow top that you love
you can look through your folder and be
like oh I actually already have a yellow
top there is no need to purchase this
and have two yellow top so I can kind of
keep you on budget and that can kind of
keep you from buying the same thing over
and over access to purchase pieces that
you can wear on duty and off duty if I
see a really cool blazer I always try to
make sure that I can dress it up and
dress it down is this gonna be
appropriate for meetings and is this
also gonna be appropriate with jeans and
sneakers on the weekend might get like
pencil skirts you probably are not going
to be reusing on the weekend but your
statement pieces like Blazers and fun
pants I always try to make sure that
they have multi purposes and that I know
I'm not gonna be wasting my money just
wearing them once every two to three
weeks is to stick to one color palette
you know if you have a really good thing
going in your closet of camels and
creams and whites and neutrals and you
see this really cool like gray and green
top you can't really push this into your
wardrobe so there's really no need to
buy this top because you probably won't
be wearing it as much as you thought you
stick to one color palette adding some
blush pink in there or just whatever you
prefer it will keep you from over buying
just random colors and rent and with
that being said camel always looks a
little bit more expensive camel and
neutrals always look expensive and I
know a lot of us have a lot of black
items camel and noodles go great with
black so you can definitely tie the two
ends they just mix colors really well
you know you can do white pants and a
camel top or vice versa add a dark brown
in there add a blush pink in there so I
think that color palette really really
looks nice I think prints and that color
palette looked nice as well next when
you are shopping try to stay away from
department stores really try to shop at
stores like Target t.j.maxx century 21
Nordstrom Rack is one of my favorite
Saks office well aren't gonna be having
the newest collection but you
be getting this same exact brand for a
much more in discounted price thrifting
is also a really great option as well I
know when I lived in Texas there was
this one thrift store that had like
designer Blazers and designer clothes
for like 40 bucks so you know if you can
find a really good thrift store that you
can visit every now and then chances are
you will find some really good stuff in
there there's always shopping online I
would try to sign up for as many coupon
grabbing email subscriptions as you can
shop tagger is really great RetailMeNot
is really great and shop on Poshmark
that's kind of like thrifting but online
it's a lot of stores if they're having
promotions online chances are they'll
match it for you in store but sometimes
that's not always the case so I might
prefer to shop online anyways because
you can always find a coupon code
usually like 90 percent of the time I
can find some sort of coupon code and
one bonus tip is nails oh my gosh I took
my gel off the other day and they look
her at this I can't believe I just like
flashed again so I always think that a
good manicure always makes you look more
put together and a little bit more nice
and definitely professional quickest
time-saving thing is to always get a gel
manicure because it'll last longer
I mean it it does it just lasts a lot
longer than nail polish so I recommend
getting the at home system Sally Hansen
was Italian yeah Sally Hansen has a
really great gel and nail system that
they use and I actually tried it a few
weeks ago and my manicure stayed for two
weeks and it looked great you are a gel
person then definitely invest in
something like that that way you're not
spending you know fifty plus dollars
every couple of weeks to get a new
manicure you're not time to do the air
Nelson you don't have time to sit down
and do the whole gel thing definitely
like pick one day out of the week to
just completely redo your nail polish
even if it's in good condition chances
are the next couple of days it's gonna
start chipping sides a little bit of
time during the week to just give your
a fresh coat of paint all right those
are my tips and I hope you love them
don't forget to sign up for the life by
