you guys have been asking me for a
curled hair tutorial so you really need
to wash my hair today so I thought I
would just a down and film it for you so
this is a routine from a wet hair to
this so here you go you keep in mind
that I do have a very thick naturally
curly hair and everyone's hair texture
is different so for what works for me
might not work for you any of us have
thick hair so most that really is
straight fine hair so if it doesn't work
for you
play with the products play with the
technique and see if you can maybe meet
in the middle and find something that
does work for you so let's go ahead and
get straight into the video before you
get started with your blow-dry you just
want to add any sort of product that you
normally put in I always put in a
leave-in conditioner because my hair is
a little dry I also like to put in a
nourishing oil to fight frizziness this
is the best stuff that I've ever found
and I only just put it on the ends and
around my face and of course a heat
protectant always to protect my hair
from the heat of my blow-dryer nice
Ashley completely missed your hair with
all of those praise you're just gonna
section your hair off into one and a
half to two inch section and I like to
use a round brush because I feel like
that gives me the smoothest blow-dryer
next you're just gonna blow dry about
halfway down as you can see I'm only
drawing the root during each section is
dry I'm just going to take my round
brush and twist my hair at the bottom
into a curl this is a lot easier than it
looks your brush in your hand just kind
of will naturally do this if you try too
once you're about halfway done you'll
see that you have four or five different
curls hanging down what I like to do is
to combine them all into one curl you
don't have to do this I just feel like
it helps me keep track of my curls a
little bit better it helps keep them
from getting unraveled once they start
getting dryer
now that my ends are finally air dried
I'm just going to take my fingers and
I'm just gonna run them through the
curls to break them up cause I've still
got like my oh now we're done just
kidding pick which curling iron we want
to use I either use either one of these
for more of a wavy look I definitely go
for a barrel that looks like this but
for what I'm trying to achieve today
which is like a clean bouncy curl I'm
going to use this one because you see
how it's thick and then gets a little
bit skinnier at the bottom a bit more
natural-looking
if you're going for a more natural curl
look rather than a big wave in a spray
and my ends with some heat protectant
spray I always want to wait about five
minutes to let the heat protectant dry
never good to put heat on your hair when
your hair is wet even if it is heat
protectant spray all right once that's
done I'm gonna section off my hair in
two I would say like one and a half to
two inch sections pieces about this big
I'm just gonna mock the shape that my
natural pearl has already made very
careful not to touch the ends of the
hair to the curling iron to keep heat
off of our end shouldn't have worn a
black shirt you can't even see I thought
I was being smart by wearing a black
shirt but my ends are darker than I
thought
so once that is done and we've got all
of our curls I'm just gonna do the same
thing we did when we blow-dry it and I'm
going to make one big curl just like
this
how do you feel like all of the heat is
out of the curls and everything feels
nice and cooled down is the time to put
any hairspray in that you want in I'm
not gonna put any hairspray in because I
don't really feel like I needed I'm not
going anywhere I'm just kind of hanging
out at home for the weekend but if you
are going somewhere
now's a good time to put the hairspray
in actually you do that you just want to
get your fingers and you just want to
break up all of the curls
so your curls are broken up I would go
ahead and put any texture spray that you
want in even and little additional
hairspray if you are going somewhere but
I do think a good texture spray is a
really good thing to have on these types
of curls the way has a really really
good a texture spray that I don't have
with me at the moment but it's the one
that I normally use but I am going to
put in the egg easy oh honey infused
hair oil this is my favorite oil as you
can see I'm literally down to the last
drop so I'm gonna put a little bit this
in and this just kind of contains any
frizziness
all right there we go all done you can
also obviously play with it if you need
some more curls by your face feel free
to grab your wand
add some more curls straighten any
pieces you want curl any pieces you want
to kind of play with it make it your own
and exactly how you like right and for
more hair inspo and definitely check out
