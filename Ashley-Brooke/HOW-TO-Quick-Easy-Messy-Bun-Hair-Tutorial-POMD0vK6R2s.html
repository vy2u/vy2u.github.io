just for you so right now my hair is
pretty clean I just washed it dried it
last night so I am gonna have a few
little crazy Flyway pieces and I'm gonna
have to spray down but for this video
I'm going to be using a comb a hair
brush some hair spray and a ponytail
holder what I was talking about with
like the Flyway this is just my life at
home so I'm just gonna take this top
part and I'm going to take my comb and
he's this part right here this is so
whenever you do put your hair up your
part doesn't fall down happens to me
all the time I'll put a ponytail in and
as soon as I out the door you can like
see my part in the front so look like
that now I'm just gonna take the rest of
my hair and put it up like I was doing a
ponytail so I'm gonna wrap it around
three times and on the third time I'm
gonna stop half way just like this hi
you're gonna take these extra pieces of
hair and you're just gonna pull them
little by little you can just kind of
move these guys over to the side now
take little pieces of your bun and tuck
them into the ponytail holder so I just
wanted to give you guys a closer look
here of what I'm doing so I talked in
all of my little pieces of hair and now

I'm just gonna kind of loop them around
to the back and tuck them into the back
