episode of how to style I actually am
styling one item today four different
ways I am styling this sweater dress
from H&amp;amp;M and it's I can't raise my arms
well I fast a long hold I'm styling it
four different ways one of them is a
work attire I know you guys really loved
last week how to style office wear so
I'm going to try to include an office
outfit in each of my how to style is
moving forward because I feel like
that's important I feel like that's
something that we can all kind of take
apart but if you love black and gray
then you are probably gonna love this
lookbook okay for my first look I really
wanted to dress it up and make it an
outfit with accessories I added this
belt from this is my Topshop one of my
hmm one I think this one's from urban so
I added this belt because I thought it
just like looked nice to have something
accentuating the waist since this dress
is so shapeless and then for my
necklaces jet boys happens to me
untangle them and then I'm like filming
and then they like they just dangle
together which is back in stock on
Forever 21's website I'll link it blue
is the one that I always wear and you
guys asked me about but it's like always
sold out it's attached so that's who and
then I added this super delicate chain
can only really see it if you're up
close or if it kind of listens in the
sunlight but um this is a really nice
necklace so we added those pretty much
completes outfit number one I just
really wanted to play with accessories
and see what I could do to it um
with only accessories and I liked it I
think I feel like that was an outfit
that I would go run errands in or meet
up with friends so I love that one and
for my second outfit this was my work
attire outfit I started with the sweater
dress and then I added a really long
well not really long it's my
my hmm my long kind of duster blazer
that I wear all the time
basic long black added this booty this
an open toe leather bootie they are by
tony bianco which I believe is an
Australian shoe brand to add a little
something dressy I added this choker
from Zara also came with this just kind
of wrap choker so I added those two I
think that is such a great outfit for
work I think it's you know depending on
your office dress code I think it's it's
it's casual because it's a sweater dress
but then you add a blazer to it and it
makes it so much more than what it is so
I love this outfit and this is something
that I would definitely wear to work
myself for outfit number two wait outfit
number three I added a leather jacket
just to kind of give it um some black on
top to dress the ball gray I wanted to
do something black something leather
with texture over it and then I added
this ankle bootie from forever 21 that I
showed you guys in my last haul I'm
obsessed with these they're so
comfortable I've already worn them a few
times and I love them so much so I added
this just to add um a studded shoe
something fun to go with it but I also
added a hat and since you know you don't
really need a hat but I'm such a hot
person I add a hat
whenever I can and I just thought with
the black ankle booties on the bottom
and then the black hat on the top and it
balanced out really nice but again you
don't need to wear a hat I was going to
be walking around a lot I would
definitely wear this outfit because of
my flat boots the leather jacket is
going to keep me warm it's a good
traveling outfit because the dress is
flowy comfortable so soft so this is a
great travel outfit you know you've got
your hat or your crazy hair because I
always take for some reason Ryan books
us for am flights all the time so I'm
always in a hat in the morning when I go
to the airport for my last outfit I
actually added some pants underneath it
these are a wax coated black pants and I
got these in LA at a vintage store love
how they're you know they've got that
wax look to them so they're not such a
harsh black contrast of the gray and
this like washed flat color it was
really really nice makes this more like
a tunic top so you know it doesn't look
so weird with pant slits on the side the
sweater dress are pretty high too height
or you obviously can't wear a dress
high enough to wear when you wear pants
it doesn't look weird so um I thought
this was a really interesting look I
love this and then you know me I added a
stud bag to it from Aldo just to give it
a little bit of dimension something fun
you know this is such a grand black
outfit so I thought this would be
perfect so I added this I love this bag
by the way to was giving me like major
Stella McCartney vibes and it was $45 at
Aldo so I'm completely obsessed with as
I click can't stop carrying it chain is
soaked and it's not one of those really
thick obnoxious chains like very
delicate so simple I love this
hiding from night now my friends drunk
godlike South Street I could hold a
candle to
you
Oh
maybe you can be somebody baby somebody
anybody
baby
that is it for this lookbook and I
really hope you guys loved it never
really done this where I've taken one
item and styled it 4 different ways so
let me know what you guys think about
that and a few requests for styling
sweater dresses
I just thought taking one and styling it
four different ways kind of really shows
you how versatile a swagger dress can be
so let me know what you guys think of
this style of video forget to sign up
for my lookbook it is the monthly look
look of a whole month's worth about this
style by myself and you get inspiration
photos you get a video of me explaining
each outfit and you also get invited to
a really cool private Facebook group
with all of us look Booker's talking
about style sharing fitting room photos
um it's like you guys are becoming my
really good friend my girls that I go to
for style advice so I love you guys
shout out to all my lip Booker's love
you so much and um yeah I will see you
guys in my next video bye I studded
boots my next pair of shoes are my over
the knee stretch suede boots and I
decided to splurge on these guys these
are Jean Michelle cause I bought but I
know you know store Wiseman makes very
similar almost the exact same pair I am
obsessed bathies have very thin legs and
so it's hard for me to find one that
really fits my leg and holds up and so
such a classic they're never gonna go
out of style so I plan on having these
for years and years and years I don't
wear them that much so they're not going
to get beat up within the first year of
me having them I really just wear them
out to dinner or if I'm you know for a
special occasion so I decided to splurge
on these guys I'm so happy I did they
were such a great investment if you're a
career woman and you're going to the
office 8 to 5 and you're hustling and
you're you know walking around going to
meetings you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
