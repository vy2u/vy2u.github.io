another episode of how to style they are
doing denim skirts today today was the
perfect day to do denim skirts it was
72° little windy I just had a spit
bubble sorry it's like starting to get
layering time and I am feeling it that
my jam before we get started into the
video I'm just gonna throw out their
fill book book and see her like Valerie
Tom thinks we're gonna be posted here
for you guys the first link is gonna be
to go purchase and kind of look over the
Bowery top the second link is for my
lookbook go check this out yes I got a
little like nah when you guys were
saying denim skirts you didn't want it
to look so like Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch
Hollister because you know dem skirts
are making a little bit of a comeback
I wanted a styling to be like on point
for you guys I wanted it to be so good
to where it didn't look like I was
walking through an Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch
ad I was trying you like make it a
little cool girl and like a little you
know put put a little bit of style into
it
so denim skirt I styled one denim skirt
through three videos is the denim skirt
that I styled it is a denim mini from
Zara it's got a blowout here and a
blowout here actually my foot went
through this one it was just a little
shred and now it's the size of my foot
so that's my first outfit alright I left
the belt will you bring me the belt I
think my neighbors are yelling at each
other so sorry if you guys can hear that
they're not speaking English so I don't
know what they're saying for to first
looks I put this black mock neck ribbed
long-sleeve shirt from brandy melville
and my favorite thing about this shirt
Thank You Ryan and my favorite thing
about this shirt is a thumb hole so
here's me when I say my favorite thing
is the thumb hole it is this not like a
security blanket or what this is the
most comfortable like my thumb fist
through this hole in any shirt I'm so
happy like count me in where's my belt
added my little Western vibe belt to it
I love this belt I honestly think it
just makes any outfit ten times cooler
so you will continue to see this felt
throughout fall so I suggest you go
ahead and buy it now I hate spending
money on belts - I was like oh $30.00 no
I wear it all the time make it a little
bit more cool I guess you could say I
added a green bomber jacket from forever
21 and don't get me wrong this outfit by
itself is I love it like it's something
that I would totally wear anywhere but
when you add a bomber jacket it's like
two totally different outfits like Ryan
thought I changed after I put the jacket
on he was like did you change I was like
no I just added a jacket so it's
completely like two separate looks so in
the lookbook I'm actually showing you
guys both ways what it looks like in um
with the jacket on and with the jacket
off and then I just added this ankle
bootie from Zara
it's a pointy toe block heel oh I just
touched the bottom gross New York's
disgusting I do not trust my shoes
anywhere except for in the top of my
closet because I step in peep you poop
sometimes from a person may be careful
where we put our shoes I think these are
a good dressy it's leather bootie I
think things like look really nice for
my second outfit I did a denim on denim
look so I did a denim shirt with the
denim skirt and then to kind of separate
the two colors of denim I added a belt
from Free People and then I added
my little leopard loafer to add a print
because this outfit was just so like
blue and kind of blob then when you add
a printed shoe it just kind of makes the
whole thing in my lookbook there's a
pair of leopard booties that I'm dying
to get I think that's going to be like
the next thing on my shoe list again
unfortunately throughout winter my
little ankle will freeze so I H retire
these starting probably at the end of
November unfortunately before my last
list I added this white t-shirt from
Zara which if you saw my how to style
white t-shirts video this is a t-shirt
in the last look and it's one of my
favorites it's the high neck and it's
like really thick actually and it's like
super stretchy so I love this this is
the one I got um salsa on during the
video so if you saw that just what you
know the stain came out but I did this
and then I added a bandana to my neck so
I just kind of tied it in a loose double
knot to where it hangs down just like
that they added a motorcycle boot with
it just to kind of give it a more casual
street style daytime looks I love a good
motorcycle boot and these have been with
me through two snowy winters as you can
see they're like beat to death but I
love them I think it makes it look that
much better and I'm touching the bottom
again gross and then to add a third
piece over it I did this sweatshirt
bomber jacket from Zara I originally got
this just kind of wear around the house
- like lounge and show it's a really
cool jacket so now I'm like wearing it
for life I love it so now that I've
given you all the outfit descriptions
let's go ahead and get into the lookbook
we were like don't break a bone stuck
inside of that house trapped in the
walls and I love the voices inside
we'll be silenced until I can
I
No
breakdown I'm not afraid
love you never gave me you slip in no
way
and I love the voices inside my mind
will never be silenced until I can find
hi
we can
I do the world
that is it for this book books I really
hope you enjoyed it hope that all of you
who requested this are satisfied and so
happy with the way that I style the
denim skirt to kind of give everyone who
has all different styles kind of
something that they can get some
inspiration from and grasp onto so I try
to make all my looks not just one style
and I'm just now reading your comments
about how you would like me to start
styling for outfits because I did last
week and it will really try to make that
happen sometimes there's just not enough
daylight in the day to make that
possible we start shooting early and
usually wrap up pretty late so if time
allows me to I will definitely try to
make that happen for you that would be
so cool so please like this video if you
liked it umm just so I know that we're
on the right track and we're doing
things the right way and definitely
share with your friends who have it in a
skirt but do not want to look like a
walking ever grubby and bicha and don't
forget to check out the lookbook go sign
up for it it's super cool if you do send
me a message let me know what you think
and I will see you my next videos bye
changing to dark and light because
there's clouds and weird things are
happening so let's just go ahead and get
started I'm going to put my super cute
headband on but my foundation I'm
actually going to mix two I'm going to
start by using my L'Oreal True Match
Lumi in the color buff beige I'm also
going to mix my Maybelline fit me
foundation in the color 220 natural
beige my skin just changes colors
throughout the summer because I'll be
tan and then my channel fade and then
I'll get self tanner on so I think it's
good to have a dark and a light and you
can kind of mix them and make your own
color formula to whatever matches your
skin I'm going to start with the True
Match Lumi
I want to remember to match our
foundation to your neck and not to your
actual face so you want it to blend with
your neck I'm going to go in with my
lighter color then I'm going to take my
Real Techniques Foundation buffing brush
and I'm just going to kind of buff
everything in
X I'm going to take my Becca ultimate
coverage concealer and this is just kind
of a concealer for under my eyes on my
chin my Cupid's bow I'm just going to
use my finger to apply X I'm going to
take my Beauty Blender and just kind of
bump and blend that in to kind of
highlight those spots
böck do you have that lifted up nicely
I'm going to take my Laura Mercier
brightening powder and this is just a
translucent powder to help set the
concealer under my eyes so it doesn't
crease off it's going to take my Beauty
Blender and I'm going to dip it in</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
