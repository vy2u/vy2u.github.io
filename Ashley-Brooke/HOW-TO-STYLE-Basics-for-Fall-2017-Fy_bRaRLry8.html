no they always say congratulations
hey guys it's ashli for those of you who
are new to my channel welcome and for
those of you who are returning welcome
back I only wanted to dial basics
because it did so well the first time
around you guys really seemed to enjoy
it so I wanted to take just random
basics out of my closet and make an
outfit out of them these are just items
that I figured that most people have in
their closet whether it be a version of
it or something exactly like it so with
this video hopefully you will get some
inspiration of how to style your basics
even if it's not the basics that I show
you today hopefully it will help you
pull some of those basics out of your
closet and help inspire you to make some
pretty cool outfits out of them for
outfit number one actually these outfits
are not in order because they're just
laying on this chair so Patten's start
with the red coat outfit for this outfit
I just grabbed a basic denim skirt
because I'm always under the impression
that denim skirt is for summer and for
spring but it's not you can definitely
carry your denim skirts over to fall
especially if it's a dark denim skirt
did a basic long-sleeved tee underneath
then I wanted to add a pop of color in
the video this jacket looks very orange
II like it does right now but it's a
true red so I thought it was perfect for
fall was this basic trench I got it from
Zara earlier this year and I got it on
sale for like almost nothing it was like
70% off so what I did was I rolled the
sleeve so it wouldn't look like an
outerwear like a coat it almost just
looked like I don't know kind of a light
layering piece then to add black I did
my soft booties from Alice and Olivia
and then I added my Baker boy hat from
ASOS and I just kind of add this when I
feel like I need a touch of black if I
need something on top to kind of balance
out my bottom so I was wearing a block
bootie and I just
like I needed something black to balance
out on top of my head next outfit is
probably my second favorite out of the
whole lookbook I started with my gray
sweatshirt and I wear this thing all the
time I wear it with jeans with like faux
leather leggings to the gym to just
lounge in so I think a good basic gray
sweatshirt is a good piece to have
especially a light one like this because
then it's not so sweatshirt II yeah it's
what shorty so to kind of dress this guy
up I did these suspenders skirt from
Urban Outfitters and I was kind of
worried on if you guys would think it
was too cold to wear like if the weather
was too cold for an outfit like this but
I like in Texas right now it's 90
degrees so this is totally doable for a
lot of you guys I think even in
California right now it's pretty warm
like LA area and I just thought this was
a really nice color combo I really love
gray and olive greens together it's one
of my favorites my coat I did this one
which actually tied everything in
because it's got gray and it's got all
of green in it so that was actually
perfect
it's not super warm it's not it's lined
but it's not like warm I think it's more
of like you know for chilly weather kind
of a statement coat but I love anything
patchwork so I was obsessed with this
Vince I just kind of make it a little
bit edgy and fun I did my boots with the
chain on it just because I wanted
something a little edgy just because the
skirt was kind of girly and I just
wanted to end it up a little bit did my
glasses because I was checking emails
while I was shooting this I was kind of
doing two things at once so I was
wearing my actual glasses I know like
the fake glasses look is a trend right
now but I actually need them to see my
phone so this look is definitely my
favorite I wanted to grab a basic
sweater dress now this is an item that
maybe some of you guys don't have in
your closet but if you don't and you're
you're kind of a basics girl like me you
like to dress around basics I recommend
this you can do booties you can do like
over the knee boots you can do sneakers
in layer
I mean there's just so you can do jeans
you can belt it there's just so many
ways to wear a really good sweater dress
I love this one from Zara because it's
very comfy it's so soft the color is
great and I really love the asymmetrical
neckline and I grabbed this one and I
was like wait does this one just
stretched out no it's supposed to be
this so I really like the look of this
that's some print with it I did my river
island coat this club just kind of takes
my outfit just to another level whenever
I have an outfit full of basics I always
like to add this because it does give me
some color some length and it's just a
really really great coat so my boots are
from Zara and I recently got them I love
them because they're super comfortable
they're durable they're warm and I
layered under them a fishnet sock has I
don't know I like the look of that you
know when I've got a basic sweater dress
on and I do a boot I don't know I just
like the look of a fishnet sock
depending on the dress depending on the
look you know if it's a super-busy dress
you might want to just do the bootie no
sock but I really like to look of it so
I kept it where my last outfit this is
just something that I would go run
errands in get groceries just like
walking Stella so I basically just
grabbed a t-shirt and jeans and went
from there a-rod's my army green jacket
from Topshop and I have a couple of
shorter army green jackets but what I
really loved about this one is that it's
long and I don't really see many of
those so I was really excited to find
this so I just added sneakers to it's
just kind of my running errands outfit
layering a long coat over jeans and a
t-shirt and just calling it a day you
know it's it's basic but you've got some
length to your coat it's like a cool
military like army green style coat so I
think it looks really nice so I will go
ahead and tell you guys that the the red
coat was taken from the life by her
lookbook I've got some major inspo from
one of the inspo photos so I was like oh
