episode of how to style every Sunday we
are styling day we are styling bomber
jackets can I get an amen hallelujah
this is probably the most requested
requested style of all time so I'm doing
it I decided to sell bombers the day
before
so yesterday I was like bombers I have
straight hair today so we're working
with it the thing I love about bombers
is that you can take a plain t-shirt
jeans and like throw on a coal bomber
and there's your outfit that's pink song
stuck in my head just vodka pal you keep
singing it no for my first bomber I got
this guy from Topshop I saw this and I
was like sequence stripes bomber I want
it and it's one of those sequins
patterns that like you go like that and
it changes color it's got white and gold
underneath a lot of your requesting that
I tell you guys the sizing that I'm
getting just so you can kind of know for
yourself I got a zero us zero in this I
just think this is so cool to dress down
I love taking sequins Blazers and like
dressy outerwear and kind of styling it
down making it fun compared that with
this pleated midi skirt that I got from
H&amp;amp;M I put it in my Hall a while back
this is online right now for $14 so I
suggest you go get it is so easy with
Ingle booties to sell for fall and I
styled it with just a plain black ankle
bootie my good old faithfuls that I need
to get take to the shoe place and get
fixed because they're coming all apart
because I've completely worn them out in
the past few years I mean look at me for
oh and in this skirt I got a size two
outfit number two I got this mermaid
looking bomber
from Zara I thought this was so cool it
might move a mermaid its metallic it's
green got some silver in it I love this
so so so much
got this like waxy coat to it and I put
a white t-shirt underneath and I added
some light washed denim I did my DIY
uneven him hmm jeans so I really liked
the color contrast of those of the light
pieces I thought they balanced out
really nicely but I added my Cecile boot
from Free People spoon is so comfortable
they're an amazing color an amazing boot
so comfortable low heel thought that the
brown tide in nicely with the zipper
detailing in this jacket I thought an
extra small I did my just basic green
bomber from forever 21 I know not a lot
of people like sequins and metallic and
crazy stuff like that so I did add just
a plain simple bomber or my third outfit
and as I small I kind of steered away
from my basic top underneath and I went
with my striped shirt from Zara then on
the bottom I added just a plain black
skirt I kind of went to make it a little
bit girly since my shoes and the jacket
are a little bit more on the edgy side I
thought I would add a skirt to kind of
throw things off and I'm just kind of a
girly piece something unexpected to
block denim you could do um black shorts
whatever you prefer and let me just tell
you about my shoe disaster today it was
so excited I ordered these boots from
Zara actually when my lookbook err is on
our Facebook group posted a photo of
them I fell in love with them
immediately when ordered them no excited
and wore them just to shoot today this
popped out this one also popped up
completely broken
I'm so mad so I just wanted to let you
guys know so you see these linked below
do not order them because I I wore them
for maybe 15 minutes and two things
already snapped off so just surprising I
have so many pairs of Zara shoes that I
wear all the time and they held out for
years and these like 15 minutes and they
just like fall apart outfit number four
I grabs this bummer from Zara and I love
it faux fur with sequins
kind of mixed into it almost like a fish
scale I just love the look of this on
oversized but it's it's not long so it's
not overpowering on your body wrap this
down to the bone I just paired it with a
basic black t-shirt and a paste pacing
the basic pair of black skinny jeans
high-waisted tuck the shirt in done for
my bdg high-waisted from Urban
Outfitters aka
like my go-to favorite black skinny
jeans i buy them every year it's 25 so
these are the high rise twig size 25
length 29 let's go ahead and get into
the lookbook because we all know that
that is the best part of me secret I
will get lost in a dream every like
dangerous riddle caught me walking on
walking on air like Oh midnight runways
