of how to style in today's video we are
styling boyfriend jeans from now on my
videos are going to start to be a little
bit more fall inspired even though it's
still literally 95 degrees outside
I am done buying summer clothes I'm
going to start rolling out the fall
stuff I hope that's okay with you I'm
sure it is because all of you guys are
asking for fall videos so that is
happening starting today now I'm still
going to be doing sandals and you know
short sleeves but it's gonna be a little
bit more fall inspired so oh whoa don't
ever let me do that again I think my
water bottles big enough today either
before we get started I just wanted to
share my little quick tip with boyfriend
jeans that I do every time I wear them I
am NOT a fan of a rolled cuff not on me
at least because I feel like it makes my
legs look short and like compact and I
don't know I just that's not a good look
for me
I wanted the effect of a cups meaning I
wanted it to look more tapered at the
bottom and a little bit shorter but
without the roll so I'm just going to
share with you guys really click my tip
that I do when styling boyfriend jeans
always do just one little tiny cup in
the front as you can see in the video
and then in the back I roll it a few
times so that way it pulls the Jean back
and it gives you the effect of a tapered
bottom I just wanted to show you guys
this video just in case what I'm saying
doesn't make sense because it probably
doesn't so if you're a visual learner
like myself you probably need something
to look at before you like know what's
going on so bad as that for my first
pair of jeans that I styled today I
chose the Topshop moto boyfriend jeans
and I love these because they are
cropped that well actually you can get
your you can get the link you want I
think it goes up to 30 and I got a 28
links so that's perfect
I love the wash I think the wash is so
pretty
I love how there's not rips everywhere
very easy to work with very comfortable
so soft for not a super low-rise there
about a mid rise but you can kind of
scrunch them down a little bit if you
feel like you want more of a low-rise it
paired them with just a solid black
t-shirt from forever 21 it's got a
curved hem and I actually tucked the
front of the shirt in so I could add a
belt and just give it a little bit of an
accessory I just felt like it was it
needed that extra something to it
so I added this belt from Topshop is to
add a layering piece that I threw on
this cream colored blazer from forever
21 obviously this is just kind of more
of a statement piece you don't really
need this because I think that outfit is
super cool when it's you know just kind
of a t-shirt fell boyfriend jeans ankle
boots it's kind of a cool girl outfit if
you wanted to add another statement
piece on top I think a white blazer
really makes it pop pops my god I
remember when I could never used to do
this
and then I just added a simple black
ankle bootie these for my go to last
year they're from Zara even my fat
little chubby foot can fit into them
even though they're so narrow they kind
of stretch out a little bit I've got
Flintstone feet or like I don't know I
can't even I'm embarrassed to even be
saying and that is it for look number
one in look number two I chose these
girlfriend jeans from Zara difference
between a girlfriend Gina a boyfriend
Jean is a girlfriend Jean is tapered in
the leg and at the bottom still has the
baggy err effect here of a boyfriend
Jean but it's more of like a skinny or a
straight leg towards the bottom is have
amazing stretch in them and I love the
color it's like a washed black it's not
you know it's not a true black I wanted
to make this outfit a little bit more
casual just because I feel like it's
always important to throw a mixture of
things into a lookbook compared these
with a white t-shirt which is I don't
have it with me right now because I was
I got hot sauce on it we were in the
middle of filming and I begged Bryant it
there was this place that has breakfast
tacos and I was like I'm so hungry me
too breakfast taco I took my first bite
and he was like - I was like what and I
looked out and there's hot sauce all
over my shirt so white shirt and then I
put this long cardigans so I can like
find where it ends and where it begins
this long cardigan over it to add
something to it to kind of flow with the
girlfriend Jean it's cool enough that
you can just wear a white t-shirt but um
I added this to it just to give it a
little something you know I am about my
my third piece I've always got to add
something on the top of everything then
I added this boot from Aldo which I
recently got these and I am so I love
them so much they're like the perfect
ankle bootie the perfect color they go
with black brown I am probably gonna
wear these completely out before fall is
over so these are good and they come in
black they come in this like really
pretty like cognac color I don't know
I'm I'm gonna be like
trying to own them all by the time the
season's over then I feel like I'm
missing something
oh my white t-shirt because it's in the
washing machine okay nevermind and the
last look I have these white wash
boyfriend jeans from Urban Outfitters
they are bdg and they are called the
girlfriends fit but they Knox they'e
boyfriend's I don't know what the world
they were talking about because they are
clearly a boyfriend I love the wash I
love a good light wash Jean with
especially like black I don't know why
there's something about light wash and
black that I'm obsessed with um the only
bad thing about these jeans is that the
ankle strap is like so small almost
panicked trying to get my foot out of it
earlier today I was like oh my god it's
not coming out I'm panicking it's a very
like clothes hole here that you're
working with these are great I love them
and then I chose this ma B purpley color
top from Zara
put it with oh did I get makeup on the
back how did that happen how would that
happen
oh well assessed with the sleeves can
you see the seat look how cool this is
so actually this part covers your hand
and then it's got this open like gaping
part that your hand goes into so it's so
cool and I actually put the black
version of the stop in my lookbook which
you'll see in a little book this front
is come see it's not sheer the front has
actually a double layer within the back
is sheer so if you have a really pretty
bra like a little bra lit that you can
wear with it would look really nice
under this and in my shoe is my trusty
little grey Steve Madden sandal I don't
know there's something about this color
palette that just makes me so happy and
I'm always such a black person like I'm
always in blocks and Gray's and you know
that kind of thing like a little vampire
no I'm
loving that I chose this color palette
versus my normal go to black so yay me
everything is going to be links below
including what I'm wearing right now
I'll link that below also because I
always forget and you guys asked me and
I'm like I don't know so I'm going to be

style video I hope you loved it I really
really enjoy doing this one because I
love the boyfriend Jean and I just think
you can do so much with a boyfriend Jean
because it's kind of like the
centerpiece of your outfit you know as
you can see I put it with a bootie and a
plain black t-shirt and it still looks
cool because your jeans are like a
little baggy
