episode of how to style we're talking
about culottes today couldn't be happier
this is my favorite one so far fall
coming and these outfits are fall
inspired so mix my little heart so happy
I put four looks in this lookbook today
because I couldn't just pick three and
so let me know if you guys think four is
just like a little too much or if four
is perfect and you'd rather see four in
sensory let me know also I'm sure you
noticed like a few videos back that I'm
doing it differently now I'm doing my
talking parts in the beginning and my
lookbook at the end I just separated it
that way if you're interested in one
thing you can watch it and if you're
interested in another thing you can just
fast forward so makes easier for you
guys to kind of watch what you want for
those of you who like all of it I love
you and finally the look look is Liza
finally we have a lookbook
to sign up for this amazing lookbook and
to learn more about it goes to Wi-Fi
haricot slash lookbooks
i'm gonna post it here just so you can
physically see it and i'll post it all
in that description below so since this
is going to be a long one let's just go
ahead and get straight into of the
outfit description in nope number one I
started off with these look how small
this is
I promise it expands this is like child
sized but it gets like way bigger once
you wear it these are navy stephanie
culottes from H&amp;amp;M they're definitely a
large kulit almost looks like a skirt
but when you walk it's nice because it
the pants flow in the wind so I love
these and they're dressy so they're
perfect for work or if you just have
some kind of dressy occasion and you
don't want to wear a typical skirt or
like trousers this is a great
alternative for any kind of professional
setting I love this color of navy it's
like one of those rich blue navy
so I love it then I paired that with
this pretty little lacy peach colored
top from Zara I was really worried about
this because I bought it when I was
super tan and
looked amazing and I was so afraid that
I was going to put it on and like be
camouflaged like it's the same color as
my skin I put it on and I was like oh
it's actually not bad so I went with
this and obviously this is not like so
professional to wear to work because
it's um see-through but you can
definitely add an alternative you can do
like a white button-down you could do a
blazer I personally love this color Navy
with a black blazer I think maybe in
black so pretty I probably said that
before but just in case I haven't that's
my thoughts on that and then when in
doubt the grey Steve Madden sandals I
thought that this was a good color
palette I don't know I thought blocks
with like a little bit too harsh for
such like a light colored top so I went
with a gray sandal um instead of a black
but I would stick with something lighter
I don't know if I would do blacks do
something like planks are so amazing
with like they're falling apart
I obviously love them my next pair of
culottes are these pretty little printed
ones from Zara I saw these on the hanger
I actually walked past them a few times
the first time I walked by and I was
like nope nope second time I walked by I
was like ooh maybe and then the third
time I walked by I was like okay I love
them they're such a good fit and they're
not a super white culotte so like you
can tell that they're a pant it's not
like a faux Kurt I love the tie I
thought the rope topple tie with so cute
I paired these guys with a light biker
Bowery top and I'm happy to say that
this is now live also you can go
purchase this this is the best white
tops it's thin but it's not see-through
all I wear and should finally show you
guys what I wear under this I wear
they're just like they just cover your
boobies they're just like little
stickers and they stick right on your
boobs and small boobs so I can
we do this but I understand people with
bigger boobs need a strap of frost still
works this is awesome I love this I love
how the sleeves are Zillah we and then
they cinch at the wrist so you get that
effective ability sleeve when it's long
but then you can also push them up and
you don't lose the effect of the the
pretty billow of the sleeve I took this
in but you can definitely leave it
tucked out I'm just not so tall and by
four so I feel like I needed to tuck it
in
I thought wife was really pretty with it
if you wanted to do an all-black look
you could I think this would be pretty
with like a fitted black shirt maybe a
blazer or some kind of like cropped
leather jacket would be really pretty
with these then I added this little
block heel from Zara I don't know I
thought the color palette was nice it
needed something nude since I'm wearing
a white top I did want to do a black
shoe and have all blacks on the bottom
and then white off the top added a new
to kind of balance out the white on the
top and my next pair of culottes are
some so what leather ones that I love I
just think they're so different unique
and I got these last year from Zara seen
them everywhere I think likes Nasty Gal
has some misguided ASOS so I think a lot
of places are carrying them now I wish
these were a little bit more
high-waisted
so I think the ones that I have found on
previous sites are high-waisted like I
wish these were you can do these for
work you can do them for going out I
think it's just like a really cool piece
tab I paired it with I just got this top
so the tag is still on it because I'm
gonna do a haul a haul o paired it with
this sheer guy from forever 21 look how
cute this IBAs oh we're obsessed we love
the sleeve I just like I'm obsessed with
this this you can like layer underneath
dresses you can layer it underneath top
it is so perfect and it was only 1290
kind of a no-brainer underneath it I put
this little bralette from Urban
Outfitters he's cute only thing about
this though is my boob popped out of it
like all the time I'll be wearing it and
I just feel like my boobs come out like
oh my god get back in there you little
guys this is by pins and needles and I
think they carry this brand all the time
of brog since I was like out in the day
filming I didn't want to do just like a
triangle bra like I would if I were
going out so I did something like a
little bit more top looking to
underneath this going out you cannot
always do um you know whatever bra you
want and I paired it with my Topshop
sandals keep selling out online and they
keep restocking so I think it's
something that they just carry and they
sell out and then get it back in my god
Ryan something's on fire back there see
it what is going on it mouse is kind of
scary um so they make these in like a
grey suede a tan suede v they make all
different colors and they're really
great love this little all-black kind of
sexy vampy look with like a dark lip I
think this is a cool look for like going
out at night and the last pair of
culottes that I styled are these denim
ones I love these I love the idea of a
Democrat and I haven't seen very many
lately so I'm gonna try to find you guys
out there a little bit high-waisted I
don't know they're just they're such a
good fit like they're not so baggy
throughout the whole leg they're kind of
more of a straight cool and I just put
this mock neck super thin shirt from
Free People underneath it tucked it in
and then added this pink bomber before
this pink bomber in my snapchat and you
guys were asking me so many of you ask
me where I got it on it from Zara so
they don't have it anymore unfortunately
but I went and searched for you guys and
they have like four or five on ASOS that
are way cuter than this one I was like
no I need to get another one now cuz
they're cuter than my well I will link
those below this color so great for fall
because it's like you can pair it with
those Mavi purples and blacks and gray
I think it's like a really good um like
color addition to that type of wardrobe
I just have like an ice battle um and it
was so weird oh of course I paired it
with I'm sure you guys just so sick of
seeing these I'm sorry but I'm gonna
keep wearing them again I love them one
of my accessories I added this headband
from Zara just like a sequence kind of
mint green and orange orange yellow
printed headband got it just added a
little sparkle a little something to it
every time I like walked past a mirror I
was like oh my goodness little sparkly
