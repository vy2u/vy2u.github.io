episode of how to style today we are
styling dresses for fall it's not a
super heavy layering video this is just
kind of more for fall not so much for
winter yet I'm trying to accommodate
everyone on the west coast to the East
Coast so it's kind of a mix of
in-between warmer and cooler weather
you're just some dresses that I have had
on repeat ever since I purchased them so
I thought why not do I have style
dresses for fall okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and get into the outfit
description so let's get started
for my first dress I had to throw in a
slip dress and I'm obsessed with this
one from Zara I'm sure you guys saw this
in my haul but I haven't styled it yet
in a video so I am super excited to wear
this out styling for you guys I love the
lace detailing and I love the gold color
and the black I think this is just so
great for fall but it's got a silhouette
for spring and summer so I think this is
a good all year-round
staple slip dress I just put a basic
mock neck shirt underneath it you were
going for a more dressy look you could
do a sheer bodysuit some sort of fun
sleeve with the necktie but I'm keeping
this a little bit more simple today
because I don't really get so dressed up
I don't really have the need to get
dressed up so I'm just pairing this
basic mock neck underneath it and I'm
adding more of a sleek soft booty from
Alice and Olivia I wanted to do
something a little sexier a little bit
more sleek because this is a delicate
sexier dress actually paired it with the
thicker ankle boot and then it didn't
look right so I grabbed this guy it's a
soft boot meaning it kind of fits you
like a sock in the ankle it's tighter
it's stretchy it's flexible so that is
outfit number one for my second look I
went with a super printed lace dress
from Zara and it's got an open shoulder
where's the sleeve really cool ruffle
details I'm obsessed with this this
dress doesn't really need styling it
doesn't really need any layers or any
big jewelry all it needs is like a good
black bootie
because the dress itself is the outfit
think if you you know are looking for
something to kind of grab and go but you
want to look styled I think a printed
detailed ruffled dress is definitely a
good go-to I'm from Zara I can't
remember if I said that or not and what
size are you the tag I just say that I
hate dresses that have the slip built
into them because I get so tangled up I
remember trying this on in the fitting
room I almost had like an anxiety attack
because I got stuck in the slip and the
slip was like twisted and then the dress
was outside my body and it was like a
situation X I'm just thinking about it's
giving me the sweats and I paired it
with my new ankle booties from Steve
Madden I don't know if I've styled these
yet in my videos but I've been wearing
these non-star pretty comfortable I
wouldn't say there are my most
comfortable boot but they're very easy
to walk in for a long amount of time
I love the pointed toe and I love how
the heel gets like little you know
fatter towards the bottom for my next
outfit this is either something that you
are going to love or hate but my P piece
is the sweater dress from Zara and it is
like an oversized best friend that I've
been living in the past week
got a nice mock neck it's huge oversized
and I'm an oversized girl so those of
you who don't like oversized things are
going to hate this up it's gray but it's
got like little specks of blue in it so
it's really pretty with light blue denim
for my girls that are in little bit
warmer clonk climates
I would suggest wearing this with just
ankle booties that's how I wore it
actually yesterday and it was so cute
with just ankle booties done it was like
72 73 degrees yesterday today is cooler
I am pairing it with a black flare from
Alice and Olivia I love my black players
I haven't styled them just yet on the
channel so I'm excited to throw these in
today planning on doing a full how to
style flare videos soon so that is
coming I just love the look of an
oversized sweater flare jeans a hat like
I think it there's something so cool
about it and I'm obviously pairing my
black hat from forever 21 with it
sweater you could do leather pants
leather leggings skinny jeans flares
light washed black I think this is such
a good fall sweater to have a little bit
my last look you guys know I'm obsessed
with this romper from Zara weight is
everything in this thing from Zara huh
interesting
Azhar around not that long ago so I'm
like styling all this Zara stuff is a
romper from Zara I put this in my life
by her lookbook I put this in my Hall
but I have yet to stylist so I'm super
excited to do that today a Trumper with
the coolest little flowy batwing sleeves
that get a little smaller at the end it
looks like a dress but it's definitely
not stands you can wear this flowy or
you can belt it and today I'm going to
belt it as I am putting some over the
knee boots with it and if I don't belt
it it's a little too long and you don't
see where my leg is like my shaft of my
boot goes into the shorts so I'm putting
a belt with it to make it a little
shorter but again if it's a little
warmer where you are you can definitely
leave it flowy add an ankle bootie and
it's like so cute
you feel like it it for a while but you
won't tell me
all of you buddy

yeah
