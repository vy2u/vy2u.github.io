you just made the worst mistake
was everything all not
No
it
Oh
again
welcome back to my channel today I'm
doing a how-to style not so much over
the knee boots but more of like a knee
boot I don't really know what to call
them except for just an avenue boot
didn't over the knee boot last year but
I decided to style something a little
bit different because I do feel like my
stretch suede over the knee boots are
just so dressy and I really only pull
them out for special occasions it's not
something that I grab on a daily weekly
or even like just maybe a couple of
times a month basis sighted to style
this guy for you and these are Steven by
Steve Madden love that they're more of
lip slope more of a wide shot so they're
not tight on my leg feel like that's
more of a modern look Robin and over the
knees stretch suede boot witnessed which
has been around for quite a while just
kind of a modern new fresh look
something that's casual but can be
dressy at the same time I just feel like
it is a little bit more versatile than
my stretched suede over the knee boot
but you will get out of this video is
some outfit inspiration to pull out your
boots and to you know don't be afraid to
try new styles oh it has feels my
suitcases in the frame sorry don't be
afraid to style new new a new style of
boot you know just because the stretch
over the new suede boot has been around
forever you know in the Stuart Weitzman
one is very popular it's a great
investment but don't be afraid to have
like a fresh modern take on a new style
of boot today I styled three outfits was
totally gonna do for for you guys but I
woke up and it is pouring rain outside
so you are getting three outfits but
it's three very different outfits as you
saw in the lookbook so I hope you're
happy with it for this look I did this
black dress from Topshop and I just love
this dress so much I have a shorter
colorful version of this same dress and
I just love the silhouette and I love
that it's lace up in the back I don't
know if you can see but for work if you
wear a blazer over its like casual with
some maybe like military
lace-up style boots so I just love black
dresses like this that have fun
detailing and just are so different and
unique and I did is this harness belt
with it I don't know where this starts
and where it stops this is really cute
so it's just like a it's basically a
hardest belt it almost gives you like an
overall effect like a stud overall
effect and then it belts in the back but
it's fun I feel like you could do this
with a t-shirt you can do it the sweater
you can do it with a romper so I just
feel like cool things like this really
take just kind of a basic piece to the
next level did the boot with it just
because I really wanted to show you guys
how much I love the boot under the dress
look that's one of my favorite looks I
just think it looks so like chic
especially in an office environment
wearing like a miniskirt with like an
over the knee boot up into it and I
really like the white shaft boot
whenever it goes up into the skirt
because I feel like when you're when
you're wearing a skin-tight boot it
almost looks like tights like tights
with built in feet so with this that
kind of gives you that like Oh slouchy
boot slouchy skirt and then more of like
a fitted top so that's kind of a look I
was trying to go for with this next I
did this comfy a sweater from Zara and I
will say the first time I put this on it
itches so bad and Jenna has it too and
she was like doesn't it feel like little
ants fighting you all over your body and
I was like yeah but someone said if you
wash it then the itch goes away and I
washed it and it's actually not as bad
as it was but it's still kind of itchy
so definitely gonna be layering a shirt
under this I love the sleeve I just
think it's such a cool slouchy
effortless kind of big sweater cozy look
which I love set it with basic black
jeans and the boots because I was going
for a super casual look and then I
paired it Baker boy hat with it because
I just feel like it kind of took the
outfit like in a complete turnaround I
feel like when you out of Baker boy hats
in an outfit it just kind of makes it a
little bit more trendy and a little bit
more like you tried rather than just
throwing on a big sweater and heading
out the
don't get me wrong I love that look but
I also really love my paper boy hat the
next outfit was inspired by me checking
the weather that day because I'm going
home for Thanksgiving and the weather in
Texas is like 70 degrees like 72 degrees
and I was like okay I need to like
represent the people who were in a
little bit warmer climate and it was
actually warmer that day in New York so
I wasn't I wasn't freezing cold but I do
want to try to cater to everyone's
climate so I did some sway shorts which
I cannot here they are these shorts
they're suede they are great fall and
winter shorts with tights obviously when
it gets cold wear some tights wear some
over-the-knee boots but I just like love
the dimension like the different texture
and dimension of boots tights and shorts
because you've got like suede
sheer tired and then leather I just
think it's like a really good
combination overall I did not do tights
just because my tights are in storage
still and I need to go get them but yeah
at types if you need to if not just show
a little bit of leg really love whenever
you have shorts kind of short like this
you have like a high high boots where
just like a little bit of your leg is
showing I think that's like one of my
favorite looks with shorts or skirt did
this tweed kind of cardigan blazer
jacket thing just love the colors on
this I love the fringe this is actually
really great belt it if you kind of
crisscross it and belt it it is so cute
I just wanted to do like an all-black
look with like a pop of texture in color
and I was really happy with the way this
look turned out it was kind of exactly
what I was going for I wish my shorts
were just a tad longer but they're
elastic waist so they kept like riding
up ya can do a skirt you could do you
could even do this look with jeans or
trousers but I don't know I really love
cardigans like this because I don't know
I can like wrap this up when I'm at home
lounging or I can wear it out so I
really love pieces like this okay so
those are the three looks that I have
for you guys I really hope that you
loved them and also let me know your
face

to ask you guys because if you're liking
certain pieces and I can keep styling
