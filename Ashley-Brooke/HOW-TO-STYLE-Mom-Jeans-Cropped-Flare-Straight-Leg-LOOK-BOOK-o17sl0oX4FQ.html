episode of how to style I think one of
these days I'm going to change up my
intro and not say the same thing over
and over it's gonna it's gonna come
unexpected you're not gonna know it's
happening until it happens but today we
are styling mom jeans and cropped flares
it started out as just a crop players
video but then I was like you know I'm
getting more requests for mom jeans so
I'm gonna do both it styles my bursary
looks I styled the same pair of mom
jeans and then on my last look I did
cropped wear because I feel like they
kind of tie hand-in-hand the pair of mom
jeans that I styled are actually my DIY
uneven hem denim denim that I 7 what I
just say
these are the jeans that I actually did
the DIY hem so I will link that here so
you guys can go check that out if you're
wondering how I got this uneven hem it's
pretty good if I do say so myself
these are in my opinion so perfect
they're high-waisted they're super
stretchy the color is so good like I I
couldn't ask for a better pair both of
these styles are gonna be big for fall
and then what skinny jean is like a
staple I feel that this like monste I
love Jean and this crops flare is just
something that you're going to be seeing
a lot of and it's just a good
alternative to a pair of skinny jeans
obviously you can't wear them with
everything but I think it is a good
alternative to a lot of things because
um some mom Jean and the crop player are
both crossed you kind of have to be
careful what shoe you put it so you
don't shorten your lives if you're going
to do an ankle bootie with either it
needs to be an ankle bootie that's
tighter in the ankle otherwise um I feel
like it just makes your legs look
shorter I always do my ankle booties
from Zara because they are so narrow in
the ankle you want it to look nice and
sleek you want to have a crop flare and
then a skinny ankle that way makes your
legs look slimmer and it also makes them
look longer
not so stumpy if you pair it with an
ankle bootie that doesn't quite fit your
ankle as well I think that's the trick
to where people get a little hesitant
about wearing that because they think it
that it makes their legs look shorter
but it is all about the shoe that you
put with it not my little ash tips for
styling crop wears mom jeans kind of
come in all all not my hair oh no that's
all what's happened I will go ahead and
start with my my mom Jean I feel weird
saying that because I don't say that
often and I keep saying it a lot and I'm
it's confusing me or my Birds outfit I
paired the H&amp;amp;M jean with this off the
shoulder top from forever 21 it's got a
single ruffle across the front and
that's long-sleeved so obsessed you
cannot find this online so I left the
tag on it so I could show you guys
here's the tie if you guys want to like
take a picture of it
there you go so take a picture of that
and take it into the store they should
be able to hook you up with that this
tops with with this pair of jeans
because I feel like it really brought
out the blue color in the top I did this
black leather choker from forever 21
this ankle bootie to kind of tie in the
black on top because you've got your
black your denim and then black on the
bottom top is so curly but I wanted to
make it a little bit more edgy what I
did was I paired it you know with the
choker and then with an ankle bootie to
make it a little bit more edgy and not
so girly because this is a very girly
top it's off the shoulder it's got a
pretty ruffle and a pretty print all of
the black in it it kind of sets you up
for making something a little bit cooler
out of it so that what it is and for my
second outfit I did the uneven hem mom
Jean from H&amp;amp;M and then I paired it with
my good Old Faithful pink floyd--
vintage t-shirt from Urban Outfitters
and iPhones now chatter probably sick of
seeing me wear this because it's like
time I just run out of the house to go
run errands or something or I'm going to
go on my bike and throw this t-shirt on
because it's just one of those things
that you've had forever that is just so
soft and it's like my favorite shirt is
like so perfect with light wash because
it's got its light blue denim in it so I
did the t-shirt with the jeans and then
I did this long duster blazer over it to
add a third piece and to also add
something a little bit unexpected
because you would think with something
so edgy like a vintage t-shirt and some
high-waisted jeans that you would put a
leather jacket over it so I thought this
piece was a little bit more unexpected
than a leather jacket then I added my
French Connection slide and I'm obsessed
with these they're so comfortable and
they look so cool the keys are also
unexpected these are kind of a good
alternative to just a plain black flap
so you know if you're a lover of your
black flap step out of your comfort zone
get a pair of slides you will love them
I promise for my next outfit I Styles
see I've got a pile of stuff here I need
to calm down
H&amp;amp;M uneven hem jeans and then I added
her life Valerie's hop off the shoulder
billow sleeve I'm in sit on a layering
piece I just did this vest from Zara
this is a heavy vest by the way it's not
like a really light layering piece I
love this I think it's them a really
good layering piece if you have a cool
sleeve this is still it's sleeveless so
it's a good way to still show up your
sleeve but show that your layering game
is like on point I love this vest you'll
be seeing this a lot over the fall and
winter so definitely invest yourself in
one of these then since that outfit was
so black and white I went with a printed
shoe of my leopard loafers from Jun
London and for my last outfit I don't
know what accent that was
I did these high-waisted um crop chairs
from Zara again another one of my
favorite pair of jeans this looks just
like black and white striped turtleneck
I just loved the queenís of this outfit
it's two completely basic pieces put
together but it makes like a really cool
almost like French girl outfit all my
French girls tell me if I'm wrong I hope
I'm not because I felt super cool and
like you know I could speak French when
I wear this outfit and I added my black
hat which you probably will see at least
once every how to style video he wanted
to do a layering piece you could do a
black leather jacket you can do the
black long duster coat the reason I
didn't is because it was warming up
throughout the day and lastly shoot it I
wear I'm having a moment and to complete
my French girl outfit I added a patent
black loafer from Zara look there's a
little heel I think it elongate your
legs I think it makes you look a little
bit more stylish when you have a little
something in the back oh look I kind of
bandaid in this one that's really gross
I think I remember these hurting might
be really bad when I first bought them
so it's like one of those situations
where you just have like band-aids lined
up throughout the whole day its patent
what do you expect it like rubs your
skin off the first week that you wear
them oh you're aces you a Winston
a phone book full of numbers and name
all their main decisions keep you day
you could have found out one but you
know Jane so aren't you glad to meet me

not having junk food where you can just
like grab it all the time so just don't
keep it in your cabinets don't keep junk
food just lying around because you will
eat it even if you say or not you're
going to and I believe everything in
moderation gotta keep your sanity
