of how to style today we're styling over
the knee boots it has been requested
like a hundred times so I'm so excited
to be doing this it's the perfect time
of year it's boot season it's sweater
season get excited this is happening
hallelujah as you guys have been
requesting over in the over the knee
boots video you've also been expressing
your concerns about things that you have
going on with over-the-knee boots a lot
of you are saying that you're afraid
your legs are too big or too small or
you're too short luckily there are so
many different kinds of over-the-knee
boots out there so it's just all about
looking for you know your size your
highs your shape definitely don't waste
money and settle for a pair that aren't
flattering for your body type keep
looking the kind that I feel works best
for most body types are the suede
stretch ones whether you have a bigger
leg or a smaller leg you know if you
have a bigger leg the suede stretches
out and really stays in place and if you
have a smaller leg you know it's it's a
very small suede stretch so then it fits
you like a glove I find that the hardest
ones to fit for different body styles
are the zip up one I'm going to find you
guys some pairs that I think might work
for you and I'm gonna link them below in
the description box I did buy a pair I
think from Sam Edelman a couple of years
ago and I loved them when I tried them
on and I think I wore them for five
minutes and they were already slouched
all the way down below my knee and it
just looked terrible they were so poorly
fitted so I actually landed on a pair of
slave stretch ones that I'm absolutely
in love with and for all of you saying
that you think you're too short for over
the knee boots they definitely make all
different sizes and no shop Jessica
Berman calm has and I'll link those
below they make the over-the-knee boots
that they make them in different the
shaft types so you've got like a small
medium and a large for all of my girls
who say they're too tall to wear them I
have a friend who actually last year
she's she was so tall and she was like
every over the knee boot I get goes to
Miney so she ended up buying a Stuart
Weitzman thigh-high boots that you know
she was tall so it went above her knee
so I was like genius so perfect so if
you think you're too tall for them try
to find a thigh high boot and it should
fit you you know right where it should
right above the knee I'll go ahead and
show you guys the ones that I'm styling
today I'm styling one pair of over the
knee boots for different ways I have a
heel on them because my flat ones are in
storage and I haven't gotten my winter
stuff out yet but I do have these they
are out of four-inch heels stretch suede
with a tie right in the back and these
are by Jean Michelle Casa bot and are
fairly expensive but working for the
company that I was working for intermix
I got a really good deal on them so I
was very lucky to find such an amazing
deal on a great pair of boots I made
sure to make all my outfits be able to
incorporate a flat over-the-knee boot
too so any of the outfits that I show
you guys today definitely feel free to
add a flat one to it if that's what you
own um it works either way
so let's go ahead and I will show you
guys one in styling so my first outfit
is more of like a casual cool kind of
street style running errands type outfit
and I started with the game of these
high-waisted gray almost like a washed
out black denim from Zara they have two
busted knees and unfinished him and then
I added this sweater from forever 21
it's just a basic lace up super soft
super oversized
I've got this not like the other day so
perfect I actually left the tag on so I
could scan it and make sure that you
have the correct link below and to add
something over it I did this shearling
moto jacket moto vest actually from
forever 21 I love a good Beth and I
can't find any good vests right now I
wanted like a good
and leather best can't find it you keep
looking if you don't have any please
link it below I love you forever and
ever a little colder today when I said
I'm shooting so I am gonna put the best
on but I'll show you some clips with it
on and off so you can kind of get an
idea what it looks like yeah I think a
good vet just kind of abs add something
to any sweater it makes it look more
cozy and more layered so I love adding a
vest to an oversized sweater this is my
first outfit and again it's more of a
casual you can add a flat boot with it
um even add like a motorcycle boot if
you didn't want to do over the knees
this outfit is really good for any type
of shoe in the fall so there you go and
spoiler my next outfit I'm gonna stop
with these accents like what is that I
started with this sport slash short
skirt obviously that's what a sport is
hold on
this is something's wrong what did i do
what did i do oh this is the front it is
a skirt put the tie then the back is
short put it on and then you tie it and
then you go to skirt cool I'm styling
this guy it's like a leatherette
material so soft so Matt I love it I put
this guy underneath it this is just a
basic striped top from when Ron yeah I
need glasses I love this color
combination
I love these warm colors with like a pop
of slacks and also I don't know if you
can see that the gold has metallic
thread through it so how bold that I
love this I'm going to add a layering
piece I did my mom my mom's jacket from
forever 21 I just love how these two
colors kind of tie in together
gives it a little bit of texture and
dimension so this is a really fun jacket
it's this outfit and this is a good
outfit for you know after work going out
for drinks with friends going to dinner
going on a date I think this is just a
flirty fun sexy
he's kind of like out there outfit and
it's really just taking to basics and
like making them cool instead of having
a skirt or short you've got a sport and
instead of just like a plane right shirt
you've got this one with like metallic
detailing really about taking your
basics and you know making them a little
bit more interesting and throwing a mock
jacket Oh Chris my next outfit is
something that I kind of wanted to
incorporate for my working girl
something that you could wear to the
office I started with these um blue
denim and you can definitely do black
denim if that's more appropriate for
your work and I did a white button-down
from tarjay this is the best white
button-down in the whole entire world I
found this at Target called everyone in
my family all my friends and I'm like hi
okay what size are you I'm getting
everyone these white button-down because
they're so good and you'll see when I
have it on well actually my knocks I'm
putting a blazer on target if you're
watching this way to go they added my
black blazer over it you get a lint
roller after this thing to make it
obviously office appropriate I love this
blazer because it's long it's tailored
it's fitted but then it also has leather
detailing on the collar and on the
pockets done before my last outfit I
wanted to keep it super casual super
cool so I grabbed the same grey wash
black denim brahms are the ones I did in
the first outfit and I added my good ol
Pink Floyd t-shirt sure you guys are
sick of thing this but I mean definitely
incorporate what you have I need to get
more of these this is by junk food and
they make the best like vintage looking
t-shirts need to get more cuz I keep
wearing this one over and over and I did
my denim jacket over it I was really
torn between the denim jacket and my
leather jacket but I thought why not add
some sort of like pop of color so I did
a blue um over this with the jeans and
then the boots again with this outfit
especially like feel free to do
flat over-the-knee boot because it is a
little bit more casual but I'm styling
it today with my heel boots you'll get
the general idea of what it looks like
alright so now that I've showed you guys
