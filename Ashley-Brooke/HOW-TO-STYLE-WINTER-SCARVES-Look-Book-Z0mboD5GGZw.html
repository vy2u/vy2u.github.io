no they always say congratulations
hi guys welcome back to my channel if
you are new here my name is Ashley and
this is my how-to style series where I
basically take one item or one trend
style it three to four different ways do
a talk through and then a lookbook
around the city or wherever I'm at at
the moment
today's video is all about styling
scarves and I was really excited to
shoot this because it's been so cold
obviously it's December in New York City
so I was really happy to film this one
outside I'm just gonna kind of talk you
guys through what I picked to where
everythings from some sizing and
different things a little bit of
background behind the logic of the
outfit picking so for this outfit I went
with this polka dot scarf from Zara and
I love polka dots I think that there's
such a good print for when you want to
mix prints like you can make the big
polka dots and small polka dots polka
dots and stripes polka dots and florals
so anytime I find something polka dot
that I love it's like a neutral to me
and I just have to have it if it's
something that I love kinds of scarves I
really love layering so I did this super
long military style vest from who what
where for target and I just belted it
because this thing is so much material
swimming in fabric so I decided to belt
it with the scarf and I really love this
color combination of the olive green and
the polka dots so much going on here
like with the scarf and then the collar
to the jacket I pulled my hair back
because that's all I need is big hair
and like lots of material going on so I
pulled my hair back and did my velvet
corduroy Baker boy hi and this one is
from Zara
careful though because this is they are
sized some of Sarrus hats are sized and
this one is a small/medium I obviously
had no clue and I got the medium and it
almost makes me look like my head's two
times bigger than it is but that's fine
because I love it so are my shoes I did
these they are so comfortable and I love
that there's no hardware I love basic
booties with no hardware because then
you're not limited to what jewelry you
wear like I have these one boots from
Zara that have a bunch of silver
hardware and I always want to wear them
with
my leopard bag or my gold accessories
but it just kind of sticks out like a
sore thumb it's not good so I love when
I can find comfy boots like this that go
with everything the next outfit I saw
this camel scarf and was like I'm just
gonna make an outfit around this because
this is such a beautiful color and I
just really love it it's so soft and
it's one of those scarves that's like a
giant blanket scarf like you could wear
this as a shawl almost like a poncho or
a cape even and belts it around the
waist because it's so big but it's
really thin it's really lightweight and
thin it's not one of those really thick
itchy scarves it just kind of played
with this I wrapped it around twice
through the back of it behind my
shoulder did it over this blazer dress
and I got a size extra small in this it
is oversized it's meant to be kind of
like a boyfriend blazer but I did wear
it kind of as a dress with some leggings
with some faux leather leggings
underneath I did this boot from Dolce
Vita again another just a great boot
with no hardware so you are not limited
to what you wear it with and these are
actually very comfy I know they look
super high but they were super
comfortable we walked I think like six
blocks up to film filmed around and then
walked back and I was completely fine so
I love the pointy toe oh yeah back to
this car um so when I have big blanket
scarves like this I like to either
double wrap it or I like to just kind of
let it drape and hang down and flow you
can really just kind of play with it
like I like to put it around my neck and
just kind of see where my arms take me
sometimes you have to start over a few
times sometimes you end up like with it
around your head and like around your
neck and you're like wait this is wrong
so scarves like that are great because
you can play with them you can get
creative and that camel color just goes
with so many of my winter items so it's
like the perfect color for me I went
scarf shopping looking for a leopard
scarf and the first place I stopped I
found one and I was so excited and I
love leopard accessories I don't know
that I'm a huge fan yet of like full-on
leopard but I do love leopard
accessories like shoes and bags and
stuff like that so I got this and I just
basically paired it
with Oh cream long-sleeved top
Jean I threw a cape over it I love capes
so much they just remind me of Gossip
Girl and I used to love Gossip Girls so
when I saw this cape
and I think this cape was under 150
dollars as well and for a good good
quality outerwear piece I think that
that is a really good deal especially
for such a classic piece that you can
dress up and dress down but I did was I
put on all of my under layers I put on
my top my jeans I did my scarf I belted
the scarf and then I threw the cape over
then with this outfit I thought I needed
some sort of hardware on my shoe so I
did these from Nine West I tried to put
on some over the new boots but then I
just feel like my legs got a little lost
because the Cape almost hit the boot so
then it was just like too much going on
and lastly I did this scarf from Free
People
this is another one of those scarves
that I went out looking for I went with
the purpose I was looking for something
with long fringe at the bottom and I
found this one at free people was so
excited and the color is so beautiful it
comes in other colors as well but I
really needed a cream scarf so I got
this and I really wanted to do a cat
what is this piece of hair that's just
sticking out this is bugging me the
whole time we wanted to do a casual
outfit because all of these other
outfits were a little bit on the dressy
side so I just grabbed some basic jeans
levels inside out so some basic jeans
top with the metallic piping around the
neck and the sleeves and I did this big
cozy cardigan and I think this cardigan
only comes in one size I believe I think
comes in two sizes small and medium so I
got a small but this cardigan is it's
velvet and it's really really heavy so
it's really heavy-duty good quality I'm
obsessed with this and I just thought
that the whole outfit kind of tied in
nicely the pink top brings out the pink
stripe the denim brings out the blue
stripe and then the cream I thought just
kind of tied it nicely with everything I
really wanted to do a lighter color
scarf then for my shoe I did this one
from Nine West if I thought the piping
on the shoe tied it
with the burgundy on the cardigan and
then so I wasn't wearing one solely
black item because it looks weird when
you have all light colors on top and
then one black shoe you definitely need
a black bag to tie in the two and then
keep your light stuff in the middle this
was definitely one of my favorite how-to
styles
I just love winter clothes I love
layering I love adding belts and hats
and gloves and scarves
I just think winter clothes you can just
dress so well and like I said I love
layers so this is one of my favorite
