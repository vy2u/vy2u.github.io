episode of how to style today we are
doing the long awaited video of office
where I haven't filmed the outfits yet
because it is a like hurricane outside
today
if the lookbook is a little different
from what I'm like describing here bear
with me it's it's been a rough weather
day here in New York when I'm filming
this video what I'm choosing outfits for
work these are things that I would wear
to my work office where is dress code
every every office is different so you
know I'm not quite sure what your dress
code is but you can definitely tweak
these outfits to kind of you know match
your dress code at your job or my first
outfit my key piece were these super
high-waisted not real actually they're
not way that high-waisted but they are
super wide leg trousers I think they
look so professional so stylish great
for the office stretch your waist Bend
hello they're very comfortable for those
of you guys who sit at a desk all day
this is where it's at hello I just love
the stripes I think the stripes are so
cool so classic so modern never going to
go out of style i styled these with a
plain black top and I'm probably going
to style it with more of a dressier top
in the video but I just want to kind of
give you guys an idea of what the outfit
is gonna look like and then I'm also
going to throw a blazer over it just to
keep the look tailored looking nice this
is my blazer that um you guys have seen
in my other videos it's got leather
piping on the collar and leather on the
pocket I definitely think it's smart to
invest in a good fitting blazer whether
you have to get it tailored or whatever
have some fun ones like you know this
one has leather on it I have one with
embellished shoulders so you know
definitely play around with your Blazers
make them fun obviously have one classic
simple one that you always go to for my
next
my key item was this tweed dress from
Zara basically black-and-white tweed
with leather pockets and some stud
embellishments with some tweed fringe on
the botton I thought this was the most
like the cutest little dress it looks so
good on I love it so much
super comfortable it's a ship's dress so
it's it's not flowy but it's not tight
it just kind of goes straight down and
so we don't have to wear a blazer or
anything over it I grabbed this bodysuit
from Zara it is a mock neck sheer
sleeved bodysuit that way it gives it a
little something fun when the sleeves
stick out they're super sheer and it's
got this nice little wrist detailing I
love this I love layering body suits
underneath tank tops to wear it gives
you like that cool dimension of a
different kind of sleeve then with this
you can do over the knee boots or you
can do a simple ankle bootie um I think
this is too long on me to wear with over
the knee boots I think my boot shaft
might go up into the dress so I will
probably pair this look with an ankle
bootie of some sort so that's it for
that one is for my next outfit my key
piece were these supercool jogger
trousers from H&amp;amp;M they are actual
joggers but they're also a trouser so
they're this really thick nice material
like a normal work trouser would be and
then they get tailored towards the
bottom so they come in towards the
bottom to make them a little bit more of
a skinny and I believe I'm going to do a
white button-down over it like an
oversized kind of boyfriend look haven't
quite decided yet but I'm either going
to go with a white button-down or a nice
black blouse I haven't decided so you
can do either one add a black heel a
cool bag and you are so good to go these
trouser joggers are everything I like
I'm going to wear them with a t-shirt
and I'm also going to wear them to work
so can't go wrong super versatile
versatile get me sleeve it's a cool like
let me show you guys what I'm wearing
this is a romper from Zara like look at
this this is so beautiful
I put this in my Hall on Friday so you
guys would have already seen this in my
hall but it's basically like a flowy
romper I don't know it looks like a big
ball of fabric right now but go to my
Hall so you can see what it looks like
it cute put my next outfit is going to
be this is my key piece to the outfit
and it is this metallic silver midi
pleated skirt and I am obsessed with
this I love this skirt so much it's from
Zara it was only how much is that I just
got it 69 and you can wear this with
over-the-knee boots you can wear it with
ankle booties heels I just think this
sort is everything and it looks so much
more expensive than it is so I'm going
to keep this skirt super casual I'm just
going to do this ribbed mock neck
long-sleeve shirt tucked into it and I'm
also just going to do a basic black
ankle bootie because I think that this
skirt is just the whole outfit it's so
cool it's your statement piece I love it
so much so all of you guys you like to

promise it's so cool so now that I
showed you guys what I'm styling today

black ankle booties with silver buckles
all the way down they're so cool on I
just think they add so much to any
outfit you could do what black jeans and
kind of an oversized t-shirt and these
boots and like a cool bag and it's like
a cool girl outfit you know I love cool
girl outfit they are very similar to the
Chloe
susannah boots that are I believe $1,200
so I thought these were a good
alternative because you know living in
New York I'm walking around constantly
my shoes get absolutely ruined so I try
not to invest too much money in a single
pair of shoes because they just get so
dirty I step in like
and it's like literally and these were
$39 and so worth it I'm gonna wear these
so much during the fall my second pair
of shoes are these from Steve Madden
I am so obsessed with these eyes oh your
socks in them yes they're mine don't
worry I think these are so cold look at
the heel look how thick that is it's you
know one of those heels that gives like
a skinny effect from the side and then
gets fatter and it's pointy toe which I
love I think a pointy toe looks so nice
and so modern and so I don't know just a
little bit more stylish shape are
actually tighter around my ankle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
