today I'm doing a clothing haul of some
things that I have purchased over the
past like two to three months a lot of
it still has tags on it so don't judge
me but this is because the weather has
been so cold here in New York that I
haven't even been able to wear a lot of
this stuff and I'm just kind of
accumulating spring stop and summer
stuff and trying to get it all done guys
car rides on stark alert he's right
there comes in no kids on scarf alert in
case it like does something funny
because it keeps unraveling all right
let's get started into what the whole um
went away I wanna make first let's start
with dresses first I have this little
jumper from Topshop I can turn it around
this little jumper from Topshop um like
as overall dress so it's like denim
material it's blue and white striped
buttons on the side I plan on wearing it
a little bit more casual maybe with like
some sneakers or something but anyway I
thought this was super cute and I had to
heaven next is look this is gonna be an
issue it's like the worst thing about
wearing off the shoulder tops is that
every time you like raise your arms like
so you're like a little dinosaur like I
can only go go up to here
next is a dress that I got from Nasty
Gal and I'm
gonna go ahead and post a video right
here next to me of me wearing it because
you can't really see what's happening
when I hold it up like this um it's
basically like cinch in the waist and
it's got a super low V right here and
then a super low V in the back and it's
not like some batwing sleeves alright
the good thing about this dress is I
think you can wear it with sandals and
just kind of make it casual or you can
do heels and make it kind of a nighttime
thing so that is what I loved about it I
had to have it next is this dress from
H&amp;amp;M and it's this like heavy it is like
a heavy duty dress but I loved how it
has the little grommet balls I just made
that vert up I don't know I just thought
it was super girly and it's flowy and
it's pretty and it's so hard to find a
white dress that isn't completely or
even just like a little bit see-through
like even if it's a little bit
see-through it's still see-through so
this dress has a really thick lightening
in it which is what I loved about it and
it's super well it's not lightweight
because it's really heavy but it's um
you know the material is really really
thin so it's not something that you're
gonna like burn up in in the summer yeah
had to have that am I gonna say had to
have that again yep wear the tops I
found in this shirt at H&amp;amp;M and it's kind
of a peachy color it's got little rose
gold purple and silver little leaves on
them I guess those are leaves and then
it has silver studs at the bottom
and it's also cute because it ties on
the waist right here so it's not so
shapeless you know you can tie as tight
as you want and get yourself a little
bit of a waist
oh and I'll stay order and on hope it's
my deodorant not someone elses my next
top is another Nasty Gal purchase I went
to Nasty Gal when I was in LA at the one
in Santa Monica
and I just love the way it's laid out it
was not like so much merchandise in it
it's like all spread out and it's super
clean and I really really loved it in
there so wait what's where's the front
so here is the top that I got from Nasty
Gal the bottom is just kind of
embroidery floral and it's got a super
flowy sleeves and the back closes with
two ties so other than that it's like
completely backless um I know I love
anything with embroidery and ruffles my
next top is a top that I had to have
from Topshop it's tangled so I got this
one from Topshop it's got little
cactuses all over it or calf died a
little cacti I pretty much love
everything about this top I love the
cactuses I love the embroidery on the
top I love the tassel what is this
sleep strapped there we go and then it
also got another little tassel hanging
here from the side so this was super
cute it's very flowy it's very summery
and reminded me of home Texas so I love
this one I'm gonna keep saying I love
everything cuz I love it and this is one
of my most recent purchases from Zara um
it's like a little cropped top it's
pretty cropped
I like the colors in it though and I
love the buttons down the front
so you can actually wear it open as a
jacket if you want to put a little tank
top or something under it it's really
cute that way also um but I mostly love
the colors I love this seafoam green and
I love how you know the colors aren't so
bright they're a little bit muted it
reminds me of like water it's got a
little bell sleeve I'm not a huge fan of
like a really crazy bell sleeve so this
is about as far as I'll go with a bell
sleeve next is this top that I got from
H&amp;amp;M I love the color I thought it was
just a really pretty top because of the
ruffle detailing on the sleeve oh it's
about sleep so maybe I don't hate them
as much as I thought so I love the print
I love the ruffles and I just thought
this was a really cute girly top maybe
to wear tucked into like a black skirt
or even just with like some black skinny
jeans or something I thought it was kind
of interesting so
okay moving on to the bottom I have two
pairs pairs pair two pair of shorts that
I was going to show you these from Zara
okay don't laugh because I can just
picture myself like in a retirement home
wearing these shorts with like a visor
on and some white sneakers
I promise I'll style them cute I know
you guys are probably like they're
disgusting but their little Bermuda
shorts I think they're cool
so don't worry I'll style them cute I
won't put a visor or a fanny pack with
them the next pair of shorts I am
thinking about returning because they're
super cute they are vintage Levi's which
I know these are from Urban Outfitters
but I know like urban or it's eeeh
redone denim you know they all take old
Levi's and kind of remake them into
something a little bit more modern and
cool so I got these vintage Levi's from
urban and I like I got them home when I
tried them on and I bent over and I was
like I feel a little breeze on my butt
and so I turned around and there's like
a rip on the butt like right on your
butt crease so I don't know if I'm going
to keep these because I feel like the
first time you know I like spread my leg
out they're just going to rip all the
way through so these are a maybe but I
thought they were super cool and they're
kind of long and kind of Bermuda II okay
now I'm just making up words
my next pair of denim is also another
pair of redone Levi's and I also got
these from urban as well so they're kind
of high-waisted actually they're not
high-waisted at all and they've got
little tweed patches here and on this
leg
and also on the poking poke it
I don't know if you guys knew this about
urban but if you go shop at their store
and they have items that someone having
returned from online you can repurchase
them at 50% off so these were $60 but
since someone returned these I got them
for 30 weight math 30 that's right um
definitely ask them if they have a
section next time you go where people
live return things online it's a really
cool like shopping hack to know so my
next bottom is from Zara and it is this
here we go with the shirt thing again it
is just a super textured kind of floral
leaf printed midi skirt so it hits me
like below the knee but above the ankle
and it sits pretty high on my waist and
I love this I love all the colors in it
I feel like it would be really nice with
like a denim shirt or just I mean
anything with any of these colors I
thought it was just so pretty and I just
loved it so much I just bought this
little t-shirt from H&amp;amp;M to kind of wear
with it because I thought oh that's a
pretty color and I'll just spot it $24
and I think this is a pretty color for
spring and summer when you're nice and
tan and just one aware t-shirt lastly
I'm going to show you some shoes that I
have I've been buying a lot of shoes
lately because I when I move from Texas
I generally bring a lot of my sandals
I've only got four pairs to show you but
um they're all so different
well actually this my first pair which I
am the most excited about because I love
them so much are these zara denim little
block heel sandals and i got these on
Poshmark brand new the tag is still on
them for $40 um so let's hop off they
were 80
I found them on Poshmark and I love them
and they've never been worn so if you
don't have Poshmark
I recommend you download it on your
phone because you can really really find
so many good things on there that are
practically brand-new and denims like
really really in this season so I'm
going to be on trend with this show next
we have these kind of the same idea
these little gray suede black heel
sandals from Steve Madden and I don't
have anything I don't have any gray
shoes in my closet so I thought this was
a really good neutral to have to go with
anything black or white you know just
something to kind of brighten up my
outfit a little bit I think this is a
great color and they also have this shoe
in tan and black I believe but they're
super cheap I think there were only like
$80 and super comfortable can wear these
to work they've got a low heel so they
comfy and I love sets cookies my next
flat I got from Aldo and their needs
just like nude sparkly at the same time
flats and I just thought they were
really pretty show you kind of a
close-up
yeah thank you so if you're looking for
a new flat but you don't want something
just basic and nude I recommend these
are very comfortable I've worn them once
but I wore them all day they were like
great on my feet though and my last shoe
is another block heel got those all
block kills
I like a block heel and walking all the
time here so block heel is good these
are just a new kind of the same color as
the flat I just showed you lace-up block
heel scandal use my words and they lace
up twice in the front and then have a
little gold tie in the back that just
kind of ties around your ankle I was so
excited to find these because they
reminded me of the Aqua Zara
flats the ones that lace up the color is
great it's like a blush nude color
they're super comfortable I wore them
all day yesterday and this is new but I
decided to wear it this is from Zara and
it's blue hard to describe it when I'm
wearing it but this was super cheap too
I think this was like 20 bucks and I
think it just kind of dresses up any
little you know basic what's that oh
yeah
Zara $25 I think I could be lying but
it's somewhere around there and I will
post a link to if I can find all of this
stuff online I'll post a link below so
you guys can shop those items online so
yeah I love you know in the comments
below if you want to see any more style
videos and you know if you want to seek
anything else let me know
don't forget to follow me on snapchat
Instagram go like my Facebook page I
keep all that up to date on what's going
on when I'm shooting what I'm shooting
when everything's coming out go follow
me on there I've always kept really hot
I just know and again thanks for
watching and I will see you on my next
video bye I kind of came up with these
roles after I moved to New York because
you know I don't have a whole lot of
clothes but I have a small closet that
my medium amount of clothes don't quite
fit into very well so having these or
small roles has really helped me put
outfits together get ready in the
morning because as soon as I open my
closet all I see is like a lot of
material mashed together into one tiny
little space and we all have different
budgets on what we like to spend on
clothes and fortunately these rules
apply if you spend $100 on my bond
clothes or if you spend $2,000 a month
on clothes you know don't think you need
all of these clothes to look look
stylish and feel good about yourself
they work for me so I really really hope
that they work for you as well all right
so let's get this video what's started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
