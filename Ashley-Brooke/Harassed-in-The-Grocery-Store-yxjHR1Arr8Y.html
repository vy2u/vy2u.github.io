so I deserve these flowers for myself
and you like rub the balls like on your
face cold so it helped reduce this
reduces the swelling in puffiness said
boxers do that yeah I think during
fights think you're like when you're
getting pounded in the face you start
swelling so the cup man will press of
like a below-zero plate of Steel no way
on their faces I'm gonna invest in
Weiner in balls because now I feel like
today's my rest day so I had no Jim no
cardio so I just see like rust my body
um Thursdays are always breast days so I
kind of like really love Thursdays now
I'm about to go in my room and film
something for Friday's video which is
tomorrow so I'm a little bit behind I
got kind of busy yesterday and didn't
get to film so I'm filming like an
office series I think I'm I'm thinking
it's gonna be like a three or four part
series just kind of all about like
office wear and like how to look stylish
really excited about that so I'm gonna
go film at John's coming in then we're
gonna do some lipo magazine work and
it's gonna be kind of a chill day
happy Sunday today is a glorious day
because I filmed and edited my whole
yesterday so today is just like mine to
do whatever I want
okay I worked for like two hours this
morning on the video but the rest today
is for me and so I'm gonna spend it
cooking and baking because today is
cheat day number two and last week I
totally blew my first cheat day because
he went a little cupcake bakeshop and I
just like went ham and ate so much and I
was like nauseous for a three day so
today I'm taking it slow I've already
had one cupcake and I'm gonna bake some
stuff we are about to run across the
street I found hey really quick so today
this morning I asked Brian I was like
okay we can either do loaded nachos or
homemade pizza and then we can like save
the next one for next week so guess
which one Ryan picked he picked both so
we are having as heat as Ryan says
nachos not just for an appetizer and
pizza for the actual dinner so let's not
forget what you had it at the end too so
okay and then we're making ya know baked
carrot cake bars and raw balls raw balls
and you just like hanging out right now
are you having the best day with mommy
yes ma'am eyebrows are healing nicely if
you guys missed the last vlog I got my
eyebrows touched up my micro bleeding so
they're healing I still haven't gotten
them wet so there's still a little ink
in them so they're kind of dark but I
think they're healing nicely
I'm also gonna take a couple hours out
of the day I got Adobe Illustrator so
I'm going to teach myself how to do that
time comes experience and
kind of how things work you know you
can't expect to just know something you
have to teach yourself so that's kind of
the beauty of putting in the work I
don't know what I just said I winter
grocery store uniform
it's hasn't failed me still going strong
Ryan and I have both had the worst
allergies this week he's been like
stopped up and nose running at the same
time if that's even possible and I've
had the worst sore throat and I think
we're both finally starting to feel like
normal people today so thank God are you
feeling any better
yeah hey hello
hello Daniel haven't seen you in a way
oh when I was like when I was in the
grocery store I got harassed by a drunk
guy in line so I deserved these flowers
for myself Stella you're so rude Daniel
tried to say hi to you and usually just
flew right by him not cool
oh my god eres the drunk I never asked
me in life get me crazy oh my god what
is he doing here
oh he's trying to get up they were
telling him he needed to leave did he
follow me over here you didn't stop
cashews soaking for my cashew nacho
cheese for the nacho so now I think I'm
gonna start making the no-bake bars I
mean no big balls because I think they
have to sit in the fridge
who's more dire to fetch to you or
Stella we just i got like everything
ready to bake my carrot cake i got
everything ready for the pizza and the
nachos and then our oven not working so
call maintenance so maintenance is
seeing they have to get approval that
they can replace the oven so we might be
able to make the nachos so you can just
like warm them up in the microwave but
my cake and the pizza screwed I'm making
cashew nacho cheese right now for the
nachos so I'm kind of nervous but I've
been soaking these cashews all day I
cannot believe how much this tastes like
cheese you might even say it's nuts
oh my homemade lemon buttercream this
right here
amazing okay because it has a lot of
this so the good news is we got a new
weapon came through new oven second good
news is that these nachos are so good
nachos it very good news
oh my gosh they are to be celebrated
this is only a 3/4 cup of soaked cashews
and it made like a ton of cashew cheese
morning guys it is 6:00 a.m. I'm about
to make my coffee right in my five
minute journal and I'm gonna go do my
cardio
it's cardio time and yes I'm wearing the
same shirt that I had on yesterday it's
clean I didn't do anything in it alright

vlog just so abruptly yesterday I cannot
tell you how much food we ate I would
gentlemanly googled while I was in bed
how to be not full like how to be not so
full there's so much food that we didn't

was like like oh my god we forgot to
like the rest of our dinner but neither
