eyeshadow kind of look today I've gotten
a few requests from you asking for a
holiday I shot a look and I'm just gonna
pick my favorite color of the holidays
when it comes to two eyeshadows which is
cranberry so that's what we're gonna do
today and if you aren't following me on
social media I'm gonna do a self plug
right here and just tell you to follow
me on instagram snapchat twitter and my
facebook page i will post the links at
the end of the video so you guys can
look at those so i on right now is my
foundation and my eyebrows for my
foundation i mixed my becca ultimate
coverage complexion cream and my
Maybelline fit me foundation of matte
and poreless I mixed these two together
because I do put a tanning stuff on my
face so my face but my face is a little
bit darker I just had more of this to
kind of balance out the lighter color
mix that's right booger or like what is
up again for my eye shadow I just use my
NYX powder with my mac eyeshadow brush
that has seamanship jump off the table
put a link to it down below so you can
look at it
now that my face and my eyes are done
I'm gonna go in with the lips now for my
liner and using Rimmel London in the
color zero to zero rich and I love
useless before it's a great great great
color and I'm using my NYX butter and
lipstick in the colour licorice I'm not
going to use a whole lot of it because
it is so dark and I don't today
I'm just going to kind of fill in my
lips with this um lip liner because I
think the color is so great when you
were going for more of a darker so I'm
just gonna fill in my lips with this
because it's a great great great color
when you're going for more of a darker
kind of burgundy cranberry look so I am
just gonna not fill it in completely
because this color is so dark but I'm
going to kind of just fill in the
outside like this to finish off this
makeup look I'm using my Tasha doing
skin mist if you don't have this get it
because it will change your life I am
dry skin and I have a hard time keeping
my makeup looking moisturize throughout
the day this is the answer to my problem
it is kind of expensive but I will
continue to buy it because I love it
that much if you have dry skin like me
this is your golden child go buy it
you'll love it it basically feels like
you have lotion on your skin all day
long you keeps it moist eyes it keeps it
from cracking and like doing weird funky
things that sometimes our dry skin can
do I know I can't explain it you just
have to know if you have dry skin I'm
gonna use it out
thankee oh my god it tastes like I
think I use too much but because now I
have a really dewy skin that is all a
hot today's were my holiday eyeshadow
routine I hope you enjoyed it you don't
have any of these more a few pallets go
out and get you one you will not regret
it as amazing so yeah stay tuned for
more videos and I will see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
