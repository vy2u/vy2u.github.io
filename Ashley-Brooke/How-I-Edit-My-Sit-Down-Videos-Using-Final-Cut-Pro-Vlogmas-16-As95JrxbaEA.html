I'm gonna fix that for you Merry
Christmas you filthy animal morning
happy Saturday and happy first day of
the new eyebrows they are a little on
the dark side I I'm loving them I just
put my ointment on them so they are
probably very very shiny and greasy but
they don't hurt I have no pain at all no
really like feeling of pain when I moved
my face so all is good in that
department decided to kind of take you
guys on the journey of the 7 days kind
of perfect I did it during vlogmas for
those of you who are thinking about
getting it done I have started to notice
there's a little bit of scabbing towards
the end here but other than that nothing
nothing big nothing not a big deal it is
8 o'clock 8 o'clock in the morning and I
have about halfway done editing vlogmas
so I'm gonna go finish that get it out
and then go grab a coffee come on Stiles
get Lenny
get Lenny yep yep yep always have to
take money mister tugs his face ripped
on this side so we have to get him fixed
so Lenny will have to do for now I'm
exporting vlogmas right now so while
that's exporting we are gonna go get
some coffee first I'm gonna put Stella's
I got her these little shoes it's
because I worry about being so cold
outside on her paws for a long period of
time and I saw on I was watching Kelly
and Ryan the other day and Kelly said
that the salt from the snow is toxic
really big pieces and I've actually like
gotten one in my shoe before and making
me kind of
sharp in their heart so I can't imagine
that that's comfortable so we're gonna
put we're gonna try to put those shoes
on her good girl yay
three more
this is a crusty crusty tummy right
Stella how did you get a crusty tummy
from the walk you're gonna need another
bath now yeah we need to get you excuse
me we need to get you a little coat so
your belly doesn't get wet
are you mad about it you mad about it
uh-huh are you gonna just go night-night
oh to start my makeup I really wanted to
go Christmas shopping today but I have
to film and edit a whole video today so
I am NOT gonna get to go Christmas
shopping unfortunately but I'm gonna do
a little online Christmas shopping today
and then tomorrow I think Ryan and I are
gonna go out Christmas shopping so
that'll be fun try to figure out a way
to put my makeup on without getting
close to my eyebrows and having it look
normal I think I'll probably wear a hat
shooting this video just because my
eyebrows are so glossy and greasy
looking from the ointment that I have to
put on or misty is I don't know if you
guys obviously you remember when I was
sick earlier this month but misty got
sick kind of around the same time I did
and she is still sick and keeps getting
worse and she just went to the hospital
and she has early onset pneumonia which
is really really crazy and very scary
glad she caught that in time so I just
sent her over some flowers to her house
but then I was like oh great probably
should have done that because she's
gonna be sleeping and then they're gonna
knock on the door so no no no it's okay
I'll fix it in a sec
I have been trying to shoot this video
for three days three days possibly four
so I'm so glad that I'm finally sitting
down to shoot this and I have to get it
up tomorrow so that's probably what my
plans are gonna be for the rest of the
day I'm probably going to shoot the
video and then fully get it edited
everything linked thumbnail all of that
so I don't have to work on it at all
tomorrow I can just go out and enjoy my
day and do some Christmas shopping be
careful it's reading the like aftercare
of my brows online and it said don't
pick the krusty like parts that form and
I told Ryan I was like I guess I
shouldn't be in charge of making dinner
then because it said don't pick the
crusty things just let them fall off
like what whoa like where they gonna
fall Ryan what are you gonna make for
dinner tonight these are very very hard
questions to answer it I mean I can make
dinner tonight oh there might be some
surprises in the dinner little eyebrow
crust to go with beyond meat burger with
the sytem eyebrows just wrapped up
filming and I can't wait to sit down and
show you a little bit of the editing
process with kind of like a sit-down
talk through video I know that's
something that a lot of you said you
wanted to see which is cool because I
love teaching and sharing things like
that so that's really cool that you
wanted to see that lunch time with Ryan
and ash and Ryan has got some oats would
you tell him the tip I gave you apples I
would love like warm apples of cinnamon
baby baby what else you got going on
natural delicious stuff
taco taco
gluta following the bar and the last one
of these probably will not rebuy but
because you like the hats chilly one
chilly one run my life salad has pretty
much become one of my favorite lunchtime
meal so I am getting my double dose of
greens for lunch today I'm eating my
salad and then Jim my vitamins B them
then I'm doing I've been taking these
for about a week now the vital protein
spirulina tablet tablets caplets that's
right right they don't smell great but
they are packed with amazingness this
has tons of vitamin A in it which I know
is a good antioxidant for skin a vital
source of antioxidant and vitamin A for
immune system support and detoxification
i used to use this brands collagen
tablets in my smoothies so they have
they're mostly known for their collagen
products that they do have two vegan
products this one and the beauty boost i
know like these and the beauty boost you
can put in like a face mask you can put
it in your smoothie
I am sitting down to start editing Luva
though or these almonds or the pecans
almonds
no honey I don't need it
finish one I'm just gonna show you the
finished product and like I said
yesterday kind of work backwards one
thing I like to do before I go in and
start any type of editing is to delete
all of just the blank space and the
reason I have so much blank space is
because when I do sit-down videos I like
to make notes for myself so you can see
here blank space obviously looking down
at my notes making sure I know what I'm
talking about
so I like to go through and delete all
of this link space so I'm going to
finish the first part of my editing the
first drops and then I will see you guys
in a little bit okay I literally just
looked up from my computer and realized
that it was dark
so just to recap for it's probably like
five seconds to you but I think I told
you guys this like an hour ago so I'm
just gonna recap for myself so to recap
the first process is to just get all of
your Clips imported take out dead space
of your Clips as compact it as possible
so next what I like to do is just create
the backbone of my video what I did here
was I completely edited myself talking
so you can see all of these cuts right
here also what I mean by the backbone of
the video is I separated everything with
a block of color and my text and all of
my photos I've separated everything
which is really important when you are
creating a sit-down video like I said
before you don't want to get your
viewers lost in what you're talking
about so you want to make sure it's kind
of like a book when you're reading a
long book you have paragraphs it just
really keeps the the reader and the
viewer in this case knowing exactly what
they're listening for or what what
you're meaning to say what you're
doing to get your point across basically
so now what I'm gonna do is to start
completely over at the beginning and I'm
gonna do the fun stuff now I'm gonna do
all of my fonts and I'm gonna do all of
my swipe ins and my sound effects and
this just kind of really makes the video
what it is that it's gonna be step
number three and then step number four I
just go back and watch it completely
through and make sure I take out all of
my arms and us and you know random
pauses here and there and then I've done
and then I export I make my thumbnail I
do all of my links all good so to recap
one more time it is a four step process
the first process import all of your
clips compact them as much as you can
step number two create the backbone
separate everything the way you want it
organized add a text block where you
want text add photos where you want
photos number three is to make it pretty
and make it you so you want to add your
fonts your swipe ins your sound effects
take out all of your eyes and your arms
and you know random words that you
better annoying to everybody else but
you say all the time I do the same thing
then step number four is just watch it
through completely as the viewer would
watch it and make notes to yourself you
know if you need to like take out one
little thing write it down
don't keep stopping it you want to make
sure you watch it from start to finish
just as your viewer would we're done I'm
only on step number two but I need to
give my eyes and my brain like a mental
break because I've been sitting I'm in
editing with my eyes locked at the
screen for like two and a half hours and
I like taking myself a little cleaning
break just to move my legs and turn some
lights on and kind of like get back into
reality and it's Saturday what am i
doing
hi guys so hey right so I'm making
dinner right now
well Ryan researching warm under layers
they're very important to me regions
warm you're under region
yeah in others you're number ones you
know there's I'll show you what I'm
making push me up
wait I got a question so alright cutie
hi cutie
scuse me come on Patagonia calm right
now
does anybody shop there or own patagonia
base layers and if so can you recommend
let me know thanks me proceed your eyes
oh okay here we go
but I am making soup because it is so
cold outside and soup just sounded like
so I'm making here's the stew
um it is veggie broth and water for the
broth and then I seasoned it with garlic
flakes salt and pepper and a little bit
of oregano and then I put in potatoes
carrots lentils kale celery what else I
think that's about it
got it obviously side Oh burger patty
for some extra protein we are doing the
Santa Fe of veggie burger from sweet
earth highly recommend 15 grams of
protein per serving sitting here by the
way it's really in the Christmas spirit
cuz I we were talking about Christmas
shopping tomorrow like getting up early
and getting coffee and going Christmas
shopping and Ryan's like oh we should
have dinner and have a movie night and
I'm thinking yeah which Christmas movie
do you want to watch I was thinking out
in my head he's like yeah we should
watch it what a psychopath that's
Christmastime and you want to watch it
that's the trailer - it gave me a
nightmare no I'm kidding we how much it
I love it scary movie
I deploy you guys to know something
thanks to all of your genius advice the
past two nights we have put Stella in
her kennel while we cook and eat we give
her a chance though we wait until she
starts getting rowdy and crazy and I put
her in her kennel look at her right now
while I'm cooking this is a Christmas
miracle oh you know what I'm talking
about
I just hate putting in her kennel while
we're here but she honestly loves her
kennel if it's out she always goes into
it and sleeps she really loves it I just
hate hearing her cry I don't know but I
understand to discipline and stuff like
that you just you have to do it
and it's for the best because I mean she
was literally gonna hurt herself while I
was cooking she was doing backflips and
landing on her back so it just wasn't
good for her it's not good for us and I
don't want her to think that she can
just run the apartment and do whatever
she wants you know so it's worth it
thanks guys my Cesar Milan dog whispers
oh hey Ryan we have some go veggie
cheese if you want it all right so here
is the soup and these are the lentils
that I used they're just the green
lentils from Whole Foods but yep this is
what we got here I always put the kale
in about 10 minutes before it's done
because the kale only needs like a
little bit of time to wilt and get
really soft you ready to eat pumpkin pie
vinegar hello dinner was so good
stop most shower do you well you do that
I'm gonna try it oh all right
