this is a mistake why did I do that I
panicked I blacked out we are going to

them for dinner last night because we
were all just so full by the time it was
like time for dinner and so tired from

gonna tell them bye and then we just
have a few errands to run then we're
gonna clean out drawers which we meet I
don't even trust you to clean out
drawers don't kid yourself that's either
gonna be today or tomorrow or but make
sure it both so we're a weekend project

thought that was Casey nice done did you
see that what that guy looks like yeah I
mean it wasn't him but it looked like
him
nice dance kisi nice stuff no offended
if he watches to me he definitely
doesn't
tell me about the scarf scarf yeah well
it serves no purpose than keeping me
warm
but I don't know I feel like it looks
cool on the cup
and it just like it adds a touch of cool
I can dig it I just love the blue well
the blue you know I got it
where'd you get it sorry but RJ

doing frame in this this is our first
visit to the Herald Square target super

subscriber in anthropology animate Jenna

find her and ask if she wanted to hang
out actually legit wanted to be Jenna's
friend Jenna if you're watching this I
want to be friends with you

easier than last time

Texas wing your home the hardest part of
having family come into town is sang by
Brian look at these trees those are
trees they're so cute
okay I think those are perfect I mean I
don't think misty would let us have a
little one
I was I was trying to record for vlogmas
sacrifice yeah it looks gonna have to
come off
it really is it's much more efficient
totally just passed by the sacs new
holiday windows and I missed it for you
guys I'm terrible
but look there's gas and yes and for
it's a noble fail and Bank of America
and where I am by so I think we are
gonna go back home and get some things
set up for I've just still totally lost
track of what I was named I go take some
stuff to our storage unit and our coats
out do is swap you guys always ask how I
can fit my clothes and my closet and
that's because I switch out every season
a lot of my stuff is in storage right
now there's so much traffic because
Donald Trump it's coming into the city
tonight everything
we just got home we have in my phone in
my purse this is mine because it's gray
we just got home we went to the Apple
store because we upgraded our phones and
yeah so new phone I haven't had a new
phone in like two years it's been a
while so every time I post an Instagram
photo Ryan has to take it on his phone
and then he has to airdrop me the photos
cuz my camera like does not work I got
the grayish white one I don't know I
don't even know what color I got because
I've never even like seen one before
this is the color that I got Brian you
got the black one right I did
oh look set up a new phone BAM
hold your new iPhone up to the camera
whoa man that was so cool
position your face in the camera frame
then move your head in the circle to
show all the angles of your face okay
your turn
since we are making a storage unit and
run I'm gonna start clean yeah no one
told me I must scare all my eyelids
yesterday's block mess so thanks a lot
right here though start cleaning out
this hall closet and then we're gonna go
over to the storage unit
creepy Peter cam
so hard no I just creep it on you work
hard exactly man handle all that stuff
okay I finally talked to Ryan into
getting a bigger storage unit what do
you mean hips look at this base look a
window and a brick wall this is
but you don't care
don't care you just
think about everyone
would you break
finally back from the storage unit and
if you guys could see my bedroom right
now you would cry for me I'm not gonna
show you tonight because it's dark but
I'll show you tomorrow
I think tomorrow's project is putting
everything away in its place and then
maybe going back to the storage unit and
taking like my shorts and stuff that's
who is coming over right now any guesses
any guesses speak now Missy is coming
over misty and a few of her girlfriends
took a bus to the city and like an
overnight bus and I have so many
questions I was like how does that work
where do you eat how many times do you
stop where do you go to the bathroom
what did you bring to keep you company
she was like it's fine but she is coming
over and I'm so excited
I love misty misty for those of you guys
who don't know was like a subscriber
turned life by her member turn like one
of my really good friends we text every
day like we talk every single day all
day I just love her so much she's like
become one of my closest friends which
is so funny how that works like online
dating I guess it's kind of like the
same you know like online meeting
friends because well it's so hard to
make friends here in the city like all
of my closest friends I'm like Sam who I
was roommates with here in New York she
lives in Austin she's one of my best
friends Taylor is one of my best
friend's lives in Dallas who was also my
roommate at one point you know my
closest friends don't live here in the
city and I do have friends here in the
city but not you know we're all so busy
with work and stuff that we don't get
together that much and then when we do
I'd obviously don't like block it
because it's just kind of awkward when
you know you're meeting up at people and
you're like hey here's my camera it's
really nice making new girlfriends
because I feel like when you work from
home and you're always working it's
really hard to make new friends though
the Internet is the perfect way it's
2017 well haven't taken the plastic off
of my phone because I'm gonna wait till
my case comes plastic still on phone all
right I'm gonna go eat a snack before I
missed it gets here but snack time it's
