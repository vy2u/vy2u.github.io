favorite colors I just kind of wanted to
share some of my tips and favorite
products for keeping my lips moisturized
and healthy throughout winter the first
thing I like to do is use this sugar
scrub by fresh and this basically just
gets all of the dead skin and chapping
and weird things you have going on with
your lips it smoothes them out it's
basically like a buffer I guess you
could say and smells I mean it doesn't
smell like amazing but it does its job
really well so and next I have two
products that were actually sent to me
they are by Mary Kay one of them is the
satin lips lip balm and the other one is
satin lips mask and I actually used the
satin lips mask right before I did this
video because I knew my lips were not
going to like having you know six or
seven different lipsticks on them and
being taken off so I use this to kind of
put a little healthy coat over my lips
and I loved love this stuff so I will
definitely when I run out of this be
buying more and the satin lips um lip
balm is just basically like a chapstick
or a lip balm that you would just use
every day and it's amazing it's really
really silky and it doesn't give you
that weird super glossed look that some
lip balms do's and the last thing is my
trusty vitamin E oil that I use all the
time um I hair on it before I go to bed
I put this on my lips and when I wake up
the next day I feel like I just have or
fresh lips that I can put lipstick on
without any cracking so I definitely
recommend buying some of this if you
don't already have it
it's really inexpensive and I will post
a link to all of this stuff down below
that way you can kind of shock them and
you know buy them if you want and lastly
I just kind of wanted to show you guys a
trick for getting your lipstick to stay
in place and getting it to not smudge on
your face a lot of times right and I
will go to dinner and if I'm biting into
like a burger or something it never
fails that I get lipstick on my chin
right here and it's so annoying when I'm
wearing a color like this because I end
up just rubbing it in and it just smears
and it looks so stupid a trick that I
have learned over the past like couple
of months is to take a mineral powder a
piece of tissue and a fluffy brush get a
little bit of mineral powder on your
brush put the tissue over your lips oh
well just roasted and voila another
reason I love doing that is because I
you know like I said earlier I love
matte lipstick and I have so many
lipstick colors that I love that aren't
matte so doing this little trick kind of
mattifies it and makes it a little bit
less shiny and gives you more of that
matte look try out next time you're
putting a darker color on and bite into
a hamburger and I promise you um you
will have less it's any on your chin
it's not not a good look when you're out
to dinner if you have big red chin and
then although I'll eat a buy of a burger
and I'll have a full-on conversation
with Ryan and then I go to the bathroom
and I see this huge lipstick and I'm
like why didn't you tell me I have
lipstick on my chin and I hate it when
people do that or if you like a booger
and nobody tells you you have to tell
people they have lipstick on their chin
or a booger in their nose all right guys
that is the end of my video I really
hope you enjoyed it and like I said
before I'm going to post a link to all
the products that I use today down below
so you can um check that out
just notice that all of these lipsticks
are drug
our products which is great because they
are super affordable and you can find
them at most any drugstore or you know
Target Walmart
h-e-b and just an update for you guys
who have been asking me about our
apartment hunt here in New York we have
started and it's going well the videos
are coming it's a lot to take in we've
seen a lot of buildings and we can't
wait to share it with you guys so they
are coming very very soon and I just
wanted to clear up a question that I
know I'm going to get asked out right
post this video I have had fillers put
into my lips so I've gotten this
question before and I have an answer
just because I kind of wanted to shoot a
video on the process and how it works
but I'm just going to go ahead and come
out and just say now the last time I got
them done I would say maybe like three
or four years ago so they've held up
pretty well I don't even know if there's
anything still left in there but um yeah
so that's that and if you guys want to
see a video on the process and what I
used and all of that just let me know
and I will make a video on that because
I know before I got mine done I wish I
had a video to watch on questions that I
had and stuff like that oh just a quick
shout out to doctor Vinick in San
Antonio Texas at radiance Med Spa she is
amazing so if you live in Texas
definitely go see her she's so funny and
smart and beautiful and she's amazing so
um go see dr. panic if you're looking to
get anything done oh wait that is all I
have for you today so I will see you
guys in my next video bye
we all you know exfoliate our skin and
the exfoliate our face so why not have a
product that exfoliates your lips which
I think needs the most exfoliating at
some times so needs the most exfoliating
out of all of those things because it we
have to take care of because there will
be a way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
