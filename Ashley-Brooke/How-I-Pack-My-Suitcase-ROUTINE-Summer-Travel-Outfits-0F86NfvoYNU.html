to Florida I have about three hours
until I have to head to the airport
what do out Oh two hours uh I haven't
packed one thing so I just kind of
thought that I would show you guys what
I'm packing my packing process and how
all that works so let's get started the
last trip I want and for all time wheels
so it's like a little handicapped
suitcase so I know for sure that I'm
filming a video there so I'm going to
pack all the essentials and all the
outfits that I need to film this video
so let's start packing that first so I'm
going to get I'm gonna actually put my
outfits together before I pack them do
you guys remember these haven't worn
them yet my video that I'm going to be
filming while I'm in Florida is a how to
style dem shorts so I am bringing a
monster stock of denim shorts which are
pretty heavy so I need it be careful
now I'm going to get some dresses
because I feel like those are super easy
to pack and I wear them more than I wear
anything else and since Florida is
beyond hot right now I'm just probably
gonna be living in dresses the whole
time so we're going to go to my dress
closet I don't know that sounds really
luxurious when I say dress closet but
it's really like the laundry room with a
rack in it
so let's go
where my dress is live in this dark
little dungeon closet um so I'm just
going to pick out some dresses daughter
and rhomboids that are just easy to pack
and I know that I can wear over and over
and make different outfits out of this
is really one of those trips where it's
going to be like no makeup no outfits
just kind of by the pool no makeup so
I'm going to bring a few things just in
case we decide to do something but it's
probably not going to be that kind of
treatment
my knots are also in here so I'm just
going to grab this one that I just wear
with kind of everything summer
so after my dresses are polled I'm
basically just going to grab things out
of my closet that I absolutely love and
filled outfits on top of that for
example I know for sure I want to bring
this top because this is my fourth of
July top it has little fireworks on it I
think that's what those are and so then
I'll just grab a pair of shorts and a
little bag and some sandals to go with
it I'm going to try to pack things that
I can wear all throughout the trip that
go together so it wants to be packing so
much stuff so let's do that so these
three tops
I can basically wear the same pair of
denim shorts with them so I've got
essentially four outfits right here with
just four tops in one bottom so these
are all really good daytime outfits I
probably going to only be packing to
nighttime outfits because we're not
going to be doing much while we're there
so I'm not going to like stress about
having to fill my suitcase up with my
time outfits if I'm not going to be
wearing them so we're gonna pull two and
just like before I'm going to try to do
the same bottom with just two different
tops that we've got two outfits with
only three pieces
now I'm gonna grab some shoes and shoes
are probably the heaviest thing so I'm
not going to go to Quincy and hell we're
just going to pass some super light
sandals a nude pair of black pair and
then a dressier pair and then maybe a
fun pair so I'm only gonna try to take
four pairs of shoes so what I feel like
that might be a lot I don't know I'm
going to take these these are good I'm
taking these I'll take these I want to
take these as my fun pair because I feel
like I have a lot of blue and denim so I
think these will play off nicely with
that this is my carry-on backpack that I
use to carry on a plane it's got all of
my little travel bags in it that I use
to put white chargers and makeup and
just like little stuff that I need to
put in little baggies it's quite a wide
variety of little bags I seem to somehow
collect fees as I go I'm not sure how so
after I'm done with all of that I'm just
going to grab my workout clothes bathing
suits lounging clothes and some PJ's and
then I'm done pulling the clothes and
then I will go to my bathroom
bring my Burt's Bees makeup remover
Clarisonic this is just my little travel
bag of medicines I've got Dramamine
which is so essential because I get so
motion sick um I've got hand sanitizer
advil and stuff like that so I always
pack this in my bag a few beauty
essentials that I can't travel without
is definitely my first a beauty ultra
Repair Cream this is I mean I go through
like two of these a month I'm obsessed
with this my rose petal toner the stuff
is amazing and actually someone reached
out to me the other day saying that this
completely changed her skin after she
had her baby because she was having
weird problems with her skin wear it
with oily and dry at the same time and
she said to saved her life
so I'm obsessed with this stuff Garnier
sleek and shine Flatiron Express
cream and when I'm going on a trip I
usually either pick between my vitamin E
oil or my vitamin C serum
um this is getting a little low so I'm
probably going to go with the vitamin C
serum and since I'm going to be in the
Sun quite a bit I'm going to bring my
argan oil to put on my ends because I
know my hair is innovating a lot of Sun
this week so this is a must this is some
of my travel makeup so I'm probably
going to bring just like the bare
essentials when it comes to makeup
because I'm not going to be wearing a
lot this trip so now we're just going to
start rolling everything into a tight
little burrito
we are done packing finally and we're
headed to the airport and this is what I
am wearing this is my go-to I wear
pretty much the same combination every
time I fly so I've got my denim jacket
on because it's lightweight and I also
get freezing on the plane who else gets
so cold I don't know how it get so cold
I got this little comfy t-shirt from H&amp;amp;M
it says Los Angeles on it with a little
heart even though we're going into
Florida these joggers I pretty much wear
every time I fly because they're so
comfortable and they're just really easy
to throw on they've got a waistband
pockets and they're tapered at the waist
I mean at the ankle which I love so they
look a little bit um you know put
together not so sloppy like my other
sweatpants and my sneakers are Joshua
Saunders
plain white leather and I know they come
in where they say la also but I got the
New York ones obviously Simon New York
we're headed out and I'm going to try to
get this video edited in the uber on the
way to the airport and get it up somehow
before our flight King song so let's go
you
to me cuz I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
