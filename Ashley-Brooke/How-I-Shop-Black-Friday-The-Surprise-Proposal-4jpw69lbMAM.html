Tiger is you didn't see my first blog my
first video it is basically your best
friend when it comes to shopping so let
me just kind of show you guys how it
works a little bit it notifies you every

some of my favorite items right now that
I've pulled actually from my life by her
lookbook but I just kind of want to show
you guys how it works really quick so

Mingo has a sale or if this gets marked
down I will get a notification on my
