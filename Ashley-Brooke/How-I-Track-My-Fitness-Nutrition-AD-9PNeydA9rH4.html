channel as most of you know who watch my
vlogs I am so excited to have partnered
up with lifestyle to show you guys
exactly how I have been keeping track of
what I'm eating my exercises a lot of
you been asking me on my blogs exactly
how this app works and what exactly it
does so I thought I would create this
quick video to show you some of my
favorite features that the app has to
offer so I hope you enjoyed this video
and let's go ahead and get started this
is what your home screen looks like also
known as your diary you'll kind of find
an overview of what your day is looking
like so far so as you can see since
breakfast I mean 563 calories so if you
scroll down this is where you add your
breakfast lunch dinner snack and your
exercises you can either do fill all of
this out at the end of the day or I
think it's more beneficial if you go
through and add it as you're eating and
as you're working out and at the end you
have your water intake which is one of
the main reasons that I use this because
sometimes I sit at my desk and edit all
day and I don't realize how much water
I'm not drinking so I really really love
this feature I think it's so cool and
just so simple whenever you are cooking
a meal this is what your screen is going
to look like you can either add items in
or you can actually scan it which i
think is really cool that way you're
getting the exact nutritional facts as
I'm making my breakfast all I need to do
is just type everything in one by one as
I put it in my bowl and it automatically
calculates everything for me so here is
an overview of what my breakfast
actually looks like all the ingredients
the exact amounts and all of the
nutrition back so you can actually see
that this was an imbalanced breakfast
which is really good to know because
I've been eating this for breakfast for
ever so now I know I need to add
something that's a little higher in
protein to my oatmeal this is one of the
other reasons that I love
using this out is because you can go
through breakfast lunch dinner and snack
recipes and then you actually have a
favorites bar which I love makes us that
much easier just to kind of go through
and search everything that I've already
saved and my third favorite reason for
using this app is because you can
actually add your exercises track how
many calories you're burning and exactly
what your goal exercise time is for the
whole entire day so it pretty much does
all of the thinking for you you just
need to plug everything in alright guys
that is it for this video I really hope
you enjoyed watching it around the
holiday time I feel like my diet and
exercise just gets a little bit out of
control so this video was in partnership
with lifestyle thank you guys so much
again obsessed with this app and they
were nice enough to give my subscribers
30% off a Premium Membership so I will
put that in the description box below
alright so until next time I will see
you guys in my next video by the way it
had to wake up at 6:30 for this clip so
you better enjoy it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
