channel today I wanted to talk about my
healthy hair routine and how I pretty
much turned my hair completely around if
you knew me in high school
you would know that I had terrible dry
damaged hair and I cannot believe that
I'm saying this on YouTube no you guys
thought I went with the highest look
mirror sitting there like yeah pretty
terrible started in high school and
pretty much went throughout college we
just kind of wanted to share with you
guys my routine on how I did this
because I'm sure there's some of you
girls out there that are kind of going
through the same exact problems my goal
in this is to really help you learn
about hair care and really get a good
healthy routine now just for proof I
wanted to show you guys this photo of me
I was actually home for the holidays
through Thanksgiving and I found this
photo of me just so I could prove to you
how terrible my hair actually was here
is photo number one you know I pretty
much bleached my hair twice a month it's
so much heat on it just could not care
less about the help of my hair as I did
just making sure that it would add me to
blond it's possible why didn't someone
tell me that this is not okay so yeah
looking back on that it's super painful
so I have actually partnered up with
Pantene pro-v today to show you guys how
I completely change my hair for the
better obviously and hopefully maybe
pass along these tips to you as well
kind of a dream come true and a brand
that you've been using for so many years
reaches out to you and actually wants to
partner with you for a good cause to
show people how to repair and protect
their hair against heat damage color
damage it's really such a cool thing so
I'm so happy to be shooting this video
with them for you so
my Pantene rotation I use the Pantene
pro-v repair and protection miracle
protecting conditioner and shampoo and
not only do these smell amazing really
make your hair feel like that really
silky smooth feeling you know you know
the feeling after you rinse out your
conditioner it's almost like it just
kind of slides through your fingers and
then when you get out of you comb it
just comb straight through without any
fuss one of my biggest tips for getting
super healthy hair is actually doing a
cocktail mask every other wash now I use
the Pantene pro-v repair and protect
every wash but every other wash I like
to mix a castor oil and coconut oil into
my hair so first I apply the coconut oil
all over my ends throughout my scalp and
really just get in there and make sure
that every strand of hair has some sort
of oil on it in with the castor oil not
only do i coat my ends also make sure
that I'm really rubbing it into my scalp
that way it gets my blood circulating
and it's really getting in there so I
usually put this mask in and let it sit
overnight and then washed out the next
morning after the mask is completely
washed out I grab my canteen movie
repair and protect so what this shampoo
and conditioner does is it actually
helps reduce hair friction and tangles
so that it's soon as the air and really
provides damage production I think is
kind of cool to know the science behind
your shampoo and conditioner rather than
just take someone's word for it like
this is at work in one fan shampoo and
conditioner isn't only healing what the
damage that you've already done but it's
also protecting you against future
damage after I hop out of the shower I
like to blow dry pretty quickly I don't
let it air dry too much because I have
super naturally curly hair and it will
kind of frizz
if I let it air-dry too much and then I
put my curling iron on a super low
setting because it honestly doesn't take
that much heat for my hair to hold it
curl and the less heat is the better and
after I've been styling I like to use my
Pantene hair spray it contains no
ethanol therefore it does not get that
super sticky weird feelings that you get
sometimes if you use a hairspray you are
someone who what puts heat on your hair
regularly colours your hair is just
really kind of rough on your hair
especially in New York right now it is
snowing it's so cold the air is so dry
that I almost feel it drying out my hair
so knowing that I'm Remos rising and
revamping just really like makes me feel
a little happier you are someone who is
going through struggles or something of
that nature I definitely recommend this
whole hair routine I would actually love
to see your progress over time of how
healthy your hair is getting and how
much it's growing and not breaking so
definitely feel free to tag me on
instagram at its Ashbrook so I can see
your progress because you know whenever
I make videos like this of really trying
to help with an issue that I've overcome
it makes me so happy knowing that these
tips and these products are really
helping someone else out there and

take this healthy hair challenge and
