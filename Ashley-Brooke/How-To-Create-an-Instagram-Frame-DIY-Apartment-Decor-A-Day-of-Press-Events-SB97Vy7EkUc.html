now we're headed to event number two and

something a little bit more springing
outdoorsy outside Z a little white
ruffle here dress on from Zara some red
ankle booties and then my little gold
bat and my wife sunglasses you know well
who's that
and you are not going to unless you're
cute and then this is what the bedroom
looks like we've got a lot we've got a
lot going on right now so yeah we're
about the head out and then after that
we're going straight to a meeting at the
office and then we're done for a while
and I got to come back and work I'm
going to edit got some fun stuff going
on right here boo
ma'am you excited very sir why are you
wearing - I'm wearing super basic
clothes he basic fine right the goal
basic be keep getting lipstick on my
teeth I got it up but it was old earlier
right so we're heading out however what
you lost sense I myself a river driver
that I love that my brain
Oh
the day
Oh
let me but I'm just decided that I'm
yeah
too hot out I thought at least I'd love
too much coal there was a block and it
is hot
now we're headed to our office for a
quick meeting and then we're going to be
done for a little bit
surprise
we finally had to get out of the cab and
walk against traffic is everything but
we are almost at Bryant Park for me as
when I hang out with you let's say if
you leave me I got you know I got you
but we're done with our meeting it was
really well here and we were just
sweating through the whole first 20
minutes of the meeting is it just me or
is a little Martin lying here
you know it's not really any parents of
this modern Miami y know you're an
enabler your enabler water Miami this is
what we're saying is modern - all right
fine once you get it a move
in turn the brightness done just for
that comment not modern Miami at all
getting ready for the storage dress okay
for storage on you feel like sweatshirt
okay so every I go to storage and walk
out our coats for a short and our
dresses you excited about your dress now
yes until since I've seen my dresses
we're going to Florida next week that
I'm very doing this Swedish quick I
think I got almost everything to fit in
the suitcases - this little pile we're
going to take this is storage swap
everything out and I'm going to start
getting ready to pack all I need to make
you to make that picture frame my DIY
Instagram picture frame that's gonna be
fun I'm going to do that Brian doesn't
know yet
Brian's getting be how to style up and
running can't forget to link the song no
more
I'm not forgetting anything it's very
important Ryan just got a fresh cut what
do we think good
you
just got some sandal some summer shoes
we are making the Instagram frame now
mine's ready so this is what it's going
to look like so they're just little
Polaroid and I have to take this one
apart because as you can see I've got
some fuzz for my rug because I did not
check it before I put it together so
this is what you'll need the ribah
frame from Ikea I got the 61 by 91
centimetres so it's put too big a white
matte photo mat you can get these pretty
much in any like frame store kind of
custom framing store I got mine online
or if you don't have a frame store you
could maybe go to like CBS or Walgreens
and get a poster board that might work
too you will need a level a tape measure
you will need this little Fuji film
Polaroid printer I just got this one
Amazon and you will need lots of refills
and then this connects to a bit so it's
wireless so it just prints up so the app
is pretty easy to use so I just found
this really cute picture of Cambria
because they just realize that she's not
in any of the other ones by herself
sorry can't breathe so I'm just going to
filter it and black and white that's
what I'm going for
and you just hit friends and then it
prints out
first I was kind of disappointed at how
small the photos were but then I thought
it actually looked nicer with the frame
so so this is a sponsored by the way
it's like my project that I'm doing are
you connecting to the app all right so I
had to get a picture of modern Miami or
Armas the picture I took in Miami and it
is the most modern Miami photo set up my
already done one so I can get my
measurements because that's forever so
basically what you want to do is get
your first one set and then you can
measure in between and it's a lot easier
okay so it starts at four and a half
inches down
3 and 1/4 inches over and then each
photo is one inch apart this way and one
inch apart it took me a while to phase
it out where it would all fit evenly but
those are my numbers
good job man and I'm use this to make
sure that they're pretty much like
straight down so when I was taping them
on I just press it up against it
Ali you know Bennett straight because
it's really easy to get in cricket and
then your whole row starts going
downhill so just use tape to tape them
on all I have is packing tape right now
so it is
looks like we're done Dunsey
you got the good your new clothes
yeah Wow so now we've got both Instagram
frames I'm going to start cleaning up
all this back Tomica see on TV success
it don't raise especially was what I
dreamed it up since I was on I said I
won't be naughty naughty I said
congratulations
