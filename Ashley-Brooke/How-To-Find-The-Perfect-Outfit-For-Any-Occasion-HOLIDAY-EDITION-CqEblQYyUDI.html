if you are new here my name is Ashley
and I'm gonna be doing a video today
over holiday party dress shopping I know
this is something we all get very
excited / stressed out about like
stressed to no ends today's video I'm
going to be talking about shopping in
store versus online some tips which one
I prefer and obviously we are gonna get
into the fashion on what to wear to
which party are so many different party
types this season there is your office
party your significant others office
party going out with family going out of
girlfriends so I just kind of want to
give you guys a whole video on how to
shop where shop what to buy and what not
to buy let's get into the fun stuff
my very first tip is when you get
invited to a holiday party always check
your closet first you might have those
hidden gems in the very back of your
closet that you bought last year that
you can totally re accessorize and wear
this year my second tip is if you do
have to buy something for a holiday
party make sure it's something that you
can wear in your day-to-day life unless
your budget just allows you to go and
you know spend money on a dress that
you'll maybe never wear again maybe
until next year and I really recommend
buying something that you can wear to
the office on the weekend for example a
velvet blazer a velvet blazer is very
holiday it's very a traditional material
and you can also wear it to work with
some trousers like to kind of stick
within those two rolls whenever I am
shopping for holiday party outfit
about what to wear wear for an office
party I recommend you can definitely
show a little bit of skin you can still
be sexy but still conservative at the
same time because you are not in work
you are still in your work environment
around your boss around your coworkers
so I really think that there's a way
that you can project your personal style
and still be semi covered up semi
conservative at the same time so for
look number one I love this one that
Olivia Palermo is wearing she is wearing
you know lots of sexy black lace very
revealing but still covered up it almost
looks like she has a black dress on like
a black super micro mini underneath and
then a full-on like lace layering piece
over it and belt it and I think this is
so beautiful this is obviously a very
dressy dress but I love how she dressed
it down with some flats so if you are
looking for something kind of sexy and
revealing but still covered up this is a
great option for you and the same goes
with this one from Kristen Bell she is
covered head-to-toe but still has some
skin showing with the lace and I love
that this is a jumpsuit it almost is a
little bit more trendy less girly than
if you were to wear a full-on dress
another sheer cutout here and I've
actually seen these ads ARA they are
just like head-to-toe sheer dresses with
nothing underneath and you can I mean
and the ones I've seen at Zara and
Topshop are like $25 so you can really
play with it put it over a micro mini
dress and you've got a really cute
outfit and you can also recycle it and
wear it with jeans on the weekend so
there's just so many different things
that you can do with a dress like that I
also really love this velvet option I
just love elven and I think it is such a
great holiday material and I especially
love this color
obviously the safe option is always
black but this is a good choice too it's
girly it's floor-length
you could do some really beautiful gold
accessories a big gold necklace and a
really fun bag this is a great option as
well this is also something that you
could probably wear to work as well with
a blazer or something over it but I
think this is a great party dress and a
dress like this can really take you
through the holiday season you can
dressed like this to any type of party I
also think this is a really great just
occasion dress overall you could wear
this to a wedding so if you're going to
invest a significant amount of money
into a party dress make sure it is
something that you can wear to other
occasions such as this one the next
holiday party that you are probably
going to get invited to is to go out
with your girlfriends if you're staying
at home whether you're going to dinner
or just full-on going out these are some
of my favorite outfits to wear for that
occasion but this one is just super fun
I love this and it's basically just
jeans a top and a jacket
almost just looks like she grabbed a
random things out of her closet and
threw it together and just made it very
festive and holiday looking I know some
of you are looking at this and you're
like um no but I think just some sort of
sheer sparkly top some high-waisted
jeans and a really festive jacket is
super cute and if you go out to dinner
and you can take the jacket off and
still have your festive sparkly top
underneath this outfit is so great I
think it is so fun so trendy the
one-shoulder the puffy sleeve if you're
going to a nicer dinner um you might
want to choose something like this
really deep rich red velvet dress with
some sort of fun sweet oh no that you
would get so much use out of this but
this will always be a classic for the
holiday time and you can recycle this
and wear it to other parties as well
this is one of my absolute favorites I
love the look of this this one's a
little bit more ballsy if you kind of
have to have a certain specific style to
wear this but this is definitely
something fun to wear on New Year's Eve
I don't know if I would go to a
Christmas party or wearing something
like this but I think it's pretty fun
for a New Year's and this is a very
specific style but I think it's really
cute and they make dresses like this on
ASOS I've seen most of them on ASOS that
already have the built in layers
underneath so it almost looks like she
found hot pants and a bra and then put
the sparkly layering piece over it but I
have seen a ton of dresses that have
this look already built into it you can
never go wrong and this is a really safe
option a basic colored velvet dress and
over-the-knee boots I think it's very
sexy you're showing a little bit of skin
but not too much you've got a shorter
dress on so you're showing a little bit
of like the Gucci belt just as KY
a really fun added accessory and again
this is a dress that you could wear any
night out you know it's just a velvet
mini dress you can definitely style it
however you want when it's a little bit
warmer you could do heels I think this
color is so great - you're kind of
transitioning away from solid black and
this is if you just want to go all out
this is great for New Year's Eve just a
really over-the-top fun sparkly dress
with some bold earrings and if it's your
style you could definitely dress it down
with like some edgy military boots you
could do an over the knee boot you could
do a slouchy boot so I really think a
dress like this you don't even need to
fuss over your accessories just add a
sexy shoe and you're good to go
the next set of looks is if you are
going out with your family you know if
you and your family get together if you
have a big family and you have the whole
annual holiday party or New Year's party
I think these are some great options the
first one I absolutely love this top and
I think the pink is perfect you know
just because it's holiday time you don't
have to wear red or green or even you
know metallic silver or gold if your
style is pink then you wear pink and I
believe she's just pairing this with
some trousers but you could even do some
black denim I think just like a fun
sequins top with black denim is perfect
and it's so easy no fuss you can find
the sequin tops anywhere and if you want
to make sure to recycle them and wear
them again maybe do the kind of talk
that has patchy sequins that way you
know you can wear it again to work or
even with some jeans and some boots on
the weekend next I absolutely love this
look I think a really pretty layered
velvet and turtleneck combo is just
perfect and these velvet dresses right
now are everywhere and I would just add
some sort of top underneath it you could
do a skin-tight black mock neck or you
could do something fun with flowy
balloon sleeves or a bubble sleeve this
is a little bit dressy but I do know
people who have full on like gala
parties with their families so I think
this is really cool it's a good way to
also kind of dress it down so if you
wanted to dress it up you could do
something like this kind of a sequin
layer on layer or you could do a sequin
dress you dress and layer on like a
t-shirt or a basic long-sleeve shirt
underneath that I think is a really good
can
an expected way to wear a long maxi to
the floor sequined dress another thing
that's really easy to find are
floor-length metallic skirts you can
also wear those to work as well I feel
like you can wear those throughout the
whole entire year or my metallic skirt
this summer with sneakers and a graphic
tees so there's just I mean even though
they look very specific and they're kind
of intimidating when you're shopping for
them I think you'd be surprised how much
use you can get out of them it's
something just simple like this pair one
of those with a basic camisole and a
faux fur coat and you're good to go and
obviously like I said before with the
cutout dresses they are pretty much
transitional to any party that you go to
I think that is one of the safest
options is getting a velvet cutout dress
or even like a lace cutout dress is
perfect as well because you can wear
them to holiday parties and you can
recycle them and wear them to other
parties and events the last party that
you will probably be invited to is
you're either a night out with your
husband your wife your significant other
and or a group of friends that's kind of
how Ryan and I always spend whenever
we're doing like New Year's or holiday
parties it's always up to and then a
group of people so I kind of rounded up
all of my favorites and put them
together for this because I don't know I
feel like when you're going out with
this group of people you can pretty much
wear your style whatever you want you
don't really have to be a certain way
because these are the people you're
probably with the most so it really just
depends on where you're going if you
want to be super festive and just
over-the-top I love this sequins dress
that sincerely Jules is wearing I would
do this with some slouchy suede boots
and maybe even a haps to kind of dress
it down a little bit because I love
taking dressy pieces like this and
dressing them down and making them a
little bit more cool for more of a
conservative but still dressy look I
would do this option right here I would
find some sort of velvet
off-the-shoulder
one-shoulder bow sleeve some sort of
velvet dress with a fun detailing up top
if I was going for more of a sexy look I
would do this dress that Olivia Palermo
was wearing I am never one to show full
skin so if I'm showing a little bit of
you know lowered chest area I try to
keep everything else covered or if I'm
wearing a crop top you know I'm always
wearing something over and some jeans so
I really love this option I think it is
sexy and classy at the same time in my
opinion this is sexier than wearing like
a full-on revealing outfit you know you
want to leave a little to the hot you
don't want to give it all the way in one
outfit so I'm obsessed with this I think
this is probably my favorite look for
any occasion last tip when putting
together an outfit is if you are invited
to something super last-minute which
that happens to all of us and you're
usually never prepared if you have a
faux fur cropped jacket of any sort or
if you can like haul it to forever 21 in
just a grab one I think just a pair of
high-waisted jeans maybe like a velvet
pair or denim high mock neck top maybe
sheer and then a faux fur jacket over it
is the easiest like probably most
inexpensive outfit that you can throw
together because I do think that those
cropped faux fur jackets are very
festive
something about on they look very
holiday very warm even if you could find
like a green one that would be like so
perfect maybe just have one ready to go
but you know you can wear those when
you're going out to dinner you can wear
them during the daytime not one of those
buried in your closet those are great
for last-minute outfit throw it together
especially if you add some fun jewelry
to it and a fun vibe you're set
the next part of this video we are gonna
get into the actual shopping it comes to
shopping online versus in-store my
number one tip no matter what is to
always make a mood board I make a mood
board for everything before I start
filming a style video before I put
together the life by her lookbook nearly
50 Pinterest boards that are in secret
on my Pinterest because they just kind
of help guide me through everything I'm
such a visual person that I need to see
it in order for me to know that it's
coming together properly I will go ahead
and show you guys my Pinterest board for
my inspiration so here is my holiday
mood board and I pretty much as you can
tell and loving anything velvet anything
faux fur I'm loving textures right now
especially for the holiday time because
I think it's a really great time to play
with textures I'm loving anything sheer
metallic so this is something that I
have kind of put together over the past
week if I'm scrolling Pinterest and I
see something that I think I would love
for holiday time then I just pin it that
way I have something to go back to when
I actually am looking for a holiday
dress so now we're going to get into the
shopping online versus shopping in store
one thing I love about shopping online
is that if you see an item that you like
you can refer back to your closet and
see if a you either already have an item
exactly like that or B you can see what
all you need for that outfit because I
know sometimes when we shop in store
we're like oh this is the perfect top
now I need jeans wait do I have shoes to
go with that what kind of outerwear am I
gonna wear so when you are sitting at
home in your sweat pants you can see
okay I am gonna go look for shoes to
wear with this and you can almost just
throw your whole outfit together on your
bed - that one piece that you're going
to order so when you are shopping online
it's so easy to just type in your
keywords so you know for sure that you
are looking for a stud blazer or a
velvet blazer you could just go to
google or go to your favorite online
store and just type it in and see who
has it so for example something that
I've seen lately that I really love is a
stud blazer one of my favorite stores to
shop out online is Zara because I always
know that their velvet is always really
good it's never gonna come in the mail
and funky and weird material I know it's
gonna be good quality and second I know
they have quick shipping every time I
order from Zara it gets to my house
within three days because I think they
have a warehouse in New Jersey or
Philadelphia so I would just go to Zara
calm and if one comes up perfect if I
were out shopping I would have to
physically walk to each store and just
fingers crossed that somebody has it and
it's just a waste of time if you're
looking for a certain specific outfit
another tip I have for online shopping
is make sure they have reliable shipping
you know if you see something and you
know it might not get there in time you
want to make sure that you can do
express shipping checkout and if you
can't I just wouldn't order it there is
so much room for human error if they
don't get your you are a package packed
in time where they don't get it sent out
in time and then you're screwed and then
you're in big trouble and then you have
to do the last-minute faux fur crop
thing but they're a good reason for
shopping online is the easy return so I
have had so many events that I've gone
to where I pull up you know four
different dresses that I like and I just
don't know which one to wear like what
if one of them doesn't fit or when if
one doesn't get here in time
I usually end up ordering like three to
four different options and online is
super easy to send back so I'll get them
I get to try them on at home send back
whichever ones I don't like obviously
it's quicker to go to the store and try
them all on
right then in there but with this way if
you have time you know you're beating
the lines you're meeting having to stand
in line so it's just overall a time
saver so now we're gonna get into the
tips and tricks of shopping in store
sure to have your Pinterest board your
mood board pulled up on your phone so
you can see what you are looking for and
you don't get distracted the great thing
about shopping in store is that you can
actually feel touch see the things you
can try them on write that in there so
my biggest tip for shopping in sorte is
to stay focused especially if you're
going into an H&amp;amp;M or a Topshop or Zara
there is just so much going on and
distractions can happen stores like that
they usually have all of their holiday
stuff kind of in one section so you want
to make sure to stay there you know
don't be like oh but that dress would be
cute for work or that would be cute for
you know the summertime stay focus the
last thing you need is a hundred things
in your fitting room that you don't need
because then your things that you're
focused on are going to get lost but I
recommend what I always do is I just
take a photo and then search for it
online later if I'm dying for it or just
to go back and try it on after you've
already purchased everything after
you've tried everything on and just make
sure to try to keep all of your stuff
seperated stay focused for shopping in
store is to get there when they open
especially during this time of year
where people are out Christmas shopping
especially in New York City right now
the weekends are in sane because there
are so many tourists here this time of
year and everyone's getting their
Christmas shopping done and you're over
here like I'm just trying to find a
blazer for my party tonight make sure
you try to get there when they open that
is my number one tip to just shopping in
general if I ever go show up shopping
I'd go right when they open like I'm the
one standing there at the door when they
open I'm the annoying one get in and out
and I'm usually in line to pay by the
time the crowd starts getting in so wake
up early grab your coffee get it done so
overall picture is I love shopping
online when I can but you know sometimes
you love the feeling of going in store
and trying things on and really feeling
everything and putting a whole outfit
together
