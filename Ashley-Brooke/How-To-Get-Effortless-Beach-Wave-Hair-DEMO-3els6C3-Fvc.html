i'm going to be talking about how to
create the perfect beach wave I know
this is challenging for a lot of us
because when we try to create the
perfect beach way we end up having
pageant hair um so I kind of played with
different wands and sprays and different
tutorials to see what I think is the
easiest and what works best so um I hope
you enjoy give any questions at the end
of the video please comment below what
you're going to need first of all is a
straightener easy enough we all have one
of those and trusty clicky and you're
also going to need a wand or curling
iron I prefer to use the wand just
because I feel like it gives you more of
a natural beach wave rather than an
actual curl um this one is by Conair I
love it I've had it for a couple of
years now you're also going to need some
type of holding spray hairspray or
mousse I personally don't use any kind
of spray because my hair is already kind
of damaged and holds a curl pretty well
so I normally just curl it and it stays
for a couple of days if you have healthy
hair or very fine smooth hair you might
want to grab some kind of sea salt spray
some kind hairspray mousse just
something that you normally use I
suggest a medium hold hairspray
just because an extra hold can get a
little bit crunchy and crispy and kind
of takes away from the natural look that
we're going for with the beach wave so
go ahead and grab your stuff and let's
get started
so what I use after I dry my hair is
this Garnier a brilliant shine glossing
spray
I love this because it takes the the
frizz out of my hair it gives it a nice
glossy shine without making it look
greasy there's so many glossing sprays
out there but this this is the one that
I find works best for my hair so I just
spray it on my ends and you have to be
careful where you spray this because it
makes your floor really slippery I
learned that the hard way so I usually
hop in the shower spray this on my hair
and then start fixing it so the first
thing we're going to do is put I would
say more than half of our hair into a
clip oh that's not cute let me try that
again
okay so you've got this nice little
thing going up here and then you've got
just the bottom layer of your hair so
I'm going to start with my straightener
because when I blow-dry my hair it's
really really volumize up at the root
because I dry my hair with a round brush
going up so I want just the top to lay
flat and this is just on the bottom
layer that I do this just this first
layer so there that's a little bit
better okay so since I have a little
more on the thick side of hair it's a
little bit drier it's a little thicker I
put my straightener barely I don't I
don't even clamp it shut I just give it
enough heat to where I just barely slide
through it and this kind of takes out
any frizz that's leftover from when I
blow-dry it so then I'm going to get my
wand I start up at the top like this and
I spread it out
and then just slide it down like that
where it's kind of like a wave and not
so much of a curl
I find that where most people go wrong
with doing a beach wave is they start at
the bottom like this and then curl up
and that's going to actually create more
of a curl see some funny see so you get
more of a curl than an actual wave okay
now I've got to figure out how to fix
that because that looks ridiculous
okay that's just gonna exit alright so
moving on so we're going to start at the
top create a long wave and just work our
way down just slide it down hold the
hair at the end with your finger and
then let go
so start at the top go down boom wave
then we're going to keep this on the
front it's nice and wavy except for that
one little piece that I showed you and
then we're going to go about half way
okay so we're basically going to go
through and just do the same thing start
at the top slide it down and remember
don't go to the ends
now when you start getting to the pieces
around your face you want to make sure
that you're going away from your face
so don't curl it in like that
curl it out like this so we're starting
from the end and we're just literally
sliding it down just like that
you
when you start getting towards the top
of your head like I on right now make
sure you keep your pieces very small
when you're done kind of break them
apart like this so another thing to
remember when you start getting towards
the top layer you want to just take
random little pieces that you've
actually already curled go back and just
recur all the top make sure you have
your hair spread out
you should really only see it wrapped
around the wand two maybe three times so
just do the top
the hair around your face try to only do
those ones because once you start going
over them more and more they'll start to
break off so make sure you're really
really careful with the hair around your
face as you can see I've got some like
breakage because I learn the hard way
but oh well
so now I'm on my top layer I'm gonna do
my bangs first so I'm going to go around
the back and just slide down
if you don't already use a wand if you
have a curling iron
I suggest you you get a wand mine's
Conair I think I got it for like $20
I've had it for the longest time it's
amazing just beware the first time you
use a wand it's going to be really hard
and you're going to just want to throw
it out the window so you have to be
patient and give it some time it's
definitely a learning process I the
first week I had my wand blisters and
band-aids all over my hand it's not cute
but um
you definitely get the hang up and after
after a couple of weeks of being scarred
up so when I'm finally done I take my
wand and I just kind of pick through my
hair and just do random just tiny pieces
like I was doing before the key to beach
waves is that it's not supposed to look
perfect so that's great so if you have
some that are a little curlier than that
others that's okay because I think that
makes it look more natural and actually
makes it look better so then I take my
straightener and like I did before I
don't clamp it all the way down just
because it causes less damage to your
hair so what I'm going to do is just
take this and on the ends I'm just
barely going to smooth over just like
that
barely clamping down because you don't
want split ends
so straightening the ends is really
really what creates the final look so
when you curl your hair you have an
all-over curl at beach waves is more
something that should kind of wavy
starting at the top and then kind of
fades up at the bottom so it's not such
a dramatic look okay then when I'm done
with that I'll take my Garnier glossing
spray and just do one more coat over it
just to smooth it out I also usually use
bumble and bumble sea salt spray that's
a really really good spray if you're
wanting a beach way because it actually
creates like a hold for the wave it's
nothing too sticky or too dry you can't
even tell that it's on your hair and it
really really holds the wave so if you
