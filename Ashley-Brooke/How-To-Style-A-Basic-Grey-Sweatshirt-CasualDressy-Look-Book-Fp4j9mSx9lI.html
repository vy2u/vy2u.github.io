how to style and today we are styling
this really awesome gray sweatshirt I'm
obsessed with it so I'm wearing it
I love taking like super casual pieces
like joggers and like this kind of
sweatshirt and making kind of an outfit
out of it I don't think anyone has
requested this but I just thought I
would surprise you because I feel like
you want this you just didn't know you
wanted it so that is what I'm styling
shooting right and I since fighting this
rain today on and off to spin like the
longest shooting day ever
so we already we only filmed one look as
it right now and we still have three
more to go so I'm just gonna go ahead
and like show you guys what we're
styling while we wait for the rain to
pass well and so I'll just go ahead and
show you the sweatshirt this is what it
looks like basic gray pine AK which I
love and I'm wearing it with some suede
shorts from Laura excuse me a little
fluffy pillow go ahead and get into the
outfit description the first outfit guy
styled with this sweatshirt um it's this
little skirt from forever 21 skirt is so
easy like if you guys ever see one of
these just like some fie shapeless black
skirts grab it to avoid it looking like
a school uniform because I paired it
with some black loafers cuz I'm
obsessive black loafers to avoid it
looking like a school uniform I added a
bandana but I did it as like a choker I
didn't do it as an actual Thai bandana I
also did my trusty hat because otherwise
it it was it looked like a school
uniform but I love an oversized
sweatshirt and a t-shirt with a skirt
but it's very borderline school uniform
so you have to add something a little
cooler to it to make it to where it's an
actual outfit so I did a hat and a
bandana and then for my next outfit I
went in the complete opposite direction
and I styled a
white pleated skirts what is that on
this skirt I haven't so this is from
forever 21 and I bought it a while ago
knowing that one day I would wear it
wearing it today
so the first time after the second time
I've worn this I just love taking super
unexpected girly pieces and adding like
a sweatshirt to it because you'll see in
the video it ties together really nicely
it's such a cool kind of effortless
street style look and then I added a
boot to it you will see these throughout
winter so much this is the steel boot I
think it's the seal from Free People
I got these last year but they make them
every year so they have them right now
on their website and please look at this
color how perfect is this color I think
it's called tobacco and I don't know I
just thought this is a really nice fall
color palette and it's also taking a
skirt that's so summery and so even
spring and making it fall which is
interesting so don't get rid of your
summer pieces quite yet and then my next
look is a little bit more menswear
inspired and can also be worn to the
office if you have an office job um I
took is kind of menswear inspired
high-waisted trousers and I just got
these not that long ago I actually got
on last this summer when Czar was having
their sales so they were 70 and I got
them for 19 the last what's up steel I'm
a warning yet obviously because of thin
summer and they're like busy thick
winter material I thought this was a
really cool way to kind of dress
sweatshirt up and for the office you can
wear you can do a blazer over it to make
it a little bit more office appropriate
I added a bootie but you can also do a
heel to make it office appropriate so I
did the trousers the bootie
I added a belt because when things are
high waisted I like to accentuate my
waist just so you can see that I have a
waist belt helps it draws attention and
makes you seem a little bit more
hourglass shape and then I added a hat
90 percent because it was raining but
also because um I don't know I just
thought a hat kind of completed this
look and since um I was doing my black
boots I did a black hat on top to kind
of even everything out um I thought it
was a nice little touch but definitely
if you're not a hat person go without
that and for my last look I decided to
do something super casual is good for
when you're going to class or if you're
just kind of like running around during
the day I did the gray sweatshirt with
some green cargos and I am so obsessed
with these
I love I've got like four pairs of green
cargos but these are like my go-to
because they're so soft and they just
say like feel like sweatpants even
though they're not I love these and I
love green and grey together so if
you're ever kind of wondering what to
Peregrine with I think grey is like I
love this color palette perfect I added
a sneaker you can do a sandal you can do
whatevs but you know I love my white
sneakers and you can also do a booties
since we're going into fall with the
little chilly do a bootie
I was doing just fine before I met you I
drink too much and that's an issue but
I'm okay
say played-out blink when I'm reading to
some now we beat that into Sun okay I
know it breaks your to the city and I
broke down
No
she tries
are you so
mmm
look as good as the day I met you I
forgot just why I loved you I was gonna
say you tell your friends it was nice to
meet them but I hope I never see them
again I know
for years no girls no you're looking
pretty a no tomorrow
can stop
ah
Oh
phone
Oh
are you so
we
for me though so in the backseat of you
over that I know you get a phone right
that tattoo on your shoulder for the
sheets right off the corner of the
mattress are you so from your roommate
back and although we never get in
good
No
alright that is it for this how to style
again hope you loved it um this was one
of my favorite things to style because
like I like I said I just love taking
casual pieces and making outfits out of
them this sweatshirt was nine dollars
from H&amp;amp;M and I just made four outfits
and I was I had seven outfits on my bed
laid out trying to decide which ones to
show you guys so definitely get
something like this you will wear it way
more than than you think you will link
this one below I love it it's not one of
those like doesn't look like it's like a
lounging sweatshirt because it's a
little bit more fitted a little bit more
tailored up here and at the bottom so if
you're looking for a good one I
recommend this one super inexpensive so
check out my lookbook if you haven't
already I'll post the link right here is
a light buy her go slash lookbook and
you will find more outfits just like
these basically a lookbook for the month
it comes out each month and it gets
delivered straight to your inbox with
videos of me talking about each outfit
so you don't want to miss out on that
it's super cool and October's it's gonna
be so amazing because we're getting into
boots and layering sweaters and official
meeting handles I will post right here
for you to see as well as the lookbook
link just in case you wanna play
something yeah don't forget to share
this video for someone who loved finding
old sweatshirt II things and making them
an outfit you know this is definitely
some good outfit info for that and it
looks like the rain is letting up so I'm
gonna go film the rest of those then try
not to get soaked in the process if you
see a little like dark grey dots all
over it's probably just a raindrop so
don't mind me I will see you in my next
video bye the first thing that goes into
the blender are the acai packs
and I know that there are many different
brands that you can choose from but this
is my favorite I get the original blend
I've tried the unsweetened blend and
it's just not like I hate it so I always
get the original blend and they come in
little individual paths just like this
first thing I'm going to do is kind of
break up the mix and then dump it in
there and actually buy already frozen
bananas but they're kind of expensive
so whenever I have bananas that are kind
of starting to turn brown I always just
kind of chop them up and put them in a
bag so I can have them believe I'm going
to add a little bit of frozen bananas a
handful of frozen strawberries you can
add any kind of frozen berry that you
want or you can even add spinach you can
add any kind of veggie then I'm going to
take my almond coconut milk and I'm just
going to pour a little bit don't pour
too much or else it'll be super slushy
once and I can blend it out I'm just
going to add a couple of scoops of
peanut butter because it tastes amazing
with peanut butter mixed into it it just
like completely changes the whole thing
if you like peanut butter if not you can
do almond butter you can do cashew
butter whatever butter you prefer stuff
things out okay don't forget to lick the
spoon
like
I'm not scraping so I'm just going to
make kind of a bed of granola in my bowl
