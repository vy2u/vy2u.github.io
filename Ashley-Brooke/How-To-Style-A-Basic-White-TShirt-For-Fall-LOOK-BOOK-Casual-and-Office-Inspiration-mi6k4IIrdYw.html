Ashley and new here welcome if you are
have been subscribed for a while I hope
you love this look book I know last week
everyone was like no it's flop them
around do the lookbook first and then do
the talk-through so that is what we're
gonna do I always want to make you guys
happy and if that's what but that's what
you want then that's what you're gonna
get hey I styled white t-shirts um I
love a good white t-shirt I finally had
to clean on my t-shirt drawer because I
was just getting to money so now I
narrowed it down to my like top 5
favorites that still t-money I don't
know the t-shirt I styled today is from
Topshop and I absolutely love it it's
one of my favorites I like the high neck
I think it's perfect for fall it's not
see-through it's great but to
incorporate some work outfits as you
guys know I always try to incorporate
some sort of office inspiration
depending on your dress code at work you
can kind of edit it the way that you
need to for your own dress code so
obviously in the fall when you wear
white t-shirts you have to layer unlike
the summer you can pair them with a cute
skirt you know layer some necklaces and
you're good to go in the fall you pretty
much hop to layer in order to keep warm
but layering is one of my favorite
things in the whole world so I was so
happy to do this video so let's go ahead
and get started with the how to style
the first way I styled it was with one
of my favorite jackets that I own right
now and it is this guy from Topshop just
this beige khaki pleated sleeve jacket
this was in my Hall a couple of weeks
ago and a lot of you guys really liked
it
I call it my Members Only jacket because
it just looks like a more chic version
of a Members Only I love it I think it's
great with black with dark denim with
light denim can wear this to the office
I just think it's a really great piece a
great unique layering piece to have and
it's really lightweight I did it with
some light color denim padding with
black originally but it almost I don't
know it was a really sunny bright day so
I wanted to lighten things up with a
lighter lighter wash denim
and of course these are my side snap
jeans I love them so much to be really
careful when you squat down because you
will just come undone literally and give
everyone a little show then I did my
little suede bag from Zara I love this
because it's navy and black which is one
of my favorite combinations this season
I'm just loving Navy and black right now
but to tie in the black in the bag I did
these shoes there's this one one of my
subscribers always comments telling me
how much she hates these shoes every
time I wear them so I got it um but I
love them so I'm going to be wearing
those and they're so comfortable too I
think they're a great work shoe if you
guys can wear shoes like these to the
office they're so comfortable small
block heel my favorite thing in the
world and I'm trying to get as much wear
out of them before it gets super cold
outside next I wanted to do a skirt I
love skirts I love a skirt and boot
combo so I was like okay I have to do
that so I did this paper bag skirt from
Zara it's this from Zara a few years ago
so I doubt they have it I wish I had it
in every color because I love it that
month then so I wasn't too covered up to
actually show that I was wearing just a
t-shirt I did my military style vest
from Zara this guy this isn't a whole a
while ago and I don't think I've worn it
maybe once since then so it's really
happy to pull this guy out pretty heavy
so it's it's a fall piece it's
definitely not summer it's like this
thick almost denim material then oh my
booth oh I love these booths from Steve
Madden they straight shaft boots so
they're not like a skin tight snug
spandex fitting boot they are a wide
shaft boot and I just I love this look
I've been more drawn to this style this
season than I am the form-fitting boot I
still love my my tighter boots my over
the knee boots but I just think these
give you more of a modern trendy look so
if you are looking for a new style of
boot definitely go for something like
this then I did my little ring bag from
forever 21 when you're wearing the best
such with such detail as the one that I
wore with this you don't want to compete
with it with your bag because you know
when you carry your bag
this then it's you've got so much going
on you want to keep your bag as simple
as possible so my next outfit I wanted
to be something that you could
incorporate into work wear so I did this
floral and plaid blazer from Zara it's
so cool I love planning love florals
when I saw this in the store I was like
how does my blazer a dream come true and
they actually have matching pants to go
with this and that is what I call a
power suit love a good power suit just
did it with my faux leather lolololo
viously a lot of you guys cannot wear
this outfit to work it's a little funky
a little crazy but if you are in a you
know low-key relaxed office environment
then this outfit should be good to go
care this blazer with your regular
trousers and it's long so it looks great
buttoned up
did I wear it buttoned in this look like
the look of a long blazer button
especially when you have a skinnier pant
on the bottom if you're wearing a wider
leg pant leave it open show your waist
but if not then button that girl up it
looks good that way um especially when
you bought the matching pants power suit
especially if you knew that was coming I
did this little guy from Topshop faux
shearling with my suede Alice and Olivia
booties I didn't want to compete too
much with the blazer but I wanted
something non leather looking because
when this is up against the pant you
don't want like a leather explosion so
you've got two different textures you've
got the faux leather and then you've got
the shearling so when you're doing a
leather bottom stay away from a leather
bag try to do something like this do
suede that way it's just not like like a
leather explosion like a lot earlier
floor mat last look it was just kind of
Saturday funsies going to buy flowers
um funsies what kind of running errands
walking around so beautiful here so I
wanted to be casual but I was like in
the mood to kind of look cute because
the weather was nice I did these wide
leg pants that I have had forever and
ever
I want to say I got these from Zara sale
like years ago
for $7 ridiculous they're not so much of
a fall material so I can't wear these
for too much longer my casual looks I've
been swapping out my skinny joggers for
a white leg with my sneaker and I don't
know I just like that look I think it's
a newer look it's a little bit more
fresh
if this denim jacket from urban buy a B
D G B D G just like does well with their
denim I love anything patchwork I think
it's such a statement piece
so I did it with this I love that it's
cropped I love that it has flowy sleeves
and I can scrunch them up it's my
favorite thing did my raggedy old white
leather sneakers from Joshua Saunders
that I need to retire quickly oh I see
Stella got a hold of this one
thanks a lot because it was Saturday and
my hair was a little on the dirty side I
threw on a Baker boy hat but then once I
had it on I was like oh this kind of
makes the outfit look a little cute like
a little cuter then it was just kind of
added um just an accessory to it you
know I feel like when I'm super casual
even when I'm wearing like leggings and
a t-shirt I think adding like a trendy
accessory kind of makes you mix your
outfit a little bit stepped-up you know
what I mean you probably don't because
that didn't make any sense
did my white actually it's not really
white kind of like a eggshell oyster
snow no knots notice and it was pretty
wait it's from a Flynn and I don't know
if they make this style anymore but I
saw in bloomingdales that they make the
bucket bag version of this that's really
cute I want the black one but this is a
great color if you guys are looking for
a good winter white this is awesome
because it's not white so it will tie in
all of your fall
items so you guys love the look book
first in the talk-through second it's
here to stay so I don't want to hear
anything else about it
I keep flip-flopping because people are
like no I like it the other way sorry

Like subscribe and share if you love
this video to share with your friends we
