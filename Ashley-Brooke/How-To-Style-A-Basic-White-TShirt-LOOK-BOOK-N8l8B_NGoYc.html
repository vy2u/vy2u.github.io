of how to style Days episode we are
styling white t-shirts I got so inspired
by a few of you in my last video started
a thread about how you wish I would
style white t-shirts so I was like oh
such a good idea I have to do it so that
is what I'm doing today let me just
start by talking about the white t-shirt
for a second I think you can have too
many white t-shirts I did a super big
closet clean out about a year ago and I
got rid of two thirds of my closet I had
10 trash bags that I took to Goodwill
I'm not joking you and I had probably 15
white t-shirts you should only have
white t-shirts that you love in today's
video I'm actually going to be styling a
scoop neck a high neck and a boyfriend
t-shirt so something a little bit more
oversized just a quick tip that I also
have for you guys I recommend folding
down your white t-shirt I feel that when
they hang the shoulders get stretched
out and that's just for any t-shirt but
I feel like white you can see it the
most you know you get those little
hanger marks and then they just start to
hang weird and they don't fit right for
this look I am styling this oversized
white cotton t-shirt from brandy
melville have about 3 t-shirts from
brandy melville that I constantly live
in so if it's a little too long to do
the tucked in look because it gets a
little bunchy so I always leave this top
house I am styling it with a long duster
blazer a c-clip bottom and a pair of
blue wrists nice skinny jeans from Zara
I wanted to make this outfit a little
bit more dressy so I am adding a simple
ankle strap heel to it these are from
Steve Madden they're obviously my go-to
ankle strap feels like like almost worn
them out completely I need to get a new
pair this is honestly a look that you
can do so much with in the winter you
can take these away and add a pair of
leather pants for work you can take the
duster away and add a blazer or you
could even add some black flats to it
instead of the heel if you want to do
something super casual
there's just so many different things
that you can do with this whole outfit
the next t-shirt I'm going to be styling
is this one from forever 21 and this is
a six almost sweater leg teacher I don't
know if you can tell styling it with the
pair of black joggers from forever 21
and I decided to make this look a little
bit more casual so I'm going to add a
white sneaker to it obviously with this
outfit you can add a heel and a blazer
for work you can add a heel for going
out or sandals just for casual day times
it's something that I would wear to go
to a coffee shop to work or to go to the
airport or you know if I'm just walking
around and want to be comfortable this
is my go-to outfit I'm also going to add
a denim jacket to this outfit just to
add a little bit of color because it is
so black and white if it were so hot
outside I would probably do a plaid
shirt inside around my waist or a denim
shirt and tie it around my waist so this
just kind of shows what the outfit looks
all tied together as you can see it
would be a little bit too black and
white if I didn't add a denim jacket
the next shirt I'm going to be styling
is this one from Zara and this is one of
my newer white t-shirts that I have been
like living in it it's a high-neck which
is great for when you're layering with
overalls or like a black dress you
wouldn't have something with a high neck
so it doesn't compete with the line of
the overall or the dress that your legs
layering it under and adding a pair of
high-waisted denim shorts from Topshop
and since we're still in summer that's
why I went with the light wash versus a
dark wash or a black really trying to
squeeze you know my last my end of
summer outfit and for my third piece I'm
going to add a printed bomber jacket
since that outfit is still plain you
know it's just a simple shorts and
t-shirt combo which is great I do love a
good just plain shorts and t-shirt but
for the sake of a lookbook I wanted to
show you guys what it looks like with a
third piece since it is a little warm
outside still I'm going
you scrunch the sleeves up this is
actually from H&amp;amp;M I have been finding
the best printed sweatshirts and bomber
jackets from there lately tied up and
twisted mouth I wanna be your lover
until I'm on the ground I wanna be me
but you don't feel the same I feel it in
your hands now I'm feeling I woke up in
a foreign land in a castle made of Sam
no one wants me
one wants me Casso me your snake
watch me
yes
you
on the sky well you don't even care I
see it in your eyes
eyes cold and black instead
I woke up in a foreign land in a castle
made of Sam wants me me

you know castle made upstairs all right
