you just a picture we love strength I
deserve what the salt on your skin
I know never shouldn't be doing this out
loud focus my thumb to your feet
try to keep a balance on his taro the
body
hoo-wah to me
browning Oh jealous does a day that you
gotta find me in a dollar your hey
that's possible
me
Oh
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel another episode of how to style
today I am styling the athleisure trend
I don't know why I don't make them so
you can kind of see my take on the
athleisure trend from the whoops book
that you just saw I think of mixing
workout pants and sweaters and sneakers
and kind of casual cool Street buy but
yet like comfy this is like the type of
stuff you will see me running around in
on the weekends and you know if I'm just
running through the office for like a
few hours and I want to be comfortable
if I'm going to be sitting down all day
this is the kind of stuff that you will
see me wearing alright so now it's time
for the actual have style portion of the
video I fight you serious like help me
what is this even make sense like almost
like I don't know what to do with my
hands so I always try when I put these
outfits together to start with and more
athletic cats I always try to start with
the more athletic wear casual piece when
I'm putting together new sorts about
Fitzsimmons build on top of it so I
started with this adidas sweatshirt and
it is Ryan's it is not mine but I always
ski with out of this closet because it's
oversized it's comfortable and this is a
size medium so I started with this can I
get a little bit more cool instead of
just doing regular leggings or jeans I
went with my faux leather leggings to
give it more of like a cool girl vibe
and these leggings are so comfortable
I've had them for three years and I know
they make them every single season I
believe they're still online right now
so if you're looking for a pair of the
leather leggings I definitely recommend
these guys then I added my camel coat
with the black collar underneath and
I just love the great Campbell combo I
think there you know on two completely
sets of the color wheel you know once
more of a cool tone one's more of a warm
tone but I think they really go together
nicely this is more of your dressy piece
in the outfit so I went with something a
little bit more tailored to kind of give
it a little bit more of an elevated look
can I added my Joshua Saunders in Y
sneakers backwards I don't know I love
these they are so comfortable they're
pretty much my year-round speakers
because they're white leather they go
with everything and I love you but yous
are pretty expensive but I got a really
really good deal on them I'll try to
find them and I'll also try to link some
other options down below for you guys
for outfit number two I started with my
black workout pants and forever 21 has
best affordable workout pants that I own
I have at least seven care from forever
21 and they fit me so nice they're a
little high-waisted they're super tight
in the leg they don't slip I don't know
I just love these then I just added a
plain gray kind of spin oversized
slouchy sweater and then I really wanted
to make my outfit pop by adding a cool
outer piece something a little bit
different so I added this cardigan some
olive green cardigan with red piping and
I thought it was really nice with the
gray I love all it in grade together and
then a pop of red is just like I'm
loving red so much right now I was
really excited to find this I had a
handbag I had a purse and I can't not
sure where is that but it kinda know
what's the screen
it's hidin really nicely to the red and
the black and the gray so as you can see
in the video I chose this because it
really hides everything or that's you I
did in my adidas tubular defiance
sneaker and I love these getting a lot
of questions about these in my vlogs
and I cannot seem to find them online
anymore I think they're pretty much sold
out everywhere but I will keep looking
brief eyes and I'll link them if I can
find them but they're basically they
have a gray toe with the star band over
the top and then suede all along the
shoe right here you have like a longer
tongue for my next outfit I grabbed this
very thick Kanye West and spy on so
everyone really inspired sweatshirt I
love that it's kind of distressed on the
collar like my favorite part and on the
arm the armhole but I love this color I
thought it just went with so much it
tied in really cool colors together and
I think you can build on top of this as
much as you want did some basic black
high-waisted skinny jeans is the ones
that I always wear but I need to get a
new pair because I was pulling these up
for the video and the belt loop ripped
off of things so I can I did this big
cozy scarf and I just kind of bolted
around my neck and threw the other half
in the back and really just tried to
make it as cozy and comfy and layered
looking as possible but I thought the
colors tied in a really nice and
obviously with the Hat I thought it
really just tied all the colors and
together I thought this was really nice
this hat is like Ally favor it goes you
know all my hats are black and white and
navy so it's nice to have a cool like
brown suede one that really you know
kind of makes your outfit pop so I love
this then I just did my basic row she's
my Nikes and I actually custom made
these online to where they would be
leather right here instead of this mesh
material you can actually customize them
to be leather so stuff that was cool
so that's outfit it's definitely
something that I would totally wear to
go like run to the grocery store really
just like throwing layers on and heading
out the door but making sure that like
your color palette is cool and you know
you've got some interesting pieces on so
I started with the forever 21
workout pants that I showed you guys
already am tonight added this pink
sweater that I absolutely love a shirt
you guys to watch my blog know that I
wear this all the time I'm sure you're
like Ashley please put down the pink
sweater so literally it's like the most
comfortable thing and I have it in navy
also we did this big cozy kind of shawl
type scarf over it the colors kind of
tight and really nicely as why I got the
scarf begin with because thought it went
with my favorite sweater really nice go
crazy then I added a super thick knitted
beanie I love this I think the colors
are so pretty and it fits really nicely
on my head and again color palette on
OnPoint here with my mommy pinks and
grays colors and well the thing I added
my me cough right here the sky this is
Stella McCartney for Adidas and I love
these so much I just think the pattern
and the colors are so nice and really
sets you up to wear some like pretty
cool colors I thought you know
everything else was kind of neutral
tones and black and Gray's that throwing
a color outfit would be really nice for
those of you guys who are in sunshine
all the time
we can't all be that lucky so um enjoy
this this one I did not it was cloudy
when I shot this one but whatever so
yeah it's a little colder where you are
you know I coat over it at a heavier
cardigan you know you can always edit
these outfits to kind of climate that
you're in right now these videos are
just for you know I'm trying to meet the
middle of my East Coasters and my West
Coasters and everyone all around oh
definitely feel free to add or take away
any layers substitutes you might get it
so I hope you guys really enjoyed this
video I had such a good time shooting
this because I was so comfortable all
day and I was at speakers and it just
like made me happy realistically like
this is my weekend entire right here
when I was running
and stuff and hopping from the subway at
the cab and you know grocery shopping
you just want to be comfortable so I
think this is a really good way to kind
of elevate your casual style if you will
you know by adding faux leather leggings
or a suede baseball hat you know almost
makes you feel not so sloppy and kind of
frumpy so hopefully this helps you know
the drill if you haven't signed up for
the life by our lookbook it's getting a
huge makeover for February so come join
us after you join and sign up for the
Facebook group to check us out and I
will see you guys in my next video
