style today and it is going to be a how
to style basics this is more of a
different setting than my last how to
style because now I'm at home versus in
Florida so this is going to be a little
bit more hands-on and kind of explaining
a little bit more what's going on I'm
just gonna grab a few basic items that I
have in my closet and that I think you
know you guys might have also and if not
they're super easy to find so I'm just
going to start with those and I'm going
to build outfits on top of it so you can
see exactly what I'm doing and how I'm
doing it this is just a plain black mock
neck
ribbed dress from forever 21 and it was
like $12 it's super basic it's
form-fitting so you can either make it
sexy at night or you can do something
casual during the day so what I'm going
to do is make it casual and depending on
the weather that day will either throw
on a denim shirt or a denim jacket since
we're making it super casual I'm just
going to pair my white Joshua Saunders
sneakers with it
but obviously if you're going to do this
at night I would just do a basic pair of
heels and you know a cute clutch to go
with it
I'm going to combine my next two Basics
into one outfit because I know I think
wearing your basics together and then
building on top is also a good idea so
here I've got just a plain black ripped
bodysuit with a low back from Zara and
then I've got also from Zara just a pair
of light washed denim ripped tomboy
jeans
so what tomboy jeans are kind of like a
girlfriend Jean it's going to be a
little bit looser fitting up here like a
boyfriend but then it gets a little
tapered and Tyler towards the bottom so
you don't have the effect of a super
baggy boyfriend Jean so I'm just going
to dress these down by adding just a
pair of wrap sandals wrap around the
ankle sandals and I'm going to add a hat
to make it a little bit cooler a little
bit more daytime I know when we think of
body suits we think of nighttime but
this is also kind of showing how you can
wear this during the day
you
this is just a basic black and white
striped top from H&amp;amp;M two pockets just
playing button down and then I'm also
going to use these basic black
high-waisted shorts from Zara and I
really hope I can find these online
because these are so comfortable they
are so stretchy and they're just a super
great fit so I really hope I can find
these for you guys online and to style
this outfit I'm going to add my Topshop
belt to give it more of kind of a Texan
vibe just kind of a little bit more of a
western look I'm going to add this belt
and then I'm also going to dress it up a
little bit with a block heel stud sandal
from Topshop
my
I think another really great summer
staple basic piece is just a pair of
shorts overall or jean overalls whatever
you prefer
so to style these guys oh and this is
from mango and I believe I got these
last year but I think they make them
every year so I'll link them below if I
can find them so to style this I'm going
to make it a little bit more girly and
I'm actually going to put this off the
shoulder top underneath and I picked a
really really thin off the shoulder top
because it's summer and I don't want to
burn up so this has really been and the
seas are kind of billowy but you can
definitely push them up if you feel like
it's just too much fabric and then I'm
going to add a fun sandal and these are
the belmont inspired but they're
actually from Jessica Berman and they're
really gross so sorry about that but
they're just plain brown and they've got
really fun detailing they've got studs
and they've got jewels on them so I fell
in love with these as soon as I saw them
so this is going to be how I style the
overall
Oh

how to style videos I know this is my

just going sit down in my chair and
you're just going to wrap it around the
top of the wand and you're not going to
go all the way down you're not going to
wrap the whole piece of hair around the
barrel and you're just going to slide up
and down make sure to not get the end of
the hair around the barrel you want that
to stay straight and then</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
