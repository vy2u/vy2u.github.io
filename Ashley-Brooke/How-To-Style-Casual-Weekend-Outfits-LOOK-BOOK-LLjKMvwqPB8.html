could be my people before I let you go
No
in fantasy story go
entity Oracle every can eventually you
let me down
and the people who say that it's magical
no don't tell me
yeah
in telephony goals every kind of in
Chile you live meet down what's up guy
welcome back to my channel Forge my face
my living room I'm sure most of you know
who watch my blogs that need to sold our
couch and we're waiting on our new cops
to get here so I thought why not make
use of this space that I have which I
have not used to so anyways I hope you
guys enjoyed this look book this was
just kind of like a casual what what I
would wear on the weekend type of
lookbook for I just kind of run errands
run around you know you have things from
a casual like denim looks to actual like
athleisure look so I really hope you
enjoyed it so I have a very important
question for you guys so I was thinking
about the how to style I want your
honest and genuine feedback on it
instead of how to style once a week what
do you guys think about me posting a the
same exact format as how to style but
like a weekly roundup of outfits that I
wore that week I think it would be more
beneficial to you guys to see just kind
of what I'm wearing during the week
rather than stick to a certain theme now
I will do how to style you know maybe
once a month on a really good topic like
how to style date night how to style
interview you know just cut from a
creative perspective I think this is a
great idea and I think it would be
really really cool the weekly outfit
videos like you'll still be getting cool
music you know you'll still be getting
the styling behind the outfit you'll be
getting you know it'll it'll be kind of
set up the same way you'll still be
getting the same out of it it'll just be
a different variety about this like
you'll get you know exactly what I wore
that week so you'll be seeing newer
items older items it just won't be a
specific topic
in next in Monday's vlog so in
tomorrow's vlog I'm going to be doing a
poll on and I'll let you guys vote and
if you all vote yes let's go ahead and
forward with this and I definitely want
to do a trial run you know for a month
just to see what you guys think of it
and if you absolutely hate it and we can
go back to the way that we've been doing
it but let me know if you want to test
it out go ahead and put in the comments
below what you guys are thinking but
there will be a poll in Monday's blog so
you don't want to miss out and vote on
them go ahead and get into the styling
session so for outfit number one I
started out with this tee shirt that I'm
wearing right now
Urban Outfitters absolutely loved it I
did this super long Navy cardigan and I
just threw this cart around it just adds
some sort of print because it was a very
basic you know really not much print not
much going on up top so I just threw
this on I think it scarf it's so easy to
throw over any outfit just to give you
you know a color or a certain print that
you're going for so I added my leopard
loafer because I thought that the color
scheme tied in nicely and I feel like
the shoe was so far away from the scarf
that you know it didn't clash so much
like you had a little bit of print up
top a little bit of print on the bottom
for outfit number two I did my fabletics
bomber this is my first time wearing
this and it's so comfortable if I go
work out piece like it's for the gym but
it's also great for throwing it on and
just like running errands and then I did
this little crop tee from forever 21 any
time I need a cropped t-shirt or
something like this forever 21 always
has my back and there's like $10 I think
I just did these I mean I wear these
like to sleep in around the house
out errands there are these leggings
from forever 21 they're like three
dollars and ninety cents and I literally
buy them in every color that they come
in they're just like the most
comfortable things ever they have a
really thick waistband so if they're
extremely comfortable I did more of a
gym sneaker like a work
speaker I did my adidas enemies in white
my love these they're so comfortable and
they're actually really padded so
they're extremely comfortable if you're
going to be walking all day but anxiety
level high because they're white and I
actually got some and you can't even
tell I'm being ridiculous but I got
something on them and I cannot wait to
like throw them straight into the
washing machine for my next outfit I did
as this teacher again I'm like I'm
running this t-shirt to its death I love
it
I did my blue linen blazer and I I love
this blazer because you can make it
casual I love dressing down dressier
pieces like you know I remember when I
was going for interviews when I first
moved here I would wear this blazer but
you can also wear it like on the
weekends with sneakers and it looks
really cool so I think it's good like
dressy blazer can be very versatile then
I threw in this scarf on it to add a
little color and a little bit of prints
and I love this because it is really
thin so it's easy to tie I know you guys
have seen this in a lot of my videos
lately and I love it then for my sneaker
choice I'll try not to touch the bottom
I did my Joshua Saunders in Y sneaker my
leather ones these are just so great for
running around so comfortable and they
just go with everything I mean they're
white so this is another shoe that I
need to like slow down because I don't
want to like ruin them but yeah they're
my go-to
alright my next outfit I did my long
duster coat from hmmm it's really really
thin so you know nothing too heavy it's
been so nice out so I don't want you
know a super heavy layered jacket so I
did this I did my white crop tee again
from number 21 then I just did my ripped
denim from H&amp;amp;M I love the color of these
I think they're so great for spring and
I love the rip placement so any time I
get a chance to wear light denim I
always grab these in to add some sort of
print I just did my slot from Steve
Madden did the first time I've ever worn
these and I thought
style are really in general because it's
always been so cold these are so
comfortable we walked up to Washington
Square Park and I walked the whole way
of Me's and was like super comfortable
so now I like grab them anytime you need
to run somewhere I just saw it adding
like a nice print a nice color this was
like a really good combination added
with the blue denim that is it for my
hottest style and I really like standing
up this is like comfortable I can move
around and grab stuff yeah what do you
guys think my all over the place is just
too weird
it's always weird when scenery changes
and things change you're like wait I
don't like it but I can reek so the
kitchen probably isn't the best like
background but maybe we can fix that I
don't know um yeah so go check out my
