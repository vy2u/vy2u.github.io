of how to style in sedate video we are
styling outerwear coats
leather jackets all of the stuff that
needs to be getting us through right now
it was a cold day shooting so it was a
great day to be styling coats so I was
super pumped about that though I've
gotten some requests for how to style
each of these items so I thought that I
would throw them together in one hat
style and then kind of talk about them
so the first coat that I'm styling is
this faux fur leopard one from Zara
there's so many different shades of
leopard out there in this world and I
thought that this one was perfect I like
it I don't like black and white leopard
and then I don't like black and brown
but I like this kind of mix of black
white and brown so it's exactly what I
was looking for I decided to do a fun
t-shirt from H&amp;amp;M and I think with
leopard coats you can play with them and
do you know fun band t-shirts and
graphic tees or you can dress them up a
bit and do kind of a solid black outfit
with the leopard coat I think that's a
really cool look as well and then I
paired it with my mom jeans the ones
from Zara I've been actually loving
these lately not letting the holes
because it's cold but loving the jeans
for outfit number two I've styled my
leather jacket from Zara I say maybe
going on six years I've had this the
ways I love styling leather jackets is
with a vest over it because I think it's
cool when your leather sleeve is poking
out it gives you a really nice layered
look and makes you look super cozy and
wintery I don't know I just love it I
paired it with my faux fur feathered
vest which is really long that's why I
love this vest so much and then I added
some faux leather joggers to complete
the look and the next jacket I styled is
this super long hooded one from forever
21 I'm done I'm going to try to put the
whole thing in the frame because it's so
long it's so much material I did an army
camo jogger
and a combat
so I like super made an edge a super
dressed down but the thing I love about
this coat is that it gives you such a
dramatic effect of what you look you're
going for
so when you want to be edgy it's like
cool super edgy long and then when you
want to be dressed up it's very elegant
and flowy so that's why I love this coat
and it maximizes the idea that I'm going
for with any look and for the last coat
it was the so dreaded puffer the puffer
coat so you guys have been asking me to
style these puffer coats for a while now
and I'm just going to be honest with you
like there is no looking cute or pretty
much stylish when it comes to puppy coat
I was telling somebody the other day on
snapchat I was like honestly everyone
looks the same and their puppy coats
just wear it it's not for looks it's for
warmth I can give you some tips so um so
with mine
I liked this little trim of faux fur on
the color I thought it made it look you
know nice and then I liked the hardware
because I do wear gold all the time so I
thought the hardware made it look
dressier but the thing I love most about
this coat is that it gives me a shape
because it has a belt and it's almost
tailored in at the waist so you don't
look like a huge cotton ball when you're
wearing your puppy coat as I can tell
you is to wear like a chic bottom and
definitely try to wear something skinny
on the bottom I you know I actually had
this on with my flares and it just
didn't look right because it was like a
lot of material and then a lot of
material
those are just my little tips and tricks
for the puffy coat which you will see me
wearing a lot this winter because for
obvious reasons it's freezing alright so
now that I've kind of explained my
outfit let's get straight into the look
look

in your mind or control in the clouds
and it feels like while here
you're intoxicated far asleep to a kiss
that tastes like wine even dreaming no
you can't escape me once it's over you
can't wait to press me one and I guess
it's just a liqueur
