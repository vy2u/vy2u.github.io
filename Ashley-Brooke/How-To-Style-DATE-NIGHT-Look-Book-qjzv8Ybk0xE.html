episode of how to style today we are
styling date night looks this was
requested a while ago by like 10 people
at once so I decided I would put that on
my calendar and film at for you guys
today in this video you will see a
compilation of 4 different variations of
date night looks all very different all
four different occasions so we will go
through that as I'm going through the
outfit we will just get straight into
the video for my first outfit I decided
to go with a shorts romper and I picked
this one from Target actually my mom
picked this out for me she was like you
have to try it out on to be so cute I
tried it on I absolutely loved it
because this high-waisted which is hard
to find a high-waisted elastic romper I
was so obsessed with this when I found
it I don't know it kind of looks like a
weird color in the video but it's black
and like a blush pink color and it was
like $24 I am so obsessed with it it's
got ruffles on the front
roughly sleeves and then it also has
ruffles on the shorts I decided to pair
this with a grey block heel sandal I
didn't want to do black because a little
too harsh for the pink so I went with a
lighter kind of elephant gray color and
I thought it really completed the look I
think this romper is great for any date
occasion whether you're going to dinner
to the movies or whether you're going on
like a walk or something I think this is
like just kind of a good all-around go
to a date night outfit Oh sometimes you
know
what else can we do when we're feeling
though so take a deep breath a little
God shouldn't be drowning on her own and
if you feel you're sinking
I'll offer you
around
so in this outfit I decided to do a
denim and top combo I did this top I
thought it was really girly and pretty
and romantic and it is off the shoulder
with a white arm sleeve and then it also
has a tie in the back but I thought that
was a little bit too much material for
me so I just let them kind of hang loose
and I thought it was really nice that
way and you can honestly pair a top like
this with black skinny jeans blue skinny
jeans denim shorts a denim skirt um kind
of just anything I decided to pair it
with my Zara ops kicks wear denim
because they're just kind of my favorite
jeans at the moment and I love the color
I think like white in the summer is
really really pretty with this really
rich blue so for my accessories I
decided to go with a plain black and
gold clutch and tan and black block heel
sandals and love these two accessories
together I think they go really nice to
kind of tie tie each other in so love
these again with that look you can do
sandals you can do a strappy heel you
can pretty much do kind of whatever you
want with that outfit
you shouldn't be fighting on your own
and if you feel you're sinking I will
jump right over into court call the
water for you
for my next look I went with my super
wide leg pants from Zara and this is how
wide like they are they're so wide but
I'm obsessed with these I think they're
awesome they're high-waisted elastic
waistbands that came with the belt but
it was ugly so I took it off and just
throw it away I've got pockets which I
love also pant is really good with a
crop top because they are pretty
high-waisted I paired it with this
off-the-shoulder lace crop top and I
think this is really romantic and pretty
for a date night and you can even do
justice with the pair of stay jeans and
you'd be good to go even though it
doesn't really matter you can't see my
shoe I paired it with my go-to block
heel sandals from Topshop because they
are super padded and super comfortable
so these are always kind of a no-brainer
for me sometimes you know what else can
we do when we're feeling zone
so take a deep breath a lot of gone
shouldn't be drowning on her own and if
you feel you're sinking um
fringo
Oh
around
for my left plus I decided to go with
something a little bit more dressy so I
picked this super flowy kind of blush
pink dress from Urban Outfitters its
mock neck and it has pockets which are
two of my favorite things in the whole
world and it's got a slit in the back
it's kind of cut pretty thin right here
so I always wear those sticky boobs with
it you can't really wear a bra because
it will show sticky boobs and you're
good to go and since I haven't really
done a super dressy look yet I decided
to throw in a heel and dress this up a
little bit but still keeping my same
color palette of a nudey pink look
whenever I do a solid color dress I
always make sure to add some sort of
texture or prints to my bag that's why
most of my bags are printed or textured
or metallic or something fun because
they're great for when you just have
kind of a solid color top or solid color
dress on I always like to add something
like this to it just to make just to
make my outfit pop and to make it a
little bit more cool
you shouldn't be fighting on
jump into for you that is it for this
out of style lookbook I hope you loved
it date night looks are so fun I think
that's the time where you can really
play with your outfits and pick some
cool things or you can be totally chill
and that's fine also you know it's just
kind of a good way to mix up your style
a little bit and like I mentioned before
in my last video there should be a
pre-sale page for her life coming up
very soon probably let's see what is
this video being posted so if if it's

girlfriend who's texting at the last
minute what do I wear I'm going on a
date oh my god this is a perfect
lookbook it is a compilation of four
completely different outfits so surely
within these four looks you can give
some great advice so don't forget to
share you don't have to be in a
relationship to go on a date or wear
date night outfit I personally love
going on dates by myself I'll go to
dinner by myself I'll go to the movies
I'll go you know do stuff like that eyes
it's totally okay to go on dates with
yourself or maybe it's not I don't know
but I do so Ryan and I were talking when
we were outside shooting this video and
we were talking about some like disaster
dates that we've been on in the past and
we were just laughing so hard
so Ryan and I both want to know what
your disaster date story is comment
below and please let us know and I will
read my favorite one in my next vlog so
comment your disaster day story please
so we can laugh at you
just kidding all right that's it I have
nothing else I will see you in my next
video bye
and it's my perfect shade i it's so hard
for me to find a BB cream that isn't too
like orange I don't know I keep buying
these BB creams that are so Orange and
they look like an oompa loompa I have
been living in this stuff all summer
long because it's so hot and my
foundation just melts right off my face
still covers up any dark circles or
imperfections that you might have but
it's light enough like a lotion so you
barely even know that it's there I love
your baby cream I will put some of my
NARS powder on top of it
just to keep it from creasing or um you
know smearing schmear my next two
products are actually oil and I am in
love with both of them equally for
different reasons my first one is just a
plain coconut oil and I found this a
t.j.maxx and then when I got up to pay
the bottle looks like craft at the top
so I had to put it back and I couldn't
find another one it was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
