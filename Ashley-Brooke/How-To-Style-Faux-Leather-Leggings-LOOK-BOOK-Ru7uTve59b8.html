Oh
Oh
hi guys welcome back to another how to
style it was so cold today while we were
filming I literally just walked back in
the door and my face is still like a
little numb kind of red from the wind so
ah what's so cold today I'm styling
these faux leather leggings from H&amp;amp;M I
got these a couple of years ago but I
believe H&amp;amp;M makes them every year so
I'll try to find them for you so for
this video um I put the lookbook first
and then the you know Alfa description
next maybe a you got and kind of get an
idea of what the outfit looks like
before I start describing it so I
thought that would help out a little bit
so I wanted to do mostly um casual
outfits because we all know how to dress
up leather leggings you know you do a
pair of heels in like a top easy I
wanted to kind of show you guys ways to
kind of incorporate them into the
athleisure trend which is kind of mixing
athletic wear with dressier pieces so
let's get started in the description boy
first outfit I wanted to do this one to
be kind of an office wear outfit if
you're allowed to wear this type of
legging to the office this is how I
would do it boss neck plain black mock
neck long-sleeve shirt with this blazer
that I put in my haul
a few weeks ago I still love it from
forever 21
it's the double button close your
closure always have so much trouble with
that stupid word a double button closure
kind of flowy long I don't know I love
this look because it's you know tailored
yet kind of cool and trendy because
you've got this oversized long dressy
blazer on so I love the look of this and
then of course I added a studded bootie
to mix it up a little bit make it a
little bit more fun not so black and
serious and I got these on Pasha
mark a few years ago there from Zara I
bought them for like $15 maybe never
worn so I've been loving these guys my
second outfit was something a little bit
more on the casual side and I started
off with this basic cream tighter
turtleneck just basic shirt and then I
added this super long trench vest over
it I love the look of anything long any
outerwear that's super long I always
kind of gravitate towards so I found
this at Target it is the who what where
collection from Target never make a
video without some sort of drama going
on I got a size medium because that's
all they had left and I was so desperate
to buy this I just bought the medium I
got it on sale for like $14 and I love
it I think it's a good throw on piece
that you can kind of throw on when you
want a super cozy layered look I added
my new booties from Poshmark um I just
got these in the mail a couple of days
ago and I was so excited to find these
on Poshmark the girl that sold me these
she has more listed in different sizes
so I will post it in the description box
below for ight now I just thought this
added a little color and a little print
just really needed a little something
extra so if you don't have Poshmark you
can use my code in the description box
to get five dollars off your first order
that'll also give me a $5 credit and if
you already have Poshmark give your
friends your code to sign up because
then you gonna viola credit so that's
always good $5 credits are always good
my third outfit I want to do something
super casual something that I would just
go run errands in if I needed to run to
the store or whatever um I did just a
basic white long-sleeve shirt this
oversized plaid button down from target
target always has the best plaid button
down there always not too thick not too
thin just kind of like the perfect happy
medium of the two to do some sort of
outerwear I did my denim jacket I did
have my leather jacket on but it was
almost a little too much
even for me I was like whoa that's a lot
of leather so I did my denim jacket and
I also had my faux leather hat on and
that's probably what was throwing me off
with the leather jacket I feel like you
should either do one or the other
the leather hat or the leather jacket so
I don't know I did my sneakers which I
can't quite seem to locate right now um
but you could do an ankle bootie a
motorcycle boot sneaker I don't know why
to the sneaker it was 48 degrees outside
but I did I just like the look of it but
you can pretty much substitute that for
any shoe or my last outfit I did my
beanie helped is twist my sweater
where's my sweater
thank you this black sweater from
forever 21 it gets inside out yep clean
black waffle knit sweater with my faux
leather moto vest over it again just to
add some sort of layer you could do like
a faux fur black vest or just some kind
of layering piece over that and my
beanie because it was like legitimately
cold and my ears were cold so I threw
this on a black Nike these are like my
running shoes of mixing athletic wear
pieces in with stuff like leather
leggings and sweaters invest not only
because it's so comfortable and I'm
walking around a lot but I like the look
of it I think it gives you like a chill
kind of cool vibe you can do a moto boot
you can do kind of a lace-up
army style boot so you know with an
outfit like this your shoe game is like
whatever you prefer but I wanted to be
comfy so I grabbed these alright so as
that is it for this video I hope you
liked it and let me know if you liked
the layout that I did of the lookbook in
the beginning and then kind of the
outfit description at the end I feel
like it makes a little bit more sense
but um again I want your feedback on
what you're thinking and my lookbook my
