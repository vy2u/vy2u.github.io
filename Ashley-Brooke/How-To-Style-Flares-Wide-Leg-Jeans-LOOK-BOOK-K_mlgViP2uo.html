episode of how to style today we are
styling Flair's slash white leg where I
get started my sweater is from Urban
Outfitters I'll link it below if I can
find it yeah cool thing about this how
to style is that we are in Texas right
now for the holidays we are not in New
York so we filmed this video at our old
apartment complex in San Antonio
actually the vlog that's going to go
live on Wednesday will have a tour of
the whole place so you guys can kind of
see where I'm and I lived before we move
to New York so super cool over my first
outfit I grabbed these semi flares from
forever 21 and they actually looked
pretty flared right here in the video
but they are like a slight flare I love
about them and they actually have their
own uneven hem so there's leaves in it
from filming the front is shorter than
the back which I thought it's a really
cool feature I just think these jeans
are like very cool girl jeans you know
it's it's for when you want a flare but
you don't want an extreme flare like you
went a little bit of a pop at the bottom
kind of in between a bootcut and an
actual flare I think that this style of
jeans is really cool with like a band
t-shirt vintage t-shirt leather jacket
black booty I paired it with this top
from who what where a target for target
loved the colors in this it's got white
green blue a little bit of pink so I
thought this was so cool it was giving
me like major rag-and-bone vibes cool
thing about it is there's actually a
necktie that you can take on and off so
if you want to wear this to the office
or if you need to dress it up a little
bit you can do a little bow or you can
do a casual and do it without the bow
but a size small in the shirt and a size
small in the jeans it's weird that the
jeans go small medium large but I got
the small for outfit number two I am
styling a pair of light wash wide leg
jeans from
market I believe there Massimo target
brand and they have the dip dye bottom
they are high-waisted there's such a
good color of light wash I love these
they're good lengths are super long
perfect with the booty so obsessed with
these jeans I love black and light wash
together so I paired it with just my
black ribbed brandy melville top with
the light wash added my mop coat over it
this is from Free People and I got it at
Nordstrom Rack I feel like this should
be in the window at the Natural History
Museum
looks like Bigfoot I'm obsessed with it
with how cool it's it's definitely a lot
of material but I love it I just said a
simple black bootie with all of the
outfit Alice and Olivia Cameron booties
which I'll link below leave a pointy toe
and I feel like pointy toe is a good for
a flared Jean versus a round toe I did
another pair of wide leg from Target
this time a dark wash and these are
great they're not as soft and as
comfortable as the light wash but
they're still like so stretchy so
amazing high waisted love these fit this
long-sleeved off the shoulder top from
forever 21 I tucked it in you can leave
it out or tuck it in I just think it
makes your legs look longer and slimmer
on when you have it tucked in if your
jeans are high-waisted like these are
that this was kind of a nice combination
and then I'm so mad at myself because I
forgot my purse at home we were filming
on location so I couldn't come back and
get it but I had this bag with this Navy
and black puff ball and I'm so mad
because I thought that this is like so
perfect when you're watching the video
the lookbook just pretend that this is
there but it's not like no we have to
turn around we have to go back I forgot
it Ryan was like no we're just gonna
film it's fine and I was like Harriet
need the bird for the last outfit the
wind was so insane so we were fighting
the wind all day long so just bear with
me on the last look because the wind was
out
tall
kiss me
he is sad agree
swing swing
shrink the spin and scale
the shoes and
strike
the
yes
so kiss me
day
bring
well take the tree
this man
each
so kiss me
so that is it for this how to style
video I hope you loved it and I hope you
loved the new change up of scenery you
know you guys are so used to seeing the
New York scenery um so I thought it was
nice to kind of switch it up and do
something a little different on this
video and in the next video is going to
be shot here in Texas and then we'll be
back in New York but enjoy it while you
can because you know I think it's so
cool I love seeing all of the trees and
you know all of the open spaces I think
it's so beautiful if you subscribe to my
channel then you know what I'm about to
say I'm going to talk about my life by
her lookbook because I'm so proud of it
so often what it is is a monthly whole
magazine style lookbook with inspiration
photos videos outfits styled by moi a
private Facebook group where all of us
girls get together and share inspiration
photos fitting-room photos hauls it is
like growing and growing and it is so
cool so come join us the link is right
here and get a lot of questions about
the lookbook if if you're in another
country if you can join anybody can join
even if you're on Mars
you can join Commodore Anna's and I will
see you guys in my next video byee
unexpected thing at the bottom dislike
the definition of business on the top
party on the bottom I'm obsessed with it
Ryan will like when I brought it home he
thought I was joking he was like wait
you're gonna wear that like out like
hair yeah I love it I'm obsessed with
this it's definitely not boy friendly
though boys do not like this dress who
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
