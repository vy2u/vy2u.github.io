style video in today's video we're going
to be styling hats and hats are my
all-time favorite accessory I think it
makes any outfit add something special
to it and it covers up any dirty hair
day or bad hair day which I seem to have
quite a few of every now and then I'm
going to be doing three looks for you
guys today I'm going to be styling a
baseball cap a felt hat and a summer
kind of straw like hat so I'm super
excited and let's just get into the
video for my first look I'm going to be
styling a felt hat and a lot of people
ask me when it comes to have it felt is
okay to wear during the summer and I say
absolutely I this is my hat that I wear
most of the time I wear this one
year-round and I think as long as you
dress it up with something really
summery and really airy totally fine so
this is the outfit that I sold to style
just have I pulled this cold-shoulder
top from H&amp;amp;M I also pulled these
girlfriend Schwartz from Topshop and for
a summer sandal I pulled these guys from
forever 21 now I usually wear my flat
sandals my lace-up black flat sandals
but I don't know if you guys saw my
snapchat in my blog where my luggage was
completely destroyed at the airport
somehow my favorite black sandals fell
out and I no longer have them rest in
peace these are mine until I can get a
new there so is 5 still under my skin
need you're here with me
this can't be
we get me
ooh
reach for me
why don't you meet me up in Tokyo
you
now on to the baseball hat I am obsessed
with this it's got little eyelashes on
it and it says babe and it is part of
the babe collection at Urban Outfitters
this is pretty recent so they should
still have it and it comes in denim and
another color but thumbs were a lot of
black and white obviously so this is a
good pick for me I like to style
baseball caps I will either do it super
super casual or like a little kind of
dressy sexy but maybe a sneaker to
balance out a hat so with that being
said I'm going to choose between one of
these tops this is a little bit more
casual 40 and this one's a little bit
more sexy because it's got the super low
neckline and I'm going to pair it with a
leather skirt and a sneaker like I said
earlier to balance out be super casual
nosov the camp so I chose to do this
leather skirt because I feel like I
always do shorts and I feel like this is
something a little bit more interesting
it's not just a basic pair of denim
shorts or some jeans it's got a little
bit of edginess to it which I think kind
of brings out the cool factor in the
baseball cap so with the leather skirt
Kimmo emotions got your red eye flies
ain't no it's fine just to be where you
are
oh that's a worse taking over MA
my favorite scar yeah you raise the bar
if we destroyed
see me
reach for me
why don't you meet me up in Tokyo
for my last hat I'm gonna do my favorite
straw summer fedora from Zara and this
just seems to have all the colors that I
wear during the summer it's got black
tan and white so it pretty much goes
with all of my summer wardrobes even if
I wear something colorful this seems to
balance it out because of the white on
tops so this is definitely my go-to
summer hat and it's already kind of
falling apart because like wear it all
time so for this hat option I would
either choose between this really
colorful top because it does still have
black and white in it as you can see you
know even though this doesn't have color
in it it's still balanced up really
nicely and it's not too much and my
second option is this just really super
summery girly ruffle top with a cold
shoulder and an attached please this is
one of my favorite tops right now at the
moment so I'm just going to pair this
with just a basic pair of blue denim
shorts and the Hat and these really
disgusting Steve Madden sandals that
I've had for years and years and just
can't get rid of them because I love
them still another skin
need you with me
this can't be no no we get
or did we
each other first
reach for me
with emotions catch the red-eye flies
ain't no it's fine just to be where you
are
worse taking over
my favorite scar yeahyou brings the ball
