channel dayz how to style I have
actually teamed up with the gothy to
show you guys some holiday look for New
Year's parties you have to go to I
really tried to get a wide variety of
occasion so some a little casual is some
a little bit more formal and dressy
Agassi like pretty much saved the day
here because I was not going to do a
holiday lookbook just because I didn't
have the time I didn't have outfits
because I was traveling for so long so
thank you again for coming to the rescue
and partnering up with me to make this
video happen or for look number one I
went with this black kind of sheer
floral lace party drastic thought this
is like chiffon overlaying and this
really cool lace detailing on the top
and as you can see the detail kind of go
down into the dress so my style because
I am so not a tight dress type of person
I like you know I'd like to show a
little skin and be a little bit sexy but
also feel comfortable and more of a
flowy kind of fit-and-flare style dress
for my bag I picked up this faux fur
clutch slash purse you can actually
remove the straps so you just have a
simple collect or outfit and number two
I went with my key piece which was a
metallic skirts this is perfect for a
New Year's party is so festive instead
of retiring this after the holidays you
can reuse this if you want to wear it to
work a really cool pump in a blazer I
think this skirt is so perfect for any
type of occasion so you don't
necessarily feel restricted just to wear
it on New Year's you're wearing more of
a conservative skirt on the bottom I
went with this sheer top to make it a
little sexy and a little bit more party
like and of course I added a lace bra
let underneath the back of this is
actually lace thought this was so cool
and this is so comfortable there's no
wiring minimal padding and it's super
stretchy so I will be getting a lot of
wear out of this also outside of this
lookbook my next outfit is something um
a lot more formal and I went with this
super sparkly a very very festive maxi
dress with a very very high slit
definitely meant for a special occasion
special party dress and again you know
this isn't something to be worn just on
New Year's this is definitely something
that if you have a formal event to go to
I think this dress is perfect for that
and wore booties in the video because
that's all that I had packed but I would
definitely go with a strappy open-toe
sandal I think that would really fit the
dress a little bit more than a booty but
yeah I mean the dress is such a
statement piece that I don't think
anyone's going to be paying attention to
what shoe you're wearing any way and for
my last look this is something that's a
little bit more casual a little bit more
cool but yet still looking festive at
the same time so I went with this
studded miniskirt again another piece
that you don't just have to wear during
the holiday time you know something that
you can kind of throw on a vintage band
t-shirt or just a plain black t-shirt
and some boots and it's like a cool
outfit and then I paired it with this
cutout bodysuit and the back of this is
completely sheer so again the bralette
that I showed you earlier would be
perfect because it's got that lace
detailing in the back well I thought
that this was a really great way to
actually dress up the skirt rather than
dress it down and then added booties a
cool leather jacket and then you've got
like a chill kind of low-key party
outfit for those of you guys who are
just kind of hanging out with
girlfriends but still want to look cute
and you know kind of like you're trying
to dress up a little bit alright so all
of these looks are going to be linked in
the description box below but let's go
ahead and get straight into the holiday
party lookbook
oh you baby wanna talk talk to you say
you say like if I hate you find someone
no baby but you know
so I choke you down to size
you
thank you
go get my do me in the worst way
don't let me asleep
come say sorry maybe I maybe but you
know I know I choked you down just like
alright guys that is it for this holiday
lookbook I hope you loved it and again

bit of inspiration to styling your New
