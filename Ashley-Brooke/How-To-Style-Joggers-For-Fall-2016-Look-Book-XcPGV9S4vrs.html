channel
today we are styling at joggers for fall
I know I did joggers during kind of the
end of the summer when it was still
pretty warm outside so today we are
adding some layers adding some fun fall
print some texture so it's gonna be a
lot more fun than the summer one I've
got four outfits to show you guys the
first one is going to be my working girl
outfit I know you guys were requesting
more office wear type outfits as an
outfit that not only what I wear to the
office but I would probably just wear
kind of like on a day to day basis
trying to keep it super versatile great
guys let's go ahead and get straight
into the outfit descriptions completely
just lost track of what I was saying or
my first pair of joggers I have these
faux leather ones from Nordstrom brand
is Piper Project
Piper Project these are from years ago
but I have seen so many now on ASOS and
um like revolve Nasty Gal so I'm I will
definitely try to find some for you guys
to link them below I think that they're
such a great pair for work or not just a
typical kind of material that you would
wear to work it's fun because it's faux
leather but it's still dressy at the
same time and then I just paired it with
this leopard flowy shirt from this is
from Topshop um years ago seen it and
places like Zara in urban and Topshop
it's just like a super flowy kind of
shapeless top that I actually haven't
pulled out of my closet in so long so I
was really glad that I got to pull this
out today Wow look at me and my friends
right now
this is aggressive and because I was
going for more of an office look I threw
on this oversized longline blazer from
forever 21 which I just recently
purchased it's going to be in my haul
next Friday I've been wearing this
non-stop since I bought it it is the
best thing ever kind of flowy and
oversized but it's not long so it
doesn't completely swallow you in
material kind of a briefcase looking bag
I would never carry this just like as my
purse because it clearly looks like a
work bag thank you
cool it gives you definitely more of
like a workwear office type vibe I have
it thrown in a loafer in quite a while
to my lookbook so I added this guy from
Zara I know that these are everywhere
now I will definitely link some below
for outfit number two I grabbed these
kind of trouser II lookin joggers from
Zara or definitely like a menswear vibe
with the pinstripe and kind of the
oversized nests but they have a stretchy
waistband which I love traveling with
these because they're so comfortable and
then I just paired it with like the most
basic cropped gray top from Topshop they
pretty much make these in every single
color every year they're not so thick so
it's easy to layer over and just way
thought that this blue and gray color
palette was really nice
they added my shaggy coat over it
because I love basically just a cropped
mop for your body it's pretty much what
it looks like the wind was so bad today
I have like pieces of leaves stuck in
all of my clothes so poor Ryan I'm
probably gonna make him pick out all of
these leaves later nope
yeah you're going to haha sorry and form
a shoe I just did my basic Alice and
Olivia
Cameron bootie these things are so
comfortable I wore them all day the
other day and no problems all they're
just like a low heel pointy toed soft
bootie I love the way they looked with
cropped pants so I will link these and
similar ones below or my third outfit I
grabbed my faux leather joggers again
because I kind of wanted to do more of
like a daytime dress down look with
these so I did these I just added a
basic mock neck oversized
kind of cropped ish sweatshirt and I
tucked into the front still you've got
like a fun pants so it makes the outfit
work and to add some sort of prints I
did my leopard booties because I don't
know I just thought that black/white
needed some sort of a print on the
bottom or on the bag or something a
black hat just
add something on the top then I added
just a simple black bag from forever 21
this will also be in my haul next week
I'm obsessed with it it's just like the
most perfect little plain black bag the
money in there will be seeing me carry
this quite a bit from now on or my last
outfit which is my favorite I think I
grab just like the most basic pair of
black joggers fostering cinched waist
kind of like you could pretty much wear
whatever you want with these I usually
wear these with speakers and like an
oversized sweatshirt but I've decided to
make my outfit a little bit more fun
today so I added this basic white
long-sleeve shirt yeah so fun right I
had this little faux leather bra let
over it um because I've been seeing this
trend a lot everywhere and I've been
wanting to try it I just couldn't find
the perfect bra let finally found one
added a head scarf to my head found this
vintage one at brandy Melville last week
and I've been dying to style it somehow
so finally found the perfect outfit to
style it with and yeah vintage obsessed
with it so obviously I can't link it
because it's vintage but I will try to
link some similar to this I just added
my Allyson Olivia booties because why
not a simple black super comfy
the Stars and otherwise
I just got closer going too far
Loulou
my deku
is a fetus
if I make it bad
to you
just keep running
my castle
the charisma
because it
- it stars like you set me free
Louie Wahby
come home buddy
take awhile
a few cars
knows if I make it back to you
you
the way
if I
just running
Oh shots running
that is it for this how to style I hope
you loved it you know I'm starting to
take these how to style videos that I've
already done and kind of remaking them
into a fall edition because I think
things like joggers and denim jackets
and basic white t-shirts are definitely
things that we've styled differently
through every season so let me know if
you are into that if you're into the
recycling of the how-to styles with the
season and what I'm wearing this is from
Zara it's like a super flowy dress um if
I can find it I will link it below for
you the color is um lip liner is Rimmel
London tiramisu filled in with Milan
ease matte naked I pretty much run this
combo like for a while and then I'll
switch so there you go that is it and I
know I mentioned the life by our
lookbook I'm gonna give you the spiel
once again just in case you don't know
about it the life by hair lookbook poll
months worth of outfits styled by myself
it's like a magazine style lookbook so
you can have it on your phone you can
flip through it it's got shopping links
videos inspiration photos and a super
cool private Facebook group that you
only get if you sign up for the lookbook
it's growing so big and it's like the
coolest thing ever we share fitting room
photos outfit inspirations I'm going to
parties and not knowing what gifts to
give I don't know it's just like a whole
community of girls who basically just
love fashion and we're talking to each
other all day it's so fun so come join
us I'll put the link right here I will
see you guys in the next video bye
what's up guys in today's video I am
going to show you my straight hair
routine I have been rocking the straight
hair now for about a month now and I
must say it is so easy to maintain
literally just like run this look for
about five days and I'm good to go

the end pushing it quite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
