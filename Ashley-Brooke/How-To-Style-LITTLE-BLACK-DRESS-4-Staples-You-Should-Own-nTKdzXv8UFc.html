episode of how to style this time it is
little black dress edition it is going
to be a little bit different today going
to be styling on my body two of the
pieces but this is just more of an
informative type of how to style I am
actually going to be talking about all
of the different types of little black
dresses that I own and that I always
make sure to have stocked up in my
closet for certain occasion they also
recommend you guys having you know a few
of these handy in your closet as well
just for a wardrobe staple purposes so
let me know what you think about how I'm
just kind of styling two of the dresses
on my body again I feel like I only
needed you two because it is just one
dress it's not multiple pieces layered
on so I feel like you get a good visual
when it's on the hanger and let me know
what you think you would rather have
seen all of them on me or if you think
that just - for the sake of this video
was good enough just let me know and
we'll go ahead and get started into the
actual video first type of little black
dress I wanted to show you guys was the
obviously nighttime black dress I have
two options here for you guys so the
first one is one that I got from
Nordstrom and ah this one is in my
opinion it's very false because it's
very thick the crochet the lace is very
thick also but I love how it has the
detailing it has the netting right here
and the crocheting right here and it's
very short so it's perfect to some
thigh-high boots or some kind of like
stockings or tight when going for a
night time dress like always look for
something with texture with print with
something fun on it but still keeping it
solid black a dress that I'm going to
show you guys in the video montage is
this one from Nasty Gal
and it's kind of like this kimono Kate
stylist really fun super low V dress I
was obsessed with this as soon as I saw
it it's got a slip up the front and
to me you can either dress this up with
the pair of heels or you keep and wear
sandals with it or use it as a bathing
suit cover-up
I decided to add a pop of color and do
this super bright reddish pink heel
which I think makes it very very summery
you could do ankle booties with it and
make it a little bit more fall but since
we are still in August I'm in with this
box of buns husbands can't help seem to
fall in heaven is you so need to know
majesty mayhem I can't complain maybe
I'll stay here if anything
like oh let you go I know I know
all right that's right the Sunstone all
right let's ride the seven stone nuts
style of dress is this t-shirt dress I
think everyone needs to own a t-shirt
dress you can wear it in the daytime
with sneakers or you can add heels to it
and make it something a little bit more
dressy not so dressy because it is still
cotton t-shirt material but you could
add like a block heel or something to it
and you don't make it a little bit more
nighttime the reason I didn't do a trend
with this one is because I think I put
this in at least three of my videos so
you guys know what it looks like and you
get the idea I will post the link down
below I know it's selling out quick it
got restocked and not selling out again
so hopefully by the time this video goes
live it will still be there but
definitely everyone needs some sort of
cotton t-shirt shapeless dress in their
closet this next dress is also from
Nasty Gal and it is a swing dress
something else that i think everyone
should have in their closet because it
is seasonless even though it has long
sleeves it's very very thin and it's
very short so you can wear it with eye
high boots or you can still wear it with
heels in the summer I would wear it like
in the dead of summer but you can
definitely wear it be getting an ending
of summer and then all throughout fall
with or without ties um I think it's
just so easy I'm in need of a black
dress my go-to because I know there's so
many things I can do with that so the
next type of dress I wanted to show you
guys with more of a daytime dress
I only showed you one of them because
they're they're very very similar when
is from hmm
um I loved the tassels I love the
buttons I love the little ruffle it's so
cute it's one of my go-to daytime as
black dresses and I just thought it
looked fun it's very flowy and you can
do so many different things with it even
though I mentioned that this was a
daytime dress I mean you can absolutely
carry it over into nighttime um like I
said with the dress before I would add
like a block heel you know nothing too
fancy just something a little bit more
dressy with this and maybe add a clutch
to dress it up just a little bit because
the material is a little nicer so it
will carry over into the next time my
next daytime dress is this one from
Banana Republic this is the one that I
will show you guys in the video it is
off the shoulder and it came with a belt
but I thought it was ugly so I took it
off uh-huh and I just leave it flowy
like I said with the last dress even
though this is a daytime dress the
materials nicer so you can wear it into
the nighttime it's just one of those
perfect daytime dresses where you know
it doesn't touch your body it just flows
and it's really really easy to wear
I wash lightning strike upon imagine
like me I'm sold them for the way that
you hold me lost in oh nice myst in
mayhem I can't complain maybe I'll stay
here if anything I'd rather died and let
you go let you go oh that is in four and
