episode of how to style this time we are
talking about off the children tops and
cold shoulder top
so they're everywhere and I'm obsessed
with them and I feel like they're here
to stay for a while so us no longer a
trendy item I think we can almost
classify them as a staple in came the
cold shoulder top and I was like nope
I like the all shoulder top I am not
buying into the cold shoulder tops I
fell in love with them now I'm making a
video about them they are daytime
they're nighttime they're casual though
I'm just going to show you guys three
ways to style the off the shoulder and
cold shoulder top today as I like choke
on my own fist now let's get straight
into the video with look number one I
can miss a lot we're my first top I
found this one at forever 21 I thought
it was so beautiful I am obsessed with
the color and I'm obsessed with the lace
take a look at the details on it I'm
like so in love with it it's just like a
pretty top I think this is perfect for
going into fall because the color is
like a little bit of a plum color so
it's really nice today I just styled
this with a simple pair of dark denim
shorts just to make it a little bit more
casual I tucked it in because the shorts
are high waisted I really love the
bottom it gets like a little bit more
detailed at the bottom I paired it with
this gray Steve Madden you know when I
bought these I was like I'm never gonna
wear these I don't know where I'm gonna
be wearing gray shoes but you guys have
seen throughout my videos I wear these
with almost everything we just go with
so much so really good fine I love the
bell sleeve it's not a huge bell see
this this is off the shoulder the
detailing like you can really really see
it it's so nice and it just pops I think
this looks expensive unico reminds me of
it reminds me of Zimmermann because they
always do these really romantic lace
tops and they run about 350
to find this first no no I think it was
$22 it's like I have to have it gorgeous
so my next off the shoulder top is this
black one from Zara and again same as
the one before you can do a daytime or
nighttime I did it a little bit in
between I guess I did it with a black
leather skirt because I love an
all-black look and I love the two-tone
of the different materials I love
anything that cinched at the wrist
because I can push it up and make the
speeds a little bit more billowy another
reason why I love the fur life top just
say I thought this was really nice going
into fall but also can still wear it
right now because it's so thin and you
can push the sleeves up so what this is
something that will carry me all
throughout fall and winter and I just
think it's a good length also you can
tuck it in or leave it out it's got a
very dramatic off the shoulder so it's
got a super thick band up at the top and
I tucked it into the leather skirt I'm
sure you guys are like why are you
tucking everything is because it makes
you look taller I know it sounds crazy
but it does I just feel like when I tuck
things in I always look a little bit
taller than I am
they kind of elongates you so that's why
I tuck it in I don't know I just think
it looks good too you don't have to
second it it'll look good tucked in or
out whatever so the next top I did was a
cold shoulder top I know I wore this in
I think either a vlog you know I wear
this in my favorites video but you
couldn't really see it all the way a
woman who told me that I look like a
watermelon thank you I think I don't
know literally my intention to look like
a watermelon but whatever but yeah this
is a cold shoulder so if you guys don't
know what a cold shoulder is it is where
basically you just have an open shoulder
there's a strap but it still hangs down
so just your shoulder is open it's not
fully off the shoulder but it's from
storks storks have a lot of really good
cool pieces there's like a lot of
ruffles and textures and print which I
love how to have this one and it comes
in a few different colors but
I think this one's really pretty for the
summer is again I just styled this with
a pair of light washed denim shorts
because it is so hot this was the only
thing that I could put on my body with
the pair of denim shorts is a pretty
summery top so I don't think I'll wear
this into the fall I'll probably retire
it at the end of August so I'm trying to
get a lot of wear out of it while I can
and see the detail the Scott pleating on
the sleeves and then it's got a little
bit of ruffles and then a tie on this
side a little see-through so the broad
situation is kind of tricky I would just
do a nude strapless and then be done
with it definitely can't not wear a bra
because like your nipples will be kind
of like exposed for the world unless
you're into that then just don't wear a
bra you make it look like it's magic
