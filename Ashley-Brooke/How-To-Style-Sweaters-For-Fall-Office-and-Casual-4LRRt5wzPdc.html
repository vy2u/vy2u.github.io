we've been brainstorming ideas for the
whole month we've got lots of good style
videos whether it be how to style or
just like you know outfit ideas outfit
inspiration a lot of you guys are like
where half the how to Styles been wired
human style videos anymore really we
were just traveling so much during the
summer time seeing family and if I move
Stella because she was like annoyed that
I was in her President speaking while
she was trying to take a nap but in
timestamp in the description box if you
guys just want to jump straight to the
lookbook if you don't care what I have
to say we got some really really great
outfit ideas video ideas from you guys
so thank you for your input on insta
stories but layout of how to style is
going to be the same I'm gonna do the
talk through first but I'm always gonna
put a timestamp of when the lookbook
starts because some of you are like stop
talking I don't care I just want to see
the outfit and a lot of you take a lot
away from the talk-through so I want to
please both areas if you who like the
talk throughs you know it's just kind of
me describing what the outfit is there
else I would wear it too so if you're
interested in a certain piece walk to
the talk through so you can kind of get
a feel for what it looks like up close
and all that other point that I want to
make is I am trying to incorporate
office wear ideas into every lookbook so
in this lookbook I have two office wear
ideas so with that being said I think
I'm done Jevon for now jabbing jabbering
I'll go ahead and start showing you guys
the outfit so for this outfit I started
with this camel sweater from Zara which
is really nice I bought it in
this camel color and I bought it in navy
as well really a good material it's
lightweight it's got a tiny bit of a
batwing
it's not super long it's short enough to
where you can tuck it in the front and
still have a little leftover in the back
this would be just a really great
sweater for the office if you wanted to
you can layer a white button-down
underneath and just wear it with some
trousers then enough to where you can
layer it like body's in the spring but
ended up not wearing them through summer
because they are so thick a little warm
every time I would try to put them on so
they're perfect for that fall winter
white tie was just a little too much so
I tied it and then just kind of tuck to
the excess in the back just so they
wouldn't show they're great for work
even if you want to do like a nicer
blouse with it you don't have to do a
sweater you could do a button-down
blouse I think black is nice any kind of
print is nice these are great not
see-through which is awesome panty lines
at the office or knock you is Marc
Fisher lace-up loafers from Nordstrom
Rack I love these I think they're so
nice for the office they're pointy toed
they're nice and structured through this
really nice matte finish absolutely love
these for the office and for just casual
I mean if you wanted to shorts jeans
culottes I think these are great to tie
in the shoes and the pant I did this
pearl embellished back and is this
actually from Topshop I get so many
compliments on this bag I even weren't
in Topshop and some girl who worked
there I was like oh my god I love your
bag I think it's from here she was like
what I ordered it online I don't even
know if they have it in stores but I
just thought that this was a really good
fine especially for Topshop I think this
was like fifty dollars so I've been
wearing this a lot when I want a
statement bag a little bit of textured
but still that structured look that I'm
going for here crying at the door yeah
now you want to come in so for my first
casual look I did this sweater from
Urban Outfitters it is a super cropped
in the front sweater but then is a
little bit longer in the back
it definitely has that curved him at the
top remember when I ordered this online
I got it in I looked at it and I was
like where does your boob go like what
such a small space love the overt I love
the oversized sleeve this is just like
the perfect little cropped sweater when
you are doing a cropped chunky sweater I
always recommend doing a high-waisted
paper-bag pan or a high-waisted denim
just so you're not showing so much
midriff that's your thing go ahead and
do it for me I like to cover I like to
make up for what I'm showing so if I'm
doing a crop top I'm gonna do more of a
baggy style high-waisted gene or bottom
on the bottom bottom bottom on the book
I did these from Zara it's like this
olive green obsessed with these I love
them they're so comfortable they will
not get you through winter they're
pretty thin but for fall those sunny
fall days I think these are perfect
drawn to this color I think it's great
for fall with when you're wanting to do
creams are grazed even I think this is a
great color
did my studded booties and for those of
you guys asking on is the stories these
are not the Chloe Susanna's they're
actually from Jessica Berman and those
are really good fine for me I've been
wanting the burnt the Chloe's for so
long but they're just I I don't know I
just couldn't spend $1200 on them I mean
when I have these sitting right in front
of my face I'm like uh how do I not
spend just 150 and get these especially
living in New York um my shoes get so
torn up they get so dirty I step in the
gross like this is perfect for me
in New York okay what bag I used for
that outfit um sorry make it blue oh and
I go back and watch the video so for my
next work where my office wear outfit I
did this sweater from Topshop and this
is just like the most perfect little
cropped mock neck sweater the
complaining though because I was getting
ready to film and Jenna and Ryan were
like talking about something and I was
like
I am in a January sweater right now I'm
sweating we have to go film it's very
warm it's very thick it is
it was hot yesterday it was like I think
78 like 80 degrees so I was a little
toasty in this but if you are looking
for a cold-weather crop sweater this is
your guy right here none of those
sweaters that you can wear it's bulky
but yet you're not drowning in material
it's got a good shape to it you can see
your body so and it's good to wear to
work so I love this for my bottom I did
this grey asymmetrical skirt from
Topshop and I love it because I love
anything like t-shirts what shirt
material just makes me kind of feel like
I'm wearing sweatpants but I'm not I
love the color I think this is so cute
with even just like a graphic tee and
booties when you're just wanting to
casually wear it or obviously you can
wear it to work with the black sweater I
showed you guys or even like a blouse
and a blazer and they like things like
this that you can kind of mix for
different occasions and to keep it
simple with my shoe because my sweater
was so bulky and then asymmetrical so I
just did my trusty Alice and Olivia
Cameron booties that I pretty much live
in they're so comfortable and if you're
looking for a good work bootie these are
a great investment they will take you
through the whole day without your feet
absolutely aching all day this little
bag obviously not practical for work
because you cannot fit your laptop or
any any iPods or anything and if you are
one of those people that you know all
your stuff is at the office this is a
really cute bag with it and I I love
this bag I like the different textures I
like the gunmetal Hardware this is
really great I love this I carry it a
lot my last outfit I did this is an
oldie but goodie
where is this from forever 21 I remember
finding this on the floor it's a size
medium that's a little big but I
remember I found it on the floor and I
was like oh you're coming home with me
you're so great long it's oversized I
wear
when I'm lounging around the house I
wear it when I go out to run errands so
this is a good just like throw on
sweater mock neck is just like a like in
styling like a basic black sweater I
always like to do something fun on the
bottom I'm sure you guys have noticed
that either a fun bottom or a fun shoe a
fun bag just to make your outfit a
little bit more interesting really like
step up the style the style factor
hashtag style factor of your outfit so I
did these red coated jeans from Zara
these are probably my most favorite
thing that I own right now I'm obsessed
with these they are the nice and coated
material from Zara I have to be careful
when I wash these I wash them on gentle
in a bag because I have noticed my
coated jeans from Zara in the past or
even my j brand once the coating kind of
wears off over time
but they're a little bit of a flare
which is really cool and they've got
this really nice zipper detail on the
front of the ankle I love these can you
tell superhighways did I love my jeans
high-waisted and these are really not
but that's okay because I love them that
much really like an oversized long
sweater with a flare I just think it
makes your you have like an hourglass
shape well actually not because like a
wavy shape we do a cropped flare if you
do a long flare I think that's probably
my favorite style to wear an oversized
my accessories I did my little loafers
from Zara I've had these forever just
because I wanted to just plain black
shoe no hardware because of the hardware
so close to my foot on the jeans I just
wanted to go kind of basic with my shoe
did my Baker boy hat because I felt like
in my head needed something I don't know
I feel like I needed another black thing
up here I know it just looked right when
I put it on so I kept it on for my bag
to tie in the gold hardware on the jeans
I did my little Melly yeah
Melly Bianca back from Free People cute
little guy he didn't you know very much
but he's sure is cute alright guys I
