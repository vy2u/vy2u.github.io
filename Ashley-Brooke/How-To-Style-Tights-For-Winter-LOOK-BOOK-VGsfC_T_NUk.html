guys I really hope you loved the
lookbook portion of this video this is
the first half style of 2017 right this
is going to be the new format going
forward I think it's going to be awesome
don't forget to stay until the end of
the video to see the whole format in
action I really think you guys are going
to like it I was really just kind of
getting bored honestly with the old
format so I thought why not change it up
just make it a little cooler a little
bit more interesting so that's what
we're gonna be doing from now on let's
get started I'm styling it types in this
video and I know tights are something
that my mom used to chase me around the
house when I was a little girl because I
hated wearing them and I still actually
do they're not the most comfortable
things let's get real but sometimes they
look cute and they serve its purpose
keeping your legs warm while you're
wearing a dress get two types of types
that I styled today are um they start
with these be opaque types which are the
extremely sheer tights like this and I
really really like these it will not
look so black on your legs you can still
see a little bit of skin and then we
styled a little bit more of a thicker
version to where they're not a sheer um
these are a little bit more warm but I
was actually quite surprised at how warm
the opaque ones were alright moving on
to the outfits for outfit number one I
started with this pinafore zip-up
corduroy dress love this I think it is
so easy to layer you can throw a basic
shirt under a printed shirt a sweater a
button-down I just think dresses like
these are just the easiest things to
throw whatever outfits together why does
it keep it super simple with my layering
shirt so I just did this basic cream
mock neck because I did do a little bit
more of a busy cardigan on top I did
this
is probably my most favorite item in my
wardrobe right now this teal luta knit
cardigan such a pretty color it's like
this dark teal color I think it goes
nice with like black gray any of your
cooler tones that you have for my second
outfit I kept it super casual I started
out with this faux leather skirt I
pretty much wear this year-round in the
summer and the winter fall really good
basic for whenever and then I actually
did this t-shirt that I'm wearing right
now I just recently got it and I am
loving it comfortable it's like the
softest cotton ever then I layered this
denim jacket from forever 21 know what's
that another item that I carried over
from summer I think it's totally fine to
wear denim jacket a light wash denim
jacket in the wintertime I just think
it's a good layering piece it brightens
up your outfit and adds a little bit of
color to it the year-round piece added
this faux fur coat because why not I was
breathing and again another piece to
kind of brighten up your outfit if
you're feeling like you've got a little
bit too much black or gray on I think
these two outerwear pieces really
brighten anything up for my third outfit
I did this is another one of my favorite
items just this plain black oversized
sweatshirt I got this I think in the
men's section I wear it as a tunic a
dress day I styled this as a dress these
over the knee boots from Zara that I
just recently got on their sale it
seemed to stay up all day they don't
slouch so I was really really happy with
these I did the more sheer types so you
could get a little peak and it kind of
breaks up the boot and the sweater dress
as well and I added the leopard coat
because I wanted some sort of prints no
hardware it's just kind of a good basic
printed throw over jacket for when you
need a print and you need to brighten
things up a little bit my next outfit is
more of a work appropriate outfit I
started with the basic frame mock neck
top just to keep it basic because I am
doing a printed coat so I wanted
something that was good for layering
over I did and this
my favorite cook that I own I love it so
much I think the colors are so great and
they really tie into almost every outfit
is this burgundy
a faux leather skirt and again I did my
sheer tights with this skirt the skirt
is so dark that I wanted to not have my
leg super dark if that makes sense like
it breaks it up a little bit you know if
you're wearing a super dark bottom you
want to wear more of a sheer tight on
your legs that way you're not so dark on
the bottom and so light on top and the
first outfit if you are signed up for my
life by her lookbook you probably
recognize the first outfit because I
pulled it from December's lookbook I
