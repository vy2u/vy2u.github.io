what's up guys welcome back to another
episode of a town style I've gotten a
lot of requests lately for work attire
for trousers specifically so that is why
I threw together course it was pouring
rain almost every day that I was
shooting so well but yeah hopefully this
video gives you a little bit of
inspiration on how to wear your trousers
for work but still kind of be in the
spring spring zone I know a lot of
places right now it's like the struggle
of being cold in the morning and then
you know up to 90 degrees by afternoon
so it's like I wear it cause do I wear
long sleeves what do I do
just want to kind of go through my
outfits and let you guys know why I
chose what I chose some alternative what
I would do differently so yeah go ahead
and get started or my first outfit I did
these trousers from Topshop I love them
because they're high-waisted and they
are thin but they're not thin enough to
where you can see when you tuck in your
blouse that it kind of bunches up in the
back that's not a good look I hate it
when that happens
so I like them because they're a really
good texture they're a really good
material big thickness but yet not too
hot they're still breathable they are
kind of a crop crop shower with a cuff
at the bottom high-waisted base it me
really nice and snug around the waist
which I like you it's tile them I did
this white button-down from Zara I own
so many white button downs I think I
have one just basic white button-down
but I like button downs that have a kind
of a cool flare to them so for example I
love the sleeve on this one you know I
think it's taking a classic piece and
adding kind of a trendy fun twist to it
that's a really good way to spice up
your office where is to take a classic
and turn it into more of a fun kind of
trendy thing then to a little color a
little metallic something I did this
shoe from Zara I got this last year so I
don't believe that this is on line
anymore but I
they find a pair on cross mark I should
searched bronze metallic Zara heel and
quite a few abuse came up open I really
just wanted to accomplish kind of a fun
twist on a classic look you know white
blouse black trouser heel but yet you've
got like a button we even a fun shoe so
there is a way to make a twist to a very
classic outfit my next look I did these
floral cool now I know that some of you
guys might not be able to wear these to
work I think most dress codes so would
allow something like this but I know
some people are strictly like a trouser
type of dress code I wear them when I go
to meetings when I did you know work in
the corporate world I did wear these
with a actually a worth it pull outfit
and that's where I got it from I also
wear these with like a tank top when I
just want to you know go to brunch or go
to dinner go walking around the sea so I
think investing in a really fun pair of
trousers is a good idea especially when
there is versatile as these guys I did
this top from Alice and Olivia basically
just kind of a classic black button-down
I love this because I don't have to tie
it myself it's already tied and it just
kind of wraps around and then it snaps
in the back so kind of already pretty
tight for you a struggle of time these
bows like sometimes I end up with just
like a giant knot I'm like wow like what
happened what went wrong this is that
outfit was so dark because it was so
dark and raining and I always dress
depending on the weather outside like if
it's dark and cloudy I always go for
darker pieces I was feel so
uncomfortable when it's so dark and
cloudy and I'm wearing like a bright
yellow sweater I just don't feel right
so that is why it's such a dark outfit
but to make it a little bit more
spring-like I did this this is one of my
new little bags from forever 21 and it's
so soft so nice I absolutely love it see
at the bottom this I was really excited
when this came in the mail I was really
impressed and I thought that it kind of
you know gave it a pop of color and did
make it a little bit more spring-like
what am i enough outfit
I did these white trousers from Zara and
they are just some high-waisted paper
bags pants that are a little bit more
tailored at the ankle so they're not a
full cool lot they are they do give you
that that tailored trouser look these
are so comfortable they are stretchy
waistband I'm telling you anything with
a stretchy waistband all about it cuz
I'm you can kind of tailor it to like
how you are feeling that day you're
feeling a little bloated untie a little
bit whereas the black pants before
you're kind of just stuck it all for my
stop I did and this button-down from
Zara so I did a black cami underneath it
just because I kind of wanted to make
the black pop in the flowers and since I
was wearing black shoes I thought that
tied in really nicely but you could do a
white or a new cami this was definitely
a more of a spring sunny fun outfit and
again this top is so versatile I love
grabbing tops like these because they
will get me through you know important
meetings like for a professional look or
I think throw them on with denim shorts
and some sandals and it still looks
really nice so versatile top always ago
always a good thing you know if you need
to look a little bit more professional
if you need that third piece this looks
really nice with a blazer and I did just
these shoes I think I did I did these
shoes twice in this lookbook because a
lot of my shoes are in storage right now
because I haven't gotten all of my
spring flows out yet because it's still
kind of cold here so I'm kind of like
been wearing these over and over because
I don't have another choice so to play
them seeing me so much I love them
though and they're really comfortable
for my next outfit I did the same black
trouser from Topshop I just wanted to
style it in a different way so I did and
this is my classic white button-down
from Target that I've had for years that
just never failed me I love it it's a
little long it's a little oversized but
in a good way
do tuck this in because I wanted to
create a layered effect with the see
both ways are the best so I did this and
then I did this about
then this is a this is a pretty fall
winter best because it is so heavy again
because all of my spring clothes are in
storage and my spring vests are in
storage so definitely swap this out with
something a little bit lighter maybe a
color if you want to I just did this
because it was all I had available to me
but I think it's good when you want to
create that layered look for the office
but it's kind of hot outside do a bet
because then you're still getting the
layered look but yet your your arms are
being able to breathe especially with a
lighter material it's going to be like
you're wearing nothing but you still get
the effect of what you're going for
and since I did have such a black and
white outfit I decided to do some fun
accessories so I did my little leopard
lace-ups by June London and then I did
my red bag because I love leopard in red
I think it's such a classic combination
and it just really kind of transforms
your whole outfit when you add to
accessories that just make your outfit
pop alright so and that is it for this
how to style
