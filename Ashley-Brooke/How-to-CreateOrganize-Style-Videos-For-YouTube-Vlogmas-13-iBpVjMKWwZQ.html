have a mullet Merry Christmas you filthy
animal hi guys
so we are about to go shoot the sweater
yesterday we just couldn't because the
weather it started just raining and it
was disgusting since it is so cold today
I think it's like in the single digits
we are gonna go to this really cute
place called tree house and we're gonna
shoot the sweater as kind of like an
indoor grabbing coffee story so I think
it'll be good but I'm wearing this
sweater some light wash jeans and then
my leopard boots jeans are urban
sweaters rubber island shoes are Kenneth
Cole and I'm probably just gonna put my
big puppy coat on to go down there
hopefully they let us shoot in there I
don't know we've shot in there before
but you just never know it is what time
is it it's already two o'clock I just
got blogging this out this vlog missed
the vlog messes that have the question
and answers at the end take so long to
edit so I don't know if I'm gonna be
doing them every single vlogmas I might
skip a vlogmas like every other one
because there really does take a long
time to edit those suckers I have to
show you what I got at Walmart when I
was in Texas it's a brush little travel
brush so cute though cuz I always need a
brush I mean a lot look at my hair so
and during the especially windy days
it's always good to have a brush it's
ashbrook creepiness knows no bounds you
just want to creep on other people's
spaces I know you're gonna go in whether
I say yes or no
I heard someone did you get scared
psyched me out got in your head
breathing the coals oh hey you know we
haven't seen in a while
you know what's hilarious is you and
your sim walk exactly alike you didn't
pick that war it's so windy okay
no if that guy's hat just hit me in the
back of the head so hard okay I've never
been one to dress my dog include but
Stella definitely needs a sweater of
some sort Stella needs the thickest
warmest type of material
her little buddy wind show right now is
20 degrees Fahrenheit
I don't know what that is it sounds it's
your mouth can't remember what you don't
know the thing well hey I didn't know it
though guy using chemistry 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
college school brain was very smart fun
fact about Ryan Ryan almost went to
medical school
randomly found these this is what I
ordered to test the other day and it is
friggin delicious so Pam
go Claremore
do you concur literally tastes like raw
food you know he's the best okay
this is the same brand as your wet bars
alright this is gonna be our little
setup here at this little table the
Lighting's not great from Rhyno figure
it out it's practically a professional
photographer at this point
sometimes location isn't always what it
seems I'm sitting here surrounded by
dirty food trays from leftover breakfast
all these tables are dirty futures and
there's the biggest dirty food tray of
them all
thank you I don't know that we're gonna
take Stella for a walk tonight
mountain-like that's not the cold it's
the wind
is insane I was vlogging outside I don't
know if you guys heard any of it
tomorrow I'm shooting a gift guide for
the holidays a gift guide for her and
it's gonna go live on looking at my
calendar I can't see we go live on
Friday so I'm gonna pull I have a long
list of things that I want to add so I'm
about to pull all of that and then I
have to prep for the next week's video
on Sunday which is going to be kind of a
guide to shopping for the perfect
holiday outfit so I'm just gonna do some
indoor work today and I'm gonna prep for
those two videos can you say hi hi thank
you
oh you're so sweet oh thank you very
much mr. bone
lay it down to y'all
I need those
got a package from Trachtenberg thank
you guys let's see what was in here we
have got Frizz Ease secret weapon
touch-up cream his ease daily
nourishment this might have been sent
over because I told Dara that I broke my
straightener and that my hair was really
frizzy right now dude donuts and coffee
I'm gonna like whatever's in here oh my
gosh oh my gosh they smell amazing I
don't know when or if there's dairy in
these probably Google they smell I'm
gonna google it right now donuts and
coffee if they're not if they do have
dairy in them I'm just gonna take a
really big whiff and go let Daniel eat
that thank you guys for sending this
stuff over that was so nice and Daniel's
gonna be so happy that he gets a
doughnut and I just looked up this place
I'm looking at their flavors right now
brown butter Key Lime I mean caramel
apple cherry pie espresso cardamom
pumpkin spice latte banana malt you know
what though I love like good
old-fashioned strawberry I love
strawberry flavored anything catering
next life by her Meetup there might be
some dues donuts and coffee Tona
alright back to planning my video for
good tomorrow my shoot day
there's no doughnuts over here stalls
this this is going to be a sit-down talk
through style video the holiday look the
holiday like how to shop for holiday
looks those are almost a little bit
harder to film than the actual lookbook
because with the lookbooks I just put on
the outfit and I show you guys I'm going
to talk about them but with these
sit-down videos you want to make sure
and write out not a script but kind of
like a a plan a video plan for yourself
kind of talking points that you want to
stay on because if you don't write out
talking points it's so easy to get
off-topic and scattered before I started
doing this and I would film I sit down
talk throughs I would be editing the
video and like I was like okay this is
all over the place I have no idea what
I'm saying and I would have to actually
reshoot the video because it just didn't
make sense
obviously when I'm sitting down shooting
it it makes total sense but when I go in
and edit it I'm like no pays gonna
understand this so every sit down talk
through video I always make talking
points and just like a really detailed
document for myself to follow it's kind
of like storyboarding so before every
out what are you showing up yeah it's
like question of the day always but it's
all about inner mouth for my how to
style videos or my outfit videos every
time I create one of those I have a mood
board on Pinterest of items that I want
to put in items that I'm kind of
thinking about outfits that I want to
recreate for less expensive for
affordable prices so this is kind of the
same this is like a storyboard talking
points for a sit-down talk through look
just in case you guys are do have a
YouTube channel and you feel a little
all over the place and this is kind of
it's so simple and it's such an easy way
to stay organized and it really helps
your viewers stay with you and stay on
topic and then tomorrow if I have time
after I film and when I'm editing this
kind of show you my editing process and
how you guys want to see that let me
know if that completely bores you then
just tell me but I can show you the
editing process that I go through to
create a stood up talk through video
because those are the videos that you
want to keep your viewers interested in
because I've seen the sit-down talk
through videos where I'm like a bored to
tears and I don't even know what's going
on and then I've seen some that I'm so
engaged and so intrigued because there's
things happening
there's cutaways there's interesting
points interesting topics so what's for
dinner in dark pretty quickly so I just
finished writing my outline for the
video I just edited a quick clip to send
to my manager to get approved for a
brand and now I am editing the photos
that we took today so I can get the blog
post written and for it takes me it
takes me about I don't know like an hour
to edit photos and to write a blog post
not that not that bad so I'm gonna do
that now and get it so I get it approved
no it's dark I'm sorry I'm about to get
up and turn the light out turn the light
on my speaking English today what's
wrong with me so how I edit photos for a
blog post is I turn on the Wi-Fi on my
camera and then I transfer them all to
my phone through the app and I just edit
my blog my blog post photos on my phone
I have Lightroom and Photoshop on my
computer but if I'm needing just like
small touch-ups like small lighting
changes and stuff like that and it's
just so much easier to do it on my phone
so that is what I'm
I am gonna turn the light on that's what
happens when you shoot in high wind
situations you get a lot of these a lot
of these
first of all I look like I'm a boy and I
have a mullet
sup bro bullet boy slash bullet bullet
alright so I totally messed up
someone in the comments just pointed out
something observant the go veggie cheese
said I tried and loved is not dairy-free
contains milk
it's just lactose free very confused by
that actually I'm not it's just me being
stupid and not reading the whole label
can't use that no mo it's right next to
the follow your heart in h-e-b in Whole
Foods in every grocery store so damn it
you live and you learn and you buy the
wrong cheese okay I am putting work up
for a moment to start making dinner I
just realized the time it was okay so
for dinner we are doing lots of veggies
here got lots of veggies going on and
then we're gonna do a side of the beats
burger just because this is gonna be our
protein 23 grams of protein per serving
do some veggies and then that on the
side call it a day here is dinner
you got cauliflower rice Karen what is
this again carrot brussel sprouts and I
did all of that on this pan and then
maybe on meat burger and I only did half
do Tufts
I've got side of ketchup for the other
half of it and did full cheese to
carrots salt a decision right
