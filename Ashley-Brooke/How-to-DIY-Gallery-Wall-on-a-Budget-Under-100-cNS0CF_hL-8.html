video we are doing a budget-friendly
gallery wall and I have some of the
materials not all of them so what we are
gonna do first is we're gonna go out
into the city to some of my favorite
budget-friendly places and we're gonna
gather some supplies so you what the
before looks like so we can get an idea
of what we're working with here is the
wall that we're working with we've
basically got a shelf a bunch of really
bad wires a plant and a lamp that's
probably not gonna be here for very much
longer I'm gonna do some sort of collage
here and then I want to do some
bookshelves a lot a book situation right
here you're gonna start with this side
with the gallery wall side if you think
about it a gallery wall seems super easy
right like you just need frames and
photos but it's so hard finding the
right photos for you and for your living
room and you might see stuff that you
like online but then when you get it in
the mail it like doesn't look the same I
don't know so I really like sourcing my
things here so I can physically see them
in person
Kristoff is going to be home good it's a
good place to start and I'm also going
to look for some other little things
because home goods has the best little
hidden gems that's where we're gonna go
first and unfortunately it's all the way
uptown for me so we're gonna hop on the
subway and head there alright this is
the home goods and I go to it's in a
really quiet neighborhood so it's not
ever like super crowded
I found a chair that I like it doesn't
have anything to do with anything but or
is this a chair like a stool what is it
just like a decoration like the cute
guys and then it comes in this champagne
color my favorite book a magazine store
get some prints
okay so no I'm done there the magazines
are in the trunk but I'll show you when
I get home
we're heading to target right now
because they have really good gold
frames and I'm also looking for
something to put on the shelf under the
gallery wall all right so what target
they have these gold frames which I love
they sell these at Westown for like
triple the price so I'm probably gonna
grab a couple of these and they're buy
one get one 25 we're so low so I'll
probably get 2
so it is the next day this is kind of a
two day project because especially if
I'm doing it during the work week I
can't really spend all day on but this
is a great weekend project so I have all
of my frames here with me I'll show you
guys those some prints already in here
to show you so I have just like a basic
black one a gold one from Target I got
this huge one back here from Ikea this
is great if you need like a centerpiece
are like really something cool like
above your bathtub but it's a really
good piece for a gallery wall to kind of
have your smaller photos spread out
around it and then this is also the
smaller one that I got from home good
for the prints instead of purchasing
just single prints I like to get as you
saw we were at the magazine bookstore in
Soho or that not everybody can just pop
in there and look but any a magazine
store will work you can get like Vogue
or L they have great editorial print
example
here are two that I got and they are
just filled with a really really cool
print do you like to buy are these
bigger ones they have the biggest prints
for things like this and then they also
have magazines like this cover and then
you can unfold these they are huge
supplies that I used for the gallery
wall and I went ahead and put some
prints in here I don't know if they'll
stay I just kind of put them in to show
you to kind of give you an example it's
the big one
I took one big spread from one page and
then another spread from the other page
so I have like you know one big print
some small text and then a small press
basically it very crooked I just threw
these in here so I can show you I'm
gonna fix them later
go ahead and straighten them out get
everything done and then hang them on
the wall quick something else I like to
do is I like to go through and get all
of the prints I like tear them out
get a paper slicer to straighten off the
edge that way I can change them whenever
want to so say I get like a new like red
pillow I have a print ready to go that
will really bring out the red and the
pillow keep a folder of prints that I
love so I can be ready to change them
whenever I get tired and bored of my
current breath
we are still time in the process of
moving and we can't find our hammer
anywhere so we're using the end of a
screwdriver to hammer everything in now
just a quick little tip yes this is a
quick tip I am really just kind of
guesstimating where I want these
pictures to go what I do know is that I
have some main colors like I have some
camel and I have some red and so I am
trying to spread those two colors out so
I don't have like my camel in one
cluster and my red in one cluster so you
want to make sure your color stories are
spread all the way up
that's what spread out means the
universal sign
gallery wall we've got our frame color
spread out I've got two gold here two
block here the whites are spread out but
the good news about a gallery wall is
that there is no right or wrong like way
to do it if you know what I mean like
the pieces that you choose represent who
you are what your home what you want
your home to be like so don't think that
like oh this print is not cute if you
like it this is your gallery wall it
should represent you so you go for it
I'm just kind of giving you some of my
tips and tricks on spacing and hanging
you guys love this video and I hope you
have some good ideas for your gallery
wall I'd love to see if you guys could
tag me in your gallery wall photos so I
can check them out but yeah I'm gonna go
finish up here I just got some boxes so
stay tuned in the blog so you know what
that is but I'll see you guys next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
