channel um first of all I apologize for
the construction going on I don't know
where it's coming from but it's very
loud in here so I hope you can't hear it
um if you can I'm sorry so today I'm
doing an updated beach wave routine oh
god it was my first video that I ever
did please don't go watch it now I know
you're gonna go watch it
please don't so embarrassing um so yeah
I get asked a lot of my videos how do
you pull your hair how do you use your
wand
you know just show us your routine so
that's what I'm doing today I'm just
going to show you my updated beach waves
routine in this routine I'm going to be
using my just basic cheat iron and my
con air wand that is a hundred years old
seriously it is so old I need to get a
new one because I feel like any moment
it's going to go out probably at the
most inconvenient time isn't that how
that always works and I'm not using many
products today just because I feel like
with the beach wave you want it to be as
natural looking as possible so at least
for my texture of hair I don't need a
whole lot of product I really just need
like an anti frizz product as you'll be
able to tell in a second so let's just
go ahead and get straight into the video
okay so to start off we are going to
step into a judgment-free zone while I
take my hair down because I was super
lazy last night and I kind of halfway
blow-dried my hair because I am trying
to grow my hair out and I'm trying to
put as little heat on it as possible so
I'm just kind of like barely going with
the cool setting to blow-dry my hair so
it's really frizzy and it's kind of I
don't know there's not much we can do
about it so
hello this is happening okay I don't
even know what this is gonna look like
in HD up close yep okay so I'm just
going to start with the bangs because I
feel like that's going to be just an
easier demonstration rather than trying
to reach around and show you what I'm
doing in the back so what I'm going to
do is basically take a chunk of hair and
I'm going to take my straightener and
barely go over the ends like just to
where they're a little bit straight and
all the frizzies are taken out because
lord knows I have some four really then
you're going to grab a piece I would say
maybe like an inch and you're just going
sit down in my chair and you're just
going to wrap it around the top of the
wand and you're not going to go all the
way down you're not going to wrap the
whole piece of hair around the barrel
and you're just going to slide up and
down make sure to not get the end of the
hair around the barrel you want that to
stay straight and then boom wave and
repeat
the key really is to making sure that
the end stays straight and not curled
because then that defeats the whole
purpose of an actual wave versus a curl
now that that is cool you're just gonna
run your fingers through we're going to
move over to this side I don't really
know what this fully looks like because
I'm using my camera as a mirror so not
sure what's going on up close when it
went down it was like was escaping
and now we can run our hands through so
now that that's done I'm going to go in
with my one and only products that I'm
using which is the Chi silk infusion
this I got I don't even know I think I
maybe got this in my Birchbox but it's a
tiny little sample and I'm almost out so
I'm gonna have to get more but it's
actually for your hair and your skin
which I will not be using it on my skin
because I think it just screams break
out for me so I'm just going to use it
on my hair this basically just like
makes your hair chill out and not be
super frizzy and crazy like mine can get
sometimes I'm just gonna pour about like
a penny size on my hand and I'm just
gonna go over my ends
that smells delicious now if you already
have really fine silky hair then you
might just want to skip this process
because then I'm afraid it might make
your hair look a little bit greasy um
but for those of us was super dry hair
that you know our ends can get a little
out of control this is like the perfect
product to use so now that I'm done with
that I'm actually going to go back in
with my curling iron and grab just kind
of small pieces around my head to recur
l-- and this time i'm going to do a
tighter curl rather than a wave i feel
like that makes it look a little bit
more natural because all of my waves are
the same size right now so i want to add
a few curls in the middle to make it a
little bit Messier so i'm just going to
kind of flip my hair over and do some
underneath to start so you're going to
do the same process you're just gonna
wrap it a little bit tighter around to
make a little more of a tighter curl
No
kids good
keeping it good all right guys that is
it for my messy beats wavy tutorial I
hope you enjoyed it and just a quick tip
you know this you do not learn how to
use in one day so for those of you who
are switching from a curling iron to
this is still hot I should not be doing
this so for those of you who are
switching from a curling iron to a wand
be patient
it is not a one-step learning process it
definitely takes practice I remember my
switch
I had blisters and burns all over my
hands for the first week that I had my
wand but once you get the hang of it I
promise I promise promise you're gonna
love it so much so stick with it and you
will get it I promise and I will put a
list of products that I used all three
of them in the description box below so

forget to sign up for updates for her
