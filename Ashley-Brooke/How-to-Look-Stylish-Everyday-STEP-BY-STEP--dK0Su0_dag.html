I am Ashley Brooke for those of you who
don't know me and for those of you
returning welcome back in today's video
I am showing you guys my routine to how
I put a full outfit from head to toe
perfume included together in the morning
now you're probably thinking why would
somebody need to know that it really
helps me just stay organized it helps me
get ready faster not only am I going to
share with you my steps to putting a
whole outfit together in the morning I'm
going to show you two different examples
one of them starting with a basic one of
them starting with a trendy piece so
however you are getting dressed in the
morning this will help everyone because
I know everyone is either wearing a
basic piece or a trendy piece every
single day go ahead and get started with
outfit number one first we have a basic
black mock neck for my bottoms I'm just
doing a basic pair of high-waisted dark
wash blue denim now that we have our
outfit of just basics on it's pretty
boring first thing I'm going to do is
tuck in this shirt to accentuate the
waist when you wearing high-waisted
jeans you always want to try to
incorporate an outfit to where you can
do at least like a front tuck or an
all-over top you are piling on the
layers you want to make sure that your
bottom layer is your tightest layer
because you don't want your bottom layer
to be showing and crinkling and
scrunching up through your other layers
the first layer I'm going to add is this
white button-down top I'm gonna tuck it
in and then I'm going to leave a little
bit of my color sticking out that way
you can see the bottom layer and we want
to incorporate black into this outfit so
we want to make sure to have a little
bit keeping out
now that I have my button-down shirt
layered over my mouth neck I want to add
some sort of lighter jacket because I do
plan on wearing a coat over this because
it is done in winter so I'm going to add
this jacket and I really wanted to do
something printed because my outfit is
so black white and denim so you want to
add something printed or something
embellished this is me picking out my
trendier item which is a camo button-up
jacket
for me Shu I do in a tie in a little bit
more black because I only have this
little piece of black sticking out so
you want to make sure you're balancing
your blocks in your colors so I'm going
to do this booty from Zara and it's
black patent with these really cool star
details on it I didn't want to do
anything too crazy with my shoe because
I am wearing two shirts and a camo print
jacket so you want to keep your shoes a
little bit more chill just because
you've got so much going on up here
toward the bag I was thinking of doing
something a little bit more textured but
still black that way you've got your
black balanced out black top black bag
black shoe so I did this black bag from
Topshop it's got the black the leather
and then I've got my texture right here
with the faux shearling
I always get fully dressed and then do a
squirt of perfume just so you avoid
squirting any jewelry that you have I
know a lot of my jewelry is costume
jewelry so I really don't want to get
the oil from the perfume on the Dory
because it will tarnish it so I do my
square root of perfume before my jewelry
I'm not gonna go too crazy just because
I've got a lot going on I don't want a
big earring because I've got a mock neck
and I've got a button-down and then I've
got another color so I'm gonna keep my
just my earrings on the minimal side so
I'm just doing these black little moon
shaped ones I think these will go really
nice with what I'm wearing and it'll add
a pop of black up here and I'm just
gonna do my ring I'm gonna do my black
ring so that way it kind of sticks out
you know up against all of these lighter
colors so the second to last thing I'm
gonna do is my lipstick so if I'm in the
mood for a red lipstick but my outfit is
like an orange sweater then I'm like
okay I've take my red lipstick off and
put more of a nude on so I always try to
do my lipstick at the end just to make
sure it kind of color stories with my
outfit
so that we have started an outfit with
basics and made it a complete outfit
you're gonna reverse and we're gonna
start with a trendy item and build an
outfit on top of that and when I say
trendy item I'm more so mean like this
statement piece it doesn't have to be
trendy um yeah I almost just fell over
be like a statement blazer even a cool
pair of pants a really funky shoe so
it's really just anything that's a
statement piece that's out there that's
gonna be like the key focus of your
outfit this outfit I am starting out
with this pair of pants high-waisted
super low crotch baggy kind of tapered
at the ankle with giant button pants you
got that and did you write that down
there our statement piece you know I
wouldn't do something like super crazy
on top I just want to start with in this
pair of pants and just add my basics to
it accessorize it make it cool let's go
well I didn't really think this one
through so I'm seeing here on YouTube in
my grandma bra
all right I've got my robe on on my
phone for um this outfit I'm gonna just
add a basic on top of it obviously you
want to start with your top necks before
my top I chose this camel sweater from
Zara I'm gonna pair this with my pants
so same idea as the pre on my pants
frickin hello when I do your shoe next
because that is the third most important
piece you just want to make sure to
complete the outfit with the shoe I am
going to add this one from Alice and
Olivia it is just my basic super skinny
ankle sock movie these pants are wider
at the bottom they're not as skinny so
you don't want to do a wide shaft boot
with a wide leg pant you want to stick
to something super skin tight to show
that your leg has an ending called your
ankle and of course we want to spritz
our perfume before we put any jewelry on
and bottoms are really funky and cool
and trendy but my top is still very
basic definitely can feel free to add a
little bit more jewelry and go a little
bit crazier with my jewelry but my ring
I'm going to do just this basic simple
gold one for my earrings I'm gonna do
these hoops from Urban Outfitters and
since I am wearing my sleeves a little
bit pushed back I added this watch from
clues I wear this watch almost every
day I think it's just like the perfect
little accessory to any outfit and you
can't forget the necklaces I'm adding
this long one from Urban Outfitters I'm
also adding this bar necklace with my
initial on it my sisters and I all have
one we call it our sister necklace so I
do wear this all the time as well just
like we talked about in the previous
outfit you want to make sure that you're
balancing out so I've got black on
bottom camel and I wanna something black
on the top of my head so I think this is
like the perfect combination right here
just kind of balance it out for boy hot
or any sort of hat automatically adds
some sort of trendy kind of InStyle
piece to your outfit so for my bag I am
doing this one from Anthropologie and I
love wearing this bag with my camel
especially just like we talked about
balancing out when you're putting your
accessories on we've got black camel
black camel black at the bottom then as
I'm heading out the door I would
probably put some sort of jacket over my
shoulders so I think this is perfect
it's just a little cropped full leather
jacket from Zara and obviously ideally
you want to put it put your arms in the
jacket but for the purpose of this video
and this outfit I am doing the drape
lastly you don't want to forget to add
your lipstick I don't know where I think
I'm going I'm not going
all right that is the order and which I
like to get ready every day I pretty
much follow those steps every time I'm
putting on an outfits you found this
video helpful definitely like it and
share with your friends you know if you
noticed somebody who has trouble getting
ready in the morning or who is always
late because they couldn't figure out
