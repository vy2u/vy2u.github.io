you guys know Ryan and I have been doing
a lot of traveling and I have been
getting so many messages on how I tape
it how I stay healthy
while traveling so much and so I really
have just like a super long list of tips
that I want to share with you so I
thought well why not make a video about
it so it's hips number one and this is
probably my favorite tip is to always
keep a workout routine I know a lot of
us kind of go on vacation and go
traveling and our workout routines just
kind of go out the door so I always like
to bring my workout with me and I like
to use daily burn while I'm traveling
it's really really excited to partner
with over this video because it's
something that I've wanted to try for so
long and actually while we were in Texas
on last week for the past three weeks I
use daily burn and I shared it with my
mom and she was like Ashley I used that
I love it and I was like oh that's so
cool so we actually did it together
daily burn is actually a fitness app
with over 800 workouts that you can do
easily from your phone from your TV at
home outside it's so convenient you can
take it with you wherever you go and the
reason I like doing it when I travel is
not only as convenience but that I can
choose workouts where I don't need any
equipment so say I have only a chair or
only a yoga mat or nothing at all it's
really easy to find a workout that's
convenient for my needs at the moment
you can also customize it to fit your
schedule your goals what you want to
work on their favorite parts about it is
that it has an online community so for
those of you guys who need an extra push
or a little bit of motivation there's a
really really great online community for
you to join it's like a social media
platform there's live chats there's
forums so it's really great I feel like
it is the future of fitness because so
many people are always on the go and
traveling and it's just you know 10
years ago you would have never heard of
something like this so I think it's
really cool how far Fitness has come
it's just making it a little bit more
accessible for everyone you know even if
you're not crazy about going to the gym
because trust me sometimes I wake up my
gyms in my bill
but I'm like um in such a rush I woke up
late I don't have time to even just walk
down to the gym so it's super easy can
we just throw an workout clothes turn on
my TV and get it done not my table right
here when workout that I have been
loving lately is the bikini but or gal
and so on that I have been doing
constantly and it tells you who your
trainer is how many minutes it is
there's like a difficulty section so you
know if you just want medium so
so I'll put in the description box below
but you can just visit daily burn comm
slash Ashley to start your 60 day free
trial alright moving on with the tips
also can my pants be pulled up any
higher right now I tell things that I am
these are just personal tips and just
kind of rule that I live by when I'm
traveling um number two drink lots of
water and I know it is such a pain in
the butt when you're traveling and
you're drinking so much water and you
constantly actually go to the bathroom
that is like sometimes the main reason
that I'm like no I'm not drinking water
because this flight I'm going to have to
go to the bathroom a hundred times I
can't always just feel it in my skin and
just like when I'm not drinking water so
I like to travel with this guy and just
when I got from a Nordstrom Rack last
year but I mean obviously they sell them
everywhere I just refilled this
constantly it's huge it's a pain to
carry around but you have to drink lots
of water when you're traveling my next
tip / rule is right and I always travel
with healthy snacks otherwise I will be
in the hotel shop buying Oreos if I'm
craving something sweet and we either
hit up like a Whole Foods or like a GNC
some sort of health food store either
before we travel or when we get to our
destination it's just so much easier to
carry protein bars and stuff rather than
you know being tempted to have like a
really unhealthy super sugary snack I'm
going to show you our neck Bowl
oh we go so this is our Bowl and we've
got all of the snacks that we travel
with these noodle bars are really great
these are awesome
here's the peanut butter can you go bar
awesome
these help wear your bars are really
good as well and all the ones I'm
showing you are vegan always wear bars I
love these I always keep this in my
purse anyway and a new favorite we have
are these 22 days bars and I think we
got needs at Target but you can probably
find them online the peanut butter is
good the chocolate is good salted
caramel okay it's not my favorite then
on dates and I'm going to be flying for
a long time and I need more so like a
meal type thing rather than a snack
these Libyan Larry cookies are really
great they're filling love it's 350
calories with a whole cookie 16 grams of
protein per cookie so if you're in need
of like more of a meal those are great
option too so yeah my next thing is kind
of planning out my meals beforehand so I
always try to know the area I'm going to
be in do a little research on the
restaurant of course if you're with a
big group of people it's really hard to
be like no I want to go here you know
you don't wanna sound like a brat so
it's definitely good too and most most
restaurants have health-conscious
options so just kind of be aware we are
going out to eat not to just completely
like pig out every single time and I
also try not to eat too late - because
restaurant food is a lot heavier than if
you were just cooking at home so I
really try to not eat it like 10 o'clock
at night and if you're super annoying
like Ryan and I we always ask for the
nutrition and so because we do use our
lifes I map so it's nice to kind of know
what what's in your food especially when
you are at restaurants try to substitute
your fries for a sign of steamed
vegetables I know it looks special e in
Texas they pile on the brunch fries New
York not so much like if you order an
entree you usually don't get an option
of like french fries or chips you have
to pay extra so when I'm in Texas I
always have to remember to like swap out
all the bride's for the veggies and I'm
saying this because I will eat every
single French right on the plate until I
have to be rolled out of the restaurant
trust me like it is not because I don't
like them it's because I'll hurt myself
if you're going on vacation I know a lot
of you guys go for work trips and stuff
so it's kind of hard to do this but if
you're going on a vacation maybe try to
plan some active activities you know
like
writing and hiking rollerblading and
another tip I have I like to work out in
the morning and if I don't have my
workout clothes on as soon as I wake up
it's like chances are very slim I'm
going to do a quick workout so I always
like to as soon as I wake up throughout
my workout clothes on that way I'm
almost just forced to go to the gym or
do my daily burn workout in the hotel
room except if it I absolutely do not
even have like 20 minutes to workout I
will do a quick stretch and I know one
can be burned there is actually a
stretching video I have it saved in my
favorite and it's really good I always
like to stretch every morning regardless
even if I'm doing yoga
I'll always stretch because I know it
just makes my day you a little bit
better I just feel more relaxed more
clear mind all that good stuff always
get enough sleep I know it's really hard
on vacation even trying to take power
naps during the day and I just knowing
this from being home in Texas my mom and
I like to stay up till like 1:00 in the
morning just watching movies
my sisters and I play board games but it
is important to get plenty of rest while
you're on vacation you're packing don't
forget to pack your vitamins and
supplements that you usually pack and
used to always pack my vitamins and they
would just sit in my suitcase until it
was time to go home and I'm like oh yeah
pack my vitamin so the first thing I do
was like unpack my bias vitamins my
bones put them on my nightstand next to
my water that way I will never forget to
take them or buy one of those like
little days of the week to hold your
vitamins in there so another thing Ron
and I always like to do is whenever we
travel we stay in Airbnb is we rarely
stay in a hotel and we always try to
cook at home if we can just again I
don't know we're not like big restaurant
people so we will try to cook at home at
least two to three nights a week while
we're on vacation
so another thing that I like to do is
take advantage of fruits and veggies
when I'm at the airport I know the chips
are tempting and all that good stuff but
if I
can get my hands on like one of those
little veggie packs with the hummus I'll
do that or like a fruit something on the
plane
