I'm talking about one of our favorite
topics shopping and most importantly
shopping on line I do probably about 85%
can't forget that 5% of my shopping
online just because living in New York
City all of the major shopping areas are
so heavily tourist areas so you know
unless you're getting there early or
unless it's a weekday you are fighting
the crowd waiting in the longest line
ever for the fitting room the online
shopper I always have been so I kind of
you know gathered up my top 15 tips for
shopping smart online first of all I
hate paying full price for anything I
know that's such a brat thing to say but
really when it comes down to it I would
rather be you know investing my money
into my savings or you know something
that has to do with my future so if I
can save money you know with coupons or
with um just tips that I've learned over
the years then it's it's totally worth
it
so we've partnered up with one of my
favorite online money-saving site called
shop tagger and I know a lot of you guys
have heard of it because I see shell
tagger a lot in my comments section of
you guys talking about it so that's
great that you already know what it is
but for those of you who don't this is
my tip number one can save items while
you're shopping online to shop tagger
and it will notify you when your item
goes on sale goes low in stock and comes
back in stock which is awesome during
Memorial Day is when they have a lot of
Memorial Day sales and stuff and I
completely missed this one jacket from
ASOS like a huge 25% off I come the
jackets sold out and I was like oh tip
number one is to use shell Tiger um you
know if you want to save money and you
don't absolutely just need that item
right now just wait first you go on sale
wait for a promotion and shop tiger will
let you know and I'll actually show you
a quick demonstration of how easy it is
and what it looks like on Free People
quite a bit so one of my favs si will go
to new and let's find something we love
this is beautiful
so and it's $350 so I would never pay
350 for this because it's so specific
and I don't know I just don't know that
I would get so much wear out of it so
you click the shot tiger tag we want to
do the Navy select your size notify me
when any price change add to list
dresses we're gonna save it and that is
all you need to do and this is what my
shot tiger site actually looks like or
all of the items that I have saved you
can also sort it by categories all of my
shoes it's really really easy to kind of
sort through everything is what the app
looks like for easy to go through it's
exactly like the desktop version tip
number two I've got it pulled up right
here at play looking over here
search for coupons when you're shopping
on high street styles like H&amp;amp;M forever
21 and other stories or at SIA always do
a Google search for a coupon I bought my
de'longhi coffee maker I Brian was about
to buy it I was like no no Google Google
coupons and we actually found a 20% off
your one-time purchase so we got the 20%
off and you know it doesn't hurt to just
take five minutes the Google if there's
a coupon code out there and use it
number three is to narrow your search if
you have extreme one extreme to the
other sizing so if you have a size 5
foot or if you have a size 12 foot you
know
retailers aren't gonna carry a ton of
those sizes because they are going to be
limited way you can weed out everything
in between and not be tempted to buy
something because I know I've bought
shoes one to two sizes too big or too
small that I'm just so tempted at and I
buy it it doesn't work I never wear them
and then it's just a waste of money I'm
gonna be joining all the newsletters
person off of your first purchase
they'll send you all the sales anything
that's going on they will send it to you
also brings me to tip number five is to
keep a separate email for newsletters so
I have one email that I use only for
online shopping that way it's not
flooding my work inbox I'm not tempted
to shop during the day
I only open it whenever I'm needing
something or I'm in the mood to shop and
also that way when you order online all
of your confirmation all of your
tracking everything is in one inbox
seeing of coupons this leads me to tip
number six is to follow all of your
favorite brands on the social media
because sometimes they will run special
deals for their followers or you know
random flash sales for people that are
following them you definitely don't want
to miss that 7 it's to check flash sales
sites so these are sites like the out
net Rula log gilt.com
they sell items but it's like a 48-hour
flash sale or a week-long flash sale and
then you never see it again and these
are heavily marked items look calm I
bought a lot of my home decor on
HauteLook my order from gilt so many
times and they always have it kind of
specified so it'll be like summer dining
or all white bedding so it's kind of
narrowed down so you don't have to just
go through every category it's kind of
categorized for you so you know you're
looking for a certain thing and it's
right there definitely go through it tip
number eight is my cart abandonment role
so when I'm shopping I like to get all
of my items in my cart and then I will
abandon my cart I will close out of the
window and usually within the first like
24 to 48 hours I'll get a follow-up
email saying like hey you let these
items in your cart you know if you're on
the fence about it here's 10% off it's
usually something very small but it
might be free shipping it might be ten
five percent off number nine I am not
recommending that you get a credit card
or any of that but I do have a credit
card for just building my credit and
keeping good credit and earning points
and as soon as I use it I pay it off so
if you're if you're like that if you use
it responsibly if you pay it off
definitely shop online with a credit
card because you know if something were
to happen it didn't get your item or you
were charged twice the clear credit card
will usually side with you and they will
fix the problem on their end and you'll
end up getting
your money back also if you do a return
on a credit card its way quicker than if
you were to return on a debit card and
also like I said before points you know
I love earning points for airline miles
and stuff like that so just any time I
can get points from shopping I'll do
that as well number 10 is to always look
at the stats of the model that's wearing
the item I was looking for this for a
crop top not that long ago and it
actually was like oh my god it looks so
good on the girl I ordered it it was
like past my waist it was like wow so I
go back to the website the girl was 6 1
so I was like okay if I would have known
math and I obviously would have put two
and two together and not ordered it so
always look at the stats of the model if
you think it looks great on her make
sure you're not 5 foot and she's 6 1
because it's gonna look like a
completely different item on you end up
wasting money wasting time you might
have to pay for the shipping for it to
go back so number 11 is to use sites
like eBay and Swagbucks you basically
get money back from shopping it's
usually not a whole lot like I think and
I had Ebates I don't use swag bucks but
my Ebates
account has like 14 dollars in it but
that's awesome and it's 14 dollars I
didn't have before so it's super easy
it's self-explanatory when you go sign
up and use it so definitely do that for
12 is to ask for discounts directly who
bought my entry table from West Elm I
had just missed the 20% off and so I
just emailed the pop-up chat and I said
hey I'm so sorry I completely missed the
20% off that'd be so great if you could
honor that for me I'm ordering this
table and blah blah blah and just like
that he was like sure here's your coat
and then I got 20% off at the table so
you know don't be afraid to ask
customer support or the customer chat if
there's a coupon floating around out
there that you need to know about number
13 is to always shop in incognito
windows so you always want to clear your
cookies and then shop in an incognito
window because retailers will get your
shopping habits and target you with
certain coupons so you might not be
getting the best coupon out there so
always want to look like a new customer
to them and that's basically what
clearing your cookies and shopping
incognito will do number 14 it's
online consignment stores when you're
looking for designer items or vintage
items so there is stores like the real
real big in tux you know those are two
really great ones pretty much guaranteed
that you're gonna get an authentic item
you know but you moving into tip number
15 is eBay and Poshmark now you can
usually find the item way cheaper but
you really need to do your research on
the seller and make sure that the seller
is legit I don't buy from anyone on eBay
who has under 96 sometimes like 98%
rating what in check make sure they're
legit and you can usually find the item
cheaper than the real real but it's kind
of like it's not worth a couple hundred
dollars if you're you know buying a
Chanel that you know is really this
Chanel that is maybe like on the fence
so definitely just use your own
judgement when it comes to shopping use
designer items who are using ebay
definitely use snipes white for bidding
this is um they do the bidding for you
you know so you're not sitting at your
office shopping at your boss walks by it
you're like hold on there is a
Balenciaga situation happening a finale
youth snipes life when you are bidding
on eBay don't forget to sign up for my
