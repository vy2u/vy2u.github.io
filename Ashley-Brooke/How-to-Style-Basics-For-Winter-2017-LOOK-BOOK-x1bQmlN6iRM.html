Oh

please

Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
I really hope you enjoyed that lookbook
this was probably one of my favorite
shots because I was really able to get
layers up and just really enjoy the cold
weather and the snow without freezing my
butt off during the shoot so I had a
really good time of shooting this one I
feel like a lot of us can actually shop
in our closet and make so many cool
outfit just by using our basics but we
kind of have blinders on for our basics
like I have a section in my closet about
this big that's sectioned off our basics
only and I pretty much ignore that
section because my eye isn't completely
drawn to it because it's so basic it
really layout what you have you'd be so
surprised what you can layer on to
create really cool outfit so let's go
ahead and get started keeping my styling
and kind of explain to you why I chose
why I chose for outfit number one I went
with this really pretty blush colored
sweater and I just think this is such a
great color it's great for winter and
fall but it also carries you into the
spring because it is such a light color
and I layered over this blue faux suede
jacket and you know I'm usually the type
of person that goes for black jackets
maybe gray jackets I never really do a
color so I thought it was really nice to
have this blue color in my closet
because I thought it was really really
nicely and really brought out the kind
of look I was going for with these
lighter colors also really lightweight
not one of those heavy jacket who it is
good for building on top and layering on
top there's a layer on top of that I
went with my good Old Faithful trusty
cream coat faux fur cream coat i layer
this thing over everything when I want
to try to brighten up my outfit add some
color this is always my go-to it just
added my basic high-waisted black skinny
jeans because I did do a little bit of a
front tuck with the sweater so I wanted
something high-waisted to make my
look longer add some color some print I
went with this stripes kind of Sikh
turban style headbands who love wearing
these they just don't stay on my head so
I can't rhythm all day or else I'll have
like this poof in the back but I thought
this one's paid on really nicely LT it
was actually surprised but yeah I always
try to add some sort of print or color
or something on top of an outfit whether
it be you know a layering piece or even
a simple headband and the basic in this
outfit to either be my black skinny
jeans or the basic sweater but again you
see how I layered a couple of jackets on
top of it a little texture a little
color a little print in the headband
that is outfit number one for outfit
number two I went with this basic
turtleneck long tunic style dress love
this thing it's super warm it's super
thick
I love the turtleneck it's one of those
like punchy comfy turtlenecks without
being so thick and I added some very
sheer tights to go with it not okay you
guys told me this in my last video okay
means not sheer and these are not okay
right there's way my mind is blown by
that thank you for letting me know in
correcting me these underneath it
because I still wanted you to see a
little bit of my leg so I picked the
ultra sheer type since you layer over it
I did this faux leather minimal hardware
it's really thick so it's very warm and
the leather is kind of that like crap
crap kind of faux leather I really
really love this always love layering
things with a leather jacket and layered
over my leather jacket I did this faux
fur vest and you guys who have been
following my style videos for a while
now know that I love doing a vest over a
leather jacket I just think it gives you
a really doesn't mention cool texture
it's a really cool way of layering
things and if you liven up my outfit a
little bit because it was just a lot of
black I did this high ankle studded
bootie I have other pairs of studded
duties but this one is high enough to
where my ankle doesn't show so on really
cold days and I want to get cool studded
boot I go over
when so my little ankle doesn't freeze
so again for outfit number two I started
with the long black dress and that was
my basic piece and I just layered on top
of it added some studs
good to go so for outfit number three at
the basic piece I started with was just
a plain super long tunic II and denim
top and it's just that good kind of
denim soft the kind that you can wear
either buttons as a top or open as a
jacket so I went with the second route
and word as a jacket and I layered
underneath it this mock neck super short
must look stripes black and white top I
see I this is one of my go-to layering
tops because I think it's always good to
add a little bit of stripe every now and
then you notice if you want to mix
prints I think the best way to mix
prints is starting with the strike then
I added my camel coat over it because I
just thought that this color combination
and like print combination was really
nice brighten things up but it's still
very winter because it's very layered
and then I did my leopard booties and I
was obsessed with this whole outfit
because my two favorite prints to mix
are stripes and leopard because I think
there's completely on the opposite ends
of the spectrum so you know you don't
get any clapping or any weird things
going on I think this is a great
combination along with the camel in the
jacket henna ties on the shoe so again
the big stick I started out with was the
center button down but again also the
basic could be these stripes just plain
layering top so either one of those
build your way up on those and for
outfit number four I started with the
basic of a sweatshirt and I chose this
one with the adidas print because I
still think it's basic just because it
is like a basic sweatshirt but again you
could do something without a print or
with a print I just think a sweatshirt
itself is a very basic piece so I
actually layered underneath it this
shredded white t-shirts and I thought
that it was really cool kind of sticking
out of the bottom of the sweatshirt it
kind of gives your eyes something to
look at you can also see it on the
collar and you can see where the t-shirt
sticks out so
it was a really nice way to balance out
the gray in the black and to kind of
break it up a little bit
the bottoms I did these faux leather
leggings I just thought it was kind of a
cool way to dress it up and kind of add
something interesting it cool you know
cool way to dress things down then of
course I threw on my super puffy coat
because it was cold today and I just
think that this jacket goes with so much
till it's relaxed sometimes legs don't
really care how I look as long as I'm
warm happy and then for my two
accessories well accessories and two for
weights - I did in my snow boots I'm
obsessed with these they are so
comfortable and they keep my feet so so
so warm there was still a little slushy
slippery spots today so I wore these
just a few things I didn't want to be so
completely wiping out while we were
filming it did this both Wade and
baseball cap and I just thought it just
really tied in the whole like chill
relaxed look dress down kind of cool
casual and I thought that the Hat and
the shoes tied in together really nicely
that is outfit number four the basic
super relaxed casual sweatshirt kind of
dressed up with faux leather leggings
and cool Brown accessories yeah that is
it for this whole entire video I hope
you loved it and I still hope you're
loving the new format it's growing on me

loved it before but I'm starting to
