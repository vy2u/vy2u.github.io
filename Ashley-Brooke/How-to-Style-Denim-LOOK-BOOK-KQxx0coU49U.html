Hey
Thanks
Oh
thank Baxter
welcome back to my channel I love this
little book let me just say how much I
love this we actually drove over to
Dumbo in Brooklyn and shot this so we
got some really great shots of the
Manhattan skyline in the background
definitely want to go over there and
make more videos because it was just so
cool not to mention there were no taxis
going crazy horns honking people
everywhere my hair it's doing something
because it's dirty so rockin the
ponytail today y'all a rough we are
probably going to go over there more
often and do some videos for you guys
because it was so cool I hope you guys
loved it too let me know in the comes in
this video I just styled some of my
favorite denim pieces you know I'm
trying not to be so specific to one
topic because the season change kind of
is varying in throughout different
countries and cities so I'm trying to
keep them a little bit more general and
not so specific so today I styled some
of my favorite denim pieces and we'll go
ahead and into the styling that part and
I'll kind of explain to you what I did
so for outfit number one I started out
with my project social tea from Urban
Outfitters and I love this because it's
a really deep v you can wear like a
cheap bralette it's good for layering
your necklaces so I love a good deep D
and I don't really like this is the only
thing in my closet that I have like this
so I actually really love this I styled
this really really cute neck scarf it's
to me like the perfect neck scarf the
perfect material the perfect length the
perfect colors than I did my newer denim
jacket that I believe I already showed
you guys in a haul I love this I love
all the cool details on it I just think
it's such a good throw over denim
statement piece
so this is actually my denim piece that
I started the outfit with and just for
size reference this is a small I think
it's the smallest it comes in so it's
just kind of meant to be
little oversized and then because it was
a little cold outside
I threw over this jacket that I got in
my Zara sale haul so this was really
warm kept me cozy and I don't think they
have to some line anymore but I will try
to find something similar to you can
kind of play with it so in my next
outfit I did these denim like wide leg
crop pants from Zara
they were my all-time favorites last
year and now that it's getting a little
warm enough to bring them back out I was
like I have to put them in the video for
a chance I guess so I started with these
then I did this white top from Zara that
I'm sure you guys recognize from my
latest haul it's the one that has the
detachable leather vest over it and
that's makeup mm-hmm the long cuffs I
think it's perfect for the look I was
going for with the cuff sticking out of
the sleeve so this is like my go-to top
lately and I love the detail of the
sleeves in the back as well then I added
my maybe a poncho cardigan with my faux
leather I mean the look OH
leopard collar I just think this so cool
and this was my first time wearing this
actually so I was really happy with the
outfit that I put together I thought it
just kind of looked like casual but also
still like a little bit elevated I don't
know I just thought it was a good meet
in the middle type of outfit then I did
my brown boots from free people to kind
of tie in the brown the leopard we had a
car we like we had a car that we were
driving around and so I was changing in
the car just why I'm carrying the same
bag and every outfit my hair and makeup
was the same because we were changing in
the car I didn't have a mirror I didn't
have makeup or anything my next pair of
denim is this pair from Target my who
what where I'm even him whooping him
afraid denim I absolutely love these I
think they're perfect transition from
winter into spring and I just think that
they're so cool and they look great with
ankle boots I did my same white cotton
Zara and then I threw this green bomber
on from Zara and you guys when I bought
this I bought it put it in a video and
then I was like I'm never going to wear
this again
we'll return it returned it got halfway
down the block ran back and was like I
need it back I'm having major regrets I
need it and I'm so glad that I rebut it
because I wear it all the time
my little mermaid jacket so just meant
to be
I made a pretend it's grabbing me my
shield okay now I'll sit to the west
give yourself it's not everyone hi now
that you're creeping on it love you with
my assistants in my star boots and I
absolutely love these I just think that
they're great with anything because the
star detail is so small that I just kind
of you know gives you a little bit of
detail not too much more my last outfit
the denim piece and I chose where it's
um overall where some overalls and I
love these sure 60% of you I hate these
the rest of the 40% of you love them I
love these I think they're oversized
casual till I don't know you either love
them or hate them I did before I love to
have to cut like this much off of them
because they were like under my feet and
onto the floor they were so long so I
just got the scissors and cut them yeah
I love a good pair of overalls you know
I have tight overalls loose overalls
I just love overalls I think they're so
easy and so cool so I did it be my
grandpa's letter from Urban Outfitters
my Urban Renewal sweatshirt sweater
mushrooms letter and I am linked below
they still have these online they don't
have this color but they have this exact
sweater in different print so you guys
can go check that out I think it's a
really good thick kind of billowy but
it's still cropped at the same time so I
love this and my hat because I just
thought it kind of completed the look
there's something about it I put the hat
on and I was like yes that's good
and I did my studded boots that I need
to get a new pair look at this ahh I've
had these for about five years now and
they are done I stepped in a giant snow
puddle when we were filming and the
whole inside of mine
shoes so that is it for this looks book
I hope you loved it this was probably I
know I think I say this every time but
I'm pretty sure this is one of my like
top three favorites
seeing my favorite outfit was the green
bomber and black jeans that was like I
love that one probably be seeing that in
my life by her look cooked of all of my
life by her girls let's get ready for a
lot of the trends with the bomber and
then the cuff sticking out even in the
summer you can do that with shorts but
I'm rambling now so went by heard get
ready for that in the marked lookbook
it's a monthly lookbook put together by
myself for my life by our group we have
a Facebook community if the maximum
style book book would gets in us
beginning of every month and it's really
cool shopping links inspiration photos
click you're your monthly fashion bible
your go-to inspiration fashion bible so
come check us out I'll put the link here
but actually just type it in I've had
some problems with people going to sign
up from YouTube to the browser so just
type type this link into your browser
end you should be good you sign up now
you will get February's and then you'll
get March on March 1st but then if you
sign up at the beginning of March you
won't get February so be sure to sign up
now in February that way you get both
and I just wanted to share something
that is so cool about our communities
though in the Facebook group
you know I post these how-to styles and
stuff and we obviously all fall in love
with the pieces because we see them
styles and you know how cool they look
on and I've noticed that people are
actually like buying things for other
people and then shipping it to them like
hey if anyone goes to Zara and sees you
know the black frames someone pick me up
a size 24 so someone will do it ship it
to them and then they pay it's just like
the coolest thing that we're all here to
support each other like the leopard coat
for example that I always wear I saw one
weapons are and I was like all right
extra small who wants it and then Laura
was like come on and I want it so you
know she paid me I sent it to her it's
just like the coolest community I feel
like we all have each other's backs and
you know I get I get I get negative
comments on me now and then obviously
not for my
scribers because you guys are awesome
but from just a random you know YouTube
trolls and I feel like the life of your
community is such a safe place for
positivity and encouragement and it
really is just such a powerful community
so and another thing that I like about
the Facebook community last point and
then I'll stop talking is so many girls
are starting their own blogs and
promoting it through the life layer
community and asking for advice what
should I name my blog what should I talk
about what do you guys think of this so
you know I'm seeing all of these likes
many businesses and many blogs form and
blossom and it is like the coolest thing
ever so if you are considering starting
a blog a fashion blog of cooking blog a
mommy blog
if you are looking for something like
that and just need that in your life I
totally recommend checking it out at
least so links appear type it in will
see that so yeah I will see you guys in
