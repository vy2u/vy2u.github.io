channel and welcome back to the new and
improved how to style yes the series is
back I got so many requests to bring the
series back there was almost like a
boycott against all of my other videos
because how the style is gone so how to
style is back and it is coming back with
the vengeance and I'm really excited so
with that being said I will go ahead and
get started showing you guys what I
styled how I style it and hopefully you
get some tips from that today I styled
denims miniskirts and I only cloud too
because I feel like there are two of the
main ones that are kind of floating
around out there I did it
blue dye nominated a black denim
introduce you to the skirts that I filed
before we actually get started so I did
this blue denim one from River Island
high-waisted great two slits front and
the back not too many risks or you know
anything crazy going on just like a
really good basic I did this black one
also from River Island this is the kind
of denim that is stretchy and nice but
then it doesn't just stay stretched out
it like sucks back in which is my
favorite kind of denim so I was actually
really excited to find this office where
if you're dealing with a denim miniskirt
it's already pretty casual even though
it is a miniskirt
it is still denim and this is a really
touchy Junction everyone's dress codes
are so different so take this outfit
with a grain of salt and you know if
this doesn't apply to your dress code
then bare with me and you know make it
apply to your dress code flops and
things out you know work with things in
your own wardrobe and you definitely
want to start out with your denim MIDI
and then you want to add a button-down
top of some sort or something that's a
little bit more dressy because the skirt
is pretty casual so you want to make
sure that you're all business up so I
did this button-down because this is
something that I would wear to my
my last job that I had this is something
that I would wear I worked in a really
casual environment so this is something
that I could get away with want to make
sure that you're able to tuck it in to
the skirt because the skirt is so long
that you don't want a long top cutting
you off you want to make sure that your
links are proportional to each other
when you do wear such a casual outfit
into the office even if it's casual
Friday you want to make sure that you're
still at your bag is still professional
you know that way you're kind of tying
all of your accessories together to the
office appropriate so what I did was
this structured ring handle bag from
rubber 21 structured it looks nice it's
still trendy with the ring handle so
it's very small you can't fit like your
laptop and stuff in here but and then
you shouldn't go crazy with your heel I
would try to do something pretty pretty
basic you know like I said the skirt is
such a outfit I catcher that you know
you don't want to try to overwhelm your
outfit with crazy heels or anything like
that definitely stick to what you would
normally wear it to the office it's a
second outfit I styled it with the blue
denim skirt and I personally love blue
top on glued on this top which is also
what I call a hospital gown chic because
that is what everyone you know is a
hospital gown
if this outfit could be for a baby
shower brunch lunch like a family outing
you know if you want to be comfortable
daytime appropriate but still over this
type of occasion try doing a top that
has some sort of special something to it
whether it be a sleeve like this or
maybe a bold print or maybe in a cold
shoulder something that has some sort of
really fun specialness to it I just did
this shoe with it because I thought that
the black and blue was really nice all
of my life I hear girls know that black
and blue is one of my favorite color
combinations so this is no surprise
unless you need to carry a big tote for
work or you know whatever it may be
I think smaller bags definitely are the
way to go because the skirt is so much
material and it's
such a huge part of your midsection but
I would try to stay a little low-key
with your bag you decide to do an
off-the-shoulder top or something where
your neck is bare definitely do a
statement necklace of some sort towards
you statement earrings so since I was
wearing my hair in a half top knot I did
these gold hoops from River Island and
to me these are like the most perfect
don't look at my nails on my gosh the
smell embarrassing if you are wanting to
do more of an edgy look I don't
recommend doing this blue one really
hard to make this one edgy I mean you
really have to like dig deep down there
and like be creative so why not go with
a black one this already has edgy
written all over it because it is black
and it's not as girly as the other one
this one is a little tighter a little
shorter has a little bit more spunkiness
to it we're going for an edgy look don't
make things hard on yourself
grab an edgy accessory whether it be a
studded bag studded like splat or shoe
or in my case a stencil I grabbed this
one is from Topshop and I just think it
makes the most perfect edgy accessory I
love to chain on it very cool if you do
opt for a super setted belt or accessory
in your waist try doing something a
little bit more basic on the top is my
white tank top from forever 21 I just
think things can get a little crazy when
you try to pair a printed top with such
a disease felt if you are going for more
of a casual look with a skirt like this
definitely recommend doing a sneaker
with it because the skirt is so easy to
dress up because it is a long miniskirt
so throw a sneaker on or even like a
flat or something would be appropriate
for my left look I wanted to do
something how I would style it so this
isn't really for any occasion this is
just me having the skirt on my body and
grabbing what's in my closet to kind of
accommodate my style and how I wanted to
style it so did this kimono because I
was looking for a print so I always grab
this kimono when I'm looking for that
because it's really lightweight it's a
good third piece for summer because it
is so lightweight I did my workout shot
from forever 21 and if you are wearing a
longer piece
with one of these longer skirts either
needs to cover the skirt completely like
it either needs to go longer than the
skirt or as like short as the waist
nothing in between because then it's
just going to look like you're wearing
too long things and it is not
proportionally right so definitely try
to do something longer or something
shorter in case I went longer because
you guys know my style I love oversized
long things so this is probably no
surprise to you perhaps my go-to summer
bag which is this one right here I have
just been wearing this non-stop because
it goes with everything it was my summer
theme I did these shoes and they are Sam
and Libya and got these at Target but
they're really comfortable and it's
really hard to wear flat sandals with
the skirt like this because it can
shorten you I am five five so you know
anyone who's tall doesn't have that
problem but I feel like my height and
lower really need some sort of height
otherwise you look like you're drowning
in it
it's specially this skirt I think if it
were a little shorter you maybe wouldn't
have an issue but I definitely try to
add a little height
whenever you're higher focus don't ever
forget your gold I will
thank you
