hi guys welcome back to my channel it's
a small hiatus from how to style only
because you know the weather was so cold
and it was basically like puppy coat
after puppy coat after sweater so it was
just not as exciting as when the weather
is nicer and a little bit more versatile
so now that we have nicer weather I will
start bringing back the have style a
little bit more frequently um some sure
you guys will be happy to hear that it's
good to know that it was very well
missed so you guys really expressed your
feelings about how you wanted the series
to come back soon so thank you for
letting me know that so here it is so
today I decided to style a head pieces
and I really love head pieces I just
think that it makes a fun outfit even
more fun and it makes a basic outfit
dressed up and a little bit more
interesting kind of mix it up a bit you
know if you're not an urban person or a
headband person definitely try out a hat
or vice versa head pieces can be a
little bit intimidating but you honestly
don't know until you try I know for the
longest time I thought those turbans
just kind of made me look like a boy I
was like I look like my brother as soon
as I put this on it doesn't put this
shape of my head I went out of my
comfort zone I wore it I got so many
compliments I just love the way my
outfit looks I love the way I felt in it
so I've been wearing them non-stop since
and I probably still do look like a
little boy but I want to continue to
wear it for my first outfit I started
out with this black jersey material
turban from
a so excited when I found this because I
was like okay I want to start out with
just basic black one so I can kind of
you know work my way up to colorful ones
and I just wanted something basic so
this was a really good place for me to
start and I loved the outfit that I wore
it with I thought it was just girly and
fun and stylish and there were a lot of
prints going on but it wasn't too crazy
i pair it with this chokers DB from Zara
and I love this I think the sleeves are
really fun I love the fit of it very
flowy and girly and I styled it with a
skirt but you can obviously do it edgier
with some booties and some black skinny
jeans so I think this is a good printed
top you know I have so many striped tops
but when I saw this pulpit not one I was
like Oh probably knew that just to
alternate my prints out a little bit and
this is the skirt that I styled it with
when it's from forever 21 a couple of
years ago but I know that they carry it
just kind of these flouncy skirts pretty
much year round so I tried to link as
best I could below but yeah it's just a
basic elastic waistband and I believe
it's lined yeah its line so it's not
see-through
then I wanted to add some color because
I was so black and white so obviously I
opted for my patent leather bootie from
I actually got these I can't remember if
I got these on even a Poshmark
cut I did find some I found one listed
on Poshmark so hopefully it's your
science go get it while you can but I've
seen these everywhere on eBay and
Poshmark so I'm sure if you search for
them you can find them but they are just
red patent with a really fun silver
detail zipper in the back and I paired
it with a striped bag which is I think
in the other room but I just thought the
pulpit outs and stripes would really
nicely together polka dots and stripes
is one of my favorite ways to mix prints
I had to be sure to keep my purse kind
of down by my skirt that way I didn't
have two stripes and the pull that's too
close together because then it looked a
little crazy skip to keep them kind of
apart from each other second outfit I
just went with a basic black hat I've
had this one from forever 21 for years
it's my go-to I need a new
and because it's kind of getting it's
kind of getting droopy and sad in some
areas but this one's held up for a few
years so way to go you feel like a black
hat you can throw on was kind of
anything and it just goes to show that
you can do wool hats in the spring
obviously in the dead of summer I want
to wear this because I would be pouring
sweat but right now I think you can
still get away with it did this cord set
from larva
this is just a stripe top with a
matching pants and I put this in my home
not that long ago these are so
comfortable I've gotten so much use out
of these pants even just throwing you
know a white t-shirt over it or like a
little crop top if you're just going to
run errands I love this set so easy I
just think torrid sets are are so easy
it's almost like throwing on a rock or
you know you don't really put much
thought into it because the outfits kind
of already planned out for you and
obviously you can throw on any shoe with
it you can do a sneaker you could do a
flat I decided to dress it up just a
little bit so I did this little block
heel sandal from Zara next head
accessory or hair accessory not an
amount you know what I mean my next hair
accessory is the striped headband from
Zara and I've got this I can't find it
online I think I got it last year I know
that they continue to make these and
they fit really well and they make the
best colors already had kind of a fun
outfit on so I didn't really need the
headband I just wanted to make it a
little bit more fun I don't know I was
out vintage shopping so I just kind of
wanted to put a fun accessory in my hair
I don't know if I make sense but I wore
and this red I know it looks Orange on
camera but it is definitely red head
sweater top
sweater top it's really heavy so I'm
going to call it a sweater top from Zara
I love this color I love the sleeves I
love the cut I think it's so fun it's a
really beautiful bright sunny day so I
definitely wanted to wear something
bright and in the jeans that I wore I
don't have with me I grabbed the wrong
pair but they are just my straight leg
light wash jeans from H&amp;amp;M that I cut see
I did like a DIY uneven hem denim on the
bottom because they were so long they
went like down past my heels my foot so
I did this like DIY and even hem
and that is what I got I know they carry
them it's just our regular basic
high-waisted straight like Jean is what
it is so see if I can find them online
my shoe I did and this one from DSW I
can't tell you how comfortable these
shoes are they're just a flat form with
a really pretty tobacco a color weight
on them but yeah they're so comfortable
and I thought they weren't really nice
with the outfit they would well with my
who what where bag and I think that the
color of the shoe in the bag was kind of
tied and really nicely the headbands at
the top so I just thought everything
balanced out really nice for my last
outfit I did this metallic turban from
ASOS I thought this was so fun and I
loved it so much you know it's not a
crazy print or anything but it's
definitely a really fun metallic
textured it's kind of weird material
like it's kind of I don't know it's it's
fun when it's on your head but when you
first feel it you're like laughs if I
wanted to wear it pretty casual so I
just did this corrupt button-down from
Urban Outfitters that I got a few years
ago by BBG and it's just cropped white
kind of flowy very circular cut town
then I did my who what where cropped
flare denim that I got from Target then
I did a nice black and white flat
slingback sandal from Zara I just kind
of wanted something casual I was kind of
just running errands so I just wanted to
be comfortable open I love that they're
black and white you know they're very
simple not a lot to them but they still
give you a really nice color-block
effect so that is all I have for you
