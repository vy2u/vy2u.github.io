you didn't come for you man when you are
picking tomatoes
Oh
Oh
yes
please
ah
what the sighs welcome back to my
channel today I styled leather jacket
really quick if you hear loud banging in
the middle of a small blizzard right now
and I jumps are falling and hitting the
window really hard so if I like jump the
sliminess thought what a perfect time of
year for leather jackets because a lot
of us are going through the warmer
weather transition phase and I think a
leather jacket is a good single layer
outerwear if that makes sense like you
know you're comfortable to grab your
leather jacket and go it's too on it's
cute off so I thought why not do a how
to style leather jacket and you guys
have been requesting it so that is what
it is today
so yeah let's go ahead and get into the
styling for my first leather jacket i
styled this one from Zara and I've had
I've had this thing for like six years
I'm pretty sure it has been through how
much I hate the cheetah print inside
unfortunately um but yeah I'm stuck I
love it I like this leather jacket
because it's fitted and it moves with me
really well it feels really nice and it
just moves with me and I can scrunch the
sleeves up and it's still tight it
doesn't stretch so I love this when I
want a lighter outerwear without being
too bulky and heavy and with it I did
these really I love these pants I did
these are like they remind me of
baseball player pants so I called in my
baseball player pants they're just a
Navy pinstripe denim with a really
comfortable waist high-waisted they're
like a little cropped actually they're
pretty cropped but they're kind of baggy
and I think they're cool I dress them up
or down with sneakers so I kind of dress
this outfit up because I did just kind
of like nicer mas neck turtleneck you
might know me I already put this in the
washing machine because I got make a
hologram and to make it a little bit
more dressy I did do my Allison
Swayne soft booty obviously you could
take this outfit and out of speaker to
it and make it a completely different
look but all my other outfits are pretty
casual so I wanted to dress this one up
a little bit with a nice issue for my
next outfit I started with my faux
leather bomber and I have no idea who
makes us because I got this at a vintage
store in LA it could be Walmart it could
be a seller on I have no plan it's not
real leather though it is so so it's
probably not too expensive but I got it
for like 20 bucks so I started with this
because I thought it was cute and kind
of sporty kind of different you know
when you think leather jacket you don't
really think bomber so I did this of
course I had to throw in a fun t-shirt
from the lifang her t-shirt line that's
coming out my hashtag self made a
t-shirt I love this you guys know I'm
loving bread so of course I had to do B
red hashtag just did this to kind of
make it playful and fun not so serious
casual I found it with my high-waisted
rip um kind of straight leg denim I love
this light wash it hid my gold Oxford
I'm at Steve Madden I love these I've
show me so many times in videos oh my
gosh why I need some hand sanitizer so
yeah I did these to make it fun you know
what I'm doing like a graphic t-shirt I
do like fun shoes just kind of play with
the outfit do like a cool battle to kind
of that's how I roll and then I did a
fun studded bag you know when you're
playing with your outfits and you have a
fun outfit was a fun shoe I like to add
you know what cool fun bag to go with it
because why not like you're already
going for it why not just really go for
it for my next outfit which there's a
lot going on here I did this faux
leather jacket kind of this cool
color-block cream and black and this one
feels like butter it feels so nice so
silky you want I mean when I say it
feels like butter like it's smooth is
that Narnia low nose up that's probably
how they're blocking is cool
I like that it's not bright white it's
like an ice cream colored and black I
did my pink boy a graphic tee and my
denim shirt I really like this shirt
with denim I think the blue ties in
really nice weighted self the color
combo of gray and denim so I did this
under the docket it gave it a really
nice layered look you could see the
denim kind of peeking out the back and I
really like that so it's obviously on an
Oxford kick today because I wore these
with it because I don't know I just
thought graphic tee denim shirt dress it
down but not with speakers what can I do
I would have these it makes it a little
tomboyish a little masculine I love a
good Austin loafer to go with anything I
did my basic black high-waisted a motton
bow denim so next I did this thicker
jacket from Lulu's and I really like
this I mean it is like a thick heavy
duty structured jacket but I think
that's what makes it look so nice
this reminds me of a jacket I saw not
that long ago at All Saints I think it
was like $900 so you know there are
really nice weather jackets out there
great quality but I also believe that
there are similar options that are also
great quality for less again I do think
a leather jacket is a good thing to
invest in if you have that budget but if
you don't then there are there are good
leather jackets good faux leather
jackets out there for great prices I
think this one was maybe $30 and I love
it I get so many compliments on it so
I'm really really happy with this one I
did this super casually with the pair of
sneakers this is something that I would
wear it to the airport this jacket is
really thick so I my not another thing
oh I just did this lipstick quick basic
white tee and then my camo joggers again
staying comfortable great travel outfit
great running around outfit no fuss
super job alright guys so that is it for
