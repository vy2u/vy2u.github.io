episode of how to style and this is the
second how to style that we are in Texas
for Thanksgiving so this will be filmed
in my hometown in Texas so excited again
it's such a different scenery from the
New York City scenery that you guys are
used to sink so it's fun to kind of
change it up a little bit a lot of you
guys were requesting that I style
overalls because you were saying that
your issue was you don't know how to not
look like a farmer or you don't know you
know what exactly to pair and sometimes
with overalls you don't really need to
style them because you know it is your
whole outfit so I think just put in kind
of like a basic turtleneck or printed
sweater is kind of all you need you
don't really need to be completely
styled I think it's really about finding
what overall works best for your body
type whether you do you know a baggy
overall a flair overall skinny overall
and then just kind of adding basic
pieces under it and then a fun accessory
stress to hard about the styling part of
the overall this is just some outfit
inspiration that I threw together four
different ways that I would style them
or my first look I grabbed these from
Target today are basically just a pair
of wide leg corduroy burgundy overalls
you can definitely dress them up dress
them down love like a wide leg anything
so I thought these were really cool with
the color and the texture I paired it
with this turtleneck um I thought the
color was nice together kind of brought
out the burgundy in the shirt and I
thought this was super fun over/under
overalls because it is a turtleneck and
a bell sleeve so I loved this
combination they added the Hat just to
kind of complete the look it was cute
without the Hat but I just kind of
thought the Hat tops it off and just
kind of completed the whole thing both
of those items are from Target or my
second look I went with man I did a
really good job of zipping everything
back up after I was done I went with
this jumper it is just a zip up dress
overalls from forever 21 and they are a
black corduroy with a silver zipper I
thought these were so fun you can layer
anything under this you can do a
button-down a t-shirt a sweater so I
thought this was just a really easy
piece to grab and I've actually been
wearing them non-stop after I bought
them for this video so underneath it I
layered this sweater from Urban
Outfitters and I just thought the colors
were so fun
I love sweaters and I love printed
colorful sweaters so this had my name
written all over it I added this lace-up
bootie from Target I didn't do tights
just because we were filming in Texas
and it was like 70 degrees I didn't need
tights but this is definitely a look
that you can layer tights under and this
dress especially is so good for layering
with tights and folded my phone look
know what accent that was I did these
overalls from Urban Outfitters and they
are Navy kind of slouchy oversized
casual comfy I don't know I just thought
these were super cool I'm not I mean I
think you can't really see what they are
when I do this to complete the look I
did a cropped gray sweatshirt from
forever 21 I bought this when I came to
Texas because I didn't bring a
sweatshirt and I've been living in it
ever since it's so soft underneath it's
like they're really soft sweatpant t
sweat panty but pant like material I'm
struggling right now help and then I
just added my joshua saunders NY
sneakers i stepped in a huge mud puddle
so they're a little dirty because i
tried cleaning them and i just thought
it was a cool look for when you're going
to the airport or you're traveling or
you just want to be comfy and for my
last look i did my black overalls from
free people they are skinny overalls
which i love um they make these overalls
i think your rounds they have these and
they have all different colors they have
black light denim dark denim that kind
of like a greenish washed out denim with
that i just layered my turtleneck which
i got makeup all over just now perfect
from forever 21 this was like $13 it's a
good layering turtleneck it comes in a
lot of colors i got the cream one to
layer under the black I wanted something
basic because
I put my Topshop backpack in it and I
thought this was kind of like my
statement piece for the whole outfit
just kind of made the whole outfit so I
didn't need to dress it up a whole lot
you know my style is pretty simple
pretty basic and then I've usually got
like a pop of something whether it be a
colorful sweater or a printed backpack
so um I just thought that this was kind
of a good kind of chill casual but then
you've got like the cool backpack when
the lies around my own is your own when
the stars are crash yarn is my own it
goes on and on it goes on Oh
a few
Kinji
when the line is your it goes on
Oh
when the stars are crash your is my own
and it goes on
Oh
you
