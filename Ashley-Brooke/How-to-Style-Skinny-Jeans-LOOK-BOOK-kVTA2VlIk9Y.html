yeah
Oh
and in my face
Oh
you make me
and you
hi guys welcome back to my channel today
is what smoke was all about
skinny jeans because I've gotten quite a
few requests over the past few weeks to
style skinny jeans I thought I would go
about this by just kind of styling it
how I would style it for different
occasions so that's what I did the first
outfit I started with my mutton bow high
rise jeans and these are the bond jeans
they're just plain black high-waisted
start super stretchy and they just hug
you in all of the right places and I've
actually worn them for a couple of days
in a row no stretching I mean they're
just the exact size than when I put them
on the first time so that's always a
plus for me I actually have a pair of
frame jeans that I got when I was
working for intermixed and they were
about 240 dollars I mean I can't tell a
difference between the two these are so
comparable except these are 100 dollars
versus 240 dollars
so glad to have replaced my old Urban
Outfitters ones that I wear all the time
so have any care so you guys will be
seeing these in a lot of my how to style
videos I just kind of wanted to tell you
guys about their home Tryon program so
and I actually had to do this myself so
what you can do is actually order one
size pay for it and then you get a
second size to actually try on without
paying for it and then you get to choose
which size works out so so easy so what
I did was they sent me a 24 into 25 I
sent the 24 Batcopter 25 studies you can
actually try it on at home and make sure
that you're getting the size you want
without having to pay for two pair and
then you know return one it's so much
easier and you're at a shipping label
which is always my printer is always out
of ink
I can never print out shipping labels so
you get a shipping label pack it up then
melt all good for the top I actually
started with this white button-down and
then I layered the sweater over it
didn't pull out the color because I
really wanted to give the sleeve the
most attention so the color stayed in
actually pulls the white sleeve out of
the sweaters
to kind of pull the color out in now is
only something about it that just kind
of bothers me I was like doesn't look
too like preppy or like schoolgirl I
don't know something about it just loves
me so I've been actually wearing my
sleeve out instead of my collar and I'm
actually like thinking okay that's what
it needed it needed a sleeve not a color
so that's what I did for the top and I
don't have my leopard coat with me right
now I think I've put it back in the coat
closet but I added the leopard coat just
to give it some sort of print because it
was very you know basic camo white box I
wanted to add a printed coat and a
printed bag and to really pop off the
outfit I did my metallic gold loafers
and I thought that this was just like I
don't know I love adding it cool to the
kind of a more conservative put together
outfit I think I have fun you know kind
of masculine shoe really makes the
outfit a little different in a little
cooler self it is this guy I just
they're so light I love them so much so
if you guys are looking for a cool shoe
but yet so comfortable and I think you
for under $100 so always a pun for
outfit number two I did these
high-waisted gray blowout me jeans from
Zara and I don't know I I've had these
for so long they're kind of my go-to
dark gray Jean I like the way they fit
they're very snug very secure and I like
how they have a risk hen on the bottom
and then they keep it kind of simple in
casual I just did my Lulu's distress
piece this is like been my go-to t-shirt
for a few weeks now it's just so
comfortable and I love how the rips
aren't so big they're very small so I
think the rip placement is so great on
this shirt now for my coat I did my for
over 21 crops faux fur I haven't worn
this yet I've worn it um oxide worn it a
couple of times but for the length of
time that I've had this I really need to
start wearing it because I love it I
just never grabbed it this is such a
cool coat and I really wanted to dress
down this outfit and then add kind of
Mattox faux fur coat so that's why I
just basic jeans basic T super cool coat
and then for the kind of more masculine
aspects like my first outfit I did this
chunky loafer from I'll go and these are
very heavy
unlike the Steve Madden once these are
like super heavy and they're actually I
feel my felt kind of clunking like a
horse whenever I walk on my back
wah-wah-wah and I can you pick up your
feet I'm like I can't
is there any so we're my next outfit I
did the Manzo's denim again because I
wanted to show you guys what the
high-waisted effect looks like on these
jeans so I wanted to show you the first
outfit was just you know you could
really see the leg and a skinny of the
Jean but this gives you more of what the
high waist looks like so it's in my
mountainful on jeans then I added my few
minute fee from H&amp;amp;M I'm laughing so hard
because all of my you know what I'm just
going to show you guys how crazy my life
by her Facebook group is we're all nuts
over this t-shirt I don't know what
happened but um you know some kind of
like crazy a wildfire effect went into
effect of this teacher so I'm going to
scroll through and show you guys how
crazy we are one person got it and then
everyone started getting it and it just
became like a running joke that we all
needed to like take a group photo in our
see when it sees and I know it's kind of
a cool thing it's like a slice by her
club t-shirt then I dude my usual
leather jacket with my faux fur vest
over it so I did my red leather blue up
my red a faux leather jacket and then I
did my black skull for a vest over it so
you can really get the effect of a weird
look but still have you know like your
sleeve popping out and I don't know you
guys to who's been watching my videos
for a while know that I love layering
the vest over a jacket so good there and
I did this um red leather ankle bootie
from Zara coffee's on Poshmark and they
are
size too small these are a size 5 I
found my size I found a size 6
but I'm reselling these on Poshmark if
any of you tiny size 5 feet people in
five years you can go in my posture mark
and check it out I'll put the link down
below oh yeah these because I just think
this is so cool I love a good obviously
I'm like loving bread right now so had
to add these then I did my hat because I
don't know I just thought it was it
looked good it kind of like pops it off
when I was done getting dressed I was
like I need something extra what is it
not a beanie out of the Hat I was like
that's what it is so added the Hat for
my last outfit I did these high-waisted
white jeans with actually they didn't
come like this I actually cut these with
scissors so I do that sometimes when I
have no patience to take it to the
tailor I'm like I'll just get the
scissors out and do it myself so I did
these in Caesar by CP at jeans I don't
know where I got these or when I got
these but I got these well white jeans
in the winter I think it's so pretty
especially when you're doing like a
winter way or like a black and white
kind of color-block look so started with
these then I did my oversized black
sweater with my faux fur shearling and
faux leather vest over it again adding a
vest over something always do that I
just think it's such a good layering
look when you don't want to look too
puffy you just add a vest over it and it
still gives you a layered look without
actually being so weird it's also good
for people who were in a little bit of
warmer weather you know that way you're
not sweating but you're still looking
layered so I did this and then I added
this scarf over it because I love red
right now I mean can you even tell
what's happening right here my doing
this for nothing
was it a little crazy I just really
wanted more of like a super casual cozy
big scarf kind of flowing in the wind
type look so that's what I was going for
with this I did these ankle booties
which I've had
forever they've got some like denim
transfer up here need to get them clean
they did because I thought they tight in
the scarf really well and they were too
harsh up against the white jean so that
is it for this book book I'm pretty sure
I covered everything but as what you
guys know my lipstick i'm wearing is
Zilla I found it in my makeup bag I mean
my lipstick bag and I was like oh hey I
like you
the color is a beso number 10 it's
really cool it's like this liquid but
then it turns to Matt so I was pretty
cool I like this good find my own makeup
drawer and I am wearing the montón bow

Olivia it's really nice blue it's nice
and stretchy super super comfy I love
