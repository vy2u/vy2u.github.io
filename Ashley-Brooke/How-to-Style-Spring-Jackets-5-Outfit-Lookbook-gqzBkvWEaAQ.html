style video in today's video I am
styling a five of my favorite springtime
jacket I can just start over because I
just did so many weird things with my
hands like things I've never done before
clop springtime jackets because in New
York City and a ton of other places it's
still a little chilly in the spring so I
love getting those really lightweight
spring floral bright colored jackets all
I am doing a faux leather jacket in this
video but that's just because I wear
them all year round
I wear combat boots and leather jackets
all year except for one it's like
boiling hot but in the spring I will
definitely wear a faux leather jacket
but layering is my favorite thing to do
and in the springtime when is starting
to get warm and bleeding into the summer
it's a little hot and it's a little hard
to layer so I'd like to take lightweight
jackets that are very spring forward
that are light colors that are floral
just anything that looks like spring I
love to layer over just simple tank tops
or basic graphic tees so that is why I
chose to do this video today let's go
ahead and get into the oven
for this look I hope you guys really
loved it I hope you got some good info I
have so many spring jackets and I don't
even feel bad about it there are some
things that I'm like ok too many white
t-shirts
I need to condense them but spring
jackets are one of my favorite things in
the world and I can just like layer them
over the same outfit and it looks like a
completely different outfit so that's
why I absolutely love a good lightweight
spring jacket I don't know if you guys
