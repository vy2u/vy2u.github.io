you

I danced with you
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel
first off special appearance by ty he's
getting some Sun right now he's shy so
can I make him feel comfortable
so I styled printed and colored ankle
booties today I had a really hard time
picking only four that I wanted to style
I can style like a hundred outfits and
been so happy I filed prints and ankle
booties because I just think a good
printed ankle bootie or colored ankle
bootie can really make your outfit you
know you can do a basic denim basic
t-shirt basic jacket and then a cool
ankle boot and it just makes your whole
outfit so in my fourth style rolls a
statement to is a major cool factor in
your outfit and I think can really make
you a brave you when I'm like struggling
trying to find an outfit for the day
when in doubt go with all basics and
then a cool shoe so anytime I see a cold
shoe with you know embellishments or
prints or a cool color I like to buy it
because I know that it'll save my butt
when I'm meeting an outfit before I get
started I will say I wore a hat and I
think almost every single outfit I was
not having a good hair day yesterday nor
really am i today I'm kind of in that
in-between phase where I have a hair
appointment hat pasture optional on my
opinion you can either add a hat
remove that but due to my no-good hangar
date yesterday I wore a hat so let's go
ahead and get started
silently outfit
for my first outfit I started with these
good pockmark signs Mizar ass booties
I love these first I was like the peel
sucks weird but I'm going to actually
like it you know it doesn't it looks
good on I guess what I'm trying to say
it like you know when you hold it up
like this you're like what is up you're
a great Poshmark fine so comfortable the
perfect length I love these and when in
doubt go with a leopard leopard boot I
like to mix stripes and polka dots with
leopard I think that's a great mixing of
print combination so I started out with
then I layered my button-down my white
button-down with my red sweater over it
and I pushed my sleeves up to where I
had a little bit of speed sticking out
of the sweater sweater was kind of
orange in the video but it's not it's
like a very like a true red but I like
the color combination of red and leopard
I think it's really pretty much so I did
this and I just did my staple
high-waisted black motton bow skinny
because they added this who what where
clutch and I went to their spring
preview brunch and we got these I love
this I think it's so simple and so basic
I love the color blocking so it did this
and I thought it was really nicely with
the outfit for outfit number two I did
these red ankle boots and I got these on
trade Z seasons era and I love these I
think the red is such a good muted tone
down red good for mixing of prints and
other colors because it is like a tone
down muted red it's not so bright mat
leather low heel these are my new go-to
red booties because they're very
comfortable
then I added this blazer that I got at a
vintage store in LA last year it is a
size large but I just embrace it embrace
the oversized and so that I thought it
was too pretty not too
by I love all of the details between the
buttons and I thought that it tied in
the red boot really nicely under it I
just did a basic sheer black tight my
high-waisted shorts and I could I was
going to actually do a skirt but I
couldn't find a skirt so I did the
shorts and I actually like this better I
thought it made it less girly because it
is such a girly Tweedy jacket but I
thought that the shorts were really nice
the suede and then I just did my go to
basic mock neck which yep best make up
good job Ashley and of course my hat my
next ankle boot I did was not so much
printed or colored but studded and I
have three or four pairs of really good
studded booties that I love and it does
not you know from the front you can't
even see the studs really which is also
kind of what I like about this boot it's
more you know what you turn to the side
like BAM Here I am basic I did this
the boyfriend ish sport so like a tomboy
Jean there's little like fattier in the
crotch and in like the upper leg and
then get a little bit more tapered
towards the bottom did my shredded
t-shirt from forever 21 I love this it's
so so so soft and I think the rip
placement really nice you mine then I
tied my flannel shirt around the waist
just to give it more like a layered but
still casual kind of look I really
actually like wearing this just as is
because it's super super long so it
gives you a nice tunic effect but for
the sake of the outfit I did this around
my weight it's added my little faithful
leather jacket over that or my final
outfit I did my Matisse printed floral
boot which I I love these and I did this
kind of like acid II wash ripped denim
high-waisted mom Jean so I did this add
a little bit of color to bring out the
color in the boot
I did this red faux leather jacket look
at me
