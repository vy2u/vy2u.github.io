channel in today's how to style video we
are styling Salah and I'm dressed for
the occasion all right so you guys are
normally used to seeing me in all black
gray maybe sometimes white if I'm
feeling really adventurous but today I
really wanted to step out of my comfort
zone and do some color and some print
and I actually really loved it which is
why I'm wearing a pink and purple
sweater right now ask you guys what
format you like better in the how-to
styles if you like the description first
and in the lookbook or vice versa and I
think most of you guys like it the old
way as you said you like the element of
surprise at the end so I'm going to
continue to do that but also posting
overviews of the outfit as I am
explaining them so I think that's a
win-win for everyone if you want to fast
forward through the explanation you
totally can but I wouldn't because
there's some good stuff in the
explanation just say alright so let's
get into the outfit descriptions first
I'm going to start with this camel
colored sweater that I got at H&amp;amp;M its
ribbed camel can't get much better than
that super basic mock neck such a great
layering piece and it's not super long
it's not cropped it's like the perfect
length
my basic hmm DIY uneven hem denim jeans
with putting these on for my how to
style and I heard this like rip and I
was like no I like ripped the belt loop
shit I'm going to have to get that fixed
cuz these are my favorite so instead of
pairing this with a basic pair of black
denim I went with blue because I thought
this was really nice for a sunny kind of
pretty winter day then I added a black
faux leather moto vest over it to give
it some sort of layering piece obviously
you can do it by itself but for the sake
of the video I did a layering piece to
add a print I did my amazing Poshmark
find these booties from Zara in a
leopard print and I just thought that
this color palette was really nice the
black the camel
Leopard it kind of all tied in together
and then because I was freezing my buns
off I did this plaid coat from Topshop
that I got last year but I noticed that
they're making it again this year so I
can find it I'll link it below for my
second outfit I went with my new
favorite sweater from Urban Outfitters
and I just think this is the most like
Rand Paul looking sweater I'm obsessed
with it I love the colors in the print
it's actually um Hennessy by van Hewson
and this is part of Urban Outfitters
Urban Renewal collection then I did this
just a pair of high-waisted black bdg
denim my favorite high-waisted black
skinny jeans a black hat and this new
bag that I got from Zara I just liked
the pop of red right here and I like the
star on the handle I thought this is a
really good color combination and I'm
loving this like seat belt strap thing
that it's got going on so this is new so
they should have this outfit number
three I went with this super fun neon
and black sweater from forever 21
Proenza made a sweater that looked just
like this I'm going to say three years
ago so I saw this at forever 21 and I
was like wait is that like Proenza from
forever 21 of not sure what's happening
it's just so cool I love like elements
of surprise in a sweater like a neon
color or fun print something go I paired
that sweater with these faux leather
pants from Zara and I liked all the
zippers on these I think that's really
cool kind of different a beanie because
my head was freezing really no other
reason and my Western inspired back from
Zara that is broken that I've had for
two years now so one of my all-time
favorite so I love this bag and it turns
everything that's inside black because
this way two rubs off for my fourth
outfit I did this neon ish oranjee red
sweater it's kind of orange in the video
but it's really a little bit more on the
side I promise it told you and add some
color and boy did I this is a colorful
sweater but I love it I think it's
something for those really sunny pretty
ball winter days I think a bright
colored sweater is so pretty so I
thought this was perfect and then I
actually loved it with this rich blue
denim I think these two colors are
really pretty together and the good
thing about this water is that you can
also wear with black denim and it's just
fine like it's not so neon to where it
looks harsh up against black but I mean
still it's really nice then I added in
this bag from forever 21 one of my
favorites right now because it's just so
simple it's like no seams no hardware
just simple black bag many of you guys
have been following my vlogmas segments
for december you will know that I just
got this code from Zara with 130 I think
they marked it down to like 69 so I
thought this was a steal for like a big
oversized coat I love the print I think
it's good um to have a printed coat that
just kind of is a statement piece for
your outfit when it's really cold
outside so I was really excited to have
this alright that is it for my outfit
description I tried to go super quick
not to bore you with anything I just
kind of wanted to explain what I was
wearing the idea behind it alternatives
and all of that good stuff so for those
of you who watch the intro I really
appreciate it because it's nice to know
that not only do you want to see the
lookbook but you want to know the
thought and the processing and the work
that goes behind it so I really
appreciate you watching this part
because this is this part means a lot to
me I think it's you know the thought
process that makes it count
so thanks guys so much so yeah let's get
