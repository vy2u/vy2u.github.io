I have a very special video for you
which I have partnered with SK Pugh and
they have introduced me to their facial
treatment essence product and I have now
been using this twice a day and you know
I don't say this often but is brand new
products that I have introduced into my
routine I'm absolutely loving it my main
goal for using this product is to
weather prove my skin I've been looking
for just kind of one product that does
all of the work for me so I'm really
really excited to have introduced this
into my skincare routine so in this
video I'm going to share with you my
personal skin problems why I'm using
this and how I'm liking it so if you
have a skin problem that I have is
depending on the time of year I am dry
and oily not just one I'm both so I'm
very combination but it's what extreme
to the other depending on the season
when my skin is dry it gets very flaky
in the winter I have dark spots from the
Sun in the summertime and just like
everybody else I have an occasional
breakout so before using this product I
was thinking what are some of the ways
that hard on my skin and I was really
kind of digging and I was like I'm
really not that hard on my skin or so I
thought kind of really was self aware
during the week and really paid
attention to all of the times that I
wasn't great to my skin or it could have
been better and I was really really
surprised at how not great I am to my
skin
so I guess my biggest issue is that my
skin is really inconsistent so using the
facial treatment essence has really
helped refine and keep my skin and even
texture also tell that this is help
reduce I get this one brown spot on my
forehead during the summer time and it
doesn't matter how much makeup I put on
it you can always see it I always can
see that it's there so ever since using
the facial treatment essence I can
definitely see it fading I'm also
someone who doesn't like wearing a lot
of makeup if ever any makeup I know we
all try to go for that makeup no makeup
below but it's been so nice using this
product just rolling out of bed
splashing it on my face feeling like my
skin it's a little bit brighter a little
bit more even tone and texture it first
leave sometimes Logging's throughout the
week and I'm not really wearing a lot of
makeup I do want to feel comfortable in
my own skin and feel like I have more of
an even skin texture and this is really
really helped me feel more confident in
that
all about ingredients I always check
ingredients whenever I'm purchasing a
product I think as I've gotten older I
started caring more about what I'm
putting on my face and in my hair so one
of the main reasons I love this product
is that it contains its own unique
special ingredients that is exclusive to
fk2 called Patera the carrot was
actually discovered in Japan 37 years
ago and remains the same to the state
fun fact as you can tell I am a
kinesiology major so just knowing the
biology and the science behind things
really really intrigues me because I
think it's just so interesting and I
would hope that you guys would want to
know also what you're putting on your
face I do think it's so important to
know your ingredients and know exactly
what's going on your skin
so on to some of my weather proofing
tips number one is sunscreen always
wears sunscreen on your face make sure
you're buying a foundation that has
sunscreen in it and it doesn't hurt to
apply sunscreen on before your
foundation and even in the winter time I
know it's so weird putting sunscreen on
in the winter but you know the sun is
still blazing down on your face even
though it's cold so definitely don't
forget to put sunscreen on all year
round another tip that I have something
that I do every time is when I'm at the
pool I'm always wearing hot and covering
my face I never put my face on the Sun
but I'm always wearing a hot a blocky
hot a baseball hot I'm going to be in
the Sun for a while protect your face
another rule that I live by is I wash my
face twice a day always when I wake up
always before I go to bed I know it's so
hard on days when you get home late for
work or if you wake up super late and
you're you know running late for work
but it is so important to wash your face
twice a day just to get the dead skin
cells off just to clean out your pores
and also makes you feel good I know when
I'm dreading it and I always do it I'm
like oh I feel so good I can't believe I
was considering not doing it so always
wash your face twice a day another tip /
rule that I live by is always be aware
of what's going in your body I know
everyone says you know it's a no-brainer
during tons of water it's great for your
skin which it is but also be aware of
the foods that you're consuming if
you're eating tons of greasy food fast
food tons of sugar it's going to show in
your skin and that is something that I
did learn in school it's like one of my
main takeaways so always be aware of
what's going in your body and drink tons
of water another tip is to stay away
from really harsh facial scrubs I know
they feel so good and it feels so good
getting that top layer of dead skin
cells and dirt off but it's actually
causing tiny abrasions on your face I
read this somewhere and it freaked me
out so bad so I did so much so much
research on it and it's actually true so
ever since then I've been using sheet
masks instead and if I am going to use a
scrub I make sure that it's a very
gentle one something you know with not a
lot of to birds or anything and my last
tip last rule is a humidifier I see
like it worked for me I don't know as a
humidifier is for everybody I don't know
if it would hurt or not but I've always
used a humidifier I feel like I just
wake up with moisturize skin and not
only does it help because I also sleep
with that fan blowing right on my face
so a humidifier helps with my throat my
nose just any issues I'm having and you
can also put like some menthol e minty
since in it which I love so if you're
having some skin issues of dryness maybe
trying to get a humidifier and see if
that helped gonna skip though use
distilled water
don't you think water and my last tip
really hurts my heart
but scalding hot showers are not good
for your skin I was so bummed out and I
still take scalding hot showers right
now and then I try to like turn it on
cold and then jump in it and wash my
face really quick and then jump right
back out and turn it on how it's really
not great for your skin it dries it out
and it's just not good so try to take
warm I don't know I'm not going to tell
you not to take scolding on showers
because I'm talking to take my own
advice on that one
so sq2 and i invite you to take the one
bottle away from journey so so far with
this one bottle I feel like I have been
able to weatherproof my skin I feel a
more even skin tone skin texture I'm not
getting dry weird flaky spots oily spots
and at the most exciting part of all is
my brown brown Sun splat on the forehead
is disappearing I hate talking about it
so embarrassing but I know I'm not the
only one out there with this type of
skin problem I think it is important to
talk about them and to address skin
problems and I really think it all comes
down to weather proofing the weather
plays such a huge role on your skin and
so far as a facial treatment essence has
really helped me transform so many of
the issues that I have been having when
it comes to dealing with weather
proofing I'm really going to challenge
you guys here to step out of your
comfort zone and open up and put your
biggest skin insecurity your biggest
skin issues in the comments below and
maybe you are just one bottle away from
making yourself feel more confident and
more secure in your own skin so I did
