channel if you are new here I am
actually Brooke and I do
predominantly fashion videos I love
doing hauls especially in the fall
because the fall fashion is my favorite
thing in the world in this video you are
gonna find some of my newer pieces for
fall some pieces to watch out for in my
next style videos hopefully you get some
inspiration out of this video I know a
lot of you guys who have been with me
for a while saying that watching my
hauls has caused you to step out of your
comfort zone because I do bicep pieces
that are a little bit out there so that
makes me happy so if you're new here
hopefully you get that as well in this
video I'm gonna be showing you some of
my newer pieces that I got for fall
we've got some outerwear sweater shoes
bags all the good stuff putting
timestamps on my video so in the
description box you'll find timestamps
of where everything is that you know if
one store is not your thing hopefully
maybe you'll find something else below
you can skip right to it just makes it
easier on you guys let's go ahead and
get started first I'm gonna start with
Topshop because I've been loving Topshop
lately it is when I go into the store I
can never find anything in there when I
shop online
everything jumps out at me so I'm gonna
start thing I got is a super just basic
piece that I think a lot of people own
already army green and kind of like
military style jacket oversized really
cool zipper it's got a hood eyes at the
waist that you can definitely wear it
with a cinched waist or you can wear it
kind of oversized and flowy I think this
is great when you're going for more of a
casual look I like it with jeans and
military-style boot like a lace-up army
boot a graphic t-shirt I really don't
know where to put it next is a flowy
romper before you look at it and be like
why are you holding up a giant piece of
fabric just know that I do plan on
belting this maybe I think there's
something just so cool about the print I
love that it's Navy to it not black
I think Navy for fall is really pretty
and it's got so many fun colors in it so
you can tie in some fun shoes and a fun
bag where the culottes style definitely
a little bit more cropped especially if
you wear a belt it will be more crops
because then you can blouse it over a
little bit I don't know I absolutely
love this
probably my favorite item from topshop
this is this guy right here a pretty
khaki color it reminds me of like a
Members Only jacket except chic I don't
know it's got a really great fit to it
the detailing on the sleeve is really
nice um the pleats in the back so this
is also something else the third piece
that you can dress up or down really
nice for those states that don't get so
cold during winter so you know light
jackets are always your go-to and one
piece from River Island it is this coat
I think this is also another staple that
is really great for any wardrobe any
lifestyle you have I think this is
awesome if you're looking for a printed
coat this print is a good way to go
because it is very versatile it's not so
crazy but yet it's still a print I'd
like about this this particular one from
River Island it's that you can almost
wear it as like a third piece laser as
well because it's not super heavy but
yet still functional enough to be a coat
so multifunction jacket here my next
item is from Norton Rock and it is this
faux shearling bomber like a varsity
jacket style bomber and I love it I love
this print right here this houndstooth
red black and white print so cool I love
red in the fall I think it just is like
a standout color anything you're wearing
that's red it's like very eye-catching
back the print travels to the back
sleeves are still faux shearling and
it's got this really cool oversized look
to it it's pretty heavy though I mean
this could definitely double up it's
like a coach like a lighter coat it's
not like a your typical light weight
bomber it's definitely got a little bit
of weight to it so on those cooler fall
days this should keep you pretty warm
next I have one pair of shoes from Nine
West and kids love these got this nice
pointy toe up really low heel just love
the button detailing
a zipper closure which is great for
people with really white feet like me I
have the hardest time putting on boots
when I have to put my foot into that
like no I'm not going in so I love um
the zipper that's just like perfect
function for me yes what's next
Laura hey Zara is next in my blog on
Wednesday I did a fitting room a try on
for you guys so some of you probably
have seen some of this already but
you'll get kind of more up-close look of
it so bear with me a new thing - I think
there's two or three new things that you
haven't seen I got the grandma chic
dress oh man I love this oh my style
like floral bold print oversized batwing
and love it so much print is really cool
here's a little close-up love the print
this is velvet neckline this emerald
green so pretty oh this is like an ankle
bootie and like a hat to make it look
kind of cool and boho I don't know
there's something about this is like
just giving me gray chic vibes I love it
next is this dress and it's like
sweatshirt sweatshirt material on the
top definitely like a thick sweatshirt
that you would wear to the gym and it's
got this really a pretty plaid tweed
detail on the bottom I'd know you know I
don't like it when things don't carry
over to the back okay I love it that
much that I just was like you know what
I'm gonna let this one slide little
dress because I love you don't do this I
don't talk to my clothes normally it's
only when I'm on camera I feel like I
have to speak for them you know she's
sorry that she doesn't carry comfort
okay at the length I am five five and it
was kind of short on me just like a
little bit short um but I think that's
kind of look I was going for because I'd
probably wear it with a higher boot so
that way a little bit of my leg shows
and we're good was this dress the one
that messed up my braids so bad it's got
a very tight neck hole just letting you
know I think this is great for if you
are going to the office or like a
meeting of some sort and it's really
comfortable very functional very
versatile Navy with this really great
neck
right here the effect of a white
button-down sticking out at the bottom
which I like like a little layered look
without having to try to be layered like
that it's Navy once again I just love
Navy for fall think you're wearing a
dark color without wearing black don't
get me wrong I live in black but it's
also good to also do a dark color that's
not black and I think Navy is a perfect
option for that
so what shirt my desert sweatshirt that
I called it in my blog I think the
colors are so fun and they're very happy
and this reminds me of an aardvark cool
with jeans when you're just running
errands lounging around the house but
you can also dress it up because it is
very cool it's a cool pattern orange is
not my color as you can see it's just
not I sacrificed myself for this because
I really loved it and I think I will get
a lot of use out of this this next piece
my Texas roots came out I just love this
so let me show you bear with me
it's a tenem jacket that's with this
okay so it's a denim jacket with sweater
French sleeves and I don't know there's
just something about that I just love
this so much the colors are so cool it's
even got lime-green threading inside of
it I mean how fun are these colors like
a denim jean with it do you kind of an
all denim look
I think I'm crazy just tell me in the
comments that I'm crazy and that I'm
gonna look silly wearing this but um
thumbs up if you if you like it
some Zara are two bags and here is the
first one it is patent black with floral
and gold studs and it's got a little
chain which I like days that I'm kind of
wanting to wear an all-black outfit that
this would be nice it would give me a
little bit of red so I can wear my red
booties that I love so much you might
still have red booties find a bag that
has a little bit of red in it and that
way you can I feel like you can wear
them more when you know when you're just
wanting to do solids like just basic
denim basic tee basic top you can
definitely wear your red booties and tie
in something like this with it so my
last bag from Zara is
and this guy right here and it is blue
actually it's dark navy and different
colored blue patches on it I don't know
if you can tell in the camera or not if
it of room inside of it
I really love this and I love that it's
silver again me with the Navy
okay second to last door is Urban
Outfitters only got two things it's
really pretty
coin pendant and I like it a lot this is
great for layering it's kind of like an
everyday necklace looks vintage and
usually never really buy jewelry unless
I know I'm gonna wear it a lot and this
is one of those things that I will just
kind of throw on and layer with all of
my other necklaces so this giant piece
of material also known as a sweater very
very oversized very batwing batwing
balloon sleeves it's just kind of like
the most perfect oversized black sweater
in my opinion this is great with like a
nice pair of flare jeans um skinny jeans
with some fun boots picture this sweater
black skinny jeans red booties and this
bag mm-hmm
so that's it Abin I've got two pairs of
shoes from Free People bounced in the
light by her lookbook group and the
Facebook group that Free People was
having a 50% off of selected shoes so I
got two pairs from me 50% off my first
pair I got to wear in the snow but then
I got them and I had on like a dress
with it and I was like oh man this is
cute with even just like a black dress
he's I know some of you were like really
like them I really like the red laces on
them I really like the gold I think
they're just fun they're not like heavy
duty so I don't know how they're gonna
hold up in the snow have to wear a thick
sock with it but like good tracking on
the bottom so I think it'll be a good
bad weather boot I will let you guys
know when we have bad weather but until
then I'll probably wear them with just
denim like a sweater or something so my
last item who get the lookbook these
shoes were in it in last month so you
probably recognize these floral full I
didn't do a very good job of the big
reveal cuz I oh they're not buckled
floral they've got these
the giant buckle detail as well as an
ankle strap so I actually tried these on
with a kick flare a crop cropped flare
denim style and I really liked these
with it sing florals yes yes they are no
I don't know actually it's all wrong
such a statement shoe they're great with
just like a black dress they're girly
they're fun they're definitely
interesting
I don't know that I would have paid full
price for them just because I don't know
how much use I'm gonna get out of them
it's not something that I would grab all
the time but for 50% off I was like yes
and my wishlist unfree people for a long
time so when I saw that there was 50%
off I was like done sold that is all I
have for you for this haul I really hope
you loved it got some good inspo look
