to get my nails done because then you
can get Tosa anyways then we are going
to go I found this really cool jacket on
Zara's website and I'm putting it in the
life by her lookbook but I want to make
sure that it's as cool in person so I'm
going to go see if I can find it
before I put it in a lookbook and then I
have to go to food emporium and get some
avocados because the dr. Oz Show reached
out to me and they want me to make a
video for their show making avocados
toast so I have to go get some avocados
and some really good like big spread I'm
excited about that
I think that we'll be going live on the
dr. Oz Show either February 13th or 14th
but I'll keep you guys updated so you
can go watch your girl make us some
avocados I'm wearing this crop
sweatshirt my wrist distress pea from
Lulu's black leggings leopard coat star
bags and I tomba because I just want to
be comfy and getting my toes done too so
I want to be able to like lift my pants

long time guess what came in I'll show
you
ready for it ready for it oh man fun pop
here it is what does video on snapchat
have already seen this but here you go
how the style videos are about to get a
lot more cool our new drone I think
there is one Park in Brooklyn I want to
say that it's legal to fly the drones so
I think we're going to go to Brooklyn
one day in practice flying our drone
that way we don't you know we live so
close to the water that I'm afraid it'll
go in the water if we try to practice
anywhere around here and it's illegal so
I want to get in trouble I did watch one
of errant Conover's videos and he was
flying his in Central Park but you're
not supposed to but I think if you go
like early enough and secluded enough
area maybe maybe my I don't know
Brooklyn's like so far across the city I
think it's more like a jaywalking long
it's like Oh Lois don't do it but it's
okay throw it near an airport or finding
peeping-tom people's windows yeah but
we're not in an airport but we're right
by a helipad where helicopters land and
stuff that's very true one of my

bigger more uncomfortable bag so he
could bring snacks
because one of those bringing snacks is
a necessity it's not you could have
brought your backpack where's your

he loves it going down I'm getting
hungry
yes like the time you said that today so

Donna thank you so much for nothing we
love that you love it when we have to
meet you guys and take pictures of so

sorry pause it for her being rude yeah
except my apartment this way is that
we're going to do this alright so we
were going to go to Zara and then we're
going to go to the grocery store but
both no because we ate too much so I
told myself I wasn't going to do it all
so I was like don't make yourself
miserable
here we are feelin miserable today has
been pretty much just like the laziest
day ever Ryan and I got home and we were
so full oh we got back in bed and I
worked on me like my hair look look
and he just kind of did some work and
now we're going to have like a scary
movie night / halo top so that's a good
flavor
alright so last night we watched what
did we watch something no we watch the
visit last night and I was scared I had
jumped a few times
Ryan acted like he wasn't scared but he
definitely was Ryan Higa the movie out
yeah I always thought that you fight for
like 20 minutes into the movie or like
45 and he's like I know it's going to
happen already
and he's right every single time so
we're going to do halo top and Blondie's
just going for it you know just go for
it
chocolate chip cookie dough and
chocolate mocha chip my two favorites
right now so while we wait for these to
solve we're going to go
thirty minutes later we finally made a
decision we're going to watch a girl on
the train first and then we're going to
watch hush them to make sure I hang up
with ice cream back in the freezer
we're taking who does the geosoft
no Josh we make popcorn okay oh we don't
have a mama
Leonato all right we're in between

is creepy fog still oh my gosh you guys
know what this usually looks like - the
fog Coffee time

are into super scary like jump jumpy
movies um what's a movie we watched
school hush right oh yeah
it's called hush and that's on Netflix
and it was so good I screamed out loud
one time and I'd never do that it's like
good the whole entire time so if you
love scary suspenseful kind of like
movies like that you'll like it right

the lighting but I think we'll be fine
