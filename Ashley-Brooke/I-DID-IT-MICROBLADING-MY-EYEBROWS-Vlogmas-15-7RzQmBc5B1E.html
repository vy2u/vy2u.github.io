moment of that I'm bout to get my
eyebrows done Merry Christmas you filthy
animal
hey guys so this is my first time
picking up actually picking up the
camera and talking to you guys today
it's two o'clock been quite busy this
morning but I just really didn't have
time to film and it was kind of an
interesting got fully ready hair and
makeup shot two outfits outside shot a
clip outside and edited blog mist and
then edited the whole Christmas gift
guide so it's been kind of a busy
morning but I am winding down I just
went and washed all of my makeup off
because I am getting my brows done later
today so I wanted a clear face for that
excuse me please do not chew on that
shoe okay so now the plan is to kind of
get my room my bed cleared I've got all
of my mess from all my shooting so I'm
going to clear all of that I have a
couple more things to do on the computer
let's go ahead and get started with the
cleaning of the room like I do this
every day pull multiple outfits shoot
have a giant mess have to leave
cleaned up my giant mess in my bedroom
now I'm gonna make some leftovers
leftover dinner I love leftovers
Ryan is watching vlogmas before it goes
live I always make sure that he watches
it just because I don't know I feel like
it's kind of like a courteous thing if
someone's in your video a lot and I
always like for him to watch it because
he's so honest he'll be like okay this
dry out for a little too long you could
have turned the music down a little bit
here so he always kind of goes through
and makes sure that it's edited properly
it's just always good to have a second
set of eyeballs on the video
okay just got my food done basically
leftovers from yesterday we've got
quinoa shaved Brussels sweet potato and
the who makes us burger brown field
roast burger patty this was so good last
night so I like love it when I have
leftovers for lunch the next day because
easy to cook easily going to work while
I eat to edit the photos that we took
this morning both outfits also I'm glad
that we did that this morning because it
is now snowing so that would have been
not very fun
I'm about to leave I've been sitting
here working for like five hours
straight and I just had the holy
moment of that I'm about to go get my
eyebrows done I got kind of nervous and
I had to put on dove deodorant non
natural deodorant cuz I was like wearing
this sweater from urban that I've been
wearing for the most of the day then I'm
doing my velvet high-waisted jeans and
my pearl boots I'll do my leopard coat
and my white scarf it's gonna go with no
makeup I feel like that's the best since
she didn't tell me if I should do makeup
or not I'm just gonna do no makeup so
she can just go go with it and don't
forget I told you there is a special
guest star in the vlog today and we will
see our special guest very soon boots
with pearls black jeans a sweater with
like B sleeves duster ease like a dog
toy ball behind you and you can take
that with you yep
looking good goes perfectly with it I'm
going to get my eyebrows done microbe
Laden are univee United bat or something
you see yeah it's a little traffic I
know
cb4 eyebrows be glad you're not a woman
cell phone chimes you may miss two days
didn't get the shape first yeah three
one
mmm nobody think we have made out a box
of a new era for us right
I'm just gonna fill in a little spot
right yeah no no no haven't grown
[Laughter]
Wow
[Laughter]
can you show everyone your blue balls
Ryan's gonna love that one
tattoo
oh so close done we are done this
Lighting's kind of funky hold on look
how amazing she did such a good job look
at this there's just a little spot right
here cuz I have a little freckle that
she couldn't go over but that'll be
super easy to just fill in now I can't
make facial expression at least you're
not creepy I like a bland so I look at
my cell when I'm spiking for it and look
at the lens but the number now and then
just makes sure things are okay all
right we're gonna say bye to d-money now
we'll have to get dinner soon go see
Banksy bye all right I just got home and
I could not be happier with my brows I
will admit I was a little nervous going
into it because you just not about the
pain but you just don't know how these
things are gonna turn out and it's kind
of scary but I could not imagine them
looking any differently this is exactly
how I pictured them when I was doing
research so I'm so happy and I just
wanted to give a shout out to Pratt for
doing them she was amazing and it
literally took her like 45 minutes to do
the whole the whole procedure it was
crazy I was in and out her Instagram is
eyebrow doctor and she goes to LA New
York Miami but I'm pretty sure she's
based here in New York but I will put
all of her info below the best way to
reach her is through email that you're
and
and I thank all of you guys who gave me
feedback and just kind of let me know
your experience it really ease my mind
and help me make my decision process of
getting them done is you do it the first
time and then you touch up in four to
six weeks and then in I think she said
four to six months depending on your
skin you have to get it like a not a
refill but a touch-up I guess another
touch-up so pretty easy process I'm
gonna go make dinner I had a huge lunch
like two and a half hours ago certainly
not that hungry I ate lunch super late
because I got busy but I think I'm gonna
make like a protein smoothie Bowl and
maybe some like avocado toast or
something get some work done because I
was gone for a couple of hours so I'm
gonna get some work done and I will see
you guys in a little bit hopping about
to hop in the shower and then I realized
I totally forgot to make my smoothie
bubble so that's what I'm doing and that
is why I'm in my robe first I like to
blend up ice frozen strawberry and one
whole banana Nick I'm gonna do a scoop
of peanut butter add some chocolate and
some extra peanut butter I'm gonna put a
layer of bar in I'm going to do one
scoop of chocolate protein powder how is
the gym really so afterwards I'm going
to top it with a little bit of curly as
Elizabeth but apparently it Elizabeth
granola pull some almonds on top
