I can't rain have to shoot I got my
video outfits picked out some color
actually for a change everything's not
all black Ryan and I are shooting my
makeup routine with his voiceover that
you guys have been requesting I think
that's such a good idea would you rather
him do an actual voiceover or do you
want him kind of sitting beside me
telling it as I'm
doing it I think it would be funny if
you're sitting next to me if C is
confused who look the best concealer but
it's not like paint but I kind of like
hello hi if this one piece of hair that
doesn't know where it belongs till it
here what so I can't I'm gonna need some
hairspray you need me to talk to it yeah
I can talk to it with my saliva no yep

styling sweaters and I'm going to be
putting like an outerwear piece over I
don't like my hair today so just an FYI

liking my hair will try to vlog a lot

filming and I cannot feel my feet my
feet are completely numb
how you doing right let's try back this
video a lot yeah we had some issues
today uploading vlogmas 9 because um I
mess up I'm not doing my intro and outro
today because my face is so red from
being windblown and my eyes are red so
I'm going to wait and do my intro and
outro and
video description in the morning so and
we're losing light we're losing daylight
pretty quickly so I'm afraid if I start
it's going to get dark and then I start
over anyway
like this chair is not meant for two
people well Ryan wants to go to the
movies most not flu like you don't want
I don't want to go to the movies we
already have this I know once like I'm
there I'll be so happy but it's just
like I don't wanna go outside again I'm
still so cold
what's even showing right now let's see
you want to see a rival what are you
doing over there slowly dying why well
number one my abs are so sore from that
ab workout I did yesterday it's getting
the worst dick showing your abs now
Brian and I have had thought I just made
eye contact with our neighbor again
uh-huh that told two of our day no first
of all we've been shooting outside all
day there were some puddles in the
ground and they were frozen over it was
so cold outside then I tried to upload a
vlog miss 9 twice and there were
mistakes in both of them so we had to
upload it a third time and then there
ended up being an extra clip in there
then some of our clips need to be reshot
for tomorrow's videos so we're gonna
have to wake up and do that Ryan I got
to a fight it happens it happens because
I think we were just both so stressed
out throughout the day with all of these
things going wrong that we just kind of
took it out on each other for like 10
minutes we both kind of apologized and
you know it's not good to take things
out on other people but yeah I think I'm
gonna make a sandwich now
on that note and then first sure you
that last cookie I like cookies I need
to so you can at least tell them that I
won the fight Oh No
ya know we were gonna go to the movies
we're gonna like go we're gonna go see
the arrival which looking awesome but
then we just put her up where I am
waiting someone's left last time we went
to the movies there was this couple
sitting beside us they were talking like
this loud the whole entire time and
finally Ryan was like Shh and they
almost looked like surprised like wait
they're a little scared you're not gonna
be talking in the theater so I'm reading
all of your comments about you know the
conversation we had yesterday about
sponsored videos I'm so happy with them
I'm just so happy that you guys trust me
to put good products in your face and so
have you been telling me like your
horror stories about how you were conned
into buying something that was in
someone's favourites and that the
product sucked like I would never do
that to you but about today oh my god
our neighbors look our neighbor thinks
we're weird sorry we are telling about
the oh well the thing in the dark should
I turn the light on no I think it's good
okay that's good that's good yeah can
you see him oh good get my bun otherwise
I look like my little brother if you
can't see my hair um butter if you're
watching it it's cool bro I look like a
little boy you're my bro I know here's a
perfect example again with the honesty
and the transparency I got offered a
sponsored video today for a game you
would have never known it was sponsored
it's like a 30-second mention you would
never ever in a million years catch me
sitting on my phone playing a game never
I don't encourage that but I'm going to
be sitting there and I have absolutely
nothing to do you're gonna see me
listening to a podcast you're gonna see
me reading a book about motivation or
the industry that I'm in something to
better myself you'll never see me
sitting and playing a game but you guys
would have never known that and that
would have been super shady at me and
that's just an example and I feel like
it's such a good time that that happened
today so I could tell you guys about it
that's just like an example of how
things work sometimes we gotta be real
though if it was the Sims that reached
out and want to do sports all I do
you stabbed me miss Sims urn because no
one knows this about ash except for like
me and her mom and her made-up imaginary
friend because she had none at the time
but she literally would spend hours and
hours playing Sims and like creating out
our big lives what do you tell a little
bit about your cinema frail relapse if I
started talking about it and you'll see
me at like Best Buy tomorrow at the
basket full of Sims oh we've been in
Best Buy before and she's gotten
multiple sin oh my gosh and we make me
put them back downward spiral of the
century what she knows the language to
Dukla she used to do that to me out of
nowhere she just come up do Blau my sins
talk oh my god didn't you lose your
whole family incentives yeah they all
died that's why you can't still can't
talk about it it hurts too soon even
though it was like 1998 tomorrow
tomorrow
we are going to earn that Monday no
tomorrow what's I'm confused
I'm putting my makeup on Ryan is gonna
do he's on into a voiceover like but
he's going to be sitting down next to be
doing like the explanation of the makeup
tutorial and it's making even more
interesting we're gonna have some
mimosas because we are going to brunch

you've got champagne in the fridge that
we've had for how long like like a month
like generally one two months when your
parents were here yeah my mom mom you
brought it yeah I know you're watching
