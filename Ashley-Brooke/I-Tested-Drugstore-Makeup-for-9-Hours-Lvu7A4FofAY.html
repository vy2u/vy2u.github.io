this morning I'm going to do a full on
full face of makeup drugstore makeup
products I was in Texas about a week ago
and I stocked up all I was a target
because drugstore makeup is so expensive
here in New York City it's like I mean
half of the cost in Texas so I like with
the target and completely stocked up on
some goodies most of the products I
would say like 99% of the products I'd
never tried before so I'm going to put
them to the test today do a full face
and just kind of guide you along so if
you are in need of some new makeup
products or just some new tips or just
some new ways of doing things and I hope
you stick along and watch this video I'm
gonna go change shirts cuz I do keep
losing this one I feel like this one's
an accident waiting to happen so I'm
gonna go change shirts and I'll come
back in here see in a bit so I have
three foundations here that I want to
try out three different colors I'm the
worst at picking out foundation colors I
am just terrible I got the covergirl
vitalist healthy elixir the covergirl
trublend liquid makeup I've got the
Revlon Colorstay 24-hour wear for normal
to dry first I'm going to grab my fares
witch hazel which I got at Target and
I've been using this stuff or I don't
know maybe three years now it's the best
toner
how about blemish here so they will be
putting our foundation to the test I
picked out these foundations I had faced
a neuron so it should keep in Church
it's my primer I picked up this is wet
and wild do we face primer which I love
a do we look so this was really exciting
for me too
it's like this gold color whoo-whoo I
just want to wear this
forget the foundation are you obsessed
with this product but but let's see how
it goes on with foundation so let's
start with the healthy elixir them all
one with the Beauty Blender so coming
out it seems pretty thick like it's like
staying in a glob looks great from far
away but when I get up close it looks
just like a little bit cakey just a
little bit and the reason I got it is
because think about healthy elixir and
just kind of made me think lighter or
the healthy kind of glowy look but it
definitely is like a full coverage look
so ya know next I'm just gonna do to
save time one on each side of my face
and I've got the covergirl trublend and
I've got the Revlon Colorstay the
covergirl trublend and I'll put it on
this side of my face looks a little bit
more liquidy than the previous one
so this is definitely a lighter
foundation almost like zero coverage now
we're gonna do the Revlon Colorstay oh
yeah this is runny
very runny very when is definitely my
favorite this one is like a medium
coverage definitely feels a lot moisture
right more moisturizing when once I got
the color blended I feel like it does go
very well but I do like this I think
this is my favorite so Revlon Colorstay
second favorite is the covergirl
trublend and then the last is the
healthy elixir actually one more face
products that I want to use the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi and lotion you can
either wear it on its own or you can
layer it underneath your foundation it's
gonna beat this this was really cool I
am like obsessed with that I love this
this is nice and this actually feels a
little bit more moisturizing than this
although they're both very moisturizing
this one probably wins in that that
department we're gonna apply our Revlon
Colorstay foundation I can apply with
the Beauty Blender
since this is a little bit more on the
liquid side it's soaking into my Beauty
Blender a little bit so next time I
would probably just dab on my face and
then blend it with the beady one top two
concealers here that I want to test out
under my eyes one of them is the Revlon
youth FX fill and blur and then this one
is just a Revlon Colorstay concealer but
definitely for under my eyes I'm going
to use this stuff I guess for you huh
you pump so many times and then they
just all of a sudden like shoot out well
this FYI
a lot comes out at one time holy my
heart-shaped tape and my milk concealer
automatically like stick to the creases
under my eyes but this is not settling
in the creases which is really nice one
of the products I didn't get is
translucent powder I guess I forgot so
I'm just gonna use my dermablend setting
powder to set this underneath my eyes
here's my Revlon Colorstay concealer to
just do just like my highlights I got a
couple of shades lighter in order to
contour my face so
next I'm gonna use some Rome though
L'Oreal True Match Lumi bronzer but I
noticed when I got home that it's pretty
sparkly and I'm really not a sparkly
bronzer type of person so I already had
this Neutrogena bronzer that I
absolutely love already that I'm just
gonna go ahead and use for today when I
do my nose I like to get a brush with a
double end like this and kind of draw it
on with this side and then blend it in
with this side I'm gonna grab my wet and
wild color corrector palette and I'm
gonna do my green because this is green
fixes redness and this thing is pretty
red but this is really good for what
it's supposed to be used for I don't
think it's supposed to be used for this
type of a problem this is a pretty bad
problem I've got so I'm just going to
use my concealer and just cover it up
that way but I will say the green really
I mean just like zapped away the redness
so that's awesome
there we go
this is a little too dark for me at the
moment but just give it a little blend
somehow ended up with two of the Revlon
Colorstay eyeshadow primer this is a
nude color feels like peanut butter a
few fun little shadows here I have got
two of the L'Oreal infallible eyeshadow
and they're really pretty sparkly colors
and then I thought this covergirl
vitalist healthy blue highlighter but I
always love using highlighters as
eyeshadows so we're just gonna do a
swatch see what all three of these look
like so faint and it's very very creamy
so I'm not even sure this would show up
on my eyes it might be pretty if you're
looking for like a subtle very subtle
gold tint so here they are obviously
this is the gold one the rose gold one
you can barely barely see this gold one
it's really standing out so I'm probably
gonna use that one for today and I'll
probably just dab it on like this
I don't have a shadow to go in my crease
so we are just gonna get creative and
we're gonna use our bronzer for an
eyeshadow Revlon Colorstay
liquid we're and we're gonna do a little
cat eyes so I actually love about this
L'Oreal that it doesn't go all over your
face it just stays it's and it is
pressed powder it's loose powder but it
doesn't like fly all over your cheeks so
that is extremely nice it doesn't get
caught in like the skin of my eyelid you
know how when you're using liquid
eyeliner sometimes it gets caught in the
bumps and it makes it really jagged this
just kind of goes right over that the
skin and makes it a really really smooth
thing so I love that I'm actually gonna
go in and add a little bit more shadow
underneath here thing I forgot to get
target was a brow pencil but I could be
wrong but I've used brow pencils from
every probably like five or six
different brands drugstore and high in
and I feel like they all do the same
thing it's just about finding a color
that suits you so I'm just gonna go
ahead and use my Tarte pencil we're not
gonna do much just a little touch-up
where I have just a few little patches I
don't know why I'm acting like I can do
my eyebrows from this far away from the
mirror I think I'm trying to show off so
I'm just gonna
a little bit now I'm gonna do my mascara
and I'm so debating on using this one at
the L'Oreal telescopic I've used it for
takes six years on and off and it's
probably my favorite drugstore mascara
but I'm gonna go ahead and test out a
new one today and I'm gonna do the
Revlon old cement all-in-one I really
debated I'm just pushing this on this
side and being like I'm gonna use this
one but I'm gonna test out anyone so if
this is like the shortest little nugget
of a brush I've ever seen what how do I
say since it is a shorter brush head it
is very easy to handle I don't feel like
I'm getting mascara all over my eyelids
okay I see what you're doing here so
that was a lot easier to apply than I
thought it was so I apologize for
complaining about it highlighter
somewhere am I just making ah here we go
so this is the Revlon Photoready
insta-fix highlighting stick but now I
kind of want to try this healthy glow
because that was really pretty okay
let's do it gosh so one of them is a
little bit more bronzy and the other
one's a little bit more rose gold I
think this may be a little too bronzer
you for me and what am I gonna do with
this stuff it's so pretty and if I can
being able under my eye
oh there we go we're doing it so faint
but you just kind of catch it in the
light it's really pretty
we're gonna do highlighter never good at
this so
cubone
my glowing goddess yet so for my lips I
grabbed three different colors I only
have one lipliner so we have to match to
the lipliner so will swatch I don't have
any skin left here we go it's the color
of our liner it go okay are not fall out
of my chair
hmm you know it's pretty neutral got a
little hint of like what is that new
it's called natural so we're just gonna
go with that natural have a who makes
says the color is beige babe
and are we nameless no one makes this
Maybelline so it's like a little why did
I put this swatch here a little too pink
for what I'm going for
it's Maybelline nude thrill that's the
winner right here yes ma'am you also
have revlon matte lip color pretty too
oh my gosh that smells nice so that's
that's what we're working with
I really like this revlon matte I don't
know if I like it why did I do you
decided my shirt the morning before I
started this look I used the distance
formula rose oil lip polish and it just
basically scrapped away on my dead skin
and made my lips super smooth and this
is what it looks like and even comes
with like a cute little spoon yeah I
love that little guy smells like cake so
I know it's a rose oil but it smells
like cake hmm
hmm pretty color just kind of by itself
like a good nude but we're gonna go
ahead and do what we said well this is
kind of like the color of my skin I
don't know if I like it I do is the
might mix it a little bit stop did it
that did the trick I should see my
situation I can't not find anything I'm
really loving this nude look so far it's
just very nude and neutral with a pop on
the eyes which I love I love a good like
very subtle with one thing that really
stands out whether it be your
highlighter some really long lashes
something to make your face pop but I
really love this but I'm going I got
setting spray and I can't here we go
what is this Revlon Photoready it's
actually prep and setting spray so you
spray it before and after obviously I
was trying out some other before items
so we're just gonna pop this on right
now I probably should have done it
before my eye mascara but what's
happening oh my god shooting it the
wrong way
that's just gonna kind of go about my
day
it is what time is it it is nine o'clock
in the morning so I'm gonna get back to
you guys around like 5:00 5:30 maybe
6:00 and just let you know how that
makeup feels how it looks and how it
pretty much just wore throughout the day
I feel like you can't really put makeup
to the test
unless you've worn it all day unless
you've been outside and really worn in
it and lived in it and tested it out
here is the close-up shot so you can
kind of get an idea of what it looks
like up close
everything blended really well and
everything built out nicely on top of
each other I don't think there was one
product that I didn't love off the bat
except for the two foundations that I
just like and did not love but I was I
really love the color stands probably my
favorite but I will see you guys in that
like six hours I don't know no oh my
gosh my mouth
okay I'll fix the clock but done for the
day oh my gosh it's been such a crazy
long day but I've been outside a few
times till I even like licked my face a
lot
so dog-proof this is the final look
throughout the day and everything stayed
I didn't even do any touch-ups on my
lips but we should have you can see
they're like a little chopped right now
I'm going to link all of the products
below my hair is so crazy it's been in
the high bun a low bun a ponytail down
and now back in a ponytail we had a
product lunch today so it's been like
super crazy to Starbucks runs
and a lot going on so I really put this
look to the test today haven't done make
that video in a while so this was kind
of the perfect opportunity for me to do
this so let me know if you guys want to
see more makeup looks or even like
reviews such as this one another thing
that I was impressed with was that
mascara even though I made fun of the
small brush and then it came in super
handy it didn't leave me any marks above
my eyelid which always happens to me so
and it's not even waterproof which is
cool because all throughout the day I'm
normally having to wipe and then it ends
up wiping off my eyeshadow you get it
the way who has been following me for a
while and knows how much I hate this
sweatshirt
comment below if you you're one of those
too but I look frazzled Bravo
right now I also thought today was
Friday it's Thursday what a day
so let me know in the comments below if
you guys want to see more makeup looks
or just more kind of drugstore binds
like this and building a makeup look
from them I'll let me know and we'll
keep doing 9 I'll see you guys in my
