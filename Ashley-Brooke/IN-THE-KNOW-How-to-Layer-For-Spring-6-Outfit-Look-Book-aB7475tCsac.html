channel today I'm shooting first of all
don't mind my super casualness it's
Friday so it's my bracelet shirt
casual Friday yeah I threw together some
of my favorite ways to layer for spring
one of the reasons that I love fall in
winter so much is because I get to layer
like jacket over vest over top as a
scarf and there's just something about
layering that I love so much I just
wanted to show you guys some of my
favorite ways to layer favorites your
third piece can sim easily be your
statement piece and you can kind of
rotate it you know wear the same jacket
with four different outfits and you can
make it two completely different outfits
by just having one statement piece so
that is why I love layering I love third
pieces so much because I feel like they
really play a huge part in my personal
file so I just kind of wanted to share
with you some of my favorite ways
my first layering piece is a Mattel
if metallic blazer and this is actually
a blazer dress from Topshop but I just
wear it as like an open jacket it's very
lightweight so it's you know something
that I can wear with denim shorts or
with jeans I can dress down I can dress
it up it's just a really fun piece and
it's probably one of my favorite things
that I own in my closet so with it I
paired this lace three-quarter kind of
semi cross top from Zara and I wore just
like a lace nude bra underneath but I
think there's something so pretty about
this combination it's just really girly
and pretty and obviously you could go
one of two ways you could do white wash
denim or like a denim skirt and make it
girly but I went with my black denim
skirts because I wanted to be a little
bit more edgy you can do this with some
moto boots with some flats with some
booties just kind of whatever you prefer
but this is how I chose to style it
today this is kind of what I was feeling
yeah I think this is a great piece that
you could probably wear into fall too
with some black denim so I think you
know good versatile pieces like this and
if a statement jacket is always good to
have the quinoa on my teeth
another one of my favorite sir jesus is
my who what where trenchcoat from Target
and oh my gosh I've been wearing this so
much it's a really good lightweight
piece that's long but still you can pick
it off and still have a complete outfit
you know it's not a part of your outfit
kind of you know like the blazer I
showed you before it's part of your
outfit
but this is obviously a jacket
lightweight it adds such a beautiful
color to your outfit which is why I love
it I did it with some high-waisted
ripped jeans more of a darker denim
because I just really like the dark and
the light of the camel I did this bow
back button down from Zara I love this
and I feel like I dress this up a little
bit you know with the button down a
little bit more crisp and clean but you
could definitely do a cube banty I mean
anything that you would wear without
high waisted jeans you know would be
great because the jacket isn't part of
your outfit like I said it's just
something that you're going to throw on
over do a graphic tee a basic white
t-shirt play up with your jewelry kind
of up to you but I chose this
for my next outfit I did this looks like
a snow white like an eggshell white faux
leather jacket from Zara I love this
thing almost fairly new I haven't had
this for a while and it's got benched
please and that's a three-quarter sleeve
which I love also and I love the look of
it scrunched like all the way up which
really cool gives you kind of a puffy
sleeve effect but again this could be
born as either a blazer or a jacket and
you just don't take it off it's part of
your outfit or you know if you want to
throw it on over your outfit if you're
going outside or going to work I think
this is a good peach tab the color too
so I did a little girly I did it with
this ruffles bra top and obviously some
very high waisted jeans because this is
a bra top the higher the jeans the
better that way I'm not like you know
completely pletely exposing myself now I
love this I think this top is so cute I
really like this eggshell color with
black I think this is a really good
color contrast so I did this
high-waisted jeans and I would do ankle
booties flats and mules you don't have
to like go big with your shoe if you're
doing you know such a statement piece
such as this
I see so I was so excited to do I
ordered it and I was hoping that it
would get here on time for me to put it
in this video but it is this kimono from
Zara slush robe right I was like oh
that's a cute rope and I was like um the
kimono and wear it outside the colors
are so pretty and you can do light
washed on them you can do dark denim so
if you were really wanting to summer it
up you could do whitewash or shorts even
you know that way you're not covered in
fabric I think shorts and a tank top and
this with some slides and so cute so -
cute outfit so they're really good throw
on peace for when you're needing spring
or summer colors and some print I think
this is a really good piece to throw on
and to have in your wardrobe
so my next layering piece is definitely
a little bit more obvious a little bit
more like stuff but I had to put it in
there anyways because it's one of my
favorites and it is just a denim jacket
this one is by Melrose and market from
Nordstrom Rack and I love the sky I love
the color I love the rip placement but I
pretty much throw a denim jacket over
everything and I feel like it's such a
good third piece you know it's actually
pretty warm I mean denim is a thick
material so if it's a little bit chilly
outside and I want to keep my outfit
light I will throw on a denim jacket so
I did it with a basic crop top from
forever 21 and also from forever 21
a white pleated midi skirt it's
completely changes the outfit I mean
without this without the denim jacket
it's just you know a basic old black top
and white skirt so the denim really adds
color springtime season which is why I
love my denim jacket so much so I will
link some denim JA I know this one's on
online but I will link some below so you
guys can see some of my takes on my
favors
you
so my next piece is definitely for
people who are in more of a cooler
climate it's kind of a struggle when and
I had this problem for so long that it's
springtime
and you want to wear all these cute
spring clothes but it's still 50 degrees
outside so it's like oh you know it's
like I bring my black jacket my coat out
so I just want to throw in a heavier
jacket for those of you guys who are
still in colder climate but still
springtime so I did this faux suede
jacket from Zara and I got this on sale
in the fall sale but it's really pretty
like bubblegum pink faux suede with
grommets and studs all over and I love
this guy it's all it was just basic
jeans at a white t-shirt because I feel
like this is such a statement piece that
you don't need prints or anything like
that you can do texture maybe a pretty
lace top or something if you wanted to
but I think just a white t-shirt and
layer on some cool jewelry and you're
good to go but that way you're warm and
still getting your spring effect alright
guys that is all I have for you today I
love casual Friday I'm going to start
filming every Friday so I can just throw
my solution I do have overall gone
though that are folded over so I do not
have sweat pants on I wish I did feel
like when I sweat pants on I don't do
anything I have to force myself out of
my sweatpants or else I feel that is
acceptable to just lounge and I can do
that when I have to film you know a lot
of this stuff is from last year a year
before I will link as best I can as
always that's all I have for you guys
and I will see you in my next video bye
so it's just me
take off all the room on the table
normally it's like you know Sarah Ryan
and then me and my little space but now
I'm like tuning up the whole table and
another good reason it's like too much
fixer-upper when they're here they just
widdle to the music and I want to watch
catfish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
