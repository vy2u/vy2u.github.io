episode of in the know which is a new
series that I kind of started I didn't
even tell you that I was earning but I
just kind of started so in the last
video we did it in the know how to layer
for spring and today is going to be in
the know how to mix prints for spring so
this is kind of a series that I started
just so we can discuss different topics
whether it be trims or how to do
something so it's going to be kind of
like this more like a sit-down style
talk through showing outfits so I do
have another series called series so I
do have another series called talking
trends which is where I talk about a
certain trend talking trans is more of a
trend specific series such as embroidery
waste centers and this is more of a
general and more broad range of topics
such as mixing prints and layering and
just kind of things that we all wonder
about and just need some inspiration for
your mixing prints you do want to make
sure that your top and your bottom both
aren't busy prints so you don't want to
have small stripes and small polka dot
sure that one of the prints is a little
bit more bold than the other one when
you are wanting to mix your patterns and
your prints I definitely recommend
bringing a striped top or polka dot you
know your favorite piece while you're
shopping and just kind of hold it up to
everything when I bought this skirt I
grabbed a stripe top from the rock and I
was just kind of holding it up just to
see kind of what print would go good
with what because it's really hard to
visualize in your head what it's going
to look like so I definitely recommend
holding things up in the store and
really kind of playing with it and see
what works best for you another quick
tip that I have for you hype and I don't
have an outfit with it but always go
over a blazer - there are so many great
floral prints there are so many great
floral printed blazer tracing that or
consider today there are so many great
slow Clinton's ozonated for Prince's
Blazers there
negate for instance ID card um you know
that you can definitely mix your prints
with like I saw this really gorgeous
floral blazer at Zara that I thought
would go great with the striped top so
definitely play with Blazers and jackets
and outerwear as well
the first prints of that I mixed is one
of my favorite prints to mix is stripes
and leopard with this outfit I did this
stripes
top from Lulu and my leopard junus
London shoe and just added a pair of
black culottes from hmm obviously you
can do denim you can do shorts and logon
celebra to the stripes are far enough
apart it really doesn't matter what you
put in the middle when I do mix stripes
and leopard I always make sure that the
majority of my stripes are white because
I feel like if it were opposite and you
had majority black it would get a little
too classy because there is so much
black in the shoe so you can do thin
stripes or you can do six stripes as
long as it's a bold enough print and
it's not too small I think really small
stripes kind of get lost
for my next two outfits I actually did
the same pair of pants from Zara and it
should ease stripes cropped almost like
a karate type of pants interferogram
I just realize that these are scissors
they are move then they're everywhere
right now so they're really easy to find
and easy to grab these are from Zara and
they actually come with a two piece set
but I do like to wear them as separate
so for the first outfit I did this polka
dots top also from Zara I just love
these two prints together as you can see
the stripes are very far enough apart
this is a very minimal striped bottom
obviously there is a lot going on the
top so you want to make sure that your
stripes are a little bit bigger and your
polka dots are smaller
my next outfit with the striped pants I
did this burn since its top when you
have tops like this that aren't you know
a typical print like a polka dot or a
stripe or a floral you know I think it
is really good to pair it with stripes
because I think stripes is a good
starting point when you are wanting to
mix prints spikes and polka dots but I
think mostly for me I gravitate more
towards stripes so if I'm going to mix
prints I always start with a stripes
either bottom or top and then add
something to it and you know this is
just such a random print but I thought
it went really nice because it's kind of
the same color palette it's all black
and white and again there's not so much
going on in the top so it really goes
nicely with the stripe Atum
often if one of my absolute favorite
ways probably my most favorite way to
mix prints floral and stripes started
out with this really pretty skirt from
Topshop that I got recently so it will
still be online for you guys first of
all I love bread I love ruffles and I
love skirts so this was kind of a
no-brainer for me I said before I always
gravitate towards stripes so I did this
top from hmm sister pop is obviously
very busy all of the stripes are smaller
it's nothing too bold it's very very
small stripes so when I went for the
skirt as you can see the floral print
it's a little bit more scattered I mean
there's still small flowers but it's not
such a busy cluster of prints like
there's more reds and there are actual
flowers so I knew this would be a great
match
for my last outfit I did another stripe
in floral this time I played with my
accessories and I just did a basic black
sweatshirt and black skirt it's one of
my go-to outfits
when it gets a little warmer when I'm
just running around I'll throw a sneaker
on or a sandal but I really wanted to
play with my accessories and mix my
prints up so I did my stripes back from
Zara that I pretty much carry all the
time when I'm looking for a print or
need to add a print to my outfit I know
for this one and then I just did my
Matisse floral booties so it's kind of
the same situation as the last outfit a
lot of starts going on in the bag
minimal floral prints in the boot and
the majority of the bag is why the
majority of the shoe is black so you
know like I said before when you're
wanting to mix prints just try to hold
everything up to each other
try it on you know sometimes it is hard
to visualize it sometimes even when you
you know holds it up you still can't
quite get an idea until you have it on
your body so I do recommend trying it on
trying on the whole outfit right so and
that is it for this video for the second
