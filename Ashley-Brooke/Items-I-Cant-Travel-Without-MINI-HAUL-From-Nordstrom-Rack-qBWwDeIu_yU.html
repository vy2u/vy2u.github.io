Thanksgiving I'm in my hometown in Texas
in my high-school bedroom so today you
just kind of wanted to shoot a quick
video of travel items that I cannot
travel without plus a mini Nordstrom
Rack haul that I accumulated um last
week while I was home in Texas so let's
go ahead and get started I will start on
the tech side of things and start with
my iPad Mini I've had this thing for so
long it's just really easy when I don't
want to get my computer out and actually
have like a whole set up and work this
is so much easier to just grab and go
little bigger than my iPhone way smaller
than my computer so it is definitely one
of my go-to grab things to keep with me
at all times when I'm traveling next are
my headphones my earbuds actually not my
over-the-ear headphones I like to just
kind of wrap these up and put them in my
backpack I got these from Urban
Outfitters and they are gold earbuds and
they have a speckled gold cord I don't
know if you guys can see them there by
skinny dip and skinny dip just makes the
best earbuds they're so cute they have
some with donuts some with like pizza so
you can definitely get like a fun pair
but I went with the gold because I feel
like they just go more with things
rather than the donut ones even though
not really one of the donut ones I loved
although when I got my headphones I also
got this trouble battery pack and it's
the marble print from Urban Outfitters
this thing packs in juice that is for
sure definitely recommend this I was
always hesitant to get a travel battery
because I'm like oh is it gonna charge
my sober 15 minutes and I know the
saying lasts a good few hours so I love
this guy and it's so thin so easy to
travel with so all right so I've got a
hat here I always travel with my hat
because I have a lot of crazy hair days
when I'm traveling and I feel like
travel days are always like get up and
go there really never relaxing for me
during the holidays cuz I'm always like
doing something with my
family we're always going somewhere I
think a hat is so good when I don't have
time to fix my hair
the Texas weather is so crazy and humid
so this is like my camouflage just a
quick tip when I pack my hat I put it in
my suitcase upside down and I pack
around it roll I roll out my stuff when
I pack and I roll everything around the
Hat and then stuff clothes inside the
Hat and it holds its shape really really
well so that is my little ash tip for
packing because you didn't already know
then I always have to have a backpack of
some sort this one I got from Topshop
obsessed with it
so like traveling with the backpack is
so easy because you're hands-free it's
on your back you know you can have room
you can have room for your hands to
carry your other luggage you know your
boarding pass it's just so much easier
when you have a backpack on versus
keeping up with a purse this one's small
it's not you know a normal sized
backpack it's kind of a little mini guy
the only bad thing is my laptop doesn't
fit in this so I put it in Ryan's travel
bag which I guess is a good thing
because then I don't have to carry it
smart I just put this little pom-pom on
it because I thought it was cute it also
comes in a tote and a cross body clutch
version so I will link those below as
well
Gucci vibes love it and of course a neck
pillow
this one is these things can be so
expensive because things can be like $30
this one was $7.99 from like a TJ Maxx
or something like that so you know
usually stores like that have these for
really good prices so don't pay $30 for
one because this one was $7.99 and it
was super squishy and comfy and I loved
it
and some snacks that I love traveling
with first is my skinny pop popcorn that
these things are like mostly half air
anyway so it's a good grab and go snack
keep in my bag tied to me over it's not
super heavy super easy love the stuff
next are my little mini bars buy help
warrior this one is coconut and look how
small they are they're so cute and so
small
only 110 calories they're so easy to
throw it I have like six of these in my
backpack I mean take up no room at all
Suns coming in right I hate eating with
my hands when I'm traveling because I'm
such a germaphobe and I like will not
use my hands for anything when I'm
traveling so this is good because I can
just kind of peel back the wrapper and
eat it and then not have to worry about
you know germs and whatnot next are my
beauty products that I can't Chappel
without I don't bring my whole entire
morning and night routine but I bring my
travel essentials first thing I'm going
to start with is my Neutrogena acne
stress control I've been using this
stuff for like seven years definitely
use this when I'm traveling and when my
skin is under stressful situations
because it controls my breakouts and if
I start to get one it clears it up like
that this is a mess for me nobody has
come for pimples mmm next are my key
moisturizers my morning and night
moisturizers this is my morning
moisturizer by Valencia and it is pure
glow brightening moisturizer put this in
my video yesterday to answer Q&amp;amp;A stuff
smells amazing it's like almost
energizing I can feel my skin waking up
whenever I use this it's a good primer
for my makeup so it kind of takes the
place of a primer as well it's not too
greasy or too oily it is perfect so love
this and then for my nighttime
moisturizer is my Valencia royal rose
hydrating serum and I love this because
it's a little guy so it's super easy to
travel with and I just kind of put this
on as my finishing touch after I
finished washing my face you can just
kind of feel you know when you put it on
it's so moisturizing and then you wake
up with you know still smooth skin so
obsessed with this and the sides so love
it
the last Beauty item is my Valenti up
fresh mist calming toner I use this
after I put my makeup on I feel like
it's that's my makeup closes my pores
locks everything in and this is my
finishing touch at night after I put my
my rose serum on I spray this on my face
and I can just really feel it tightening
and kind of
locking in all the moisture and it
smells really nice and feels good so I
love this stuff this almost acts as like
a rehydrate ER for your skin so if
you're feeling kind of you know like
you've been traveling all day and your
skin is kind of like doing funky things
spray this on and you just feel like
woken up and refreshed all over again we
have got two perfumes here my moogle a
angel perfume I love this stuff and this
is easy to travel with because it's a
small bottle I'm almost out of it won't
want mom good thing about this is they
have refilling stations I think it like
Macy's and Ulta that you can just refill
this without buying a whole new bottle
so that is muy bueno and then of course
my mini Balenciaga cannot travel without
this perfume I really need to get a
travel size because this bottle is too
pretty to travel with I'm afraid that's
gonna break but I love this my everyday
perfume so cannot go anywhere without
this stuff oh yeah those are a few of my
travel items that I just spit everywhere
hmm you know in the comments below what
your go-to travel items are because I'm
gonna be traveling here at the end of
the month for Christmas holiday time so
give me some tips and tricks on what you
guys do for your travel routine I'll go
ahead and get into my little Nordstrom
Rack haul I'm super excited this thing I
got were these Nike um leggings and
these are great for traveling because
they roll up really really small and
they were only like $15 I think they
were 29 and it's got a rose gold Nike
check on the leg so these are a great
color I have a lot of big black
sweatshirts that I like to workout in so
it's great to throw over this human
black as well but I got the gray the
next thing I got was this mock neck
slash not really a mock neck more of a
turtleneck kind of layering shirt and it
was $15 the brand is 14th and Union and
I think it's just good for layering or
we're in by itself because it's actually
not see-through which so hard to find a
good cream basic shirt that's not
see-through it's a great color it's not
too cream not too white kind of a good
balance in between do we have this
gold bag by du Loup lux I am I can't
read but it is just a cracked gold in a
patterned bag I love this oh look how
cute it's got little doggie inside I
love that may see that that's so cute I
just thought it was a good little basic
for when I need a metallic bag which is
always and it was quite the markdown I
think this was like $70 and I got it for
12 so this was a really good find and
it's small enough that I can just you
know put my essentials in and be on the
go like that it has black in it it's not
too in-your-face metallic you know it's
got like a little texture print little
black so I got these French Connection
reversible earrings and I was so excited
to find these because I've been looking
for a good pair of reversible earrings
and I like that one side is matte and
one side is more of a shiny gold so so
excited I found these these worth $38
and I found them for I believe they were
$5.99
so this was a no-brainer for me I was
really excited to buy these next we have
this gold skirt oh I love this so much I
was going to that interior design
fashion show the night that I got there
and I was kind of panicking because I
didn't have anything to wear so that's
why I went to Nordstrom Rack in the
first place and I found this gold skirt
this is I believe originally over $100
and I bought it for 12 like 12 or 15
dollars it'll post a photo of me wearing
it right here so you can see what it was
I just paired it with a simple black
mock neck I feel like it didn't need a
whole lot black Chanel black booties
it's got a slit and it is by soprano and
I got a size extra small so I hope I can
find this somewhere for you guys because
it is like really good for the holiday
season for work parties or any kind of
holiday party you have I think this is a
good option and next I got my rose gold
water bottle that I have
in like carrying with me non-stop
everyone's always like why is your
waddle so big and I'm like cuz I drink a
lot Oh got me the rose gold one and I
got Ryan a black one
you were only 14 dollars they are not
ice well a lot of you guys are asking me
who makes it and I'm not sure because I
ripped the packaging off and there's no
label anywhere it was more of a matte
one but they had some really like
metallic e shiny looking one correct
terminology I feel like it's no this is
like a start of the price of a big SWA
bottle I think my big sell bottle was
like $45 this one was 14 so love it and
I actually put cold water in this last
night and then when I woke up this
morning it was still like ice cold so
serves its purpose but a great gifting
item this is like such a great gift for
holiday time so that reminds me I need
to make a gift guide right I need to do
that I'm gonna do that is it for this
mini haul slash items I can't travel up
without I don't know I wanted to do both
video so I was like well why not just
make them into one video like a little
two-parter so those of you obsessed with
