throughout
morning guys so I just woke up Ryan's at
the gym I'm going to go down to sink
coffee and I'm going to get a nice
coffee
I often to get us a new bag of love ops
not coffee because I knocked ours over
yesterday and spilled it so when I get
back I'm going to try on my stuff from
thredUP I'm so excited
ask you guys in the last vlog if you've
ever you start up and a lot of you
actually have so that was good to know
so clear coffee
let's try and live so now that we got
our causing it it tells me that I am not
the only one who accumulates this

always have this giant pile right it's
going to be put away this weekend it's
happening happening really quickly
before I grab this it's the red up a
disc Foster's as part of the video I
just thought it was a good partnership I
love saving money on clothes I love
consignment shopping here in the city so
I thought well why not do some
consignment shopping online here we go
super cute packaging so look at all
these prints that I got I'm so excited
I'll dive into this box I totally forgot
why I ordered I know when you order a
few things online you completely forget
what you ordered until you open the box
it's like a surprise all over again
I got in this top from Free People how
gorgeous is this prayer weight look how
this matches my nails right now so
I got and this off-the-shoulder little
smoke dress by aqua and I just thought
the print what's really cool after it is
really frilly and roughly and girly and
I just thought for spring and summer
this is such a nice little throw one
dress one of those easy pieces to have
next I got this from ASOS just off the
color was so beautiful I haven't really
uh anything seafoam green and a long
time really oversized flowy bell sleeve
top you know I like how simple it is
there is no embroidery there's no
hardware it's just like a beautiful
flowy top totally forgot about this I'm
so excited this is a velvet studded vest
and this is actually from Zara and look
at the back you guys know I love wood
things carry over to the back and it's
in such a good shape you know all the
beads are still intact everything is so
good alright
all right so that is my little bread up
haul for you guys

this partnership happen this was really
cool actually give me your eyes 40% off
of your first order so I will put the
link and the code below so you guys
don't want to miss that because it's
already super marked down prices so if
we're ready percent off on top of that

they're like new though I feel like I
just got brand-new item when it's things
that aren't in store right now it's
things that our previously owned so kind
of like by getting you know cool vintage

basically just signed up and I could
search by size by brand by what the item
was like if I wanted a vest or if I
wanted leggings if I wanted a dress it
was just so easy to maneuver through
