filthy animal good morning guys so scary
scary news this morning sure most of you
heard because some people already
sending me messages by it
there was a suicide bomber a pipe bomb
went off three avenues down from my
apartment so that is really really scary
and I'm so happy that no one was killed
such a crazy crazy world so yeah we've
been kind of watching the news all
morning and just kind of keep an eye out
we can see it from our apartment it's
just it's insane there is police and
fire trucks and ambulances and just kind
of crazy all over the place so very
scary but I am headed to Topshop right
now I have a personal shopping
appointment that they've kind of set up
for me so that's really cool um so I'm
gonna pick out an outfit and then I'm
going to shoot that outfit for a blog
post so it's really cool I'm going down
to Soho I'm not going to the one on
fifth just because I like the one on so
hoe better I can find more things in
store and I just like the layout a lot
better so that's where I'm going I will
head over to the mirror and show you
what I'm wearing alright so I am wearing
my black faux leather Baker boy hat my
black baby doll top my side snap jeans
light wash my fishnet ankle socks and my
moto boots and then my little leopard
bag just to give myself a little bit of
print and then it's so cold outside I
think it's in the 20s so so I will do my
puffer coat obviously my dog she's
crying he knows something
my family would live by my family nice
watch love you both hey mom's gone
something else that I needed to do and
Soho I just can't think of what it is ah
don't you hate that
wraps up here at Topshop and now I'm
gonna go to brandy melville these it's
right across the street and most comfy
t-shirt in the world so have it
security guard totally talked me into
getting two things
I left my keys at home Ryan's at the gym
so he has to come down and get me and
let me up all right Ryan were you done
with your workout at least almost oh
yeah you got to go back to I'm sorry I
left him in such a hurry that I forgot
my keys
Daniel let me up here next a house here
wait that's okay I just got home and I
made some oatmeal
I've got oats cinnamon granola and
bananas and some dried cherries so I'm
going to finish log list because it is
way too late for vlogmas it is too like
almost two o'clock so I'm gonna do this
blocking this out see you guys later
I have been cleaning this apartment from
ceiling to floor because since Ryan's
parents were here we were like going
going going you know coming home
changing going out to dinner coming back
so there were just clothes thrown
everywhere I'm sure you guys know that
I'm talking about when you have guests
and you're constantly like doing stuff
so I just cleaned everything's great
I got the couch blanket on for Stella
there she is
dilemma right now is what's for dinner
where's Ryan you want burgers you seems
like right Brian we don't even have the
tree plugged in right now I am it seems
to warm burgers so that might be just
what's gonna have to happen yeah I'm
kind of craving a burger too cuz I had
like a quinoa bowl last night and salad
so yeah we'll do burgers
what's for dinner
what's for dinner
those are dinner Col that's for
Christmas just get your jokes right
garden-variety
oh nice nice nice nice Hey Hey look of
shame look of shame look of shame way to
go way to go she's gonna lick that up
it's not good for dogs I know you should
have done that no no I'm good I'm good
guy document this for later when you
realize what you've done you should get
up like no we're gonna hips throw No hey
wait I got a question for you what just
it's very profound it it's very
important and you answer this is honest
as possible okay how does it feel to be
a think vegan and a bad mom I just
cleaned this whole entire apartment so
good for like two hours and that's the
that's the attitude I get from you what
you mean like jovial excitement with
some zest of comedy
you know what any of that means I do it
sounds like the explanation of a coffee
box from a cheap beans and Tony
it's an inside joke sorry guys I can't
if you're in Texas good h-e-b and read
the explanations of the cafe au lait
cured coffees Mike tastes like a warm
magical winter's evening with just a bit
of jealousy but just a bit of jealousy
and a hint of macadamia fruit powder
it's true the most ridiculous
descriptions ever I do like provolone
pretty good problems dope bro but I miss
all right I need a new port say say do
you like cheese why yes I do my
favourites Gouda tell me more about how
you cleaned the whole apartment and why
did it take you two hours when it's like
a 15-minute job
she's like as big as your upper half I
know
so my cleaning routine I didn't film it
because it's probably like the most
boring thing I could ever do but I
basically pick everything up and put it
in its own room so like if something
goes in the bedroom I just go throw it
in the bed and then I clean I get
everything in the room it's supposed to
be and then I go through and clean ruin
my room and put everything away
then I clean like the surface areas and
then lastly I do the floors two hours
huh okay this is fuel on your sandwich
your main solar go ahead she has
barbeque sauce in her ears because well
no because I wouldn't help her because
you dropped a fork full of barbecue
sauce you're on another level tonight I
mean I live my life on another level do
you guys see what I deal with with Brian
I hate you baby
I think arm is great you know Ryan was
being rude to me earlier he thought I
was being super funny and giving me a
hard time
well he just threw his keys in the trash
chute hey what happened what happened
long ago your business what happened
yeah you did you never throw trash down
the chute while your keys in the same
hand I think any non rookie would know
that all you people out there with
trophies I ran downstairs because in my
head I'm thinking they're just gonna be
right on top of the dumpster that
catches all the trash so just tell I
talked to the tour guys and they're like
no it's a huge machine like the present
room that's a compactor and there's a
door on it and that's how you can get
into it if needed be so there is no like
oh I can reach the top of it by going on
the top so I'm pretty much never gonna
see those keys again and I'm gonna need
to get key fob mail key new apartment
key new house back at Texas key what
else is on there milky milky I said that
we're on the mindset that I could just
like go in and they'd be on top well and
if it makes you feel any better I threw
my keys away with my lunch Earl last
year if you don't remember I do remember
that mm-hmm so I was trading dummies but
bright side of it I'm about to eat a
badass dinner and we still have a home
and you have a set of keys and yeah I
think you're still good wait
wow we're talking just in general about
things can we just talk about the
walking dead last night how did we go
from like Ryan's terrible evening to the
walk because both things are terrible
it's true if you haven't watched the
episode yet we're not gonna ruin it yeah
nobody any spoilers what do we got here
right
you go to bars it go slim in mint
chocolate mint toasted coconut butter
chocolate peanut butter these lesser
protein the holy frickin Frick yeah
these are Ryan's favorite never heard of
we're gonna test these out you never
tried this before go hop in the shower
but first I just wanted to show you guys
what I've been using to take off my
makeup I used to use Vaseline and then a
lot of you guys told me that that wasn't
great for your eyes because it has
petroleum in it which is really
disturbing once you like really think
about it I'm using a cleansing oil
instead and I really love this brand I
actually when I was at Sephora the other
day I bought a few things from this
brand and I really really love it I've
been using to take off my makeup I
basically like before I get in the
shower
I will rub it all over my face and then
hop in and it literally just takes
everything off so I just get a wet wash
rag and it just rips everything stuff
holy craving a protein bowl smoothie
Bowl so what I did was strawberry banana
ice since I ran out of strawberries
I had like two strawberries I did a half
a pack of acai frozen acai and then
those the acai packs have so much sugar
in them so I really only tried to do a
little less than half a little bit of
cashew butter and since I was already
just going downhill I did a chocolate
brownie
lera bar so all right so to give it a
little bit of a crunch I am doing some
granola pumpkin cinnamon that's probably
not gonna be very good so just add a
little more sugar to the mix find this
Monday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
