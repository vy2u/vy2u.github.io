Angel Tree Foundation which is basically
a foundation where people get together
and buy presents for families who aren't
fortunate enough to have you know
multiple gifts under the tree so we are
out delivering right now we've got
everyone in the car and this one's
really not respecting space she just
kind of goes where she pleases
is only going a couple of miles so don't
worry that we're sharing the front seat
we just got done delivering and I'm so
glad I got to do that quite an
experience
finnaly makes you happy to get back to
others and grateful for things that you
have welcomed to Corpus Christi Texas my
sister's house I would vlog anything
today because I've been pretty hungover
so we drove three hours to Corpus today
and we just got here
to see my sister her husband and my two
nieces before I'm going oh we're gonna
see them and the little dog boomer
z'ha'dum it's Ashley's subscribers you

either sin' wants thing
I guess he's sing oh I'm excited sing is
gonna be so good all right yes me
cambree Maggie have sat down to do our
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A have you and Ryan ever
spent Christmas together I think we
spent like last year yeah but we usually
part ways and but Christmas with our
family so where is your black hat from
that you always wear forever 21 what's
your favorite store to find unique
pieces oh my gosh there are so many cute
little stores and so he'll though many
cute little vintage
stores and there's just always something
different every time you go in breathing
from like vintage Chanel bags to even
like vintage fan t-shirts in Italy any
of those little hole-in-the-wall stores
are like the best scenes are you guys
planning to move somewhere else would
you raise your child somewhere else yeah
I mean I think eventually we would
probably move back to Texas at some
point it's not something we talk about
but I'm just speaking for Ryan mr.
Bingley would probably yeah yeah yeah
yeah I thought about creating your own
clothing brand please something good to
come in 2017 it's something that I've
been talking about you know I have like
my her who did those exclusive tops and
we're about to launch our sunglasses so
something's probably gonna stem from
that at some point very soon so stay
tuned do you get any looks or treated
any different in your hometown since you
moved so far away but also to New York
State
no I pretty much grew up here and people
that I know still treat me the same no
matter what so what is your ambition and
life you have the most inspiring vlogs
on YouTube hugs from Norway it's to just
be happy and be able to do what makes me
happy and helping and picking up others
along the way and kind of spread
inspiration and motivation your best
tips on taking photos in public without
feeling weird and awkward I mean don't
try to hide it because I feel like that
makes it even more awkward when you try
to hide that you're filming or taking a
picture just do it and don't try to hide
it because people don't know what you're
doing it took me forever it's just build
myself and pop life without feeling like
an idiot hi Maliha hi Louis can we
expect from you in 2017 any
collaborations with other youtubers more
series on my YouTube more blogs
hopefully some collaborations I don't
really have any in line right now but
that's something that I would definitely
love to do we're going to miss you I
love your vlogmas
I'm gonna miss vlogging everyday and
Ryan and I have been talking about
things so the statement for vlog news
what do you recommend for someone
wanting to start a fashion YouTube
channel just doing it planning out your
content and knowing what you want your
channel to be about just doing it like
before I started my channel it took me
months to actually just do it and I'm so
mad because those could have been months
that I spent actually having a channel
so my best advice to you is to plan out
your first five videos film them and
then release them every week and stay
consistent consistency is key Dana wants
to know what my first ever job was I was
a well I was a lifeguard all through
high school but I was a part-time sales
associate at Juicy Couture
well you continue of vlogging everyday
yes please I definitely would like I
don't know I don't want to talk about
this about Ryan here
but cambrie and I are home alone right
now just FYI
mm-hmm we're about to go upload a vlog
miss you okay yes and then we're gonna
come back and just kind of hang out I
feel bad because since I left New York I
feel like vlogmas has been so boring
because I'm really not doing anything so
Jay just sent me a video wanting to know
how I am motivated to go to the gym all
the time and eat healthy you know my
biggest tip for eating healthy most of
the time is just to not stock junk food
in your cabinet and in your refrigerator
because if it's not there you won't be
tempted to eat it so no junk snacks
nothing like that or snacks I pretty
much stock like hummus and carrots lots
of fruits and vegetables or this little
pea like salt thingies I don't know what
I just said but I think that's our real
thing tonight a sucker's can you stop
calling me up stop calling me out evarin
I pretty much think anyone gets a pass
during holidays as forgetting the
motivation to work out every day is
just kind of a routine that I have in my
life to where at this point I've been
going to the gym you know like four to
five days a week for so long that it
almost feels weird when I don't go like
I don't even think about it I'm just
like okay like I put it into my schedule
I put it into my routine that way it's
there to stay and I block out are they
working at home I have to be in a
routine or else I get sidetracked so
just going to the gym is part of my
routine it's part of my schedule it's
actually in my calendar go to a gym so
if you just make yourself go every day
for a couple of weeks it'll just be a
normal thing to you
what is your Spotify username I have no
clue okay this is my task for the rest
of the evening is to get on my Spotify
and create cuz all I have are songs
right now that are just kind of
scattered all over the place I'm gonna
create playlists for the gym etc and
then I'm going to is it etc or etc know
what that word and then I'm gonna send
you guys my username in the next vlog
because I have no idea we're closing the
Q&amp;amp;A
we're gonna go upload the video we're
gonna go to the library just up so I
keep forgetting about Maggie because she
blends in with the clothes that are boys
can you spot Maggie I see a little
eyeball hi now you see her now you don't
all right so
cambree and i are going to cambrian are
going to the library to upload a couple
of videos to my channel and hang out
there for a little bit then we're gonna
come home

after seen singing it was so good so
good hey but I think that's where I'm
gonna end this for now and this is the
end of vlogmas day end of vlogmas nope
nope nope
say bye vlogmas by vlogmas the library
and i have a few more questions while my
video uploads misty wants to know what
was your most memorable day in 2016 I
would probably have to say the day that
I quit my job kind of when this whole
new chapter of my life started so that
was really exciting do you still do blip
fillers and other work or do you keep it
on that Terrell the only thing I've ever
had done is lip fillers and I had those
done about three years ago
and I haven't had them done since but I
was happy with the results so not saying
that I would never do it again
what lipstick are you using gone gray by
Maybelline what shrink to you order at
Starbucks when it's a hot drink i order
a soy vanilla latte with one pump of
vanilla when I get an iced drink I get
an iced soy latte with one pump of
talking us I'm gonna answer a few more
questions but my phone died because
that's just how today's been thank you
guys you're gonna like it how to style
video that goes live tomorrow what do
you have in your thermos hot chocolate
why are you repeating what make mini hot
chocolate with marshmallow sitting there
drinking a water so on the way home
cambree and I decided we wanted to be
so we're gonna get on Pinterest and
we're gonna try to find something after
some very intense research on Pinterest
we decided that we would make dirt cake
let's go quit gum you are
I haven't had dirt cake since I was like
a little kid
cambree swears she had it last year
maybe two years maybe two years so okay
I think all of you who don't know what
dirt cake is dark cake is made to look
like dirt and then you put gummy worms
in it but it's like an Oreo refrigerated
we are gonna watch home alone we just
put it on and we're gonna make our dirt
cake with worm it's not dirt cake in
your arms in it
okay we are done filming all four
outfits are shots and all I want to do
I'm so cold all I want to do is let my
sweat pants on take my makeup off
and eat a corn - Hagen he just ordered
corndogs so we're gonna go pick them up
and call it a day
wrap Christmas presents because the
twins are gone with dad they would to go
eat and do some other things so we're
gonna enjoy some peace and quiet and
