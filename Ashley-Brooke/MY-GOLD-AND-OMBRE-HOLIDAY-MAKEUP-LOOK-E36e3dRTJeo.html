you are new here welcome this is in
partnership with Ulta to bring you a my
one of my favorite go-to holiday makeup
looks it comes to the holidays I
definitely like to play with my makeup a
little more than I normally would I'm
usually just like a very basic you know
mascara and brows and a little bit of
powder kind of girl so holiday time is
like dress-up time for my face my
favorite go-to holiday look is
definitely what I've created now what
I'm gonna show you in the video some
people like you know lots of glitter and
some people like you know no liner put
false lashes so we all have our own
little love's when it comes to holiday
makeup and this is definitely my
favorite way to do my holiday makeup I
love an ombre lip a bold ombre lip I
love a winged liner a little bit of
highlighter and a subtle but yet I
catching an eye shadow so that is
exactly what I'm gonna show you today a
little a little getting off of a cold
right now a little under the weather so
my voice is kind of scratchy and I'll
probably be coughing and sniffling this
whole time so I apologize in advance for
that I'm gonna start out using first I'm
gonna clip my hair back I'll be using
urban decay complexion primer and I love
this because it has SPF in it and it
also gives me more of like a smoothing
matte finish from my foundation I'm
gonna be using what I always use my
dermablend smooth liquid camo and I
always mix the color camel and cream
just depending on my tan my tanning
stuff on my face it's kind of nice
because I can just make my own
my dark circles are a little darker than
normal since I've been a little sick I
haven't been getting much sleep the
Bekaa ultimate coverage concealer is
like Photoshop for your dark circles
I've been using this concealer on and
off for a few years now and I really
love it really thick but it's great for
if you had kind of a rough night you
didn't sleep well this will cover up
anything I find it helpful if I blend
this with my finger and about the warmth
of my skin tone I mean my my skin just
kind of melts it and blends it a little
bit easier than any brush wood and
immediately after dabbing this I'm going
to get my dermablend loose setting
powder with the Beauty Blender and then
just kind of let it sit under there
because my creases crease up after like
two seconds of putting all my concealer
I'm just gonna contour it with my hoola
bronzing stick love this stick because
it really blends well and it goes on
nice and
concealer stick and I'm just gonna kind
of line underneath my contour here here
and down my nose to contour with this
stick because it blends really really
well
for my brows I'm going to be using the
tarte amazonian clay in medium brown
I've been using this forever and it is
definitely my go-to I have the pencil as
well for when I'm in a hurry but when I
want to create when I have an all-day
lasting all day look I use
I just created I'm just gonna switch
over here and kind of just create
exactly what I did here using the
tartlet toasted palette has so many
really great holiday colors in it as
well as everyday color so that's why I
love this palette start out by using the
colors s'mores because I feel like that
just kind of gives my eyelid a level
playing field if any discoloration you
have will just kind of disappear and
everything will be one color
shimmering skin perfecter highlighter in
the color opal and I'm just going to
highlight underneath my brow bone I'm
just gonna be using Stila all-day liner
and I love this because it literally
just draws on like a pencil and it
really does stable using a mascara or a
liner on my lower lid I am just going to
use the sunset color and just kind of
dab a little bit underneath and then I'm
gonna go back over it with candles so it
has like a light shimmer to it I'm using
the Tarte gifted been using this forever
it is my absolute favorite favorite Holy
Grail
finish it off of my face I'm going to do
my cheeks now going to use tarte blush
in the color sensual because it is a
very light color I'm gonna do drops on
my cheek so wiped up I'm gonna make sure
that I keep my blush as light as
possible using be a cover FX custom
enhancer drops for a little shimmer
action on my cheek I like to put this on
by doing a little drop on my Beauty
Blender here doing a little dab a little
bit of rosy color it's almost like a
rose gold copper I like to just kind of
dab over it with my Becca opal
highlighter and it really creates the
color that I'm going
where my lips I'm gonna create an ombre
look because like I said I think like a
good cat eye subtle gold shadow and then
a bold arm bright lip is really more of
my style for like a holiday look I don't
like to go super over-the-top but still
you know play with my makeup make it fun
for the holidays I am using Milania
color statement lip liner in the color
number 12 I'm just gonna line my lips
and I'm actually gonna go into my lip a
little bit more than I normally would so
I can create the ombre effect
you can see I just shaded in almost all
of my lip but then I left like a little
bit in the center or so that's
definitely how you want to start with
that to create the actual ombre effect
I'm gonna use the Stila what are these
calls these are really creamy and great
stay all day matte and this is the color
jolie so when you're doing an ombre lip
you always want to make sure that you've
got two pretty different colors and then
you can always just kind of blend them
in in the middle but make sure they're
kind of in the same color family
here is the finished look I've got my
ombre lip I've got my gold gold subtle
eyeshadow and then a little bit of
shimmer on my cheek so this is
definitely my kind of holiday look I
really hope you love this makeup
tutorial I don't do makeup tutorials
often but I really really enjoyed doing
them when I do do them because it's kind
of a cool way it's kind of like putting
an outfit together you know you're
mixing colors and textures and tones so
I really enjoyed this don't forget to go
