weirdest hair line in the world I have
like your memory as I
are you kidding you look so small in the
camera
so it is Friday and yesterday the
lookbook went live we have been working
our buns off getting that ready and out
and it is out and it's so good
listen so we got back from Florida a few
days ago and we were stuck at the
airport for nine and a half hours it was
such a nightmare JFK has one working
runway on to wait 9 and a half hours it
was love
I'm nightmare but we're back and we
actually leave for Vegas in a few days
on Sunday I am client has like a trade
show or something on an hour probably to
get more information before I start
talking about it but I'm just going to
tag along we're just I don't really know
what we're doing today we're just kind
of hanging out today recovering from the
lookbook
kind of getting a game plan we have a
Content meeting later today yes but we
are doing a giveaway I've gotten so much
stuff lately and I need to find it a
good home so I'm going to do a giveaway
I'll show you I have to be quiet no
constraints on us calls the client I've
got like backpack full of stuff and then
I'm box full of stuff and
another box full of stuff so we get back
from Vegas next Thursday so whenever we
get back we're going to go through all
of it and just depending on how much
stuff there is we're going to do either
one giveaway or two but we'll decide
when we get back so stay tuned for that
not really sure how a giveaway works or
what I'm supposed to do so I'm probably
enough to figure that out and then we'll
do the giveaway I have been trying out
this fashion-based subscription box
called lid taupe cuz I love subscription
boxes but I have never really found like
a fashion based one that you can kind of
customize yourself but get your items in
the mail and you get to keep them for
however long you want and then you spin
back what you don't want when you're
ready for a new tote if you fall in love
with some of the pieces you can actually
keep them and buy them for like up to 54
comments super discounted price so it's
kind of like renting clothes and then
setting the back of them getting a new
box i customized my tote and I just got
it and I'm so excited so I'm going to go
grab it so I guess this is your when
you're ready to mail it back got like
the shipping label and all of that on it
so it's super UV
pretty much like Susan of course I'm
excited about these and I got these
three people work out guess they thought
mesh paneling down the side and thought
is this blank NYC embroidered jacket
these little ear jackets they're rose
gold and then I got this chain as well
which I love it so let's hope is
actually an offer you is 50% off of your
first month which is really cool so I
will put the link below for you to click
on it'll take you straight through the
night I'm going to go get some packages
