we are doing another favorites video
this time we are doing may favorites hey
it's almost over so I just thought I
would share with you guys some things
that I have been absolutely loving this
month and can't put down a little bit of
everything today we've got some skin
care hair perfume makeup fashion home
you know I always like to throw a little
home trinket in there so we'll go ahead
get started with skincare this product
I'm gonna show you is the Philips visa
pure advance I actually showed you guys
this on my ends of stories the other day
and I got so mediums like what is that
so I'm really happy to have partnered up
with Philips to show you guys this
product it has three different heads on
it this one is the deep pore cleanse and
this is what I've use in the shower
every night after I wash my face it
really helps to get all of the dirt and
oil out to make your skin look a little
bit more radiant this is the
revitalizing massage head I use this one
in the morning time it really helps deep
puff my skin because it gives my muscles
a little bit of a massage and then this
one is the precision cleanse and this is
for around your nose around your mouth
or your horse appear a little bit bigger
and your blackheads are a little bit
bigger and there's more of them there so
this is perfect for that and I use this
one like twice a week I don't use this
one every day I think I love about this
is that it helps your creams and your
moisturizers sink in a little better it
helps your skin to absorb all of the
oils and the creams so I do use it on my
face and on my neck because I do go down
my neck with my moisturizer does have
head recognition which allows the handle
to know which pad you're putting on that
way it's kind of tailored to fit your
needs of whatever had you're going to be
using I'm not a big user of moisturizers
I'm Mormon
user so I can really feel a difference
when I use this at night and I put my
oils on I wake up in my face like my
oils have sunk something into my skin I
just I don't have oils so kind of
sitting surface level I can feel it
really in my skin and my skin is smooth
without being oily still in the morning
so that's a plus for me or more
information just head over to Philips
calm and that is where you will find
this product the link will be in the
description box but moving on to skin
hair speaking of oil this is my favorite
oil right now it is the drunk elephant
luxury face oil had a sample from
Sephora and we would like fighting over
who was getting the last drop so
full-size bottle it is now we have to
fight over it anymore but it is probably
one of the best oils I've ever used this
one and the BIOS on for skin I guess it
is the multi-use oil in the scent and
grapefruit and Jasmine enriched with
apricot oil and sweet almond oil and I
always drop a little bit of this in my
back and I just feel like it makes my
bathroom smell nice it makes my skin
smell nice and makes my skin feel really
moisturized not too oily or slick just
like the perfect amount of moisture and
I do put it on my nails if I am painting
my nails or my cuticles are getting
gross I will put a little bit of this
around my nail before I go to bed at
night and I usually wake up and like you
know that dry skin that you hear right
here is usually gone by morning next
moving on to hair care and I know I've
showed you guys my olaplex before but I
posted this
my incest story a while back and I got
so many dams about it I think if it
really works and I am just here to say
that this changed my hair completely
especially if you guys color your hair
this is a must-have product
I know it's expensive for the size that
it is but if you're really looking for a
solution to dry damaged color treated
hair this is your new best friend so I
like the fourth bottle of this and buy
my probably like the middle of my first
bottle I could already see and notice a
little difference so give it a little
bit it's not gonna you know show major
difference after the first use but just
give it until the mid bottle and you
should be good you should see a
difference I believe I've showed you
before is my living proof nourishing oil
and this is my probably second or third
bottle of this but you only need
probably I mean like a fingernail size
dab and it covers like your ends and
your root like up here that's where I
normally put it on a huge difference if
I don't use that like when I went on
vacation last time I forgot this and I
had to wash and dry my hair and I was
like what is going on then I was like oh
my god I didn't use my nourishing oil so
if you have frizzy hair if you suffer
from frizzy hair in the summertime when
it gets humid definitely give this a
shot it's the way memory mist and it
pretty much is what it says it is it's
the memory mist so I blow-dry my hair I
spray this on I do my waves and it
almost just makes my hair it almost acts
as a hairspray but without that crunchy
texture like I put it in this morning
before I curled my hair and my hair is
still super soft I didn't even feel it
in my hair but when I wake up in the
my curls will still be intact bonus it
is the heat protectant as well so that's
always good news when you can combine
two things in one I have two cents to
show you the first one is my replica
lazy Sunday morning I had so many
compliments on this scent and I hate
floral scents I hate floral perfume I
love like the little candles but for
some reason floral perfume I just cannot
do it gives me a headache but this one
is the only thing that I can do it is
probably one of my like top 3 favorite
reviews that I've ever owned so I love
this and it stays on all day long when
it's my velocity a you perfume and it is
the complete opposite of this guy this
one is very spicy and I just can't
explain it it's so funny because when
you spray it on the scent changes
throughout the whole entire day and I
know when Caroline was here last we both
sprayed it on and it smelled ompletely
different on our skins so it really kind
of like molds to your skin it's really
cool so if you guys are looking for a
new perfume and you like spicy
definitely give this one a try next we
will move on to beauty I'm going to show
you my wet and wild dewy primer I mean
this stuff is so amazing
I sometimes just wear this by yourself
because it really gives you a do we
really dewy glowy skin I don't know if
you can really see it but next time you
guys are at like Target
definitely
can you test it I do I always test the
makeup at Target when I'm not supposed
to but I always find one that's already
open so I'm like okay someone else did
that's what I'm just gonna tap should be
admitting them gonna get so much
but yeah this is a great primer to have
if you like moisturizing do me a glowy
can wear it by itself you can put your
foundation over it and it still gives
you that like really dewy look so
can I say do it one more time okay I
have vilest healthy glow whoo and that
help makes this no no I'm like L'Oreal
makes it or Maybelline I don't know but
anyways it's what I'm wearing on my eyes
right now it's just a gold multi-use
clay put it sometimes on my cheeks I
sometimes put it on my eyebrow pigment
it it stays on all day long they come in
different colors as well I know they
have like a pink pinkish color I know
they have silver champagne but this is
the like very gold gold one
speaking of glowy is my revlon
highlighter and I have tried probably
eight different brands of highlighter
I just can't find one that works for me
I always end up looking like I'm
sweating and that's not a good look
for anybody only highlighter that I have
found that I absolutely love and I'm
actually wearing it today I'm wearing it
on my chin and my Cupid's bow and my
cheeks and also dot mean I was a little
bit I don't want to look like i'm
wearing highlighter i just want to have
that like glow without the look
and this is exactly what it gets me it
just kind of catches in the light every
matte women looks kind of crazy there
but I do blend it in I don't just like
streak it on but once you blend it it's
really nice this is the color 210 gold
light is lip color and I'm just gonna
start out with the liner that I use and
it is the Rimmel London 0 for 9
natural just this really pretty kind of
nude nudie natural color red I like to
layer either one of these two news this
one is by L'Oreal and it's called
fairest nude it's pretty much just like
a nude color with a little bit of like a
rose tent either layer this is what I
have this what I'm wearing right now I'm
wearing that liner that lipstick and
then over it I just added a little bit
of Maybelline nude thrill and it's a
very very nude color layered that over
it just to give it like a more nude look
really this one you can layer it over
almost any lipstick to lighten it up a
little bit and make it look a little bit
more nude so I hardly ever wear this one
by itself I always like to mix it it's
moving on to fashion well I guess I'll
do these so these are my sticky boobs
from Victoria's Secret and I'm pretty
sure now that I'm showing you I've
showed you guys these before because it
has the nipple things where you don't
rip your nipple off when you take it off
but I know that Victoria Secret
discontinued these and I could cry just
knowing that but I know like one more
house and target has them Ricky Sally's
like everywhere carries them but what a
lot of people don't know is that you can
just wash these and reuse them someone
was like I always have to throw them
away after 3 uses I'm like no you just
wash them with soap and water and the
sticky part comes back for awesome for
when you're wearing a top you know when
I'm bra showing or if you're just really
comfortable when you don't want to wear
a bra I love these and
push your boobs together it's my Chanel
bag which I never showed you guys
I like bought it for my birthday and
then just pretended like it didn't
happen
I just forgot to show you so this is
what it looks like it's just black no
shiny you know Falacci logo it's just
stitching logo which I love and then it
has this really pretty tassel on the
side has this gold changed to basic gold
chain which I've never seen before I'm
Chanel bag I mean I'm sure it exists
that I've just never seen it before so I
really loved the simplicity of this gold
chain I have two of shoe styles that
I've been loving for spring so far and
the first one is like woven and platform
so I've got a flat form here by Franco
sorrow and then I've got a platform
sandal by Kenneth Cole and I just think
this is like the perfect Springs of
summer shoes and kind of brightens up
any outfit even though these are black
leather this really bright brightens
things up and makes it a little less
harsh even though it's black style of
shoe I have is a mule and I love these
there's this link snakeskin print I just
think these are so cool and this will
also carry me into fall as well it's
still a little chilly here in the city
so I'm kind of I'm not ready for an open
to it I don't think I want open toe all
year which I'm just not ready because
well I mean it penny
I love shoe I think it's cool I think
it's um trendy and these do go with a
lot of things you have one more bag to
show you and it is this one from Urban
Outfitters
it's woven it's really thick too it's
not like a flimsy bag it's pretty thick
with these wooden handles and just
carrying it around the store people
we're like where did you pick that up so
I mean everyone was loving men the color
scheme is so pretty I just think it's
like the perfect little grab and go
spring in the summer tote bag and next
item I have I'm I love it and I'm going
to show you but I'm really mad at the
company so I'm gonna tell you why though
but if this thing for myself and I'm
obsessed with it it's got my initials on
it great for traveling and holds my iPad
but it also has compartments in it for
just like all of your little stuff so
you don't need to carry a big purse it's
great for work but I ordered these as
Christmas present I got one for Ryan's
mom I got one for my mom and whenever I
ordered Brian's mom black one it said
will ship out and read it by business
days as soon as I ordered it three days
later I got an email saying okay your
order your items on backorder and it
won't be delivered until February and
I'm like oh my god it literally says on
the page delivered in three to five
business isn't happening to mine as well
which I didn't care because it was just
for myself it wasn't a gift but mine
ended up being back ordered like three
to four separate times
so they said it would be delivered in
January but I actually just thought it
last month this is great for a gift but
I wouldn't count on it
getting to you on time so if you are
gonna order this is a birthday gift or
if you're getting it as a Christmas gift
I would just go ahead and order it now
just in case my rant is over
kind of what I have to say about it but
I do love this this is really cool and
they have tote keychains other little
things like this so really cool item I
have to show you are these Phillips
light bulbs which Ryan ended up getting
a set for Christmas and then we've ended
up filling our whole entire apartment
with them there's smart light bulbs that
you can control with you're looking at
and people were asking me on my blogs
they were like it's not your lamp that's
like Auto on and off from your eyes and
it's not it's a light bulb you can like
dim the lights you can turn them on from
another room you can change the hue you
could do warm light cool light so these
are really cool to happen they're a
great gift to give as well we put them
in our bedroom and we're going to be
putting them like in the living room
also so yeah I have a cool thing for to
have for yourself and as a gift that's
all I have for you today from Maine
