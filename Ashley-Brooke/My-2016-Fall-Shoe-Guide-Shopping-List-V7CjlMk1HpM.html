shoe guide and their lead just hauled
ass rode my bike home so I can film this
video and I'm losing sunlight sorry this
is already getting dark it's six o'clock
I'm so looking forward to the days where
it gets dark at 4:30 loved being in bed
by 7 o'clock
who else loves that who loved being in
bed early and like getting a good
night's breath I'm gonna kind of keep it
to shoes that I love to wear during the
fall and I'm just like my go-to
number-one grab these shoes and go and
then I'm also going to tell you guys
what is on my wish list what I'm
planning on getting within the next
month for fall and before we get started
I just wanted to let you guys know I'm
going to link all of the shoes that I
can find online down below as well as
things on my wish list as well as
alternatives so you will have like a
whole fall shoe shopping guide below
let's go ahead and get started the first
ones are my slice I absolutely love
these I think they make any outfit look
so chic so stylish so trendy you can
even throw on a pair of jeans and a
t-shirt and like a leather jacket and
these guys and you're all set like it's
such a cool outfit so I'm in love with
my slides these are from French
Connection I think they're actually on
sale right now at Lord &amp;amp; Taylor need to
get a pair of just plain blacks all I
have are the patent right now but um
yeah black cotton or plain black leather
you can't go wrong and next which is
kind of in the same category as the
slide are my little loafers and you guys
you know it is like so hard to buy your
first pair of loafers because you're
like those are so old ladies so grandpa
but you know I love these I get so many
compliments when I wear them I just
think they look so good with dresses
with jeans I mean like anything this is
just like a great alternative to just a
plain black pair of black anytime you
want to throw on a pair of black go for
your slides or your loafers instead and
I
it'll make a world of difference on what
your outfit looks like step outside the
box
today step outside of your comfort zone
of your black flats and go for something
a little bit more modern and a little
bit more fashion-forward next is a pair
of just plain nude block heel sandals
I'm obviously a black shoe person so
buying B's has really changed up the way
that I dress my outfit so anytime I'm
wearing a top or something with kind of
more nude warm colors I go for this and
it really changes up the whole tone in
my outfit always such a black white and
grey person and this year I'm really
trying to let go for brighter colors and
warmer colors so this was um almost an
impractical purchase for me until I
bought them and I've I've worn them
quite a bit
any time you play your outfits just a
little bit too dark just add a lighter
shoe on bottom and you're good and these
are so comfortable because it's a little
block heel guy we're not those are these
leopard low furred by June London
you just said loafers I seriously hope
Lord &amp;amp; Taylor guess he's back in stock
because these are amazing I will keep
looking for them for you these are my
go-to when I went out of print to
something and like I said before I do a
lot of black and white and just kind of
solid color so adding a print to the
bottom like just makes the whole outfit
so anytime I've gone on a plain white
shirt and black shorts I add these and
it's it just it's the whole thing
either do a printed shoe or a printed
bag and it just makes the whole outfit
it's your statement piece I definitely
recommend the pair of leopard shoes of
some sort whether you're going for a
heel bootie a loafer add some leopards
in your life next is my studded bootie
these are from forever 21 I really
really wanted the Chloe
susannah boot which is pictured right
here but every time I would save up for
them I would end up buying something
else
yes I just can't quite seem to like buy
them so I opted for these instead
these were $27 and it it gives you the
exact same look pink this is um a great
alternative to just a plain black boot
like why not add something with a little
bit of stud to it just to kind of liven
up the bottom of your outfit I like to
wear these with black skinny jeans
skirts if I'm wearing a girlie skirt or
a girly dress I really like to add
something like this to make it a little
bit more cooled a little bit more edgy
and it really changes up your outfit and
speaking of studs I have got these guys
and they are from I don't know but I
bought these on Poshmark someone will
selling them for like $15 so obviously I
bought them I think they're from Zara
actually but they're super cool they've
just got some really awesome detailing
and I like to wear these when I'm
wearing like tights or skirts they don't
really look that great with skinny jeans
but tights and skirts and dresses and
stuff like that this is like my go-to
for fall I just think they're like the
coolest shoe I love them so much
boop boop and the heel so short of how
low vickielizabeth they're so
comfortable I could wear them all day
obviously I have next are these booties
from Aldo and this is for when I'm
wearing like some sort of denim bottom
like a denim skinny jeans denim skirt
done shorts with like an oversized
sweater I think this color booty is so
important for stuff like that I really
was going for the look of the Isabel
Marant one but um they're so pricey for
just like something that I could find
you know for under $100 like I just
don't see I wouldn't spend the money on
and as the Balmer on booty when I could
find these they look exactly the same
there's a little hesitant with buying
them because I was like ah you know I
always are my black booties but now that
I own these I literally grab them so
much more than I thought
what next are these from Aldo and when I
brought these home I thought Ryan was
gonna fall out of his chair he thought
they were the ugly things in the whole
world but I literally give so many
compliments on these I love them so much
and everyone thinks they're Stella
McCartney and they're absolutely not
they're from Aldo they're fit heavy but
I think most of these kind of platform
Oxford loafers are a little bit heavier
these are just good with skinny jeans
with dresses skirts again this is also
an alternative to a black flat if you
want to add you know like liven up your
black shoe game like go for some
alternatives don't just reach for your
black flats all the time
grab something like that grab something
like this or the slide picks it up a
little bit step out of your comfort zone
next is my super easy just plain
motorcycle boot and I told you guys in
one of my style videos that these have
lasted me like a few winters like look
at the heel is already chipping way
these are awesome
they've been through many snow storms
are so great
they're like worn in they look cool from
Steve Madden a few years ago but I know
they have some just like this on I think
a chose hats have quite a few and I know
Frey makes really good biker boots like
this these are really good for when
you're wearing like an oversized sweater
and skinny jeans it's pretty much stay
by my front door in the wintertime
because I just grab them whenever I'm
going out anywhere it's like run errands
go down the street for something this is
my go to grab biker boots next is my
over the knee boot whoop these are by
Jean Michelle Kasbah and I did invest in
these because it is so hard to find a
good over-the-knee boot that for me at
least that wasn't slouching because I
have such small legs so I couldn't find
anything to stretch and fit onto my leg
and actually like grasp on and not
scrunch down material is so great you
can tie them in the back to make this
tighter heel isn't too high I think it's
just like four inches maybe so it's a
really good high good for going out
there good for like dressing down you
can pretty much do whatever with these
and of course my classic black leather
ankle booties from Zara these are my
go to when I need a little bit of hike
when I need to add a little something
dressier you know a little something
cooler I don't want to do something flat
heel is super low um but you still get
the effect of like an actual heel I love
how these are skinny at the ankles so I
can wear these with my crops flares or
my mom jeans and um they're not so big
on my ankle because I think when you
have an ankle bootie it's important that
you know your your shoe isn't swallowing
your ankle that you have something that
holding onto it because I think it just
it's just a cleaner look it looks nicer
and lastly I'll just go over a couple of
boots that are on my wish list I'm going
to post a photo right here at these are
by Matisse and Marisa graffiti ankle
bootie and I'm gonna just order these
like I'm literally gonna order them
tonight I love them so much I was really
just waiting to see them in person email
their customer service and I was like
where can I find these in New York City
and they were like they don't exist
anywhere in New York SAFE they're only
in online so I'm gonna order them
tonight and I will let you guys know
what I think of that because I think
there's just so many cool colors in that
if you subscribe to my lookbook you will
see that I put these in a few looks um
my favorite is with a red sweater and
dennah like house it will be smoothly
with that outfit so I just think like
the good printed booties is so cool to
like dress your outfit up make it a
little bit more interesting um for those
outfits where you do just have to basics
I think a printed shoe is so important
that's why I wear it B so much because
when I do wear my basics and put this on
it just makes your outfit completely
different and another shoe on my wish
list are these leopard booties by
Kenneth Cole and for some reason all of
the Kenneth Cole stores in New York City
are closing down I was like Google
mapping them and they're all shut down
I'm not sure
why not really want to get these because
I really want a good pair of booties for
winter because these are only gonna last
me through fall like my little ankle
will freeze off I try to wear these so
cold here that like your skin hurts want
to get these to replace these for the
winter all right guys that is all I have
for you for my fall shoe guide I really
wanted to just kind of point out my key
um shoes my go-to things that I just
can't live without I usually do go on
like a small shoe shopping spree at the
beginning of every season because I feel
like what a perfect way to start the
season is with you know three or four
pairs of new shoes and I think it really
just kind of sets you up for this
season's wardrobe because I like to spy
you know a few pair of new shoes and
then especially like funky or shoes and
then I like to kind of match you know my
fall wardrobe think that I'm fine for
fall to my shoes that way you've got all
this no matter what I know a lot of you
