channel open awkward waves today I am
doing a winter shoe guide in New York
right now it's beginning of February so
it is still winter I know all my family
back home in Texas you know the weather
is getting a little bit warmer but for a
lot of us here it's still really
freaking cold I'm just going to share
with you buy some shoes that I've had on
repeat why I love them shopping links
below and also if these are sold out
similar links to where you can shop a
similar look a sweater is from Zara
it is so itchy I do not recommend it do
not buy it stay clear of this sweater
it's really cute but if I leave a
glitter trail everywhere I go if my
lipstick is Maybelline gone great sure
most of you guys already know that by
now if you watch the videos shout out
some tag you sunbathing right now he
will sing in my video so my first shoe
is a bold color shoe this is a statement
shoe a really bold color they did this
patent red with a super detailed zipper
in the back
I love to wear these when I'm wearing a
super basic outfit sometimes you know
what my brain just can't function in the
morning and I'm like basic t-shirt basic
jeans and then this completes my whole
outfit if you have some red accessories
like red details on my bag or a red lip
and I think it really ties in the whole
look that you're trying to achieve in a
try next time you've got just a basic
outfit on at a bold colored shoe and it
makes the world of difference are my
studded shoes and I think this is kind
of the same situation as a fold color
shoe it really makes your whole entire
outfit I have got these super casual
ankle boots studded ankle boots from
Lulu and I love these because they come
up really far so you don't have any
ankle showing so if it's super cold
outside you're all set because it covers
the ankle like
these with skinny jeans with tights and
dresses to kind of make my look a little
bit more edgy not so girly and then here
is more of a dressy and stud boot so I
would wear this with some skinny jeans
or some faux leather leggings with maybe
an oversized button down and look an
oversized blazer or something and I like
dressing them down I think these are
make a cool western vibe so I think like
a cool graphic t-shirt and a leather
jacket some ripped jeans and these this
is a really cool outfit one my favorite
oh and these are I definitely got these
from possum art these are old Zara as
well like I think like five years ago so
next I've got my sneakers so these I
have two sneakers here and they are both
kind of my athleisure casual wear when
I'm running errands and also my gym
shoes so first we have my adidas tubular
defy a speaker and well the stars on
them I love how it's weight on the back
and it's like not mesh the like this
material in the front sir my gym shoes
that they are also really cool with
jeans and like an adidas sweatshirt
or you know like an oversized t-shirt
something casual they're super
comfortable also are my adidas and
Indies and I really try to not wear
these outside for obvious reasons they
are very clean and very white so these
are my really my go-to of gym shoes
because I have a lot of black and white
gym wear and I also have like a lot of
printed color gym wear basic white
nothing else so they pretty much go with
all of my gym clothes next are my
lace-up almost military ish style boot
these definitely are military style boot
these are my almost my bad weather boots
they've got a little snow stuff still on
the back of them you need to clean them
really ready look like my camo joggers
and like an oversized sweatshirt or
skinny jeans and like something super
casual on tops so super comfortable and
I really like the chain detailing here
next is more of a minimal waist
butI so as you can see it's got a
skinnier toe and it's got thinner laces
and it's got a little bit of the heel
and it still comes up high so it covers
your ankle and what I love about these
is that it has a cutout moon and star so
I like to wear black socks with these so
it kind of reflects off of the Sun I
think it's really cool these are
definitely for more like an everyday
casual or dressy look I mean you could
do these with like tights and like acute
overalls dress with a sweater underneath
they're a little bit more easy than the
last one that means they're really
lightweight and super super comfy next
are my loafers and I've been wearing
these on days where it's like in the 50s
and I don't mind a little bit of ankle
showing because it's not so cold but I
will start with my black ones these are
my older last year Aldo ones but I think
these are so cool I love the chunkiness
of the heel and I like how it has Brown
here so anytime I'm wearing any camels
or neutrals or browns this part really
ties it in like it really brings it out
whenever I wear this and I've got my
newer loafers my Steve Madden loafers
and I love the gold I've been looking
for gold obras for a while finally found
these and these were a great price they
were under $100 so I had to throw these
in here and I just think it's good you
know when you don't want to do a black
you want to do something a little bit
more fun do that next I've got my snow
boots that I've been wearing the season
and it is still snow weather here in New
York so I'm throwing these in here
that's right it snowed two days ago and
it's supposed to snow again next week so
I am still wearing these these are from
and other stories and I put you in my
life by her look look and everyone was
like Ashley no those are disgusting what
were you thinking I loved them so much
they're super comfortable they're
lightweight they are super line they're
so warm and I love the printed shoe lace
toe beginning a lot of wear out of these
and I pretty much raised with anything
when it's snowing I will just throw
these on and just not care because
they're so warm so the next few shoes I
have are my textured shoes
and these are more for when I don't want
to print I don't want to color I just
want a little bit of texture when I'm
wearing an outfit and I don't want all
the attention on the shoe but I still
want to wear a cool shoe
I have abs from the Zara sale they are
pony hair lace-up and as you would call
these like loafers or booties or Oscars
or what the Hollies are all over Pony
hair and then they've got a leather
stripe down the back and they're just
solid black but you believe they like
these my next texture too is also this
one from Zara sale and it is my star
oops
I've not worn these because I am
planning on putting them in a hall
coming soon so I'm waiting to wear these
until I put them at all but I'm showing
you guys now so M you will wear them
next are my dressier ankle booties so
I'll start with my black ones these are
my Alice and Olivia solid black suede
sock ankle bootie they're pretty much
with my go-to with dressy black booties
that I wear with pretty much anything
these look good with almost everything
and I have my new shoe who are these by
circus by Sam Edelman from Zoo shoes pan
pointy toe bootie multicolored you know
it's a good neutral goes with pretty
much anything
still pretty skinny at the ankle which
is what I like because I think before
you start getting your colored like
dressier ankle bootie it's good to start
with two solid colors one blacks one
more mutual kind of pan color after my
two casual ankle booties so again kind
of similar situations than before I
thought my brown in my black my black
one is my Zara one that I have had for
so long but I'm on the hunt for a new
pair because they are unraveling here as
you can see do you guys know if you take
these to ASU doctorate they can fix this
haven't taken them yet but I'm just
wondering if you guys have had any
similar issues though let me know then
for my brown I have these from Steve
Madden they are just a basic almost
Western the like suede ankle bootie
they're a great color they're like that
Vasiliy Brown so next I have a good over
the knee boot and I actually chose to
show you guys more of a casual over the
knee boot so I've got this lower healed
pointy toe
obviously kind of curb appeal from Zara
and I love these they're so comfortable
I have these um jean-michele cuff but
stretch opening boot and I just cannot
wear them for too long because the heel
is just like a little higher than like a
we're all days I feel so lastly you guys
who know me Newell this wasn't found to
happen at some point are my printed
boots and kind of goes similar for the
pop of color boot and the studded boot
this really makes your whole outfit so
first I have a good leopard boot now I
have a few leopard boots but I've been
loving these from Kenneth Cole so
initial a disease of the chunky heel and
I love the height of the ankle because
again your ankle isn't exposed to the
cold so on super cold days you can still
wear these and for my last printed shoe
I'm going to show you guys my Matisse
floral booties it took me a while to
wear these and I've set I mentioned this
in my nurse Java style video is I found
these in the back of my closet I ordered
them before it was really like boot
weather so I forgot I had them I found
them in the back of my closet because
the New York Department small closet not
enough room so these were kind of show
up in the back but I found them and I
was super excited I just think the
colors are so beautiful would like to
wear them with red leather jacket
they're good with white jeans anything
green I just think they're so much fun
that is my current winter shoe guide
some shoes that I'm loving you know for
the most part my style is pretty casual
I like to play with a lot of basics I
either have a super printed outfit on or
it's super basic outfit on so I think my
shoes go pretty well with my style as
you can see I like to be super
comfortable I think the tallest heel I
have is probably this one right here
which is
not that now I'll play around me or shoe
closet and see what kind of outfits you
can come up with just by you know
starting with a cool shoe and building
your way on top of it if you guys
