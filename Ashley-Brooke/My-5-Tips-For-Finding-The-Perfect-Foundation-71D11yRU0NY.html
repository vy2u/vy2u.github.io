channel in today's video we are going
over the five things to look for when
purchasing a new foundation it is the
fall winter time we are all kind of
ditching our BB creams from this timer
and getting real about our foundations
so if you're out shopping for foundation
or you're looking for something I just
thought this video could kind of be your
guide to finding exactly what you need
because there are so many factors when
it comes to getting a new foundation I
am going to kind of base these tips off
of what I did to find my perfect
foundation before we get started I
landed on the dermablend smooth liquid
camo foundation and I actually got two
colors I got cream and camel the cream
is for when I don't have any face tanner
on and I'm just kind of all-natural this
matches my skin tone perfectly
I don't normally put self tanner on my
face so this matches my neck when I do
have my self tanner on and that's
actually what I'm wearing right now so
shopping tip number one when looking for
a new foundation is you want to make
sure that it fixes your problem area
whether you have blemishes or red spots
or dark spots you want to make sure that
your foundation fixes this problem
because that's the whole reason you're
buying the foundation is to cover up the
issue and my issue is dark circles in
the fall I do get dark circles and when
I'm filming my style videos and when I'm
filming this kind of video I can't have
them showing so I need something that's
going to cover them up and that's
exactly what my dermablend does so
perfect number two when it comes to
finding a foundation that's good for you
is the coverage so it goes by light
medium and full coverage I like a medium
coverage I think a light coverage is too
light for me in the winter time and a
full coverage almost just feels like I'm
wearing tar on my face so I like a good
happy medium the dermablend is actually
a medium coverage so that was perfect
for me checked off another one off my
list and what I like about the
dermablend is that it feels like a BB
cream like it almost just feels like a
tinted moisturizer like lotion yet I'm
still getting the medium coverage that I
was going for so whenever you can find
something like that that's always
perfect tip number three it has to be
buildable I do like to contour my face
so I need to find something that's
buildable I've had foundations in the
past that when I try to build on top of
it it almost just smears off so a
buildable meaning you want to build
other things on top of your foundation
you don't just want over your foundation
you know you want to contour you want to
wear blush you want to wear bronzer
highlighter you want to make sure that
you have a foundation that completely
lets you build on top of it without
smudging or it not sticking properly end
the dermablend I contoured on top of it
something turns out really really nicely
sticks good it doesn't look like I'm
wearing so much makeup so love that so
another one checked off my list tip
number four it has to be long-lasting I
usually wake up around 7:30 put my
makeup on and then I'm usually filming
until about 4:30 or 5:00 whenever I gets
dark just so impressed by the dermablend
foundation because I actually up at like
6:30 because I had to film something so
I had my makeup on all the way until
9:30 at night and it lasted through an
all day outside shoot in the wind it
rained a little bit and when actually
asked me what foundation I was wrong and
that my makeup looked good and I was
like that's insane
I've just been like through hell and
back all day that's really cool to know
that this really is long-lasting and I
can always trust it when I've got long
days and I don't have a mirror handy at
all times to be like what does my face
look like and speaking of long lasting
you always want to make sure that you're
doing some sort of setting powder
because this really locks everything in
keeps everything from smearing I always
like to think of it as hairspray for my
makeup
it's also make sure that everything is
blended together nicely you don't want
any harsh lines on your face because
that's weird and it does not look good
me we've all been there when we have a
long day come home and we're like well
really that contour is so not good so
don't make that mistake ever again
number five is that there has to be SPF
in it and this is something that
everyone needs to be checking off their
list so I went to the dermatologists not
that long ago I'm so ashamed to say that
something that I never even thought
about but it's so important she said you
should at least have SPF 20 in your
foundation no matter what checked off my
list dermablend has SPF 25 in it which
just makes me feel better knowing that
I'm putting it on knowing that I'm
protecting my skin at the same time
alright that is it for my 5 tips on
finding your perfect foundation so happy
I found mine dermablend in the liquid
camo

foundation for so long and then found

outside so it's like it's dark in my
progress Ryan's head into a casual
meeting so we're gonna talk about is
outfit really quick how's it look I
think you should do this pose all the
time that's why I like while you're
