Christmas you filthy animal
alright this is what I am wearing today
I've got on a blush and light denim
situation going in light shoes and these
are two items that I got from my Topshop
personal shopping appointment the other
day obsessed with this long navy coat
it's so warm and so heavy but it's also
still like tailored at the same time
which I love I love these faux fur
stools that kind of go over your jacket
because it almost looks like it's a part
of your jacket like it's part of the
lapel and I think they're really pretty
to just kind of throw over your
shoulders so I think that's add the nice
touch I like I like the colors and this
because it ties in all my blush things
my camel things Navy items gray even so
this color is quite specific but it does
tie in a lot of neutrals so yeah this is
what I'm wearing to the back of the coat
super long I love anything floor-length
because it's warm and I just think it
looks kind of nice and like oversized I
love this coat because it's Navy and on
days like today where it's freezing cold
outside but it's still sunny you know
you want to wear kind of lighter colors
just to match the weather a little bit
so I really love that it's Navy and not
solid black like all of my other ones
okay
decided to put on at the top on Topshop
because it's really windy outside and
I'm shooting today
so I know a my hair to get it like
windblown but we are we are gonna go
grab a coffee really quickly and then
we're gonna head back in and I'm gonna
get ready fully get ready and then we're
gonna shoot
I just got ready I am just got ready a
lot of work stopped you today I have to
film two videos and then I have to film
some outfits outside if I have time and
I have to edit so if you are not
interested in the behind the scenes
filming work side of things and probably
not watch this vlog miss you know it's
kind of hard planning fun things to do
outside and inside when you know there
are videos to be filmed and I still have
to kind of carry on with my daily work
schedule so doing the best I can here
but I know today is gonna be pretty full
of film boring stuff for a lot of you so
I am going to sit down right now and I'm
gonna film my gift guide that goes live
on Friday tomorrow whatever happened to
you when you have a project or something
and you're like oh yeah I need to get
that done I have a few days at least and
then you're like wait you know I
actually in tomorrow just have that
feeling so I have to sit down and Phil
not and I'm gonna do that right now I've
got all of my stuff
I have all my stuff kind of bagged up
right now so it'll be easy for me to lay
out and get it done right I'm gonna go
and get started filming and I will see
you guys as soon as I'm done okay so
Ryan and I we're just filming for about
two hours I guess oh my gosh it is so
cold outside my feet are still numb and
I had double the socks on and we got two
outfits done which I'm so happy about at
home and I immediately changed into this
oversized sweatshirt thick leggings and
my comfy socks that I think cambree got
me for Christmas last year but whew
so now I am just going to I'm gonna grab
a protein bar and I'm gonna go in the
bedroom and clean up my whole mess that
I've made today with two outfits and all
the filming so we're gonna go do that
hello welcome to backlit shots with Ryan
do you enjoy this it's been a long day
I don't even think I really got to vlog
that much because we were so busy I'm so
tired
I didn't sleep very good last night
because every time we watch American
Horror Story right before bed I always
have nightmares and so I kept waking up
last night and so of course now I'm like
tired today look at my second wind here
pretty soon I think I'm just like they
were a little tired spell oh I'm to sit
here and work and my brain just like
won't thing do you guys ever have those
days where you're trying to focus at
work and you're just literally so like
your brain is so tired from not sleeping
well that you can't even like I'm just
staring at my computer I'm just staring
at hoping that all the work is gonna get
done how'd you sleep last night
Oh some cereal I think I'm also tired
because I haven't really eaten that well
today so I feel like uh and I didn't get
to go to the gym so double lesson
learned for tomorrow tomorrow's a new
day
Oh Stella gets to take a bath tonight
that'll wake me up so I'm sorry I said
the b-word oh my gosh Ryan's best friend
just had a baby my best friend just had
a little baby proud moment oh I love it
that made me in a better mood so yeah I
am going to work for 30 more minutes 30
more minutes and setting a timer and I'm
gonna get at least two tasks I'm setting
a goal for myself
all right I just said I feel like junk
food today and you're giving me more
junk food
don't tell Silla but it's time for her
back are you ready for your back are you
ready for your bath oh boy
off your collar oh I think you know what
this means don't you
dive we just died on my oh did you love
your back
I'm very playful here what tell ya why
are you would you
that's complete Luna truly gave us a
hard time made me work up an appetite
I'm kind of starving now I don't know
what I'm making for dinner yet I'm just
gonna kind of look around and see what I
can come up with
one of my favorite things to buy is
shaved Brussels sprouts and I have a
food processor and it's almost cheaper
to just shave them yourself with your
food processor but I don't have a room
for my food processor in my kitchen so
I've been buying the bags lately but you
can do either if your grocery store
doesn't offer bagged then you definitely
do it yourself because like I said it is
a lot cheaper and I would just shave a
whole bag of em at once and then just
keep it in your fridge
Brussels sprouts stay good for a pretty
long time like grilling these up I like
eating them raw with um
salad and raw Brussels sprouts on your
salad is a really good thing to take to
work especially if you already put your
dressing on it because it doesn't get
soggy
so greens like kale Brussels sprouts and
cabbage are all great for salads because
they stay hard and they don't soak up
the dressing and make it really soggy
so advice request Stella is a maniac
during dinner time any meal time bark go
crazy jump around while we're cooking
and then even more we're eating now how
do you train a dog not to do that thank
you
like we get the puppies are crazy and
have lots of energy and she definitely
is crazy and has lots of energy but when
I'm making dinner or breakfast her lunch
she loses her shit and it's like doing
backflips and fighting me and jumping on
me a day she jumped and up and turned
the stove on and I had no idea that it
was on so I don't know and she goes so
crazy to the point where sometimes she
just like jumps backwards and lands on
her back and I'm afraid she's gonna hurt
herself and I just don't know what you
so any tips
much appreciated Thank You Jose you face
the nars rudder so sure yeah do any of
you guys recreate our recipes I know
what girl said that every meal that we
filmed we made she made the exact same
thing the next day per like a few
strains that's cool I know and that's so
cool Takas show ya show us your food on
Instagram so I was just wondering how
many of you guys actually do that and
like actually like the cooking and the
recipe part so this is what we're eating
I kind of laid both of ours out
differently because we like it different
ways but here are the shaved Brussels
with the quinoa sweet potato and then
the burger patty and Ryan likes his
separated tonight's a burger patty is
the field roast filled burger and this
actually comes with four patties so
we've got two left over for tomorrow
it's made with barley carrots and celery
going to start this bedtime routine this
is kind of the time of day after I've
already cooked dinner eaten done the
dishes taken Stella for her walk and
it's literally time to go to bed I
always shower right before I go to bed I
don't know if I shower and then like
make dinner or something I almost feel
dirty again great hair needs to be out
of face I'm using my cleansing gel to
take off my makeup and I like to put
this on right before I get in the shower
you can't let it stay on for too long
because your makeup will start getting
in your eyes and it'll burn so I put
this on my face rub it in really good
and then hop right into the shower
obviously you can keep this in your
shower and just do it while you're in
there but I like to do things the hard
way I'm gonna go ahead and tell you what
I use in the shower because I'm
obviously not gonna take the camera in
the shower for my what I'm gonna wash my
face with is this stuff right here I
love this because it really clears away
any excess makeup that I have I really
love this stuff and don't be alarmed if
you get this and use it it's hot on your
face it's like warming but then it goes
away after a second just kind of depends
on where I'm at in my self tanning
routine this is what I use to exfoliate
my face they exfoliate twice a week if I
need to clear any excess Chan off I wash
I am using the origins and gloom away
grapefruit
body wash fun fact I always use men's
razors just something about the men's
razors but I never get razor burn I
never get any type of ingrown hairs or
irritation which I guess kind of makes
sense cuz they're meant for men's faces
so I don't know they don't irritate they
don't burn I've always used men's razors
ever since I mean like years now just
what I haven't use it gonna hop in the
shower and I will see you when I get
like body lotion on so I put on at my
origins soothing souffle which is a very
minty smell and it also feels menteng
just so hot natured and this cools me
down after a shower
after that I brush my teeth I use the
clip toothbrush in the rose gold I floss
every single night and right now I'm
using the Coco floss in the strawberry
flavor my face routine is different
every single night just because I use
anti-aging products twice a week I'll
use like retinol or lactic acid and then
all of the other nights I use a really
heavy moisturizer and I do toner every
single night and tonight is my
anti-aging night so we will go ahead and
do that
I toner I am using the affairs witch
hazel in her rose petal and I just this
is the brand that i've been using for
toner forever I have to try not to get
it around my eyes because it will dry
out my eyes and make them swollen and
patchy it's really gross or my
anti-aging product I am using the Sunday
Riley good jeans
all-in-one lactic acid treatment and
beware again if you get this it burns
when you put it on because it's just
lactic acid and it burns and it will
probably make your face peel a little
bit the next day but it's totally normal
that's why I only use like retinol and
lactic acid and glycolic acid just twice
a week for my moisturizer I'm using the
drunk elephant hydration gel and then
for my eye cream I love this stuff I am
using you know what I like this and I
also like the drunk elephant brand but
tonight I'm using this one it is the
belief moisturizing eye balm under my
eyes and around my eyes just get so dry
and almost fit like they swell up and
they flake and they turn red some days I
can't even wear makeup because my
dryness around my eyes is just so bad
and it's really embarrassing still I
have to if I hide an eye cream that
works for me I like have to just pile it
on or my PJs I am wearing this out from
under the brand out from under and I get
it at Urban and it's just a bra top and
it
the most comfortable thing in the world
then I'm doing these brandy melville PJs
shorts and then I just like to throw on
a cardigan when I'm just like walking
around or laying in bed working talking
to you guys cuz obviously I'm not gonna
be like what's up on the camera but
before bed I always go make either a cup
of hot tea or a cup of iced water and I
had ice cream right before I got in the
shower so I'm craving something really
cold with ice for my nightstand I've
always got my phone here charging I had
my charger in my drawer I turn on my oil
diffuser and I'll either put on lavender
oil not on put in lavender oil or
eucalyptus it's mainly when I'm feeling
stuffed up or kind of have like a sore
throat I feel like it kind of clears
things up by morning time yeah I always
light a candle I really like the scent
of this one because it's not so strong
and it just makes the room smell good
and I always just kind of blow it out
before bed but I really like the
lighting that it gives off when I turn
my lamps out and I start working we're
watching TV it just gives off like a
little bit of light I turn on my heating
pad all the way on high and I really
love this one because it has a timer so
if I fall asleep with it on it'll just
shut off and I won't wake up in a puddle
of sweat I just uh make my bed hop in
get my heating pad settled and I usually
work while I'm watching TV and then I
usually am lights out by like 10:30 or
11:00 I'm going to go make my water and
get in bed and answer questions so funny
out of all of the nights I've done this
common answering I just figured out that
I can put my laptop on my bed my camera
on my laptop so it stay still you or I
don't even know this but I fight this to
stay on top of my bed which obviously it
doesn't work then to address the micro
bleeding situation I got so like I got
probably 50/50 do it don't do it but I
was really looking for people who have
done it and just what their experience
was and I appreciate everybody's
feedback think I'm going to do
and I know some of you were like no no
no no but almost every single person who
commented and said that they had done it
loved it and here's the thing with my
eyebrows I did some research I contact
with some people what I'm gonna have
done is they're just gonna fill in the
patchy parts which are mainly just on
the top right here and that's it I'm not
getting my full eyebrows filled in I'm
just getting a few little wispies where
the patchiness is and that's it so don't
panic it's gonna be good and I'm getting
it done tomorrow chorus I will take you
along with me because I have a special
guest appearing in this vlog oh yeah so
we're supposed to edit a video today
don't think I just edit it and didn't
show you I just didn't edit it it's
gonna have to be tomorrow again I ran
out of time today and I just had other
things that were a little bit more
important on my to-do list but that
video is going live tomorrow so we will
sit down and edit it together I will
I'll actually probably edit it and then
show you what I did to edit it I think
that would make a lot more sense almost
like working backwards so other people
were confused about the go veggie cheese
which makes me feel a lot better go
veggie makes a vegan cheddar and then
most of them are lactose free kind of
like the lactate being next to the soy
milk um but the thing about the locked
aide being next to the almond milk is
like it's next to it like there's almond
milk and then there's lactate in our
grocery store that we go to it's like
Chow go veggie follow your heart so it's
like mixed in the middle of all of the
vegan cheese's which is strange oh well
it was really delicious for those of you
guys who are lactose intolerant that go
bad you cheese I've always wondered if
you've ever done any runway or modeling
or thought about trying it no I don't
think I would be good at these do more
videos with tips for YouTube how to's
etc that's good to know
that if you guys like to see how many of
you guys are youtubers if you have you
know large channels small channels if
you do it as a hobby if you do
as a profession let me know in the
comments what your channel is and what
it's about I'd love to know
and also if if you don't mind maybe just
putting what you would like to see for
me in terms of you know if you're just
starting out like what would make your
life easier if I gave you a tip on you
know to make getting your channel
started a lot easier like what are you
struggling with within your channel my
robe where is your robe from the fuzzy
pink one is from Target and it is so
perfective and so warm
I'll link it below and then the thinner
one with all of the print is from Free
People and I will link that one below as
well
Stella definitely does not need some
kind of coat as long as there are no
degrees to zero I don't know because I
saw two dogs today that were with their
owners on their leashes and they were
shaking uncontrollably I felt so bad
with them and they were both wearing
sweaters and boots and they were like
it's like one of them was trying to sit
down but he was so cold that his butt
couldn't touch the ground so I don't
know I just to be on the safe side I
might get our little coat at least a
protector from the snow and stuff like
that you are such a hard worker and you
never complain what other jobs did you
have before doing this and from what age
did you start working what was your
favorite job and the least favorite one
how does it influence your current work
these are great questions I have I
started working at the age of 16 No 15
and I've I've never not worked a day in
my life since then I've always had a job
all through college
halfway through high school my favorite
job was definitely working in visual
merchandising just because it's such a
creative job and you really kind of get
to like create a blank you get to start
with like a blank palette and just kind
of create whatever your mind is thinking
and to be able to have the resources to
do that is very cool I mean obviously
what I do now is my favorite thing but
past jobs that was
my favorite so I was working in
anthropology and it was I started kind
of when I was starting college and it
was my very first day and they had me
clean the bathrooms which is fine like I
know you know when you're new you have
to do that sort of thing got the mop and
the bucket of water and I knocked over
on the sink I knocked over a whole
bottle of soap it broke everywhere and
so then I was freaking out I was like oh
my gosh how do I clean all of this soap
up so of course I get the mop out with
water and start mopping and by the end
of the hour I was standing in bubbles
like this tall my clothes were soaked
like my hair was soaked like there was
just soap everywhere and finally someone
came and knocked on the door I had just
cleaned everything up and it was like
hey is everything okay in there and they
walked in and they were like oh my gosh
it's so clean and it smells so good and
I was like yeah you know I've just been
cleaning the bathroom this whole entire
time you know what my least favorite job
was I worked at Juicy Couture and my
manager hated me she absolutely hated me
I think I got fired my gosh she was
literally the worst the worst
I hope she's watching you're the worst
can you make a guide for your favorite
protein bars I feel like that's an every
of every vlog as a guide to our favorite
protein bars where did you get the
greatest dressed t-shirt forever 21 just
wondering if you've noticed anything
different about yourself
since going plant-based body skin mood
etc I definitely feel like I have more
stabilized energy used to if I would eat
a bunch of meat whether it be burger
steak chicken I would always kind of go
into a food coma and just kind of feel
well and you know just full throughout
the day and I don't get that anymore so
I have kind of a constant steady level
of energy you know what though I my body
feels better because my body has never
really agreed with dairy or meat I just
have a really sensitive digestive system
and the sensitive stomach if I'm the
kind of person that I can't eat too late
at night or it just doesn't settle right
and I don't feel good the next morning
so that has been really great my skin
has definitely changed I got off of the
pill a couple of years ago and I got an
IUD and my skin just turned on me I
think it was the hormones from the birth
control pill that was keeping my skin
clear so as soon as I got off the pill I
mean I was having breakouts like every
other weekend since I started eating
more veggies and more clean food my skin
has really cleared up and every now and
then I'll just get a little blemish here
and there maybe but it's completely
changed my skin Ruben's also freaking
out that avocados are $5 here they can
get pretty they can get pretty pretty
expensive I usually like to go like if
you go to a farmers market if you can
catch a really good farmers market on
Saturday or Sunday they're pretty cheap
there but just like a general grocery
store
you just never know sometimes across the
street they're $2.00 sometimes they're
$5.99 sometimes they're $4 so it just
kind of hit or miss one wherever you go
Brad four or five comments about linking
my b12 spray and I will link that below
as well this is her ugly walk looks
exactly the same and I feel like you
need to send me an in Sasori showing me
your ugly walk and then just so you
don't feel embarrassed I will send you
an insta story back showing you my ugly
walk but like a personal ugly walk video
oh my god this is so funny every day of
December I'd go and hide out in the
bathroom at work to watch your videos I
think my boss is getting worried that
something is wrong with me I should
agreement with you about marriage we
definitely want to be financially stable
personally I wouldn't be more successful
in my career and there's so much we want
to do before getting married yeah that
is totally kind of Bryan and I you know
we've accomplished you know so much in
the past that when we first started
dating I mean we couldn't even really
afford to like go out and eat or you
know we just kind of had to save every
penny that we had so and of course Bryan
was struggling starting his business I
think he maybe had like three clients I
had I just worked retail because I just
graduated college I was trying to figure
out what I wanted to do and you know I'm
really glad that we have concentrated so
much on kind of where we want to be
later in life but I didn't mind waiting
to get married and I've honestly never
been the type of person to just like eat
sleep and dream wanting to get married
and when is he gonna propose and it
better be soon I've just never I've just
never felt that of course I get excited
about it and of course being married and
the thought of being married makes me so
happy but it's not something that's in
the front of my mind all the time so
it's good to know that there are other
people out there that are like that you
know when two people have told me that
they think that's really strange I mean
I know it deep doubt it's not strange at
all it's just a personal opinion but
it's good to note there are others I
think you need a cooler shade for your
eyebrows I've tried that actually and my
hair tone is just so I have so many warm
undertones that it always just looked
like ridiculous think what I need is
just a lighter color I don't know just
you know some days they're fine and some
days I just fill I feel like I over fill
them or they might just be a little too
dark and also when it's when it's winter
and I don't have tan on and my face is a
little bit more pale they stick out even
more so I think getting the micro
bleeding done in a lighter color just a
few whispies will just make the world of
difference for me and I'm really excited
about it okay there are a few more
comments to go but my battery is going
dead and I literally just changed this
battery so I know my other one is close
to being dead but I
see you guys tomorrow I'm gonna go to
bed it is time it is 9:20 so I have a
little bit of work to do
watch a little TV then go night-night
but I'll see you guys tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
