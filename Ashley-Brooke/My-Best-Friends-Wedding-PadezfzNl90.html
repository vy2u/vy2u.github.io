we are in Texas right now my best friend
Taylor is getting married tomorrow and
this is her big weekend he stayed at my
parents house last night and fried and I
are driving to the wedding venue for the
weekend he have been moving in the past
two days like moving unpacking and all
of that good stuff actually not good
stuff it is one of the most stressful
times oh yeah
100% cannot wait to share that story
with you guys then bad luck number two
disco or one style video ago there was
no intro and outro right so I filmed the
intro and outro and my vlogging my
camera didn't write it to the memory
card then we've logged the whole moving
process then I went to go put it on my
camera and it was broken again it did
write to the memory card and it just is
done so I'm actually on a new vlogging
camera we had to stop at Best Buy
yesterday on the way home from from the
airport and get a new camera for anybody
wondering what
disaster but luckily we still have some
more stuff to move we actually didn't
get all the way moved out of our old
apartment so now that we have a new
camera we'll do more of like the proper
moving vlog and when I get home which
will be in this vlog I'll show you guys
I'm not ready to show you the whole
apartment yet because it's a mess but
I'll show you bits and pieces of it and
stuff like that it's back to what we're
doing now we're on our way to the hotel
that we're staying at tonight and I just
did my makeup in the car because we were
running so late this morning and then to
find out that the rehearsals been
postponed because it's been pouring rain
for like two days straight
I just didn't make him in the car and I
wanted to show you guys I have you've
heard of the brands that bull human but
they have like the coolest tech gadgets
me this trashcan that you just wave your
hand over it and it opens up or you say
open and it opens up but then Ryan I are
talking sometimes and we'll say the word
open and like the trash can you can like
see it in the background just like oh

guys that this American visa fee is
must have in my travel bag and in my
purse when I'm on the go I'm gonna show
you guys really quick it's what I used
to do my full face of makeup in the bar
oh my god we'll get my hands from honey
tanning last night on very sacred that
is super handy pouch watch the light
around here
what is called true Lux lighting so it
simulates like natural light from the
Sun you know how when you're doing your
makeup in the bathroom and it's like
artificial light and you go out in
natural light and you're like oh my god
what did I just do in there you put it
back in its pouch it goes off and really
lasts up to a week if you're just doing
like regular daily touch-ups which is
what this is perfect for recharges right
here just no rose gold it comes in
stainless steel black and it comes in
stainless steel it was like perfect
timing thought they'd send me the slip
so like hey you know I have my own
mirror and it has a light on it so
that's like perfect but and also check
out the trash can - it's like the best
thing in our whole apartment we're at
Starbucks getting some coffee we're

crazy with moving we've booked our hotel

some body wash for my sister's so we've
got pretty as a peach actually smells
pretty good I'm using my bio signs to
take off all my makeup my detoxifying

face our belief I bomb herbivore pink
cloud moisturizer format before I put my

product but I love it look huh perfume
this i ge K coconut oil gel it's great
for like my little flyaways that I get
up here I just put a little bit on my
fingers and just like flatten it and it
pretty much stays all day especially in
weather like this almost like it's
really thick going into your hand but
then once you rub it in it's like it's
not even there so it's actually pretty
great and let's see it pretty much packs
like just a little bit of makeup and
here look how bad of shape it was in it
was held together by tape Oh update it

it's just been pouring rain all day
you're just gonna kind of run through at
the rehearsal dinner tonight
it's what time is it 4:17 we're leaving
here at like 6:15 I don't know I have
might just take a nap for the first time
in five years
I'm so tired I think I'm just not caught
up on the sleep from the flight because
we did get up at like 4 o'clock and
I went to bed late last night woke up at
5:00 this morning's knit you support
this decision welcome to my side of the
bed restaurant right what

my Amazon cart to the point that it
scares Brian
no no more I'm gonna get that vacuum

comments section below that you vote
that I get the vacuum and I think if we
have enough people say it it will happen
for us will get the vacuum I'll do a
vacuum review I mean how many of you
have hardwood floors that you sweep and
then mop
it's just save time and let's get the
one tool that does both that's what I'm
saying
mm-hmm well it's really easy for you to
shake your head the person that doesn't
clean the floors wins last time you
clean the floor I'm gonna go do some
more Amazon shopping and then we'll do
an Amazon haul when I get back back
seeing a little bit I'm ready to go I'll
show you guys what I'm wearing I'm
wearing this flowy dress from Urban
Outfitters all the bridesmaids have to
wear blush because that is the
bridesmaids color so we're all wearing
blush to the rehearsal dinner and these
are shoes they're like this rose gold
blush color with silver grommets on them
all kinds of shades of pink today
can you stop training so that's good
news it's actually kind of nice but all
right we're gonna go I don't know if I'm
gonna bring the camera with me because
my purse doesn't even hold my phone in
it so I don't know where I'm gonna bring
the camera but I'm definitely going to
check back in with you guys tomorrow and
I'll bring you to the wedding and while
we're getting ready and stuff so I will
either see you tonight if I decide to
bring the camera or I'll see you
tomorrow bye
day
and we had so much fun last night at the
rehearsal dinner it was at the most
beautiful place I don't know bears on my
against the story but it was like on
this hilltop that just looked over
mountains and trees and they were like
dark clouds in the back I listened to
die for now Ryan is heading to drop me
off at the bridesmaids house and it's a
15 and I wanna see Ryan until the
wedding starts but we are going to be
getting ready and just kind of hanging
out having coffee and breakfast and it's
gonna be a lot of fun somebody coming to
do our makeup she's doing a lot of
people's makeup so if we run out of time
Law College instead of doing my own just
by and I brought my stuff just in case
all right Sydney and Kendall and I just
cut all this fabric and now we're going
to hang it I probably don't remember
Taron but uh hard to forget so we're
gonna attempt the flowy curtain
you look at your Princess Bride I love
them can i motorboat
we are back from Texas and we just got
back really late last night and I'm in
an empty room in the new apartment right
now actually it's not empty there is
like a little random stuff in here but
Ron and I are about to go to Ikea and
just grab a few little things like we
just need some hampers and like you know
just like little IKEA things and I think
we're actually gonna build out that
island in the kitchen so if you just
measure that off and we're gonna do some
island putting together I'm nervous
because I don't know what I'm doing and
neither does Ryan so we're building out
a dresser
tell them what's going on building out
this dresser over here and we're gonna
I'll be back we're building out this
little thing but we're changing the base
color of the white changing the doors
and changing the legs and then we have a
mock up over here we're gonna do these
big doors on the sides and then we're
gonna do drawers in the middle better
this color should look pretty cool Ryan
is in total man mode no pictures please
no pictures please
so serious excuse me I work here
seriously we've only been here for like
an hour to me to come pick you up when
I'm done see ya so now we're wandering
around because the kitchen island
situation has become much more difficult
than we thought
this is so frustrating because they can
customize some things but not others and
our best options of what we want will
leave us with one unfinished edge of the
countertop so many Commons that's where
we get our bowls and we just want you
know they're not here except for those
like those oh I should have that on the
product description like this a little
drawing of you and black and white yeah
she was done with her coffee and she's
like hey you wanna sit I said sure is it
still won of course it is ice pretty
cold
doesn't it mess with me because I like
my coffee at a higher temperature than
36 degrees Fahrenheit all right
that is something I've never want to do
ever again we're waiting on our uber to
take us back to Manhattan home we got a
dresser I'm gonna try to like IKEA hack
it make it look like it's not from Ikea
not that there's anything wrong with
that but I'm gonna fancy it up a little
bit
snaps it up a little bit we are home
from yeah finally I just sat down and
ate a burger feeling good all right
so I'm not to show you what our office
is going to be I'm just gonna warn you
there are boxes literally covering every
square inch of the floor and these
shelves were left from people who lived
here before so we're trying to get this
taken care of because it's really
inconvenient it's like right where the
door opens so yeah they left us tons of
goodies the people before us so thanks a
lot for that I'm gonna show you oh okay
so this is where the office is going to
be I know we're gonna have like a big
table here don't really know what else
where everything else is gonna go but
this is pretty much it for the most part
and those are my underwear to get any
underwear or any like pajamas like
there's my jewelry there's my sunglasses
we got a dresser at IKEA we wanted this
one from Restoration Hardware it was so
nice that was one of those big tall ones
but it was like the jillion dollars so
we just kind of made our own at IKEA I
don't know I think I'm gonna like try to
have like DIY hack it make it look cool
we'll see you but look what I found when
I was packing I forgot I have this in my
closet it's my my youtube um 100k plaque
which is really cool so
okay but I oh okay
okay can we just though I just showed
them what this room looks like yeah it's
interesting isn't it if you ever lose
anything
you should check in here first I'm gonna
go I got it in this vlog I feel like
this vlog is gonna be so long and I need
to wrap it up but next week we'll do
more moving stuff I think we're gonna
try to go to the apartment sometime next
week and get the rest of our stuff but
slowly there will just be more apartment
stuff and I'll show you like decorations
and IKEA hacks that we're planning on
doing so that is coming within the next
probably like 100 vlogs I don't know
