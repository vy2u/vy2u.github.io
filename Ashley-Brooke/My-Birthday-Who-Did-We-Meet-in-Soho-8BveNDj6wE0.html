briquette fat bird good morning guys so
yesterday had an amazing birthday right
and I just kind of spent the day in Soho
and in West Village just doing we went
to some stores like H&amp;amp;M and Zara but we
did a lot of vintage shopping it's my
favorite vintage places and it was so
much fun we went to the park you know
that's like one of the best ways to
celebrate birthday is just around the
people that you love just spending time
together but I thought my birthday was
over yesterday and Ryan has surprised me
with a massage down at the spa so I'm so
excited and I know the massage therapist
here is really really good like last
time I went to her I couldn't walk for
three days she was so intense
awesome so Oh my finger getting better I
know if I told you guys is I know I told
you on snapchat in some stories but I
was cutting a muffin that was frozen and
I was trying to slide the knife through
and then I slid through them up in and
just punctured inside my hand where my
pinky joins my hand so every time I open
my hand the cut opens back up it's so
gross was it was the gusher
it was disgusting sorry I thought it's
TMI but we're going to do that right now
we're going to get a massage and then
we're going to shoot some outfits and
then just relax for the rest of the day
so this vlog is coming out today but
other than that we're just going to
relax and enjoy the weather it's gonna
be nice but
hey you stop cry so so Ryan's most Rams
working a little bit right now almost
uh-oh
it's always almost done
oh we're going to get ready and I don't
know why they get ready like I'm just
going to wear this it kind of ended the
vlog last night just randomly we got
home and just like got in bed and
watched the stuff we finished it so good
I can't wait for next season we were
going to eat some of my cupcakes but we
were so full from that place it was so
good but I was way too full but I did
eat a strawberry one for breakfast this
morning
in bed so that happened considering
doing that every morning just having a
cupcake for breakfast and that's
acceptable right
I was so stuck I couldn't figure it out
- carrot it with some basic white
trousers just to kind of dress it up a
little bit I know you guys like when I
show work appropriate outfits the good
thing about this top is that you can do
it dress up or dress down
it's a dressy enough top that you can
wear to work but you can also throw it
with some you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
