just woke up it is 7 a.m. and I'm going
to blow dry my hair for you today a
couple of videos a couple of weeks ago I
posted a like get ready with me I
straighten my hair and all of you guys
were like wait your hair looked so much
better before you straighten it and I
actually just blow-dried it so you were
all requesting a blowout routine and how
I get myself to blow I like to alternate
between two different shampoos and
conditioners I use my Nioxin number 4 it
feels like a really good scalp treatment
it's like very minty and I think this
actually is like a scalp yeah scalp
therapy and I also use my living proof
no frizz shampoo and conditioner and I
absolutely love this line I have the oil
and I have the no humidity spray
I think it's called humidity shields
here in New York City in the summer it
is so human I'm gonna go jump in the
shower wash my hair and I will see that
at all Wow it almost like doesn't go in
the fray I had to maneuver my living
room a little bit I always like to
blow-dry
not in my bathroom because I get so hot
so I like to blow drying a big
everything should bury the first product
I'm going to use on my hair is a anti
breakage serum and actually my amazing
hair stylist Bianca sells this at her
salon and it's I'm almost out of it
actually it's really really good you
want to use the living proof no prisoner
real relaxing issues there's always a
heat protectant spray and I'm using this
one today I have a few that I use but
this one for the past few washes have
subs in my favor you're looking for some
extra volume definitely do like a mousse
on your roof like lifting mousse or like
a thickening root boost boost mousse
sorry let me start that over we use a
lifting mousse a root boost mousse or
you know what I mean you can use a
mousse on your mousse on your like to
put my hair up in about half an inch and
a half section I don't want to do too
small of sections because then my hair
will start to air dry so I want to do
bigger sections and get my round brush I
use more like a medium brush I have a
larger one and I have a smaller one just
kind of depending on what size of curls
and how much volume you want the first
thing I'm gonna do is just to grab a
pretty good chunk just kind of whatever
you are comfortable with grabbing you're
gonna have to play with it and see what
works best for you a more quick tip is I
like to blow dry out so I never blow dry
down I'll either blow dry out or I think
this creates the most volume for you put
my blow-dryer on the hair blow-dry it
completely until it's all the way dry
and then I'm going to twist and pull and
then that will create a curl and then I
like to let it cool down before I start
running my fingers through it and then I
like to let it just sit here so I will
do my whole head let it sit for about
ten minutes before I start running my
finger through it and putting more
product on it
I guess my last like top inch section
here I like to grab my pieces and
blow-dry completely straight up rather
than to one night
actual blow drying parts done I've
literally got like one big curl right
here and over here so what you want to
do is just take your fingers and just
break up all the curls do want that
extra bit of curl you can always get a
curling iron and just kind of get you
know these pieces here or some over here
just kind of depending on the look that
you're going for I will link all of the
products that I used below and I really
hope you enjoyed this this was so
requested after my last get ready with
me so I really hope that you took
something away from it and that you've
enjoyed it great so I decided to
straighten my ends and just kind of give
myself a wave in the middle but it still
has volume and you know I can still flip
it over if I want to and create that
like the luminous look very very big
I'll usually just leave it alone or I'll
create something like this but since I'm
about to film today I wanted something a
little bit more tame that way it's not
in my face on the camera and like
completely out of control and I will see
you guys in my next video
burying this halter top from urban with
this bralette on from forever 21 and
then ties in the back
skirt is also wait who wears the skirt
room
and comment I think it's time hmm I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
