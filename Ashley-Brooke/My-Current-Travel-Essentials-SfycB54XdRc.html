most of you know I'm in Texas right now
visiting family just kind of wanted to
shoot a video and show you guys some of
my favorite travel items things I can't
travel without so this is my bag that I
have with me at all times when I travel
it's just got a lot of my necessities in
it it goes my carry-on with me goes
everywhere with me
especially what I've gotta use up is
hand sanitizer and I don't know anyone
who doesn't travel without hand
sanitizer and this is by the brand
everyone and it is coconut and lemon and
it is delicious I get it at pulses next
is my Z odorant and I carry deodorant in
my regular suitcase but I always travel
with deodorant because if you like my
body still trying to get used to
aluminum free deodorant and it has been
quite the transition I guys have gone
through the transition knew exactly what
I'm talking about
so always have to have a deodorant with
me at all times because gum is old to
show you breast spray also this one's
for Iong because so ya always gotta have
fresh breath ever I want to plain and I
like go to sleep I wake up and just the
grossest taste in my mouth I know my
breasts probably think so always I to be
prepared for that next is my travel
charger because I am notorious for just
like running down a battery on an
airplane or the plane out a hundred and
I will get off at two no matter what so
I was going to have that next is my
Dramamine and I get so motion sick
mostly on the car ride to the airport
I'm usually pretty good on the plane
unless it's really bumpy but it also
just kind of helps me sleep and calms me
down
so Jemma means always next is lip stuff
I have chopsticks and lip balms all over
the place and every purse in every
travel bag just because my lips get so
chapped when I travel for some reason I
don't know why but I always have to keep
that with me okay I'm just going to grab
one but there's at least seven hair ties
I really just need one I don't know why
there's so many maybe this is where all
my hair ties go I drop it back in a nail
file this is also another thing that's
just in all my purses all of my little
pouches always need one of these I
always have to travel with
look I'm always reading and right now I
have got Tim Grover relentless and I
haven't started this yet because I just
finished my other book so I grabbed this
on the way out and I can't wait to start
reading this one when we listen to books
on audible but when we go to Texas we're
always at the pool or at the lake and I
don't want to bring my phone near the
water so it's always good to have a
hardcover like an actual book also for
times like that and for travel snacks I
usually have like nuts or some sort of
chips or crackers but in my travel bag
right now I have probably seven or eight
lira bars
this is the best selenium Larry's
cookies because these have 16 grams of
protein they have a ton of carbs but
they're vegan no soy they're just I mean
if they're awesome and they're really
filling so in case I'm on the plane and
I don't get to eat a meal that's a
really good like a filling you know high
carb high protein things for me to have
next is for this trip I definitely had
to pack my black swimsuit this one is
from River Island and it's this one
right here
you know I posted a picture of it on
Instagram if you guys want to go see
what it looks like on but it had to be
black because we are going to the lake
and if it's not black then sometimes the
lake water can kind of turn your bathing
suit like this really a gorgeous brown
color so I always have to go with black
when I'm going to the lake is black and
it's got kind of this really pretty
white stitching I don't know it's two
really good black and white bathing
suits is always have to travel with my
travel cups I have so many travel cups I
just happened to grab this one but the
pluses of having that be I think it has
to be a Starbucks cup but you get a
discount on refills and you get a
discount whatever you use this so you
know I just think it's better instead of
just re you know storing away and
getting new plastic ones to have one cup
good for water at the airport I don't
know I just always travel with some sort
of cup is this bag and this has been my
one of my go-to bags for summer it just
goes with everything if ever I'm like
okay I can't find a bag to do it this
outfit I can always count on this one to
go with it so I love this and it's
really good for traveling
because it's structured so you can put
your sunglasses I always roll out my
perfumes in an old t-shirt and pack them
in here because and I know they won't
get damaged so it's a nice like
protector as well next is my bag o
chargers so I always keep this bag it
has a splitter so Ryan I can watch
movies all of my cords all my chargers
fit in here it's just like a little
adjacent bag I know it's really not by
cute kind of ugly actually I've just
been using it forever because I can see
all my cords so I can see within there
because I will do some beauty products
and I'm really not super high
maintenance when it comes to beauty
products I mainly just stick to what I
used to say things all the time we've a
heat protectant spray
especially when I come to Texas because
we're at the pool at the lake my hair is
always getting wet I'm always having to
blow-dry it so I like to spray this he
protection on it to keep it from drying
out from breaking off they just sent me
this actually and I've been using it for
about a month now and I really like it
so it's my herbivore after Sun oil and I
got this at Urban Outfitters but it
smells really nice it's got a nice fresh
almost like coconutty smell to it so you
know after I've been in the Sun all day
I like to shower put that on it just
feels so nice and it smells really good
this is my Sancho pea face canner
and you guys know that I don't put my
face in the Sun so to make my face match
my body I put this on almost every night
just a little bit goes a long way and it
just gives you just like a hint of color
for the next day you know if I put Bondi
stands on I feel like my face is like a
brown so I just need a little hint of
color to kind of match the rest of my
body and that really does the trick
I do not travel anywhere without my
drying lotion because this stuff zaps
away a simple overnight it works best
overnight obviously so I put this on
overnight and really just zaps it away
even the worst ones like what you know
it's going to be a bad one you know what
I mean is that's it away so I love that
the only moisturizer I'm really using on
my face right now is my SK 2 a facial
treatment essence so a little bit of
this goes a long way and I'm already
almost like halfway done with it that
moisture eyes are on before I put me
got blind but for the most part that's
pretty much it loading wise obviously I
pack tons of denim shorts because we're
in Texas and it's freaking hot I'm such
a pants girl like hello I'm wearing
overalls right and I love denim shorts
that I like love my pants so to meet in
the middle of Texas heat and shorts I
pack these really lightweight to LA and
they're almost like no material I mean
there are so thin so airy and I could
just fill these on with like a crop tank
top or a little t-shirts and sandals and
they're really nice and comfy and I
don't get too hot because I love my
denim jeans and I can't wear I mean you
just can't wear a denim jeans throughout
the day here it's too hot so I will have
to settle for my to us these are very
wrinkled something in my suitcase but
it's really really lightweight denim
culottes
again super airy almost like I'm wearing
shorts super breathable so always travel
with these and dress these up or down so
it's a really good versatile item to
pack if you are going out to dinner put
some heels on if you're just kind of
roaming around do some sandals some
sneaker is so very easy is my romper and
a romper is just so easy to pack because
it's a whole outfit but it's just one
item like you don't even have to think
about it you just grab your romper throw
on you know dressing up heels dressing
down with sneakers or sandals and I love
this one from River Island mostly
because it's black I really like the
flirt worry no frills sleep on it this
is probably my favorite romper at the
moment but you can see it's like a you
know like a really girly flowy sleeves
print is really soft and feminine but
it's also black too so you can kind of
you know dress it up cool with some
sneakers or something but always always
travel with a romper next is a white
button-down is dress and I still
wrinkled oh look this travel with one of
these because I can wear it open with
denim shorts and a tank top I can wear
it as a dress dressed up or I can wear
it kind of edgy with some booties and
like a cool bag or with sandals just
just so much you can do with it it's
really lightweight you
keevon wear it with jeans I mean I take
this thing everywhere because it's just
you know if I'm kind of at a loss for an
outfit I can always build something
around this next are just two really
easy tops that I have I don't know why
they're I grab two white ones but I did
talk some more colored ones these are
tops that you can dress up or down I
don't like to pack super dressy things
just because you know if I'm just going
to be wearing them for a couple of hours
or just a few hours to go to dinner it's
just almost not even worth the room in
my suitcase so I packed this top this
little off the shoulder the detached
arms I love the style of top but you
know you can tuck this into denim shorts
to make it casual skinny jeans for
nighttime I mean there's just so much
you can do with it and that one's from
forever 21 I also packed this river
island one it's a little bit more girly
because it's got this really pretty
frill sleeve that goes up the front and
it's so cute but again same situation
you can dress this up or down so it's
really good grab and goes off course
