video today we are shooting my everyday
makeup routine a lot of you guys were
asking me what my go-to makeup look is
for when I'm shooting my how to style
videos and this is it when it comes to
makeup I usually keep my same routine
I'll sometimes do a different contour
routine or different eyeshadows but for
the most part all my products pretty
much stay the same until I find
something that I just cannot live
without I actually shot the video this
is the end result and I actually shot
this video about 9 o'clock this morning
and it's now 4:30 so what this is kind
of after a long day of shooting as you
can see everything is still intact and
in place so that is always good news I
swear by all of these products that I've
been using them for months now and I
love them all so much I am so mad at
myself though I completely forgot to put
my primer on I always do that every time
I shoot a makeup video and I'm done I'm
like only gonna do the primer on the
primer that I normally use every day is
covergirl trublend based primer for dry
skin and it's basically a heaven in a
bottle that's just a moisturizer it's
very silky it's not greasy or oily and I
just feel my makeup kind of sticking to
it it just almost has like the secure
feeling and I know they have um this is
for dry skin but they have for oily skin
combination skin all kinds of different
types though luckily - the rose gold
color
um so include this in the video
alright so let's just get straight into
the routine oh I'm in front of my window
so the light is probably going to be
changing to dark and light because
there's clouds and weird things are
happening so let's just go ahead and get
started I'm going to put my super cute
headband on
I'm actually going to mix two I'm going
to start by using my L'Oreal True Match
Lumi in the color buff beige I'm also
going to mix my Maybelline fit me
foundation in the color 220 natural
beige my skin just changes colors
throughout the summer because I'll be
tan and then my channel fade and then
I'll put self tanner on so I think it's
good to have a dark and a light and you
can kind of mix them and make your own
color formula to whatever matches your
skin I'm going to start with the True
Match Lumi all I want to remember to
match your foundation to your neck and
not to your actual face you want it to
blend with your neck I'm going to go in
with my lighter color then I'm going to
take my Real Techniques foundation
buffing brush and I'm just going to kind
of buff everything in
as I'm going to take my Becca ultimate
coverage concealer and this is just kind
of a concealer for under my eyes on my
chin my Cupid's bow we're just going to
use my finger to apply next I'm going to
take my Beauty Blender and just kind of
bump and blend that in to kind of
highlight those spots Bach do you have
that blended out nicely I'm going to
take my Laura Mercier brightening powder
and this is just a translucent powder to
help set the concealer under my eyes so
it doesn't crease off just going to take
my Beauty Blender and I'm going to dip
it in and then I'm going to apply it
gently under my eyes
I'm not going to quite blend this out
yet so we're just going to let this sit
for a little bit while we contour our
face to take my Kat Von D shade and
light palette and I'm going to do my
contouring first so I'm going to use
this middle color right here and I'm
going to take a smaller angled brush I'm
going to contour my nose first and then
I'm going to go back in with my Becca
and I'm just going to make a line right
down the center of my nose and then
we're done
don't forget eye next I'm going to take
my angled contouring brush and I'm going
to go back in with this middle color I'm
going to contour my cheeks my jawline
and my forehead
so after I'm done contouring I'm going
to take my Beauty Blender and I'm going
to blend and buff my nose they take
another contour a smaller brush I'm
going to go in with this middle color
and I'm just going to kind of go over my
forehead my nose I'm going to blend out
this under my eyes and then I'm going to
go down underneath the contour on my
cheekbone at my chin
I'm going to take my Beauty Blender and
then I'm just going to blend and buff
all of the contouring out of my face as
you can see it's still really really
defined so we want to make sure that we
blend it really really nicely this is
the key to contouring so now that
everything is blended and buffed and you
can't see any harsh lines on your face
I'm going to go in with my NYX eyebrow
cake powder and I'm going to do my brows
but I'm just going to kind of
fast-forward through this whole process
because I have my brow routine on my
channel right now I'll post a link right
here so you can open it when you're done
watching tutorial I'm going to start
doing the my eye shadow and I'm going to
start with my benefit
lemonade eyes shadow primer no sometimes
are I lived or a little bit darker so
this really brightens up the natural
color of our eyelids so our eye shadow
goes on smoothly and doesn't change
color so for my eye shadow I'm going to
be using my Maybelline blushed nudes
palette we're just going to go ahead and
use this super simple kind of off-white
color I guess just to kind of give
myself a base I'm going to go in with
this darker color right over here I'm
actually going to use I'm just going to
use my finger to put it on and I'm just
going to apply it in my crease
it's funny because I have study brushes
and I always prefer to use my fingers
because I feel like it just blends out
better and I can control more of where
things are going then I'm going to put
this pink color right on top of exactly
what I just did
so then I'm going to take my finger and
I'm going to take this champagne new
color I'm going to go in right
underneath my eyebrows then I'm going to
take a blender brush and I'm just going
to kind of blend up raising it so for my
outlet I'm just going to go in with my
Becca highlighter in the color I can get
it open
Oh back in the color opal I'm just going
to brush this along my eyelid
so next is my mascara and I am using a
L'Oreal telescopic mascara get them to
focus in the color black is black
after my mascara is fully applied I'm
going to take my NARS blush in the color
orgasm and I'm going to just do a little
bit I'm not going to do a whole lot
because it's still so hot outside that I
feel like I get a little bit of a rosy
cheek anyway and today on my lips I'm
going to do a Rimmel London's lip liner
in the color natural and then I'm going
to fill it in with Maybelline's blushing
beige lipstick because when in doubt go
with a new lip then to give it a little
bit of color I'm going to apply just a
few little drops of L'Oreal's
purple prelude jobs a little bit of
color to such a nude lip alright that is
it for my everyday makeup routine and
also how I do my makeup for my how to
style videos I really hope you enjoyed
it and if anything I do different it's
usually maybe adding an eyeliner with a
darker eyeshadows so I'll normally get
like a blending brush and just kind of
blend underneath my eye my bottom lashes
I get darker brown eyeshadow and also on
the top but for the most part stays the
same like I said earlier I'm getting so
much good feedback on the lookbook I am
