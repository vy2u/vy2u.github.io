I keep thinking today's Friday it's such
a Friday feel kind of day but I am
actually about to go to Burberry's
headquarters I'm doing a collaboration
with them to show one of their new
products I am wearing my Grateful Dead
Sea from brandy melville I've layered on
some necklaces oversized blazer some
vinyl pants and my Alice and Olivia
booties I just kind of want to be casual
because I'm gonna be sitting and getting
getting some makeup done so this bond
keeps giving me props I've got a big
pumpkin is so dry I am embarrassed she's
gonna be like Jamie moisturize her face
ever I haven't had time to put a mask on
I was gonna do my drunken elephant baby
facial and just like have not a time I
gotta think about a two-night ASAP or
like some sort of mask I have to do even
my lips are kind of dry I'm falling
apart I'm gonna just like crumble at any
moment into it dry
pile on floor
all right so I just got home from the
event and I took all my makeup off and
now I'm going to try to recreate what
Wendy created for me there at Burberry
so I'm gonna just kind of reapply my
makeup Chas you guys for a little bit
show you what I'm using and all that
good stuff seriously like the coolest
experience I don't think I've ever had a
brand take me to their headquarters and
show me how to use a product and partner
me with a one of like the best makeup
artist that there it's like that was
just the coolest thing ever I
collaborate with Burberry on this I
partnered up with them to actually show
you guys and just kind of introduce me
to their new fresh fluid gel Stix very
like London inspired I've never been to
London personally but just by kind of
doing research and research on this
product it's very kind of dark and dewy
and just kind of puts you in like a mood
if you know what I mean you've never
tried any of Burberry's products before
and I was really really impressed with
this foundation because it's a really
good kind of medium light coverage
foundation we're gonna get started what
Wendy did do for me was she heavily
moisturize my face and I'm assuming that
this is when you are going for more of a
dewy look you do want to add extra
moisture before you apply your
foundation and I have the video where
she was like slathering moisturizer all
over my face and I was like is this the
secret to a dewy look did you think I
was talking to you this time be for the
camera telling stories and Ryan's over
here giggling do you like that story so
I feel like stuck when to do a skin is
so happening with this moisture so I'm
going to go in now with the color honey
color number 32
forgot to show you guys what I use for
my um my intense hydration they use the
Tarte h2o like very jelly like and a few
drops of my argon milk from josie maran
which just be where it is white alright
now we're gonna do some damage control
on the under under eyes just do lots of
damage control like to let my
translucent powder sit on my eyes for a
little bit I hate it when I get
foundation on my mouth like makes your
tongue disappear so then I'm gonna go in
with my darker glow gel stick and I'm
just going to create some dimension on
my face we're just going to buff this
out
the next thing Wendy did that kind of
blew my mind was she took a lip color
contour and in the color medium number
three it's a bit Li a pretty color kind
of like a dark and and plum plum like
and to keep the theme of the gel kind of
dewy look she actually used this as an
eyeshadow as well as a lipstick I know
so that's what I'm gonna do it's used
her finger to blend it which is a woman
after my own heart because I love to use
my fingers when it comes to blending my
makeup again it gives you a really nice
kind of gel gel look instead of a powder
so it looks just a little bit more it
looks just a little softer I'm gonna go
in with a rose gold highlighter and I'm
just gonna do I'm just gonna put a
little bit on my finger here and I'm
just gonna go over my eyelids because I
think it complements the shadow a slush
lip gloss / lipstick really nicely
a bit above my Cupid's bow so then I'm
gonna go in and use a Dewey stick and
I'm just going to line right above my
cheekbones here so what this does is it
just kind of like complete see or do we
look without having any color in it like
it's not rose gold it's not gold it's
not any color it's literally just like a
Dewey stick with my tacha dewy skin mist
and I'm just gonna give my face a couple
of sprays so now I'm gonna go back in
with my color contour and I'm just going
to do my lips actually and not my eyes I
love this color because this is almost
the shade of my natural lip color so it
really just like accentuates the shape
and brings out color that I already have
did you don't recommend talking and
trying to put this on at the same time
not smart I'm gonna do my Stila stay all
day waterproof liquid liner aka my eye
sharpie and I'm just I'm not gonna do a
full-on cat eye but I am gonna do just a
tiny little little dab just a little bit
like okay both cat eyes are done mini
cat eyes so now I'm gonna go in and just
put some mascara I'm actually not gonna
put any on my bottom lashes for a change
because I want more of like a heavy top
top situation with the eyeliner and the
lash and the mascara combo so I'm gonna
leave my bottom lashes alone today
lashes are done now my very last thing
that I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna
go back in with my lip contour and I'm
just gonna do a little bit of color
underneath my eyelid I just remember
that that's something that Wendy did
that I really loved so this is my
finished product I'll link everything
below that I use to just love this look
I've actually was like not sure about
not putting anything on my bottom lashes
cuz I'm always like full lashes on top
polish on bottom kind of girl but after
doing this I really really like it it
does give you more of like a minimal
makeup look which was really cool it's
like one of the best partnerships that
I've ever had just great relationship
great people to work this thing
guys for that as well guys thank you so
much for watching this video and I
really hope you loved it everything will
be linked below for you must have
finished the finished product and I'm so
excited about it but I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
