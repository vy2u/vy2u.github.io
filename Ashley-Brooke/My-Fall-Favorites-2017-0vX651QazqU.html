channel today I'm doing a fall favorites
I haven't done hi I know I haven't done
a favorites video in a really long time
and I try to do them seasonally because
I feel like I get in one routine per
season and then I change the next season
so it just makes sense to do it that way
for me yeah so these are some new things
some old things that I've just
discovered that I love again so that
being said let's go ahead and get
started first I will start with
fragrance and these are all old
fragrances that I've just kind of been
loving again hate spending money on
perfume it's like one of the worst
things I just hate it everyone is my
Elizabeth and James and I know there's
the white one in the black one I love
the black ones and it's so perfect for
fall it's like spicy and smoky one
squirt will take you well I hate that
word squirt and spray we'll take one
pump we'll take you through the whole
entire day this is another oldie but
goodie I've been wearing this for a
really really long time it's a little
bit on the lighter side but still
perfect for fall for going out for my
nighttime perfume the Tom Ford Black
Orchid
to me this is not a daytime perfume at
all it is so strong that's what you want
then go for it but this is my go-to
night time perfume so the next thing I
have are two pairs of workout leggings
and you guys are the ones who
recommended these to me I'm like so
obsessed with them I asked you guys for
recommendations and you told me pair is
from ninety-degree by reflex and I got
these on Amazon and they come in like 15
colors so many colors they are super
super like tight they hold everything in
they just make you feel really secure
not see-through at all I also got the
basic black ones from gsella and I
actually like these a little bit better
they're very similar to the Amazon pair
these are a little bit thicker and they
also come in different prints next is a
brand from Urban Outfitters called out
from under I might have showed you guys
this before I can't remember but they
have the almost comfortable like
lounge thanks I already have this bra
top it's like a high neck and then a low
back just ordered the high leg undies
back and in the white color so ordered
the bando this is the most like
comfortable material I think it ever put
on my body fake but it's not too thick
it feels secure I sleep in the sets
obviously not the ones with the tags on
them because I just got them I'll do a
few home items so first I have my go to
fall candle I go to candle just my life
candle is the volcano candle from
Anthropologie it's just always in my
favorite nose nothing else like pay of
all use bought pomegranate blood orange
spicy umm its fall but it you also
wouldn't smell it and be like oh that's
a small candle it just kind of gives you
some full but because it's spicy
container is always so cute it goes with
all of my fall flowers and like that
really matters but you know some people
would tell me thing is my little iPhone
tripod um it has just I didn't even know
these existed until recently whenever I
do my facebook lives for life by her I'm
always like propping my phone up I have
like this rigged system and it falls
over and I'm like sorry guys
so I got one of these I'm sure all of
you and the Facebook and the light by
her group were like thank God because I
was so tired of you and Ryan like
fiddling with thanks a remote control
timer for selfies that I don't even know
where that is anymore but yeah it comes
with that is my oil diffuser um I keep
this on my nightstand right and I both
get kind of dry skin in the winter so
this is perfect and my two favorite
scents is the eucalyptus and I also like
the lavender which is in my bathroom
right now but I kind of alternate back
and forth weekly between those two
scents Bastas like I went crazy buying
essential oils after I bought like this
whole pack of like 12 essential oils on
Amazon
I've been like testing them yeah it also
makes your room smell good so it serves
like dual purpose oh my next home item
I'm like my favorite thing in the world
isn't in my heating pad I'm just gonna
go ahead and show you and then I'll
explain so this is my heating pad it's
my favorite thing ever and at night I
like to turn my air conditioner down
super low wrap-up and that thing I love
it so much and that one actually is the
timer on it so if you fall asleep it
shuts off automatically it's great for
if you get bad cramps if you're sore
from a workout or just want to like get
super comfy and under a blanket watch a
movie and put the heating pad on a
couple of valentines days ago I asked
Ryan he was like what do you want
repellent in√©s day and I was like I
want a heating pad so I got a heating
pad and it finally broke and so I
ordered this one and it's soft and it's
just really nice so you're like me like
a grandma then you would love you
the yule of heat my next home autumn is
my JBL speaker if this is so dirty I'm
embarrassed it's waterproof so it's
great for when I'm in a shower and I'm
listening to an audiobook or a podcast
while I'm getting ready listening to
music while I'm cleaning these make
great gifts too if you guys are looking
for a gift for somebody these make
really good gifts I think that's it for
my home stuff um makeups so um I get a
lot of questions about my lipstick and
I'll just show you guys kind of what
I've been doing lately on Tarte salt
life I will put Milan ease and that
naked over it so you get this really
nice kind of purply like mauve purple
color and then over it you get this
really pretty matte okay so it's almost
like a purple pink with a like a matte
finish not too dark not too light it
gives you a nude color but still some
sort of color so that's what I love
about it next is my makeup my eyeshadow
palette from Tarte I promise this isn't
sponsored by chart I've I've never had a
sponsorship with Tarte I just love their
makeup I've been trying to transition
all of my products and took cruelty free
and this is my favorite makeup brand so
or that I had found that is cruelty free
so is this eyeshadow palette and not an
eyeshadow person at all so I usually
just have one for the whole entire
season and this is perfect it's got just
all the colors that I would need and fun
colors it's got just basic colors so
really good it for makeup what's next
let's do um skincare yeah for skincare
and beauty I guess I've been using this
Josie Maran Argan exfoliating powder
I've been using it twice a week and it's
so nice it's actually it's it's the
powder and you just mix it with the
water and it just removes any dirt any
makeup only thing is sometimes I won't
get enough water and I'll put it on my
face and I breathe in the powder and
like choke to death in the shower if
you're careful not to choke it doesn't
smell amazing but it works really well
and to me I'm not like a huge smell
person when it comes to products so it
doesn't really bother me next is my
origins plant description anti-aging
serum and I have never really gotten
into anti-aging until recently this is
my first anti-aging product I guess you
could say my mother told me always start
early always start in your 20s using
anti-aging and I never listen to her
until now she's gonna be proud me my
neck skin care product is my Kiehl's
midnight recovery concentrate I went
into keels and asked the woman like what
is your most popular product for kind of
an overnight serum won't make me break
out or get oily or feel gross like
sticky in the morning she showed me this
and I can see why this is their best
product so good only been using it for a
week which I know is like no time and
skincare product but I'm really starting
to look for items that I'm gonna be
incorporating into like a weekly I hate
just alternating skincare routines
constantly constantly so I'm looking for
products that I want to stick with and
mostly brands that I want to stick with
um some kind of just trying to find a
good skincare routine right now but
this will definitely stay here as day it
is my good old lip balm and by Mary Kay
and this is the only thing that works on
my chapped lips
in the winter time I'm pretty sure I
showed you guys this last year this is
probably my like eighth tube that I've
gone through my grandmother in Texas she
knows somebody who sells Mary Kay so I'm
like Hello I need some more lip stuff
next are my deodorant boy those of you
who only use natural deodorant you know
what I'm talking about
that wet feeling you get when you put
deodorant on and you're out you don't
have Bo and it doesn't smell but your
pits feel like wet and also sometimes
just natural deodorant throughout the
day sometimes you just
it doesn't like completely lasts so I
always carry at least like six of these
in my purse all the time next is a
product that I have never used but my
life by her lookbook Facebook community
says that it is amazing so I went ahead
and ordered it we had like a huge long
thread about it and people were like
raving about it but it is the Indian
healing clay Aztec secret and it's
powder and Mazon reviews were crazy
incredible so I went ahead and ordered
it and supposedly if you mix it with
apple cider vinegar it makes it even
better so so excited you can make hair
masks out of it I learned so much on
Amazon in the comment section brush to
put it on with I don't know what it was
like an ad on things like Mina I
probably didn't need that maybe well
I'll let you guys know how much I love
it
it has the great reviews so I'm gonna go
ahead and trust everyone and all the
girls in the light bear community like
swore by it so is my cardamom my ground
cardamom I have been putting this in my
coffee has amazing health benefits and
it tastes like fall Christmas
Thanksgiving in my coffee
well usually alternate between this and
cinnamon used to go to this coffee shop
here in the city and I would get a
cardamom latte I thought it was some
sort of like syrup that they put in it
and then I was at Whole Foods and I was
like
wait cardamom is it isn't this I didn't
know what I thought it was a cop like a
coffee so yeah now I've been using it
and I love it
so now I have two pairs of shoes for you
that's for but this is to Everest are my
studded booties and I love these I get
in the habit of when I'm running out
somewhere I'll throw on just jeans in a
sweater and I'm like wow you're this is
boring Ashley what's going on so I will
throw these on and it just makes my
outfit so I think a good pair of studded
booties is definitely a favorite of mine
right now because this is kind of a
season where I'm just doing some light
sweaters just basic jeans and this just
makes your outfit even just like a basic
black cotton dress this shoe I mean this
style of shoe will take you take you bar
well I don't know about that but it
always helped your office and my last
shoe is this guy from Nine West and you
know I'm gonna be honest it's not the
most comfortable shoe it's so cute it's
got burgundy piping it's got this cute
detail on this little button detail and
yeah I just point each other like super
pointy Joe um I know that burgundy is
always such a big color in the fall so I
think you know having this piping really
ties in like a burgundy sweater and
jeans wow I just blew through that I'm
really tired of hearing myself talk and
I'm sure you are too so with that being
said I'm gonna in this video now I
talked about the life by her lookbook it
is you always talk about is the Facebook
community but it is an actual magazine
that my team and I put together every
month a really cool community a really
cool magazine Nicole process so we now
have an app it is ready for Android it
is not ready for iPhone yet I'm gonna
put the link below and also here if you
want to learn more about it you can read
up on it read some reviews so many
questions don't um if you have any
