going to be all about my favorite
drugstore foundation I haven't had a
drugstore foundation in years
so when I found this one I thought it
was too good to be true I was thinking
so I don't have to pay forty five to
fifty dollars from my foundation anymore
so this is all I've been using for the
past two weeks I've been obsessed with
it and I just kind of wanted to make
this video to tell you guys why I love
it so much and then at the end of the
video I'm going to do a quick like
run-through of me applying it and then
building on top of it so my amazing fine
with the Maybelline fit me foundation I
got it in well I talked about this when
I actually do the tutorial but really
quick I actually got two colors because
I don't know well I do know they were a
buy one get one half off and one was
actually too light for me and one was
too dark for me so I just got both of
them and made my own little concoction
reason number one that I love it so much
is that it goes on really really smooth
I normally apply it with my foundation
brush and then use my Beauty Blender to
kind of smooth it out even though it
goes on so smooth already I really don't
need my my Beauty Blender have you ever
like left your house without like
putting on your bra that how I feel when
I don't use this guy my Beauty Blender
because it's just part of my routine
every day so I normally just use this
regardless anyways we are getting off
track we're talking about bras and
beauty blenders number two being that
the color is so perfect I actually took
my NARS foundation into the drugstore
with me to try to match the color and
I've done this so many times before oh
yeah that's the same that's totally
going to work and then I get home and
it's like dark and it looks ridiculous
so this foundation
actually what it appears to be so you
can even like hold it up to your skin
and it's like okay that works
you know because you can't test these
out in the drugstore even though I do
some time number three which is a huge
one for me is that it stays on all day
so a lot of the time during the week I
need my house it's seven or eight in the
morning and I don't get home until you
know seven or eight at night so for it
to stay on all day is such a big deal
for me this was like a no-brainer for me
to use this every day almost just
because of that reason and I'm sure you
guys can relate to that enid shows after
you've had a hard day sometimes I feel
like I get in my elevator and I look at
myself in the mirror and I'm like what a
hot mess I did not look like that when I
left the house this morning
whew number four is that it gives you a
really nice matte Photoshop look which
kind of goes back to number one being
that it goes on so smooth but it stays
smooth looking when you put it on it
really covers up any blemishes or dark
circles that you have it's been really
humid here in the city lately so I've
been kind of I guess like breaking out
because of it had a few little blemishes
um where I put my bronzer and this
really covers it up without irritating
it I hate putting makeup on over a
blemish because I feel like it's just
making it so much worse um I forgot what
I was saying and number five is that it
gives you a full coverage without it
being cakey so as you guys know I know
I've talked about this before I normally
don't do a full coverage in the
summertime but this I would actually
kind of call this a full coverage
foundation but it doesn't feel like it
and it doesn't look like it which is
amazing because I don't want makeup
picked on my face when I'm sweating my
butt off so anyway it's like I'm I'm
where I'm wearing it right now and I'm
going quite a bit just so you guys like
see what it looks like I don't feel like
I've got a face full of makeup on it's
like a really refreshing almost like a
moisturizer feeling it's great
and last but not least it is so
buildable if you guys are like me and
have dark circle and a few blemishes
here and there I like to put on my
foundation and then I like to put on a
concealer over it and sometimes if you
have kind of like a cakey foundation
your under-eye concealer kind of like
sits on top of it everything just kind
of built without it looking like you're
just piling on one thing after another
after another
I obviously love it for that reason as
well because concealer is a part of my
everyday makeup routine and if you
haven't subscribed yet go ahead and do
so I will place the link right here so
it's just easy to click on and all right
so let's get to the actual makeup video
it's going to be really quick I just
want to show you guys you know how I put
on this foundation and then how I build
on top of it and how it still has that
flawless coverage let's get to it so I'm
going to take my Real Techniques
foundation brush and I'm just going to
mix the two colors together
then I'm going to take my beauty limiter
and just kind of blend everything in
Oh
that is the end of this video and I hope
you guys really enjoyed it and I hope if
you were looking for an affordable
drugstore foundation that this was the
answer for you definitely give it a try
I love it it works for me I'm going to
put this subscribe button right here one
more time in case you missed it the
first time and that is all for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
