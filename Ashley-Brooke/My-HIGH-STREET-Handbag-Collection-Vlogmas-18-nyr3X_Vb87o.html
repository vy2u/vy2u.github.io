morning guys I just sat down to do my
makeup get ready for the day just got
vlogmas edited it is now exporting I
mean uploading into YouTube today I'm
filming two outfits outside for how to
style on Sunday how to style is coming
back we just had the worst luck with how
to style because first Ryan's parents
were here then I was sick that whole
week and then it's noticed so we're
finally getting it back - did I lose my
mascara in the bathroom yeah dang it
alright just opened a new mascara it's
always the best feeling actually I don't
know about that I never liked my mascara
the first two times I use it I'm trying
to get all of my filming stuff in order
in line before we go home for the
holiday the perfect day to be shooting
outside because I think it's in the 50s
actually kind of waiting for today to
start shooting because of the weather
few days have been in like the 30s so
that is not fun to film in today is the
fifth day of my brows and so far still
no itching or sores so we're doing
pretty good in that department
that's how windy it is outside right now
so we just filmed one look and we are
going down right now to film the second
look and I'm not telling you anything
else
given the way any of the outfits because
I kept getting in trouble for that I
think it was last laught most people
were like I want to be surprised so
you're going to be surprised but Jenna
is almost here she's gonna watch Stella
while we go film the last look and
tomorrow I'm gonna film the sit-down
talk through and then the hata style
scarves for winter is wrapped up I'm
getting hungry
I want lunch like the food is I can't
grab a wire since we are currently in
stock with my favorite bars did I tell
you guys we got another box we have two
boxes of these now we need two we needed
a stock up for Texas so poor Jenna had
to get an uber she was walking here from
Fifth Ave and she had to get an uber
because she's wearing her new Doc
Martens and she said they are like
hurting her feet so badly
well Ashley and Ryan are shooting I'm
just working on the lookbook but Stella
he's staring at me
she wasn't staring at me for like 20
minutes
what are you doing are you just gonna
stare at me oh hey no nope yeah
I just edited yesterday's vlog missed
and realized how an eventful it was so
we're sitting here trying to think of
things to do today
so I'm eating
um this is us eating I asked them so
stories what you think we should do
today Missy text me and said five minute
makeup challenge or the no mirror makeup
challenge but we both have makeup on so
they said spoonful of condiments
challenge and I said nothing area no
nothing goes in my mouth no condiments
alone go in my mouth there's so many
challenges oh wait we've got some
stories here talk about the worst gift
you've ever been given for Christmas
person yeah look how I packaged it like
you were in a hurry
no like I was in like fifth grade and it
was like a Secret Santa
you're like fifth grade you get a pass
for bad wrapping though and then some
only pulled me out for it oh I like even
remember what I got her but I didn't
have any tissue paper so I wrapped it in
napkins please tape it alright alright
well I don't know you never gonna move
like patterns was it at least like
Christmas patterns no go to Roosevelt
Island
hey film all of your bags rinds in the
bedroom right now I can't go in there
he's on a call with the client okay so
just got me in the stories I just
checked on what you guys want to see
and a lot of you said you want to see my
handbag so that's what we're going to do
first
yikes dies from today's filming all
right I just put all of my bags on the
bed so I'm going to just bring up a
chair pull up a chair sitting down with
not going to work so I think I'm just
gonna have to stand up I'm sure you guys
like this but the bag that I'm carrying
right now is this one right here from
Anthropologie and I love it because it's
round like the braided detail here front
and back these are the other two bags I
got that day my little leopard one
another little round handle bag really
nothing fits in here so I have to kind
of be careful like where I carry this
and then this big tote right here I
haven't carried this yet but when I go
home to go to Texas I'm gonna use this
as my travel tote and like my shopping
tote it's as big as my torso but I
really love it
I feel like I have so many czar bags so
let's get into those first it's just
basically black and white stripes has a
long strap pretty good for summer and
fall and just every season do more
little fun bags I have from Zara are
these two this one has little coins and
stars and those bugs so I just have
flowers on it like this is good for um
like spring in the summer that's good I
feel like I'm cleaning out my bag so I'm
gonna do like a spring and summer pile
and then a winter pile so I can keep
everything separated these are two of my
little embellished bags from Zara
so I've caught this one it's like velvet
with a lot of beading cool detail on it
this one is this really pretty deep
purple color but these pink doves it
looks like ooh got some pokey I love
Gotham pokey ah this guy black and navy
little bag also doesn't hold a ton
but it's really cute and I just think
it's fun and I love the strap on it
forgot about this one this is in the
back of my closet a snakeskin faux
snakeskin bag with red on the back so
this is really cute for fall and winter
um got some really cool colors in it
hold on to that for later huh
just black beaded super cute I carry it
this a lot in the summertime but I
haven't really gotten it out for winter
so I need to I think it's missing a bead
though I don't know I feel like you
would never know if it was missing a
bead because they're like everywhere I
love this red one a really pretty color
and I like all the details on it jus
more from Zara my little metallic
collection this one is just basic silver
this one has the gold and then on the
back is rose gold I don't know if you
guys remember I carried this all the
time in the summer and I actually still
really loved it there is this one that I
got last year it is like my Western
looking bag I don't really care this all
carry out this a whole lot anymore
because the clasp broke and this black
sometimes transfers on to my clothes if
I'm not careful if I get has a really
unique look to it another Zara Western
inspired bag is this one I don't know
why I haven't carried this oh the strap
is kind of short so I haven't really
carried this a whole bunch but I like
this the color is really pretty and I
like all the details it's just very
specific with what outfit you wear with
it in my last three from Zara my navy
Patton one like a really really dark
shade of midnight blue my floral one
that I just got not that long ago again
I haven't carried this because it's just
very specific it's not something that I
grab all the time this lion this is an
oldie but goodie I'm sure you guys
remember this one I just think the
colors are so cool and I really love the
seat belt strap on this one my - totes
from Target and I remember I got these
last year during Christmas because they
were all 50%
I got them all is Lee band-aid got a
bunch of people these those Christmas
gifts also because I was like these are
so perfect just like the perfect little
faux suede tote two more from Target
this one is my summer little summer
black tote you guys definitely remember
this one my little who what where
crossbody ring bag for a Topshop we've
got this little metallic guy very cute I
love this I like it more than my sorrow
one this one just looks a little bit
nicer this one always looks almost looks
kind of like Proenza and then this one I
wear this one all the time because I
just love the two different materials
but I probably found like $10 and change
in all these purses so do more from
Topshop this guy right here I love the
handle on this one it's really cute and
then this one I dropped this one the
other day and one of the pearls fell out
but luckily I found it so I just need to
glue that guy back in and then I can get
back to carrying this one this one from
Aldo pretty specific not something I
carry all the time but I really really
like this my gosh I have had this clutch
for ever it's something that I carry
when I'm traveling my iPad in it and my
chargers and stuff so I don't really
wear this going out it is pretty big
but looks like Alexander Wang I think
that's why I got it I think he got it
like in high school my desperately
wanted an Alexander Wang bag but my mom
was like I'm not know so this was the
next best thing I think this is from
like French eskas or something
do you guys know Francesca's then my two
ring bags from forever 21 love both of
these lost the long straps to both of
them but it's fine because I'm not
really I wouldn't really use it anyways
one from forever 21 it's just a plain
black crossbody bag
I have been looking for these well I
forgot about this I love this little
backpack really wanted this Stella
McCartney one but they were just too
expensive so this looks just like a
Stella McCartney so I got this mines
done and it was I don't know
thirteen dollars bought my little mini
olimpiadas I got this at a secondhand
store in Austin like a little
consignment shop it's not a birthday
candle and then three packs of honey in
it so I carry this one quite a bit
during the summer one from Melly Bianco
my little back from Free People
I sold I carried this one so much during
the summer so I'm kind of trying to like
rotate it around but I always end up
defaulting back to it because it's just
cute and little and it's like it has the
right amount of hardware on it white
bags this one is from forever 21 and
this is a good one I like the color of
this one it's a little too white to
carry during the wintertime but this is
good first summer this one it's the one
I got hmm
Wet Ones and wet ones and poop poop bags
that's funny
back is by Flynn and I got this one out
of Bloomingdale's a saline tote that I
literally carry all the time I don't
really carry this a lot in style videos
because it is so big and it literally
covers up my whole entire outfit but on
a day to day basis I grabbed this one
all the time
gosh my chapstick I've been looking for
this we'll have to change lots or
receipts this clutch that I got
Anthropologie like a metallic gold and
silver clutch it's really cool a hotel
keycard
loved this one from Target my who what
where I carried I carried this wooden oh
so much that I haven't really been
carrying it a lot because I like overdid
this once I've been trying to change it
up a little bit
my gosh this bag I've had since like
College because it looks think about
auntie no so I love this when forever21
my go-to bag in the summer my bag from
free people in my little basket basket
bag I don't know why receipts
smell weird yeah I love this I can't
wait to get this back out when it's
spring in the summertime is that's it
for my handbags back home in Texas my
Balenciaga which the handle completely
broke off so that's in Texas and my
diwanji bag it's cream oh my god you
guys are going to die it's cream and it
was beside that black suede is our bag
and the suede transferred all over it
was in the duster but some of the duster
had it slid off and it's just a solid
black on one side so that is in Texas as
well I tried to get it cleaned and they
just made it worse so it's completely
ruined still trying to figure out what
to do with both of those have a lot of
fun bags I don't really have too many
designer bags like that is something
that I definitely in the future want to
invest in and it's not a priority for me
right now at the moment I'm so happy
with the bags that I have but that's
what I've got right now and that's fine
I'm glad you guys suggested that now I
get to go put them back oh and I just
found this one look how cute this is

we're gonna turn off the camera go eat
dinner hello everyone welcome to
answering comments in bed a cold
beverage my phone it's messy after
shower hair I have my hair back and no
makeup I look like my brother all right
I just turned the camera off for a
little bit because I got on my phone to
answer comments and I was like that's
weird nobody has commented on my latest
video I go and look my video is not
there you're right and I did some
investigating for a little bit and some
panicking it seems that I deleted
yesterday's vlogmas I shot a video for
express they always want to see the
rough draft first
make sure that they're happy with their
clips then they'll give me changes
I'll make the changes upload a new one
so then I have two videos that are the
same when is the rough draft when is the
final a couple of times my rough draft
has gone live and so in order to avoid
that happening I go through and delete
all of my rough drafts
well I deleted what I thought was the
rough draft of Express but it was
actually yesterday's vlog it's are my
videos right here is a rough draft right
here right smack the middle of all my
videos and the thumbnails look the same
so I deleted it and I'm so pissed
because it literally takes so long to
edit those and that's just like a whole
day of filming three hours of editing
and didn't I wake up at like 6:00 a.m.
to edit that one yeah oh my god I'm so
mad at myself so that happened why can't
you just reload it Ashley well since I
am doing vlogmas I'm loading so much
content onto my computer on top of a 4k
style video 4k quality style video I
have to continuously delete clips as I
load them so all of the clips are
deleted from my computer they're still
on my memory card but I am not about to
re-edit that whole entire clock those of
you guys who missed it it was basically
me showing my favorite hair thickening
shampoo which is Nioxin I will link it
below so someone said Dana Dana has been
commenting a lot and I love your
comments Dana when I did purchase a blow
dryer and I saw you using your white
teeth ut3 blow dryer and you said it was
amazing now you were using the Harry
Josh can you please tell me which one is
better to buy I personally like the
Harry Josh because it is small and
compact the t31 I absolutely loved but
it was just too big to fit
in my drawer small apartment probs and I
already had a blow dryer so I actually
gave that one to my sisters and when I
go home and visit my family I use that
one so basically I'm just keeping the
t31 at home but Harry Josh all the way
love the t3 brushes I have the t3 round
brush and it is so good it makes my hair
feel really like I can getting a good
blow-dry good straightening blow-dry a
question from Kayla why do you pat your
lotion on your face instead of rubbing
it in rubbing actually stretches out the
skin and it breaks down all of the
collagen and the lasting obviously this
is overtime if you need to if you're in
a hurry and you need to rub your
moisturizer every now and then it's okay
but just don't make it a habit Kayla and
you keep that in mind as well over there
I mean it's okay obviously to do it
every now and then like I said but try
not to make it a habit I felt like a
mother is scolding her child and
especially the skin around your eyes I
know you're especially supposed to like
just gently Pat I used to be the worst I
used to be like I did research on it
because I loved doing research on things
after I hear about them sure enough been
doing it wrong my whole entire life it's
probably why I'm getting wrinkles right
here what is yours and Ryan zodiac sign
I am an Aries Leo what are you even you
are a Leo okay I wonder if we're
compatible
well somebody tell me about it if Leo
and Aries are compatible
I noticed you still follow plant-based
diet when you travel or go on holidays
how do you guys manage to do that even
when it's so tempting I need help with
tips
I let holidays trip stress as an excuse
to eat outside what I would really like
to follow as far as healthy food um I
really think it's just mind over matter
I mean no one's forcing you know junk
food down your throat I feel as an adult
you make decisions on your own
and I completely understand going on
vacation and just like wanting to eat
everything in sight I believe in
everything in moderation even when
you're not on vacation
I could eat completely healthy all day
long go to the gym and then have it
giant bowl of ice cream and like a few
cookies at night I just think it's all
about moderation and just listen to your
body if you're feeling like crap if
you're feeling sluggish then put some
healthy food in your body don't feed it
junk up I know vacations hard vacation
is really really hard but just mind over
matter you explain your bed situation I
just want to see if you sleep with a
duvet without the duvet cover and then a
formal comforter on top of it I actually
get this question a lot so I have just a
regular comforter the pintuck one that's
on my bed and then at the end of the bed
Stella's dreaming Luna wake up the end
of my bed I have a duvet with the duvet
cover apparently I'm saying Gayler wrong
Galah not gala not to be that person but
I thought it might be nice for the sake
of knowledge you are being that person I
think I've always said gala yeah I think
that's an American thing i've never
heard of gaul up someone commented
denise commented and said kimbridge
dictionary says gala for the US and
Gawler elsewhere maybe it's different
regionally in the US as well
alright thanks Denise Lindy's my car
I'll be your NYC friend my closest
friends don't live in the city either
and making friends as an adult is hard
Lindsey let's be friends let's go grab
coffee
I'm serious message me on Instagram
Steven Tyler's daughter that's my girl I
freaking love Steven Tyler I'll be his
daughter because because I have a big
mouth yep
actually this vlog is certain to inspire
a lot of young girls who are interested
in vlogging I'm curious what you majored
in and what your career goals are if you
don't mind me asking you have a great
work ethic
I majored in kinesiology I was going to
be a physical therapist but you know
after four years of working my butt off
in school and kind of having my mind set
on on top that's what I was gonna do
that was the career path I was going
take you know I kind of slowly started
realizing that my true love was for
fashion and I made you know a bold
decision to follow that dream it was one
of the hardest decisions that I ever had
to make because it's completely like
life-changing do I go this way or do I
go this way so I ended up just following
my heart in my passion and this is kind
of where I hit it up I guess so maybe
and my parents totally supported me you
know no one was weird about it everyone
is understanding I honestly you know
going back to where you said I have a
great work ethic that is one of the best
compliments that anyone can ever give me
because I was raised to have great work
ethic I've been working since I was 15
it was raised to if you want something
you go after it yourself nothing is
handed to you if you don't feel like you
were taught great work ethic lucky for
you you can teach yourself great work
ethic it's not something that someone
has to you have to have grown up with or
anything like that there are books you
can read podcasts you can listen to you
can motivate yourself to have great work
ethic it's just about setting your mind
to it and really being self aware of
what's going on in your in your life in
your surroundings fog mist tip maybe you
should film when you're doing more
festive activities and upload once a
week or every other week when you have
more material instead of daily vlogs
because your vlogmas seems very
repetitive and all work-related here's a
little tip for you how about you don't
tell me when to upload I have a tiny
channel which nobody ever watches I'm
trying my best
Oh Jesse everybody go watch Jesse Jesse
brighter BR a gr b ra de r dammit brows
on fleek
thanks Zoe often every time I look at
Zoe Austin's profile picture I want to
wear my Baker boy hat because she's so
cute in her picture everyone says that
you know glow layering pieces layering
basics are the best don't you wash your
face before going to the gym
Jim gim Jim whoa yeah don't watch it the
worst movie ever
I don't know I'm like I'm pretty easy to
please when it comes to scary movies but
I thought it was pretty scary I screamed
out loud once do you usually give Stella
a bite of food of the food that you make
no definitely not
I put in her dog food i mix sometimes
apple sauce sweet potatoes
Kuwait's what else do we put in Swiss
Della's food no more cheat codes for
cents
you make me want to change my diet so
badly this is my let there be glam she
always comments I love her I love what
you make it always looks yummy I'm
scared because I'm beat
thanks to my mom I'm the pickiest person
on the planet any tips honestly it's
just about trial and error like you're
just gonna have to try a bunch of
different things and combinations and
see what you like and what you don't
like it's a process yes Ryan let your
beard grow let it grow the beard is gone

attention about my audio is unbalanced
