I am shooting a video all about my hair
care routine as requested from you guys
you know if you guys are the same way
but I feel like my hair gets immune
system products if I use them for a
while so I have to hair care routines
that I switch during the week I usually
wash my hair twice a week so I'll flip
flop each time quick side note I was
shooting in my bedroom but there's this
row hanging from like my window I'll
show you guys I'll like post a clip of
it and not that long ago I was laying in
bed on a Saturday morning and all of a
sudden sees two men in this window
washing like cart slowly I just started
coming up my window and I'm in bed and
like hey mom this is awkward
everytime that rope goes up I like
scramble into the living room because
I'm like afraid someone's just gonna pop
out in front of my window hey kiddo
stranger I'll swim to my bedroom let's
start with my favorite haircare routine
all my favourite products and just FYI
this video is not sponsored these are
products that I actually just like
absolutely love using and it's like the
only thing I use my first haircare
routine are these guys this is my
shampoo and conditioner and I actually
found these at t.j.maxx or I think they
were $5.99 each and I only got them
because they smelled so good and it said
it's for severely damaged unresponsive
hair and I would like set me and trust
me I have a cabinet where shampoo and
conditioners go to die this will live on
forever I will keep buying it it's my
favorite and the brand is theory I guess
eh yo RIE so it's theory and it's argan
oil ultimate reform shampoo and
conditioner for severely damaged
unresponsive hair my shampoo and
condition my hair with this stuff and
I'll give you a little close-up so you
guys can see what it looks like even
though I will link it blue so please
don't spill and then ask
I get out of the shower and I towel dry
my hair I spray this stuff on it it's a
miracle Canet
miracle leave-in sprays surprisingly
another t.j.maxx fine looks trapped
would have had a really slippery floor
and oh my if I could just like just try
to smell it it's oh it's so good and
then I get my blow dryer and a small
round brush and I just round brush my
roof I don't blow dry my ends because I
just like the left heat on it the better
I get a small round brush versus a big
round brush because I feel like the
smaller one grips it easier so it is
hold it tighter so it's kind of slow
drives a little straighter and if I were
to have a big round brush I feel like a
big round brush is better for creating
full waves when your blow dryer after I
just blow dry the roofs
I left the end kind of air dry all night
I sleep on it I don't put any more heat
on it and then the morning is when I do
my curling iron and you know kind of
more of this styling process then that
usually lasts me like this is day number
four before I head out the door every
morning I spray my living proof humidity
shield because humidity shield I have
super frizzy hair when it gets humid and
in August New York City if my hair is
like a bush a full blown hot mess this
stuff smells really good
look it almost acts as a dry shampoo I
think it's what keeps my hair to where I
only have to wash it once or twice a
week so um this is like a must I love
this and my second routine my second
group of products are my John Frieda
Frizz Ease flawlessly straight shampoo
and conditioner these just make my hair
feel like after I get out of the shower
and I do the blow drying process it
feels so soft so smooth like there's not
one hair out of place
then after again the shower same process
UPS I put on my cheek Harriton leave-in
conditioner and let's also smell inland
in the same process I only blow dry the
roofs let the ends air dry all night and
then wake up I'm style the next day so
those are my few routines my two
different products routines for fixing
my hair and if it is going to be raining
or I know it's going to be extra humid I
will throw on some of this living proof
nourishing oil it is also from anti
frizz this is awesome but it's an oil
treatment so I only use this stuff maybe
once a month and I only put it on my end
so this is good to have if you just are
looking for a really good oil treatment
just to recap same exact process just
different products I just fit everywhere
if you guys follow me on snapchat you
would have seen the shampoo the
conditioner and the coconut oil spray
because I added that into my random
t.j.maxx haul on snapchat then you
probably already have seen this product
so that is all I have for you guys today
that is how I keep my hair looking fresh
and plain well not so clean like right
now it's like a little not clean so I do
not stray from this routine this is my
only haircare routine that I'm using
obsessed with it every now and then I'll
do a coconut oil treatment but other
than that this is my go-to this is what
works for me so don't forget to Like
subscribe and share with your frizzy
hair friends but so tell them that just
feel like hey I found this hair care
routine that I really think you would
like now that your hair is frizzy or
anything but just try it so love you and
