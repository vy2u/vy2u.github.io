I'm shooting a closet tour this was
definitely one of my more recommended
requested not recommended
one of my more requested videos so while
living in New York City you're just kind
of expected to know that you're going to
have a small closet this is actually an
upgrade from my last apartment my last
apartment was like I had this much room
so today I'm going to be showing you how
I organize my closet the rest of my
clothes my jewelry and cool tips along
the way that hopefully give you some
inspiration yeah let's go ahead and get
soda
these are my two closets right here well
not my people office but these are the
two closets that I'm working go ahead
and get started with - number one inside
of my door right here I keep my purses
that I am grabbing the most so I've been
going to the pool almost every weekend
because it is summer so I keep my cold
ID and like my shopper tote right here
keep a quick little grocery bag here so
if I need to run to the grocery store I
can use this and then my black tote
stays here because it is something that
I grab a lot as well I like to keep one
hook here just to keep things advice and
grabbing a lot lately
easy access ready to go this little tiny
section are my dresses and I like to
section them off by sleeve length and
then by color like to do a sleeveless at
the beginning because it is summer so
I'm grabbing more sleeveless things than
I am long-sleeve I like to do this
because if I have a sleeveless dress
that gets stuck between two long sleeves
chances are I'll probably overlook it
most of the time all of my sleeveless
dresses right here ready to go and then
I do my short sleeve and then my long
sleeve and then here in the corner is
where I keep my overalls my comfy
cardigan sweaters my sweat suits just
things that I like to grab kind of like
when I wake up in the morning or after I
shower at night just something
comfortable to lounge
on this side I have all of my my pants
pretty much everything - my jeans and
the front
it's my skirt and then it goes to
joggers flares more joggers and then my
leather stuff is in the back because I'm
not grabbing that during the summer so
when it's wintertime I'll obviously put
like my leather stuff in the front like
to hang them on these four here the
hangers feel like it just really keeps
everything in order that way when I'm
looking from the side I can see exactly
what is on the hanger let's double up on
these hangers so if I've got two denim
skirts I will probably hang both of them
on the same hanger that way if I know
I'm looking for a denim skirt I can see
both of them very easily right there
together this door right here has all of
my my leg slats and my slides it'll have
some booties just because these are my
summer booties that I will grab and go
when I'm wearing denim shorts so I like
to keep them visible and easy to go
right here another tip I have for you is
definitely some sort of over the door
shoe hanger and my last closet all of my
shoes were kind of thrown in the floor
and it's just really really easy to miss
so even if you only have room for one
take the pair of shoes the pairs of
shoes that you are the most and put them
all right here and it's so much easier
to grab
moving on to the show here on this top
shelf I've just got some taller booties
that I'm grabbing more oft in the summer
because they really stick out in this
thing these are just much easier to grab
and go right here on this little top
shelf
well my bags are going to be up here on
this middle shelf I kind of organized
them to again easy access all the bags
that I'm grabbing right now at the
moment I put in the front
so obviously this straw bag I'm grabbing
a lot of summer so it is ready for me to
go right here actually I can probably
put this here because I do grab this
multiple times a week but like my gold
Balenciaga my denim backpack all of my
Browns and my res ready to go right here
and then all of my like suede and more
wintery bags are going to be in the back
as well as my nighttime clutches that I
don't need so much this middle shelf
right here is definitely one of my
favorite things in my closet it has got
all of my jewelry so I got this thing
right here from Urban Outfitters and it
holds some earrings some necklaces all
my bracelets are in the bottom it's just
really easy to grab and it's really easy
to see because it's so tall I love these
little acrylic cases you can get these
on Amazon
another great Amazon purchase I like to
put things that get lost easily so like
smaller earrings maybe things that I
don't wear quite as often but still want
to be able to have access to whenever I
need it but this thing is from Bed Bath
&amp;amp; Beyond and it just holds kind of
necklaces that I'm wearing a lot right
now again super easy in my vision
ready to go whenever I need it it's a
little snug holder that I also got from
Urban Outfitters and have very much on
it right now but this is really
convenient for when I'm needing
something super quick I can see
everything really easily ask my little
bowls and these have some air jackets
that don't go on the earring holder and
then as well as some rings and bracelets
that I'm grabbing
so than my other stuff drop my perfume
holder this one is this is some target I
believe I'll link everything below so
you guys can see but this holds all of
my perfume I used to store my perfume in
the bathroom but then I read somewhere
that it needs to say room temp or else
it loses its scent it loses it witnesses
uh potencies don't want that perfume is
expensive so I keep all my perfume right
here at heat Brian's Cologne
kind of in the back somehow it keeps
ending up right there but yes so on the
shelf I have my microphone that L'Oreal
sent me during Fashion Week last year I
just thought it was really cute and
quite cheap in there I also keep my
YouTube 100,000 subscriber play button
this is one of my most favorite things I
own if you keep blister guards because I
usually keep them in my medicine drawer
my medicine cabinet in the other closet
but I always forget to grab them so
whenever I'm picking up shoes this is a
good reminder to pack extra in my purse
just in case I need them so recommend
keeping these in plain sight like
actually with your shoes so you can
don't forget these and we've all been
there where we're out walking and you're
like oh I need bandage on this shelf is
all of my denim again all of the denim
that I'm wearing right now is going to
be in the front and then in the back is
more of like my winter down you know I
go through phases where I'm wearing more
done in the mothers so I'll definitely
rotate my denim out to kind of what I'm
liking right now this bottom shelf I
have all of my attention stepped-up I
usually try to keep them color-coded but
it's just really hard to keep that up
so they're all folded right here it easy
for me to see on my two drawers my top
drawer has all of my belts in it if
clear bends are so easy from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond I just went and I bought like ten
of them and I still have some extra ones
but they're so nice to have in case you
need to create a new chore if you start
to accumulate a lot of one certain
things they're so easy to have the
bottom drawer is all of my scarves
unlike my turbines and my hair ties more
so like those types of accessories in on
the very bottom shelf the family soft
bench plus booby pad Bend these are all
of my environments
yes we share Docs and have families
often but obviously like some like these
are my comfy socks but you know we for
the most part share like ankle socks and
stuff like that and you know it's easy
to tell who Institute so we thought we
would save space by creating family lock
pin so here it is highly recommend
journey three dresses at the very bottom
I have my pin of basic tees so instead
of hanging them up I have them all
folded color-coded in a bin heap my
favorite ones hanging but for the most
part I keep the rest of them folded
because I have like six or seven like
white tees black tees great ease and
they all serve a purpose but for the
most part I keep my basic and my
favorite ones hanging in the closet here
I have all of my hats so I have my
fedoras are all stopped in one stack and
then my baseball caps are stacked right
beside it I have my winter ones on the
bottom obviously you know you want to
keep your summer ones that you're
grabbing more of on the very top and
then you are felt wool ones on the
bottom
now onto closet number two this is the
right size of the closet and I actually
grabbed this one from Amazon as well
it's more of like an extra large size
for men's shoes so if you guys want to
read you your closet and you know your
husband or boyfriend needs something
like this this does come in extra-large
so that's why I super helpful also
cleanses sooner get distracted first I
will start out with this thing right
here this shoe rack is from Amazon and
it has been such a lifesaver it holds
twice as many pairs of shoes as the one
with the slots in it so I love this just
the tip if you are planning on ordering
it my door is two inches thick and it
only comes with one and a half inch
brackets so I actually had to reach out
the company and they send you for free
like extra long ones so definitely do
that if you do order this and measure
your first I don't really organize my
shoes in a certain way just whatever
makes the most sense room wise not so
much like color coding wise because
obviously I don't need to color code my
shoes because I can clearly see them so
that's really not that important to me
moving on to moving on see the clothes
and so up here I've got a random pair of
heels I don't know why these are here to
put my gym shoes up here because I do
brought them every day so it's just easy
for me to grab you're in their own place
ready to go for my clothes I've been
separated the top shelf is going to be
all my printed tops and then the bottom
shelves are my basics and my outerwear
my like summer outerwear so hard to keep
printed top and color coded because
there's colors everywhere it goes into
sleeveless and short-sleeved again like
I said with the dresses if I put a
sleeveless top in between two long
sleeves chances are it'll kind of get
eaten and I want to see it really really
recommend doing it by sleeves then doing
it by color a lot of people at color
really doesn't even I'm so OCD so it's
more of like a visual thing for me to
keep it color coded I don't think it's
necessary unless you're a crazy person
like me then it makes you look so happy
the little things you know fun shelf I
have all of my like button downs my
basic whites my solids and I really
don't have I have too many whites solids
obviously Dara was making fun of me so
hard and I was like everything serves
its purpose you all serve a purpose
they're all different like to keep my
outerwear on one side I put it on the
right side just in case I need to grab
something to throw over my outfit and
then I've got my basics my t-shirts also
color coded also by sleeves before we
move on to the next segment I just
wanted to show you guys a little
something that Ryan does which is really
helpful he buys anything new he keeps it
in the front of his closet sometimes if
you buy something new you can forget
that it's there so you want to make sure
that you're wearing your news
and you're enjoying it before you know
you put it away and you're like oh my
god I totally forgot I bought that I do
that all the time I did it with the
shirt the Ryan tip put your new in
the printer glove is because I don't
have a dresser to put my clothes I will
show you where I store my underwear my
PJs and all that stuff all of that stuff
goes in these bins underneath my bed for
I need it I just slide it out this is
where I keep all of my bras so I'll fold
up like my padded bras right here and
then all of my lace bras are folded
right here obviously I only wear these
waist bralette so that's what I have way
more of I'm saying with all of my
workout pants I like to roll them up and
put them in this bin a hall closet in
the front of the apartment
that n I have a storage unit that I keep
offseason clothes in so you definitely
want to make sure that you're not
keeping your sweaters and coats with
your tank tops and your bathing suit you
want to keep your seasons separate
something that I do recommend if this
video inspires you to do a complete
wardrobe clean up what I like to do I do
this once a year sometimes the things
are getting crazy I will do it twice a
year with each season but I recommend
taking every single thing out of your
closet this is like a Saturday's project
you have to just put it in your Google
Calendar re put it back in and you will
be it's like you have a whole new
wardrobe donate things that you do not
wear a little tip that I learned is if
you're on the fence about it put it all
in a duffle bag and then a month later
revisit it and if you didn't miss it
then get rid of it if you missed it and
keep it looking at some other closet
tours on YouTube and everyone has these
extravagant huge like glamorous closet
and I was like oh my gosh here's me with
my tiny little closet that has like
three rocks you can have the biggest
closet in the world and still be
disorganized I think no matter what size
your closet is if you have a system and
you have organization it's just as good
as having a giant closet so don't worry
about size in this case dice is
matter if you truly believe that having
an organized closet rather you do it my
way or your own way really plays a
really plays a part in your personal
style and the way you get ready in the
morning that is all I have for you for
my closet tour I really hope you enjoyed
it I hope you love this video I hope you
got some good tips I will link
everything I showed you most of the
stuff on Amazon the urban all that good
stuff I will link it below and let me
know in the comments what your closet
tips are and always like moving things
around and reorganizing so let me know I
will see you guys in my next video bye
so the last few vlogs we've been
starting out Saturday night dinner
making so but why why break it now yes
Ryan's doing lunges in the living room
