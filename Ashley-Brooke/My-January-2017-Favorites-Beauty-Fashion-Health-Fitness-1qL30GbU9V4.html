would keep blood through maternal
welcome back to my channel and I am
doing a favorites video today because I
haven't done one in ever I think I've
done one maybe in my whole entire
YouTube career which has been about a
little over a year so these are things
that I have been using for I know
there's just my favorites I just love
the all these things this is what are
those videos not opportunities
starving I'm going to start with my
bathroom type beauty products if you
love coconut oil and Paul that is
coconut oil you will love kawari my two
favorites from claipari are the coconut
milk and coconut sheer oil this is my
third jar I believe so I go through this
like crazy this is their coconut milk as
you can see I've already dug dug my way
to the bottom there in this one I use
this for my coconut hair mask I do one
every other wash we comb my hair with
the coconut oil put my special abilities
on for a coconut mask sleep on it wash
it out overnight I mean such a
difference a good coconut oil mask
inmate this is sulfate free cruelty free
non-gmo vegan then for the sheer oil
this is basically a liquid form of
coconut oil with a little dropper so
there we go if I had any dry patches
like especially in the wintertime here
in New York I get dry elbows and
sometimes my skin gets kind of itchy
clothes girls do a little drops of this
on any of my dry itchy spots and it's
just like almost immediate relief so I
love this and also if I get out of the
shower and notice that a little bit of
my makeup it's go on like my mascara or
my brow powder a little drop of this
just gives it right off this line I keep
using over and over and I will
definitely use this again as well so I
will link it down below also but if you
just go to Campari Beauty calm slash
Ashley
you actually get 20% off of your first
order so thank you to Co party for
partnering up with me and giving you
guys that opportunity for a huge
discount that such a generous discount
so again it my origin active charcoal
mask and I think one of these last night
before masks and buy a packet so anytime
I have an event the next day or like
something to do the next day I always
put this on and my skin is just so
amazing the next day like it makes my
makeup go on a lot easier it almost
gives me like it do we hide feeling love
it it's not one of those peel off our
compounds that like kill yourself layer
of skin off no one washes off with warm
water so clicking no pain safe bathroom
product is actually a combination of my
jordan span boil and my rose hydrating
serum by Valencia link it below so you
can see well as in this it's just like
so many different natural oils I've been
putting this on my face oh my gosh I
love it so much
basically what I do is after I get out
the shower or wipe my face using a toner
and then I will do my row serum and then
right before I go to sleep I basically
coat my face with the stuff and hey
they're shooting a movie down there
excuse me finding the extra after mixing
these two things together for a while
makes all the difference in the world my
skin isn't so soft so I'm loving both of
these products together hope to put your
oil run first or your moisturizer first
because I put this on a minute but I
don't know you guys tell me because I
feel like simulator next item use my
essential oil this is my lavender oil I
this on my pillow I just love the smell
of lavender when I'm trying to go to
sleep I don't know there's something
calming about it but I just do a couple
of drops of the sky of the same oil in
the peppermint form or the peppermint
oil in the bottom of the tub and when
you're in the shower
theme oh my gosh something so soothing
and relaxing about it I don't know you
have to do it it just clears up your
like head and you're know then you can
breathe and you just feel clean and
refreshed do not put it in your
bathwater
I put pepper monoi oil in my bathwater
thinking that it was going to be the
same effect
no I had places that were feeling weird
in places that you shouldn't feel weird
like very tingly and like didn't like it
at all the next are my 2's makeup items
and you guys have been asking me a lot
about my lips and what I'm putting on my
lips for the color and I have been using
Milani lip liner in the color 9 I can't
be right spice spice is the color so
I've been lying my lips and I'll line
them and then I'll fill them in like
little line and I'll put milania's
Rhodes fan lipsticks over that is my
good old hoola bronzer because I have
been using my Kat Von D shade + light
contour palette and it's almost out
forgot about it and then I used it and
then I remember how much I love this
stuff they're looking for a good bronzer
this is the to progress' that stuff
is awesome next or my to was kitchen
items I have first time coffee if you
guys are coffee lovers I have been
loving the love of the ugh coffee in
Santa Marta
single origin this stuff is the bomb I
just recently got a new coffee maker
that if I could carry it in here and put
it in my favorites video I would because
hey I'll say why I like it and I'll link
it below does for coffee so I can like
have a pot of coffee and also have an
espresso maker so I can make cappuccinos
lattes and espresso shots back to the
favorites back to the coffee this is a
great coffee I love it so it's like
keep it right now next is my vital
protein collagen peptides for most
beautiful skin healthy hair strong nail
that's why my nails have been growing so
much thank you join my manicure was like
oh my god your nails are so long and
strong and I was like I know I know in
tribute to a balanced diet helps
maintain weight supports joint health
I'll be mu digestive and central nervous
system so I will usually put this in my
smoothie after I go to the gym do a pack
this frozen strawberry frozen banana a
little bit of peanut butter and a little
bit of spinach and you can't taste it so
I love it and it if you even if you put
it in your water it doesn't give you
like you can't feel a powdery
consistency like it just dissolves
completely so I'm a real gaggy person
like I can't take vitamins and I can't I
don't know I'm just thinking abut so if
I can do it you can do them because
anything like this makes me gag if it's
like powder look I will do I have a few
clothing pieces that I've been loving
lately that I want to show you to
outerwear pieces and my first one is my
leopard coat so those if you guys watch
my blog you will know that I'm obsessed
with this leopard coat I pretty much
grab it whenever I leave the house
second gives my loop knit cardigan at
this pretty Pele color from forever 21 I
grab this one I need to add color to any
outfit click this really pretty teal
blue color and I just think it goes good
over any graphic t-shirt basic t-shirt
it just kind of add something to your
outfit because it's colored and textured
it needs to add some sort of print to my
outfit I go with it but even like this
with stripes actually so I would
definitely wear this coat with this top
to a little mixed print action I think
stripes and leopard is like a really
good go-to mixing of prints though
technically mine is too
25 I am NOT going to wear a leopard coat
something in the back of my mind was
like mm aren't limping these jeans from
American Eagle they're high-waisted
they've got a little bit of an uneven
hem and they're afraid so
they're perfect and I also got them in
the dark wash too I have been getting
asked a lot about my dainty gold ring so
I just thought I would play you guys
before I got them because I love them so
much and I need to order some more woman

ordered these from her years ago was
