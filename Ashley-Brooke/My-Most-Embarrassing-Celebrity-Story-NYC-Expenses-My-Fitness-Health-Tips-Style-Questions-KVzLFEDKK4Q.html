I'm about to go to work and Ryan is
headed to the Google offices today and
we found out yesterday that we get
resident breakfast here at the building
on the 43rd floor now we had no idea
this was going on I'm so excited so
we're actually gonna go up right now to
check it out really quick I think it's
like muffins and bagels and stuff but
that's really cool that they do that
turkeys I have this huge bag of clothes
right now because I have to stop at Zara
on the way home and like exchange sizes
and stuff so like carrying this giant
tote with me totes that's a total
excited oh my gosh wait we have to go
back to the apartment
brennon just that dance to do a Q&amp;amp;A
really quick and I'm asking you guys
right now on snapshots what questions
you have so Jenny on YouTube asked what
camera do you use to film who films and
edits and what software do you use to
edit the final product i use the sony a
5100 for everything dislikes my child i
love it with all my heart
ryan film i edit everything and I use
Final Cut Pro but this is from Sarah on
YouTube I know in one of your videos you
said how you studied community ology and
have strong interest in the body and
health would you be able to share your
healthy lifestyle habits or how you stay
in such great shape I will film a what I
eat in a day I've get I'm getting so
many requests for that so with all my
calendar it's coming very soon the best
advice I can give you is keeping on a
good workout schedule is very important
and I think it's whatever works for you
when it comes to the gyms you know there
is weightlifting there's cardio there's
intervals those different exercises work
for different peoples I think when it
comes down to it what you put in your
body is where it all stems from I always
encourage you to eat healthy and that is
where you're gonna start seeing results
in the kitchen the snapshot questions
are rolling in Sharon Sharon I'm so
sorry if I'm saying your name wrong I'm
the worst who wants to know what season
is my favorite season
hands down fall is my favorite season I
love summer clothes like I love like
putting on cutoff shorts a tank top and
legs going to the beach fashion wise
fall is my favorite I don't know there's
something about like crisp cool air and
like layering on sweaters and boots and
I don't know just thinking about it is
just like making me so hot
and then seen fall in a long time you
miss her
sure you miss her she's coming though
she is the comment oh alright I love you
in this draft filter you're so cute
what is the number-one staple that you
recommend for any closet oh do I have to
pick one I don't want to be so cliche
and say a white t-shirt
okay Ryan said jeans no I'm gonna go
ahead and say a white t-shirt and I
would say like a denim jacket
those are like it's season I couldn't be
wearing a denim jacket to go outside
right now because it's melting I would
say a white t-shirt because it's season
list you can layer over it and you can
wear it by itself you can dress it up
you can dress it down so I would say a
good white t-shirt it's like the key to
your basics
Olga from snapchat wants to know why
have you chosen New York for question
number one the first time I visited New
York was about I don't know it was a
while ago I think I was still in high
school and I left and I was like bad I
felt just like I missed it like I missed
the energy and I missed the people after
the fifth or sixth time of me just
visiting I was like I have to experience
living this lifestyle of constantly
going and just being in this environment
so I I just didn't know when you go
somewhere is you just know you want to
be here like you feel happy don't get me
wrong Texas will always be home but you
know living this life and experiencing
the things I'm getting to experience
right now is just exactly where I want
to be
Olga's next question is what is your
favorite trend of the upcoming seasons
and do I follow trends from the runway
so my favorite trends for the upcoming
season are definitely menswear inspired
pieces I love oversized things and I
love trousers I think making trousers
you know kind of
feminine with the top is like so cool
and so sexy so definitely menswear and I
love hope sleeves I don't know if
they're called Pope sleeves in real life
where your sleeve is like billowy the
cynic it's tight at the wrist so I love
tulle sleeve enjoy follow the trends
from the runways sometimes I do
obviously we all know that runway it can
be like super aggressive with their
style obviously it's just how they
present their line I tries to a take
what they show on the runway and then
make it a little bit more minimalistic
because that's just my style and she
said most importantly when is your
fashion line coming I can't wait you are
so sweet and just make like look at my
mouth I'm so happy look oh my god Hannah
from snapchat wants to know how do you
get into the fashion industry love this
question Hannah thank you so much I am
actually gonna make a full video on this
I really want to keep it super organized
and like step by step exactly what you
need to do so that video it's coming but
I like a lot of you guys have been
messaging me one on one about how to get
into the fashion industry with your like
own separate questions you wouldn't have
a personal combo just shoot me a message
and love Malia's wants to know question
who is your favorite subscriber I feel
like you're putting me in a trap Liliana
is not fair and it's also in like all
caps so I know she's like you're messing
with me please stop please stop Sarah
from snapchat wants to know is it
expensive to live in NYC yes yes
spensive of New York let's talk about it
really quick expenses of New York yet
the rent is it like it's like I can't
even explain to you how expensive rent
is and for what you get like look where
I'm sitting this is my living room
kitchens front door and back rooms hi
right
I don't have a car payment I don't have
to pay for gas I don't have car
insurance bitch knocks off when I'm
living in Texas a lot of my monthly
expenses though I feel like is that
balances out almost MetroCard for the
subwave is I think 110 a month and
that's for you just get unlimited rides
to the whole month so that's actually a
really good deal or you can write a bike
like Ryan and I read by most of the time
that's a really good way to save money
there are different ways to save money
you just have to find out what works for
you next question do you see a lot of
celebrities in New York but is your
favorite story so yeah I see a ton of
celebrities something that you see a you
know on a daily basis or weekly basis
about it you know not a big deal my
favorite story is I have been living
here for like I want to say a month
maybe just thinking out it makes me like
one of them it I was walking down the
street it was early in the morning I had
just gotten to work and I was like on
the way to get a coffee one of those
morning's where I just could not get my
 together like I could not get it
together I had like my makeup in my bag
and like my deodorants I'm walking down
the street I'm gonna get a coffee
I'm like okay I put my deodorant on I
grab my deodorant I'm like putting it on
because there's only me and this other
guy like walking towards me on the
sidewalk so I'm like no one's around
whatever this guy gets closer to me and
we're like this loves heart and it's
Jake Gyllenhaal and he's staring me
right in the face as I'm sweating my
deodorant on like shirt up and I just
like stop in my tracks about my phone
like here I'm on the phone with Ryan I'm
like my morning stop or deodorant Jake
Gyllenhaal right there Oh anybody when
you pick two gets better like it gets
better
two weeks later I'm sitting at dinner I
look over and Jake Gyllenhaal is sitting
in the booth that shares my booth should
I apologize was Yoda Hrant thing I tell
him I usually don't you lash whatever
did I'm in
to go to the bathrooms and I cut on
accident in front of the girl that he's
wibs and then she tells me that I cut in
front of her okay I gotta go so if I
ever see him again I'm just gonna do it
turn around and walk the other direction
so today I just filmed and got that out
of the way just at my cue a some very
bright what am i doing and look at all
these fools at the pool today look at
them just like having such a good time
man this zooms in really far this is
like creep level 500 that man is in a
speedo 100% oh and halt coming soon I'm
getting stuff that I need to do a haul I
don't wear these clothes really until I
have a haul so I'm kind of like do it
already so I can lay and start wearing
them alright so that is it for now I'm
gonna go shower and get dinner ready and
stuff like that

like starving so it needs to happen soon

great for any date occasion whether
you're going to dinner to the movies or
whether you're going on like a walk or
something I think this is like just kind
of a good all-around go to a date night
