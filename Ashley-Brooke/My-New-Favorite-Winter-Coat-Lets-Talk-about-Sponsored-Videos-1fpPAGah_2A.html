full clothes
he only folds his clothes and puts away
his clothes because he doesn't know
where any of my stuff goes so that's
about those reasons well why don't you
ask where my stuff goes instead of just
like it'll be on the bed and after he's
done all my stuff is still there and his
is all put away but it's a nicely
organized pile of her stuff yes the most
organized probably ever seen that's what

does this mean
yes absolutely maybe that means you get
a free wish all right first you gonna
wish that this salt is not bad number

very long all right well that was a
pretty shitty wish you could wish

Suja Ryan decided to go with the viscous
ancho chili flavor

oh man you're gonna like this one
convened is it like the right amount of
darkness yeah all right so before I get
back to work and then go to the gym I'm
gonna do a little bit of cleaning
because this week we've been home a lot
cuz we had a lot of stuff to do at home
this week so it's a little messy there's
like dishes and laundry and stuff like
that I just ran out at my favorite
candle burned out it will not light
anymore luckily
I'll remember how earlier you were
giving me such a hard time about not
drinking my coffee and that you are just
gonna drink it and then you put it in
the microwave and then you warmed it up
and go on go over you saying that's the
second time you've done that
like in two months for coal uh-huh okay
these parmesan crisps are so good they
are really hot though well they smell
weird in here like the fumes from the
floor cleaner so I just got done
cleaning like floors are clean laundry
is done like the best feeling ever so
then I put my gym clothes on and I'm
gonna get going cuz otherwise if it gets
any later I'm just not gonna go cuz
that's how I work for I go to the gym
I'm gonna answer a few questions
Polly asked for my tweet backpack is
from it is from Aldo actually but Zara
has a mini version right now cuz I got
the wood from Aldo last winter Zara has
a mini version it's the exact same thing
it's on their website right now
someone requested to do a what's in my
gym bag video and that's a good idea
definitely do that I don't even know
what's in there
you should totally make an apartment
tour of the entire building second I see
yeah we could do that yeah if I get in
trouble
mmm Kristina said that she did a coconut
oil and castor oil hair mask how do you
guys like castor oil that's so funny
that I just read that because I was
actually on Amazon
earlier today looking for castor oil for
different reasons for like hair girls
skin nails I heard it's amazing this is
hilarious be careful with who you say
money shot around I said it the other
day and got confused looks I later found
out it was a porn reference
hey I needed Google this oh that I
shouldn't have googled that at all yeah
you need that I have a couple of
questions how do you look so put
together after the gym and why don't you
take your makeup off beforehand are you
supposed to take your makeup off before
you go to the gym I don't know I guess
like I would never put on makeup just to
go to the gym but I also am NOT gonna
take the extra step to take it off
before I go to the gym my face doesn't
really sweat a whole lot my whole other
body does but my face really doesn't so
I don't know maybe you're supposed to
take it off I don't know help seconds
have you ever considered going vegan I
know you're into nutrition so I'm really
confused about how you aren't vegans I
feel like you can be healthy and
nutritious without being vegan not
really educated enough on being vegan
and vegetarian enough to really know but
I know that I love cheese a lot so I
think that would conflict with going
vegan actually really like vegetarian
dishes I love cheese so much and I think
that would be an issue for me cheese
vegan cheese right I'll show you guys
what we're wearing to the gym today
basically this is it my champion
thing I promise I'm watching this after
I wear it every time my forever21
my favorite pants in the whole world
pant I don't know what I'm trying to
pants like pants what I'm trying to say
this I just got from forever 21 the
other day it's part of their workout
line I like it because it covers my butt
and it's long it has a hood I'm obsessed
with this it's like cotton material and
then the pockets are like a different
kind of like workout material and in the
back is that same material so I love
this
you guys know what happens when you're
rushing out of the apartment to get to
the gym you spell foundation wrong in
your thumbnail YouTube panic mode when
something is spelled wrong
I put foundation it's Russian for a
foundation in case you didn't know and
dislikes already on my 5 tips for
finding the perfect foundation can you
dislike tips hmm
I love tips that's fine if you don't
mind tips
8 dislikes someone just like you tries
out saying that no more tip videos noted
YouTube I am watching I Love You Man
right now with Paul Rudd and Jason Segel
and I'm literally having my ass off
because it is so funny a really random
dinner situation going on to making an
adult grilled cheese because I don't
know what else to make so I thought it's
Friday why not go for it the dole
meaning that there's avocado in it and
two types of cheeses and unsalted butter
so I feel like it's a little more adult
but I could be wrong and I'm also having
an apple hummus and carrots and chips
and salsa because I'm just finding
things that look good to me right now
oh haha rhyme insulted Jim right now I
left before him so I finished before him
now I'm gonna eat and start editing and
then I feel like me to have a talk about
a little something called sponsored
videos stay tuned flop it to bed
a device the best said I was gonna get
my ship eating under control now look at
me
this is what dinner is looking like for
me tonight adulting super hard with
avocado two kinds of cheese don't forget
apples chips and of course
Brad's oh and some lemon sparkling water
look at that I'm getting the rest of the
bird meatballs I want you to guess what
I was watching earlier let me give you a
hint okay
I'm gonna job with my bunt now I got a
question for you what we slap in the bay
it's crying laughing because it's so
funny hey I don't know if you guys
remember but Paul Rudd is in our
Friendship Circle he is he's in DD one I
want you to be in our friendship our top
three celebrity Friendship Circle yes
this was all about you but this is all
about me you know that looks like dog
food okay I wanted to talk about
something really quickly sponsored
videos first of all I want to know what
you guys think about sponsored videos
say killing a lot of people have bad
taste in their mouth when it comes to
sponsored videos we just say and I know
I can't speak for anybody else when I
say this but I just want you guys to
know that I will not show a product
unless i 100% believe in it and think
that it's amazing so I posted a
sponsored video today and I'm not trying
to hide the fact that it's sponsored it
says it's sponsored in the description
but dermablend sent me that foundation
and I could easily said this product
sucks I don't like it I'm not doing this
video but instead I loved it and you
know what the first thing that came to
my mind was was oh my gosh I feel like
everyone would love this foundation I'm
gonna be completely honest but I get
quite a bit
of sponsoring video opportunities and
day it turned down about 95% of them
which I could easily say yeah yeah throw
me all of them I'll do them all like I
don't care That's not me that's not who
I am for example I showed you guys my
nutria my nutri ninja blender thingy my
ankle weights so many skin care products
that aren't sponsored so why is it any
different if I love a product that I'm
showing you that I think he would love
also I genuinely want to know so kind of
like startup in the comments what your
opinions of sponsored videos are because
so far I feel like I haven't given you a
reason not to trust me and not to trust
my opinion still let me know I really am
curious ryan's eating dream beause the
dream balls are going demolish all the
dream fireballs completely gone wow it's
all about black beans no mmm just a big
ol bowl of black beans mm-hmm okay
thing about sponsor videos is really
it's almost a disservice if you find
something amazing that can help others
and you just keep the to yourself
because you're worried about bad
feedback I would hope that my loyal
subscribers would have enough faith in
me to know that I'm not gonna be showing
you things that I don't truly love I did
a lot of research on dermablend before I
did this video but looking at before and
after pictures of dermablend for people
who had really bad skin problems and
dermablend I was just like reading
stories of people who the foundation
kind of transforms their faith and makes
them feel confident and comfortable in
their own skin and I thought that that
was so cool um you know so that's why I
wanted to share it with you and you know
I could have just done a video of me
putting my foundation on but instead I
added five tips in there to show you how
to find the perfect foundations so you
know I'm just noticing I'm getting a lot
of dislikes on that video when I'm
assuming that's why so that's not cool
but that's fine is that she really does
get emails like every single day from
companies that want to send product or
pay for product to be sponsored a lot of
them like 90% of them
our no-name companies that no one's ever
heard of that have crappy websites and
have no support links on them so yeah be
easy just to take the money or take the
product and promote it but what kind of
experience is up for you if that product
does suck and then you can't refund it
you can't talk to somebody who supported
that company there lots of opportunity
for sure but she's not gonna put you in
a position where you're gonna be on the
out and have about experience
exactly that's bad so high five see my
loyal subscribers who won't give me
about it I thought - you too
oh yeah 2008 we're eating ice cream and
about to watch a recorded episode of
2021
does it say my age that I was born in
the 60s this episode of 2020 is pretty
legit you guys have seen making a
murderer it's almost like the exact same
case so I think in another life I was a
detective this weird obsession with like
murder stories so tomorrow we're filming
how to style and I think I'm gonna style
sweaters because I've gotten a few
really good sweaters lately that like
I'm excited about so I think in the film
that tomorrow all right that mammoth I
guess who I talked into getting a mask
sometimes just go with mask man
sometimes you just gotta get hydrated
nutrition is key you should never be
ashamed of your hydrated skin absolutely
no I'll show you guys what I put on and
then what I put on Ryan so this is the
one Ryan has on it is the high</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
