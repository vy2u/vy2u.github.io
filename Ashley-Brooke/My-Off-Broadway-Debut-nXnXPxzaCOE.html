good morning guys
Stella and I just hook the longest walk
look how out of breath she is still
we've been back for like 20 minutes I'm
about to run to Ikea God again because
I'm kind of like I'm trying to finish
out the gallery wall and I'm gonna do
some bookshelves just like floating
shelves here to match the Shelf down
here I'm gonna get ready and we're gonna
go you're not coming to Ikea I can't
even take you the Starbucks I know
remember when you pooped in Starbucks
remember that day yeah you can't go in
any right now
New York City has been I'm sorry are you
embarrassed cuz I told everyone I made
it to Ikea we're gonna try to make this
an in-and-out type of trip that's what
they all say
all right this is what we've got so far
I'm afraid this thing's gonna be super
big nope
where is it it's that it was right here
hmm I just had a couple more things to
get and then I'm done
I usually reward myself afterwards with
a cinnamon roll but this whole like no
dairy thing kind of stands in the way
we are back from idea and I'll start by
showing you what I got I got two new
additions to the family well I just like
still have the pot I need to go get some
new dirt before I make the full transfer
but Jenna and I were walking through
this like big giant plant store on the
Upper West Side and they had a cactus it
was like this big it was huge and it was
bad it was like 250 dollars I would get
one as a baby and raise it it's probably
gonna take a few years but I feel like
it's more special that weighs shelving
unit here I got some shelves because
they were out last time so I'm probably
gonna stick these in really quick and
then we'll move on to another
thanks honey I'm in here building things
and Ryan's cooking breakfast for okay hi
didn't see you sitting here you guys
just even like go into it or just be
like look what we did it worked
perfectly the first time
what happened follow me
another one right here so we got the
shelves and the first time we put this
one on
I guess our toggle bolts didn't spread
out so I put like three books on it and
I was like oh yeah it's good I put three
more books on it
perfect that's three more and everything
fell it made a huge dip in the pool are
enough to get my wood marker hope you're
not watching this landlord I've never
seen toggle bolts rip out of the wall
so that was first so I tried to put a
picture on top of it
leaning I hadn't leaned it far enough
back like five minutes later it fell
broke everything helps fell the Shelf
stay though so that's good news it's
rich how long has this been to put these
three shelves up two hours right
probably
because of all of this we're gonna go to
the movies and see a scary what is it
all hereditary hereditary because you
heard really good things about it
you ready we all have a story to tell
and the more stories we share share your
stories getting more beautiful
like your pants same time
movies over thought I don't know what I
just thought what did I just watch that
was it I liked it because it's different
you like this video and Brian makes you
nauseous while you're watching this
video like you think I'm a shed Walker
we somehow made our way under the
scaffolding in this alleyway we're the
only ones here and I feel like I hope
though scared
yeah just want to be where the people
are
one of the
walking around on
Oh flipping your fins you don't get you
far where was I
but who cares
no big deal
I want more
flipping your pin 0 get super dead I'm
gonna finish it off I'll wait
0 minutes on the card you better hurry
video this way encore encore gonna get
the thumbnail up here
or skills now
I think you just gave yourself whiplash
why are you going this way this way is
home
parkouring on the NYC streets
you gotta mix it up you can't do the
same move every time
back to the gym showered ate breakfast
here comes Stella she hears me talking
they see you freakazoid and as you can
see I got this room cleared out a little
bit it's still not fully cleared out
we're gonna clear it out and then we're
gonna do something with it
just not sure what ya get like
everything else taken care of first
before we start doing another room
oh good today we just have work stop and
I thought it would be fun to just kind
of like bring you along during the day
so you can kind of see like what goes on
on a random date here day is so
different because we have so many
different projects going on hey guys
remember I'm sure you do during vlogmas
I was answering the comments at the end
of each vlog what if we started doing
that at the end of some of the vlogs if
I could like set aside some time to go
through and like answer comments the
vlog before so you let me know what you
guys think about and that has been going
on oh we got Stella a baby gate so now
when we leave we don't have to put her
in her kennel kennel training is a thing
and she does really well in her kennel
like sometimes she goes and like takes a
nap in her kennel she loves it but I
just really hate the thought of her
being in there for literally more than
two hours and I know that's ridiculous
or YouTube I never knew how wide I
opened my mouth when I was like doing my
mascara and other things remember my
first my very first makeup tutorial that
I filmed like a couple years ago I
didn't post it because I was like this
the whole time obviously is that really
how you put your makeup on so then after
that every makeup tutorial or routine
that I did I had to be like close your
mouth I've been doing
my whole life how does anybody love me I
don't understand I'm gonna go and see
you and about an hour and a half bye all
right I'm ready for the day you mean a
talk like that all day yes okay we are
running across the street really quick
because we're out of paper towels
laundry detergent and we're gonna walk
Stella so except still I can't go into a
tree so one of us always has to stay
outside with her while the other one
goes in
I usually go do the shopping because if
I wanted to get paper towels he'd come
out with like one little winnie-the-pooh
on it or something all right
okay let's go
leaving these two for a second I'm gonna
run and join read
get a few things for the girls get here
they'll be here any minute but I can
never push these doors they're so heavy
let's get basket because you always need
gorilla glue I feel like I said that
like seven times the sleep I wish I had
gorilla glue so I know I need it I think
the heater is on here yep and that's
what's going on a little worried cuz I
grab my shopping cart
it's wet I'm just wondering like why
like what is that hey guys jade has done
a sneak attack on us and gotten us a
present Oh team present whoa there's
food in here guys this is so sweet Jane
Oh what we all have things ooh it's a

and we're running into jewelry
but I just wanted to tell you guys
something
Jenna made this dress like actually made
it
right so but that's literally the only
thing you kept like you you kept this
leaves you did the sweetheart neckline
and there were like these big ugly
pockets that I can close them and I cut
them off and I like so

kind of strange um so I'm sure you guys
saw in earlier in today's vlog I am in
the process of making our collage wall

gonna come all the way to the floor and
we decided it would look cool if we
brought it up here to the track lighting

about okay I'm gonna show you what I got
some ASOS I got this dress from ASOS and
I absolutely love it's by monkey it's
this is one of my favorite brands for me
so should we switch places so you can
see in the light so this one is just
like an off-the-shoulder
eyelet dress I really love it but how
cute is this
but how it's super visible in the light
that a smile I think I can see your
teeth through the whole problem like
this weird stain and then also like it
looks like somebody cut it with scissors
you see this it's cuz you pissed me off
earlier so you were like oh I was gonna
wear it this week like I have it is fine
