style pack with me slash tips for
packing that I'm sure you guys already
know about I'm going to show you anyways
my routine for packing we're going to
Florida tomorrow Ryan and I are going to
Orlando where it's going to be so hot so
it's going to be a chill it's like a
family vacation so nothing crazy you
know no partying nothing like that we're
just going to be kind of chilling at
home at Grandma's house by the pool so
we're going to pack for that and my
routine that I like to do is I like to
pack all of my beauty stuff my
toiletries and then I like to do my
outfits laughs so I can like really
focus on what support I'm going to
definitely bring my fears
witch hazel toner just kind of gets
every bit of dirt and makeup just any
kind of residue oh this is actually a
new one because I just ran out use this
every morning every night I live by the
Spade toner next is my mask so I cannot
go anywhere without my dr. jart first of
all love dr. Dores and I also love the
Sephora brand clay mask because these
are actually really easy to travel with
because they're in these little pouches
with the lids on them next is my face
serum this is pretty much the only base
moisturizer that I'm using right now buy
it fresh and it is the rose deep
hydration base theorem it's specially
good for really warm weather because it
doesn't feel sick or greasy it's just
like silica the goes on and you just
feel refreshed very important is my acne
facial cleanser I feel like with all of
the sunscreen that I put on and all of
this sweat just kind of mix the makeup
um well so I have to be prepared for a
breakout coconut water cleansing wipes
from Sephora I take these on the plane
with me I keep them at my purse just
like on a regular basis they're just
good when you need to wipe down your
face if you feel kind of 20 or gross or
you need to take
make up off these are always great to
have when you're traveling and just for
life next is my protein powder
I find it hard sometimes being plan bit
too when you're traveling make sure
you're getting enough protein
so I actually randomly just have this
Burt's Bees chocolate protein sample but
I usually will put it in any protein
that I'm carrying I'm in a plastic
ziplock baggie and take it with me on
the plane and just make sure I have it
with me so I can I eat protein right
there so the Kings dispense it I'm going
to buy it when I'm out I bring obviously
sunscreen I'm going to bring sunscreen
and tanning oil this is by Sun bum and I
think this is a new product that they
just started carrying but if this one
has SPF 15 obviously I use a stronger
SPF all over my body
for just like regular sunscreen but you
know when I'm tanning I do like to get a
little oily so I will use this smells
like the beach smells like Hawaii so I
just like to close my eyes and pretend
and that is it for my go to beauty
products is going to be a super relaxing
vacation so I don't need to worry about
bringing like I don't even know I might
just bring BB cream at mascara for my
makeup I don't even know if I'm gonna
bother packing up all and hey hop
alright so I like to pull my beauty
product first and then we will start a
sedated
Oh
Tiger Gamble's table try rock your hair
don't sit on die
do you read resume cuz I can't walk away
you okay no I like to start know what
I'm gonna change lenses because that's
just going to make things easier for
everyone so much better right the
wide-angle since what I've got going on
right now I like to start with my
dresses because you know since we are
going to be kind of lounging by the pool
I'm going to probably spend most of my
time and dresses even during the day
just kind of hanging out so I want to
pack more dresses than anything so I did
this little two-piece three people set
it's got a skirt and a matching top so I
love this I love the color
super comfy and loungy hold these for
dresses right here this one is really
lightweight maxi tie tie dress and then
this is also a good one I love it it's
really white and airy and flowy this
orangie red pleated at the bottom dress
love to pack a white button-down draws
pretty much anywhere I go it's cute with
sneakers it's cute over a bathing suit
it's just kind of a really versatile
piece whenever you're traveling so I'm
not having to pack for daytime and
nighttime I like to pull dresses that
are versatile so any of those dresses I
can wear hanging out during the day but
can also throw on a pair of black heels
handles and go to dinner at night and
some jewelry so I want to make sure that
I'm not over packing that I'm packing
super versatile items here we've got our
top and our denim shorts this sheer one
printed solid and florally more like a
dressy top in case I wanted to wear that
out but these tops I can kind of mix and
match and make many different outfits
even though it's only seven pieces you
can make I mean endless outfits with
these pieces then I packed three of my
favorite bathing suits
I've got these two one pieces and then
this two-piece and then some of my go-to
sunglasses I've got my car mine's in
black and silver and then the
use white ones right here these dresses
I just packed these two these are just
bathing suit cover up and I like to keep
these by the pool if I'm you know
soaking wet or I need to run in and get
a drink or something I can just throw
these on and um you know bathing suit
covers and they fold up really small so
I thought why not after I pulled the
pieces and I'm dead set on taking and I
feel like I have enough outfit I will go
ahead and put everything in my suitcase
even my toiletries my lounge clothes my
PJs and then if I have enough room I'll
go ahead and maybe add a couple of more
dresses one more bathing suit make sure
that you're only packing what you need
to begin with and then you can go
through and add stuff in a little bit so
I will go ahead and pack all of this
I'll complete the outfits with some
sandals maybe two bags probably a
colored bag and a black bag that way I
know it's going to go with everything so
you're going to go ahead and get started
with the rolling muffin I know a lot of
you guys do the rolling method it's the
only way to go saves room do the roll
you'll love it
almost done packing and I've got a
little bit of room so I'm probably going
to add a couple of more dresses and then
I'll be set but no jeans and I'm not
overdoing it on jewelry such a jean
person that I'm always like oh I'll just
pack a pair of jeans just in case no
never going to wear jeans in Orlando in
the summertime
oh I'm just not going to do it I'll
never wear them there it is morning of
travels got my suitcase all packed just
wait it out right here
all good to go another must-have is a
neck pillow this one is from TJ Maxx at
a little tip is to buy these from places
like TJ Maxx because this is a sharper
image I think it was like thirty dollars
and it was marked down to like $4.99 so
yeah that is it for this video I hope
you guys loved it and picked up some
cool tips there will be a travel blog
coming soon for Florida so we will see
you there Sabrina what should we bring
