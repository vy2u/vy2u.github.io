oh my god I'm so thirsty help me I just
wound sweating stirrer damn we did a Q&amp;amp;A
and interest or EQ and a with Dara's
idea so we have so much fun we're going
to try to do Q&amp;amp;A zhan fridays one of the
questions that I kept getting siren go
ahead go ahead
one of the questions that I kept getting
was I get this question a lot about how
like I moved when I moved to New York
from Texas how I got my job what kind of
job I got and just kind of like asking
for advice on people who were in that
position and then wanting to like move
to a bigger city actually been in talks
with LinkedIn we've been trying to get
like a partnership together for a little
bit and I thought this is the perfect
opportunity because LinkedIn is the main
reason that I was able to get my job I
kept I was living in Texas wanting to
move to New York but I needed a job I
applied for probably like 50 to 60 jobs
and I heard nothing back and I was like
you know what screw this I'm just going
to get on LinkedIn and start messaging
like people who are already in the
company
so that's what I did first five messages
that I sent through LinkedIn
I got responses back and they got
interviews and I ended up getting the
job this was all in like a week so I
just feel that going straight to like
whoever your boss would be or whoever HR
is is the better way to go rather than
just sitting there and clicking the
apply button because they get so many
people applying on a daily basis so I
feel like it shows initiative and it
shows good work ethic if you are
confident enough and smart enough to
just reach out to the source so with
that being said there are three super
important key factors and number one is
your profile picture you want to make
sure that it aligns with the the
professional role that you're seeking so
for example if you're trying to get a
job in the fashion industry you know you
want to make sure that in your profile
picture you've got you know an on-trend
outfit but still professional and still
being able to see your favorite - is
your current position needs to be
up-to-date or if you're in school or
just starting out in the professional
industry it needs to be your school
criteria and it's also important to not
only list your current position but all
of your past positions you know people
like brands want to know where you've
been what you've been up to what your
roles were and don't be afraid to add
photos or videos something visual that
people can actually grasp onto and
really kind of get an idea of who you
are
as a professional individual and number
three is location so when recruiters are
you know narrowing down their search
they usually do it by location really
good way to be found so you definitely
want to make sure that you have your
location up-to-date so yeah those are
just some of my tips for upping your
LinkedIn profile like I said that is and
I know I've talked about this before in
a video like a while ago stop hitting
the apply button over and over find a
company you want to work for and
literally stalk the people that works
there
persistence I know one company that I
actually got an offer from
I sent the lady of HR a message five
times before she responded back to me
and you know they're not ignoring you
they have so much going on but they
forget so it's just kind of a reminder
like hey I'm here you know I thought I
was being annoying and I was like you
know what what do I have to lose I'm
just going to keep doing it sure enough
she called me box we interviewed the
next day and I got an offer the next
week so be persistent and I just don't
give up if you want to if you have a
company that you want to work for go
after it if you have a certain position
that you want and go after it
yeah I'm going to get to cooking I don't
know where I went and he disappeared
it's funny how he disappears on this
time to cook dinner we've got some
veggies going right here the getty
squash broccoli carrot I cannot believe
left um in my last vlog I use foil which
is the whole reason why Ryan and I
stopped using like we use aluminum free
deodorant so I don't know why in the
world I would put oil on my pan aluminum
thanks for calling me out in the
comments because I like wasn't even
thinking about it so so there's still so
many messages left over from Q&amp;amp;A on
Instagram let's go through some how
compact it is are I my mind is one those
are very compacted just four there okay

that I've built and created from
absolutely nothing and it's going
exactly where I wanted to go so I didn't
really even know that that was my dream
job until it started happening what's
your dream job besides being the perfect
house husband and I feel like we are
living what we dreamed about the long
time more balloon why am i coming back I
don't know I actually am from Armenia
well here almost no one knows about such
videos I have Tanya come on I watched
all your videos until my friends about
you I would love to know what is your
favorite movie and song oh no hardest
question ever what is your secret for
getting your nails so long I have
honestly I have no idea
I've always had a really long like not
long I like very strong nail I will say
last month when I had on that matte nail
polish it was gel matte it was like
thicker I guess so
my nails kept from breaking sometimes
that's just how they grew without
breaking
that make any sense to you totally fine
live in your hometown and I love your
videos oh how cool Juliana
hi how many years are you living
together six this year six in October
thanks in October that was clear oh she
Co has a vegan cinnamon roll recipe and
a vegan ice cream cheese icing recipe
and we're back okay what is your first
job after you graduated college oh and
he ever did you pick a door on a couture
had it written on your book oh don't
remind me you have any special place in
New York that inspires you where you can
rely at night on the pier right out here
it's so quiet and you can hear the water
and you can see all the city lights like
it I think any they're in for ransom it
is so amazing and when nobody's out
there and so apply it it's just like the
most serene place where you can really
just like appear your mind oh can you
say something in Spanish I like that
actually what do you think is the best
way to start an influencer where you
have so much to share on different
topics but don't have enough courage to
face the bad comments people say just to
hurt you thanks to them um I think you
just have to dive in headfirst just I
mean know that you're going to get
hateful comments there's always people
that are going to hate on you no matter
what and I feel like you get sick skin
over time like my first hateful comment
I thought I would click torn up about it
four ways you want but now if I get one
I just it literally doesn't save me at
all so it's so kind of about diving in
headfirst you know it's kind of a
trade-off like you get to do what you
love if you can take you like negative
things
right now and then so it's just kind of
sad fourth it to you does anyone ever
comment on your body how skinny you are
and things like that how do you handle
it I mean have you seen the comments I
can in my attention every day yeah I get
comments on my body all the time but I
am happy with my body and extremely
healthy
I am Sinhalese in person um you know I
just am and I don't mind it when people
call me when they say oh you're too
skinny blah blah blah but when people
start throwing out the word anorexic is
when I get a little bit defensive it
doesn't hurt me it doesn't bother me but
think about the other people that you're
occurring with that comment if someone
is sick and does have that illness
you're you're reminding them that I
don't know there's just something about
that that's so disgusting
and just so vile when someone throw that
word around like it's not a big deal you
know that's something that people die
from that people suffer from every day
and the fact that you're just thank you
you look interesting you're anorexic
it's just disgusting to me again
doesn't think me um at all but think
about the other people that are great
with that word you know you know me I'm
Olivia what is sharing is election party
chin is so oh it's so broad and so gross
come on um yeah but again yes so yes I
do mean hateful confident I've always
been just that small I'm used to small
can't
I'm get into a business program Johnny
Mac we're back internal temperature of
the battery of crypto actually is
joining not joining but doing a workout
program soon by Lauren Simpson not
related
she's from Instagram and I don't know
what her handle is you'll find her and
that's what actually going to do tell us
all we did so much research on like
fitness gurus and they really want to
like I want to bulk up I don't want to
say that but I would want to be able to
like count my macros and make sure I'm
getting enough carbs and protein and
also follow a fitness plan at the same
time so we're trying to decide between a
few different business plans but next
one very profound and super invasive of
privacy question I love them not to be
creepy so like how did y'all get it on
in the old apartment with no curtains
and that creepy guy you could see in
your living room yeah you know yep
hey we'll never see my guy ever again so
it's fine a good question for the video
today how did you get into the fashion
industry it's my dream you have any tips
ah well I would like to know what do you
feel about yourself and how can we be
more confident do you have any other
dreams that you want to achieve
like how do I feel about myself yeah
well how do you feel about yourself and
what can you do to feel more confident I
think confidence comes from what's the
word I'm thinking of self-acceptance
accepting yourself for who you are and
not trying to please everybody and most
importantly pleasing yourself you and
