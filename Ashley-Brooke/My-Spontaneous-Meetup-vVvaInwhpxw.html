living on many chests and bars today
because we haven't had time to go as we
grab food but we're going to an early
dinner with a lot of people here that we
know from the conference so we're going
already at like 6:00 so what's the plan
zippers down
I wonder why that man was looking at
your I'm older this and get in the I
know who found a life no more I put you

all alone
can't be anything I rise no it's alright
my sessions are over today and now we
are meeting some people and going to

out to say hi so I really say hello
what's up guys it's the last day at the
conference when leaving San Diego
tomorrow though we have a little bit of
downtime today and tomorrow so I'm
hoping to do like a super quick Meetup
because last night I just kind of in
story that we were at this place so if
you're in the area you know come see us
come meet and like like quite a few of
you came out to say hi and I was so
shocked and so happy to meet every
single one of you and take pictures and
it was just like the coolest thing ever
so I'm hoping if we have time that we
can do something like that again
not so last-minute not so like Braddock
so hopefully this can happen last day in
the conference it ends at 3 o'clock
today but I need to get a video edited
out to you guys that what I wore this
week it's going to be a little bit like
mish-mosh II it's not going to do
because we're traveling so I'm like
doing my Oscar in the hotel room and
it's kind of all over the place so right
in the back what's up Brian
so I think we're going to go try to find
a Starbucks and get to the event we're a
little late
ate something but we'll see you guys
later say we got our coffee so we're
happy camper came Bruce that our
we're heading into the event late I'll
keep the camera on so you guys can see
how big it is I know I don't thought
many people will be at this one right
there's not like a lot of people throw
the keynotes from the beginning I
consider too concentrated there should
be people might be hungover this morning
the suckers it was that party bus yes
but you know we got turnt and we're in
bed by like 10:30
what about 10:30 oh and we were I wasn't
good with her I had one glass of wine
why do you always play say these things
about this I had one glass of wine at
dinner and then I had water
I don't want to meet you her when I
don't wanna New York time' actor one
knows who will be the guy can get
Crossing a microscope inside
we've got done with lunch little breaks
from the session and Ryan it's about to
hop on JetBlue
customer service and see if you can
change our flight because food Gary just
told us that there is a snowstorm coming
our way so we are going to try to avoid
that because I have a hair appointment
for the day we get back and they charge
like the 30% will nervously if you don't
show up so I really trying to avoid that
yeah that's what's going on Brian's
special genius
you guys want to know what he did so he
looked at the red-eye play we leave
tomorrow at 9:00 p.m. and we get into
New York at 6:00 a.m. and my hair
appointments at 11:00 a.m.
so that's going to be super fun that's
all definitely going to be long
what you do think the dogs can have the
salon forget it
uh-huh got a recolor hi everyone so
update since a lot of thought to you we
had to move our flight we called JetBlue
and they moved our flight from nine
o'clock tomorrow night to one o'clock
tomorrow afternoon so we should be
getting into New York a few hours before
the storm hit we were deciding we were
like okay should we rent a car drive to
LA and just hang out there until the
storm passes obviously that's what we
wanted to do but we just have so much
work to do it's really hard being gone
for so many days and cayenne Olivia I
don't even know like what they're up to
they're just you know Olivia needs water
it was a hard decision but we decided to
do the adult responsible thing get back
to work
we're trying everything in our power not
to go back to Cafe Gratitude we're like
okay try something new try something new
so we decided on what's the place called
this is a cool 1845 they have language
oh maybe tomorrow I gotta wake up and
pack hate packing because I under kind
of person has to unpack everything when
I get to my hotel room so like right now
all my stuff is hung all my shoes are
lined up everything's with drawers
because I'm just annoying we could just
skip the snowstorm all together and just
be in LA where are we going from
better get back and work I know but
but snowstorms you can't work
snowstorms can I work why can't we work
from an LA stretch
what do you mean la Fonda sighs focus
not ma I live in LA I wouldn't want to
be outside all the time at all I'm
really sad because you know I met up
with you guys a few you guys last night
and I really wanted to do some sort of
quick meet up tomorrow but it's not
going to happen because we had to
reschedule our flight so now I'm really
sad about that I think Ryan and I were
really looking forward to do it oh yeah

peeping into people's apartments so we
went to a couple of places to see if
they could do vegan options and just
