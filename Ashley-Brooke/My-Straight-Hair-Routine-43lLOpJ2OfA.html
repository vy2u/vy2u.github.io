going to show you my straight hair
routine I have been rocking the straight
hair now for about a month now and I
must say it is so easy to maintain
literally just like run this look for
about five days and I'm good to go
obviously a little dry shampoo towards
the end pushing it quite a bit the most
part it's like an easy wake up and go
hairstyle super low maintenance minimum
to no product I have really unmanageable
hair and I'm sure there are so many of
you guys out there that are like me it
looks different every time I blow-dry it
whether I'm letting it dry by itself or
whether I'm drying it and then styling
it it never looks the same once I've got
like cowlicks weird things going on like
breakage I don't know like raise your
hand if you're like me with weird hair
there's going to be a super low
maintenance routine because I really
don't need a whole lot of product I feel
like the more product you pile on like
the worse it is for your scalp or I get
started I'm just going to introduce you
guys to the straightener that I'm going
to be using today it is the luma Bella
cool mist straightener
this thing is all about anti breakage
which is my new best friend still a
little hot felt the heat on my cheek how
this guy works is it comes with a
macadamia conditioning treatment it came
with two bottles of this and you
basically take this little slot out pour
the oil in and it's an anti breakage
like conditioning treatment and I'm
obsessed with it can feel my ends aren't
completely like crispy critters they're
nice and smooth and I don't feel like my
intro completely breaking off I've been
using this for about a couple of weeks
now and I must say I am noticing so much
of a difference in the breakage of my
hair and just like my the ends like
being healthy overall just turn on the
cool mister whenever you want to use it
you don't have to turn it on but it is a
nice feature to have when you're going
over the ends of your hair and it's like
rose gold and white so how much more
could you kiss Zuma belly girls were
nice enough to give you guys a $20 off
coupon code this Brooke 20 so if you do
decide to buy this wonderful healthy
hair straightener definitely use the
coupon code we all love a good you know
$20 off situation so definitely go use
that and let's start it into the
tutorial thing gets hot really really
fast so I'm just going to go ahead and
jump straight into it or the oil
treatment all I need to do is hold down
this button and there we go so this is
my natural hair I pretty much okay just
blow drying the roots that way I have
like a little bit of volume I just took
a round brush and blow dry it up that
way I have some volume because when this
part is straight I don't want like super
flat hair I still want a little bit of
volume up at the root and then this is
just kind of letting it dry by itself
it's pretty crazy kind of all over the
place no hair is going the same
direction unfortunately but when I'm
going for a straight hair I usually go
for my living proof no frizz nourishing
oil because this really just helps
against humidity any type of frizziness
that I might have which is like my life
all the time now that I got a couple of
pieces out of the way it's going to be
so much easier for me to kind of get in
there and show you what's going on
smaller the pieces it's better that way
you know you're getting everything and
if you see smoke coming up don't worry
it's not smoke it's actually the mist um
the the macadamia treatment that's
coming out of it it only activates
whenever you clamp a straightener so you
can see it kind of coming off right
there and I'm going to kind of just get
a really good grip on it I'm gonna grab
my brush I'm just going to make sure
that all of my hairs are going the same
way that is the purpose of the brush
that way you don't have all these
different hairs going
so many different ways
now after it cools down I'm just going
to brush through it since I blow-dried
the roots of my hair I'm really trying
to stay away from them with my
straightener so I avoid flattening out
the top completely I still have a little
bit of volume left from my actual
blow-dry of the root sure I'm done
straightening and my hair is cooled down
and brushed through I'm just gonna spray
some of my Chi rapid shine mist another
good t.j.maxx find on my ends just to
make sure that they're nice and oh I
don't my face everything's looking nice
and shiny not to drive hob oily hair I
would avoid using this I might add a
little bit more oil to your hair than
you probably want so dry hair only I'm
guessing I don't know try it out see
what you think but um I recommend
definitely not using this if you have
oily or hair so that is it for my
straight hair routine easy enough this
will last me probably about five days
and it's just like the most
low-maintenance hairstyle that I can
possibly think up for myself at least so
