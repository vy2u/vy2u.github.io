it is 6:50 on Friday I have been hitting
the snooze button for an hour and I have
mine is line trazan so just guys I
usually get up around 6 o'clock but I
was really tired this morning because
somebody made me watch a movie last
night so we're going to get up now and
we're going to go brush it - you just go
on here okay we're actually going to get
up now and go brush your teeth by we I
mean
my favorite things to do in the morning
is the quick 25-minute session 15
session of yoga with adriene I like to
do this right when I get up immediately
after I brush my teeth just really gets
my day going and gives me energy and
just really positive thoughts throughout
the day
normally I'll sit down and do all my
other stuff right after yoga but that
workout got me pretty 20 so I'm going to
go ahead and skip to my chakra now we're
having a hard time waking up in the
morning I dropped some grapefruit like
oils in the bottom of my shower it has
been known to wake up the mind and the
body and I think it really works only
thing that I'm using on my face right
now in the morning is my is k2 facial
treatment essence
first take my shower I'll change into
something a little bit more comfortable
while I make my coffee check my email
and just kind of before I get ready this
is a stray shower get some launch
clothes I like to get my computer check
some emails my phone but before anything
I write in my five minute journal just
to kind of set up the day make sure that
I'm setting up all my goals things that
I want to get done my to-do list and
then I'll tackle the emails and my
Instagram stuff like that so we are
going to make and I plot it a little bit
of the knot
you
all right so now that I have checked my
emails my inbox clear such a good
feeling I'm going to get ready because I
have a meeting this morning I should do
my makeup sitting right here at my desk
obviously hug either music a podcast or
the Today Show live with Kelly and Ryan
on but I'm talking to you guys I'm not
going to do that today I'm going to a
meeting and I do want my makeup to look
natural not so over-the-top or crazy so
I'm just going to do kind of my everyday
routine because that just involves like
the bare minimum so that's what we'll do
sorry that I didn't get to do a go full
morning routine I don't know something
about Friday's I just keep hitting my
snooze chakra right first I use my Urban
Decay primer and I love this stuff it's
like perfect
I don't know just the perfect texture
for my skin looks like I'm going to be
wearing makeup all day like I am today
it really really helps keep my makeup
just kind of stick where it's supposed
to be for my foundation I'm going to do
my L'Oreal I don't know I said L'Oreal
I'm literally reading Laura Mercier's
early at Friday I was going on my Laura
Mercier a photo edition foundation and
I'm doing the color sand beige
foundation because it's I don't know it
does not feel so heaviest a great summer
foundation it's really almost as feels
like moisturizer schmear about on Sigma
f80 brush it's a really good color um
it's a little bit darker than my face
which is good because I don't put my
face in the Sun so it kind of blends in
with the rest of my body nicely so for
my under eyes and all of that good stuff
I'm using my heart-shaped tape I like
anything with a stick
so much easier to apply but yeah the
meeting I'm going to today is pretty
casual so I'm not going to dress up too
much trip really casual meeting to go
over some things and I know these people
so I don't have to like you know really
dressed to impress I can just kind of be
casual so the those are always fun
meeting and kind of blend all of my fun
spots in right here super excited
because Game of Thrones comes back on on
Sunday which is when this video is going
to go live I'm sure all of you are
getting prepared and ready except it
only comes on I mean it didn't this huge
gaps in between seasons so I'm going to
have to watch a go recap of last season
because I really remember what happens
so my under eye concealer always gets
kind of in my creases so I'm just going
to use my dermablend just like my loose
powder here and use my Beauty Blender
and I'm just going to let it kind of sit
under my eyes while I do my bronzer my
browser I'm using my hoola bronzer when
using this stuff forever it's like the
best color for my skin going to do my
jaw kind of bring that down just a
little bit so if I ever told you guys
how much I appreciate all of your
comments about Cotton's our dog who we
had to put down and because he's just he
was just so old and so sick and he
couldn't have surgery because he was
just that said that he probably wouldn't
make it out of surgery and so we have to
put in complete but all of your guys's
comments were just I mean Ryan and I
were so upset and we were so down but
your comments really made us feel so
much better and just you know made us
smile so thank you guys for that because
that
really means a lot to us like really
means luck you take me seriously with
this going on so now that I have bronze
my face I'm just going to grab my little
brush here and I'm just going to kind of
dust all of this dermablend off so yeah
my morning routine is you see a little
lower than this but um middle blend it
all out but yeah that snooze button it
was just like really sounding nice today
and I got just like new foam memory pod
for our bed so the past two days we had
the hardest time actually getting out of
it because it's so comfortable I just
kind of sink down into it it's amazing
I'm going to do my blush and I'm using
tarts in the color sensual I don't use
like really pigmented blush I don't use
like a crazy color just because in the
winter time my cheeks get rosy and in
the summertime when my face gets color
on it it might sheiks also get rosie's
so I don't keep to add any more rosiness
so I just do a little bit of it next I'm
going to do my brows so for my whole
entire brow process I use Tarte the
Amazon clay Crisco
Amazonian clay and then my Becca
ultimate coverage concealer to kind of
roam them out so brush off these guys
eyebrows I don't know if it's because I
have naturally really curly hair but my
eyebrow I have to trim them all the time
or else they would just grow out of
control they would literally just grow
and I could braid them because they I
don't know I just don't stop growing
sorry I can't talk and do my eyebrows up
Stanton if you are asking what plans we
have for the summer I think if we're
going on any more trips and we are
actually going to San Antonio and we're
going to Austin
and we're going to my hometown in a few
weeks actually I think like a couple of
weeks so on my San Antonio and Austin
growth I would love to meet up with you
guys at some point we can remember I
brought with our sisters not twins
I will say there's just too many days
where my eyebrows don't even look like
sisters but now I'm just going to finish
off with my mascara and I am using the
gifted mascara by Tarte and I swear by
this mascara up and down this is the
best I think different people different
people have different eyelashes so I
just think different types of brushes
and different mascaras just work
differently on everyone but this is by
far the best mascara I've ever used
thing no eyeshadow today because I never
wear eyeshadow unless I'm it's like a
nighttime scene or I'm just in the mood
for it but my everyday makeup routine
does not involve a shop do you see what
happens when you're in a hurry my makeup
is done except for my lipstick but I
usually do that after I've put my
clothes on just because I like to kind
of match not so much the color but just
kind of the undertones I get this cooler
or warmer and I like to match that with
what I'm wearing so let's pick out an
outfit super casual I just found out
that it's going to rain soon so I am
just going to put my hair in like a low
bun and do a hat which is good because I
just got this really cute Baker boy hat
from River Island so I get to write that
down
alright little behind up this is the Hat
I was telling you guys about so cute so
I'm probably going to do this it's a
little like low button I think that's
really cute
so we're going to start the outfit with
this and then filled pop pop it
so my outfit is picked out I'm going to
do I started with the hat and then I did
this long kind of really lightweight
duster blazer just because it is going
to rain so when it rains in the city it
gets a little chilly and then this tank
also from River Island it's just like
they have the best basics and this is
really nice and thick and I'm going to
do my dark denim the booties to tie in
the Hat and then my silver Carmyle
sunglasses
alright so here is my outfit I decided
against the booties and I decided to do
my patent loafers instead so my short
again this white tank is from River
Island they have the best basics I think
these are like two for ten dollars and
they come in like different colors my
black long blazer and then my Baker boy
hat also from the rough so I really hope

ready with me this is the first in a
while if not ever morning routine I have
done I might have done one last year I
can't remember but I really want your
