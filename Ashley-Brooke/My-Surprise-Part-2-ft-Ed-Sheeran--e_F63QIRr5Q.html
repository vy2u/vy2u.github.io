Ryan could go anywhere for his birthday
today and he wanted to walk over to Best
Buy
before because we were at Target where
you wanted to go no no but I needed I
needed supplies for my shower we are
getting a new Joby and this time it is
giant giant er more giant Moscow oh nice
there are times a charm right man
washers and dryers have come a long way
look at that face that looks like a
garbage can but it's not maybe it's
dual-function like you can throw your
trash in it as well as wash your clothes
maybe just packed up now we're heading
to our hotel I'm so excited
all right we are gonna go do a little
exploring before we get ready for the
content look how nice concierge was they
sent us up these two gorgeous cupcakes
and its really really a sweet note but
they're not vegan so we just have to
stare at them here's the pool we'll be
down here tomorrow
hey down there many leather-bound books
little puppet show for the kiddies
okay yep just deciding to go do your own
thing that's why this is here ma'am
ma'am please ma'am
what are you running what happened
whatever huge meeting people hi guys we
are about finished getting ready to go
and I did a little pink hair action for
Edie so I'm kind of excited about it I
just kind of wanted to settle I didn't
want to put a ton of pink hair cuz my
dress is really really crazy so I just
did a little bit but I'll show you what
I'm wearing so I've got on this like
built-in choker you lightweight and
perfect for concert in my black booties
because I wore sandals one time to a
concert and learned my lesson never
again
took a strap off of my purse and made a
belt my necklace my hope my camera strap
on just in case so I can bring it in bag
booties already it's top red top red
let's go top red
gotta have that hand sign you know
that's a must and the hotel shuttle is
taking us over there BAM hey what are
the odds of us getting to bring this
camera in thirty five percent really I
was gonna say like 48 years yeah well I
was gonna say there's a five percent
chance of you being close to my estimate
which is ironic because it was okay
right we don't you know basically if it
cuts to iPhone clips here in a second
you'll know that we couldn't bring the
camera in there was a sad
totally slower
we just ran into I don't know if you're
in some things it was super dark but
prior name is Tina
you know thanks for stopping in seunghye
was so nice
yeah nice to meet you firstly hit like
an Ed Sheeran concert chill Ramba
which by the way can we talk about the
concert at the end of the show they
threw his guitar picks and the girls
aside we caught it and I don't know
where my account read what where it was
just like I wasn't paying attention
trying to figure out the uber situation
always there's always an uber situation
needs to go inside the uber that him but
that is him six seven three two
oh really might be him Oh OMG me out of
here
that concert was open and tried to talk
Ryan into getting a drink at the bar
downstairs and he's no so instead we're
going to later and eat popcorn and watch
