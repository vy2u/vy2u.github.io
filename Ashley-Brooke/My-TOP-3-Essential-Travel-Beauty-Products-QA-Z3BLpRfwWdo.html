blog that is for damn sure Marcus no no
no I did not under my peanut butters
doing all my the car connects to my
bluetooth so I can listen to my music
quick little tidbit here I just got a
comment on the YouTube video and it says
does daddy pay for your apartment
hashtag no hashtag no weird how when you
see someone who works really really hard
for what they have and you just
automatically like your mind goes to Oh
her dad must pay for her apartment why
why do you assume that I don't
just a thought just a curious question
I'm just wondering maybe someone you
know might have success on their own
like why why is that so hard to believe
that someone works hard and it's
successful I think there's always people
that are mentally stuck in a certain
place and the only way they can
rationalize where they are is to put
someone else down yeah that sums it up
pretty much just answer a question and
no daddy doesn't now pay for my
apartment I wish he did that would be
nice Larry dad come on
Harvey let's go Barney
so we've been on the road for about 10
minutes and we're already pulled over so
Ashley can go to the bathroom and gas
station almost the first one that we saw
I think so this is probably the first of
seven I believe that we're gonna do on
this three and a half hour trip yeah
it's gonna be a lot of potty breaks
thanks babe welcome back to the trip

killing you slowly you know what I swear

Phoebe
guys remember those shoes on Poshmark
yesterday that I was you know bidding
for and countering well Tara we went
back and forth a few times but I ended
up getting them
thanks Poshmark put the Poshmark link
and my description so you guys being
like there to sign up because I'm sure
most of you were on your mobile phones
right now so it's going to be much
easier so good like I put it below
bathroom trip number - about 15 minutes
later nice you know what I'm mad about
what that we did not go wine-tasting
that's like the one thing I wanted to do
while we were home between San Antonio
in my hometown there is a lot of
wine-tasting places and we have an app
trust me right in there at like at
people if there's an app for it
we have its app called wine trail
adventures and you can actually like
while you're driving look and see all of
the wineries around you in your area
which is so cool and you can go on the
app and rate wines see what other people
have rated these wines and you can
actually win trips to go places so it's
like the total win-win so if you're into
wine and that sort of thing I recommend
that app because we've used it so many
times kind of show you what it looks
like
this is what the app looks like and so
these are all of the wineries kind of in
our area right now there's like at the
time because we're in wine country am i
right dish we're in wine country ish
we're kind of in the outskirts of it but
yeah check it out if your wine people
I'm a wine people
I want people's yeah I'll put the link
in the description for the app so you
guys can check it out hashtag and not
sponsored that is really like a true out
there right and I use that we recommend
so when in Texas yes ma'am I sure did
all right we have made it to enterprise
right there and my mom and the twins are
picking us up from here Brian's filling
up the tank right now and then we're
gonna go home
I'm so excited the last hour the whole
last hour of the road
I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A snapchat I have all of
your Q's on my phone so I need to a best
click outfit idea for a casual night out
but you don't have much time to get
ready but want to look cute
my go to last-minute outfit is a pair of
black skinny jeans my black leather
booties high-waisted skinny jeans and
either like a crop top and like a cool
long jacket or like a cute blouse like
usually black I think that's the easiest
to like throw on you don't have to worry
about matching but I usually try to
throw like texture like a necklace or
something to it so Tia wants to know
what my favorite song is workout music
and my next vacation I want to take
so as for like workout music I'm
actually while I'm home I'm gonna do a
quick like know gym workout routine for
you guys no gym no equipment needed just
like a quick good workout and I will
also put my Spotify playlist that I
listened to when I workout this question
is from her boyfriend who says it's
funny what kind of car do you drive back
home I do not have a car back home I
sold my car I had a Jeep I love my Jeep
I sold it when I moved to New York
because I didn't need it
so it sold it is it really possible to
move to New York because I really want
to after University but everyone tells
me it's impossible because I have to be
a billionaire if I want to live there
I'm not a billionaire but I really want
to live in New York how did you do it
well you definitely don't have to be a
billionaire do your research find out
what area you want to live in I mean
people move to New York all the time
it's not some like impossible thing you
just have to do your research and move
at the right time have money saved have
a job lined up know what you're making
versus what your monthly expenses are
gonna be and you definitely have to be
organized but it's not impossible you're
going to need a roommate definitely get
a roommate it will help you tremendously
it'll put you in a nicer area with a
nicer place
Maggie Maggie alright so got home got
unpacked and now my sisters and I are
taking Maggie for a little walk
say hi girls cambree and Kylie wait can
we just look out to all these guys are
Kim here to stand next to me and my name
is Kylie almost as tall as me how has
yours and Ryan's family been about
starting YouTube going full-time and are
they supportive do they worry about it
no they were so excited about us going
full-time or me going full-time because
they know that it's something that I
love doing so yeah everyone's been so
great about it
boyfriend and I love coffee just like
you guys do do you have any good
recommendations for iced coffee and
where do you get it from right and I
drink nothing but Kohana coffee now it's
coffee concentrate so you can add as
much water to it or milk as you want to
kind of dilute it to get to get it to
where the taste that you love I always
put either some vanilla or some cinnamon
some toffee nut or I just drink it
straight I'll link it below so you can
go to their website and order because
they have lots of different flavors to
choose from I love the French Roast I
think that's probably my favorite is
your favorite thing about Texas and New
York you know they are completely
opposite ends of the spectrum like look
where I am right now this is why I love
Texas open space I'm from a small town
I'm here now and it's like my favorite
thing ever is to come back home so quiet
I just love it so much and then you know
you have the best of both worlds living
in New York and you know constantly
being inspired and motivated but this
will always be home what is un Ryan's
favorite holiday tradition I think my
favorite holiday tradition is just being
with family getting to see everyone
because I don't live you know in the
same town as my family the holidays just
reminds me of family and everybody being
together
I love it when do you think you guys
will have kids you know we definitely
want kids one day but it's not even
something that we discuss right now you
know we're always joking when we see
like kids who are like that is our
future child if it has like an oversized
sweater and leggings Ryan's like that is
your daughter
but um yeah something that we want just
not right now tie my shoe because I've
got camera in one hand phone in the
other yeah that one don't tie it too
tight what do you ask for when you get
your hair cut I always ask for like a
long bob my hair if I flip it over like
if I parted on the side it's longer on
this side than it is on this side the
most part I just ask for long layers so
last question from Alyssa and her sister
you guys were so cute in your snapchat
video that you sent me get some
motivation for doing YouTube oh gosh my
biggest motivation are is the comments
that I get that you know telling me that
I'm helping someone in subway whether
it's being more confident in the way
they dress or someone finding their own
style for the first time you guys are my
motivation 100% of course I love putting
outfits together those comments like
that is what keeps me going what was
your favorite part about working in the
fashion industry every day is different
you know you don't have the same like
eight to five work schedule and you do
the same thing every day like every day
is different so it always keeps you on
your toes keeps you going why am I out
of breath all right guys last question
before we in this vlog what are three
travel beauty products that you cannot
live without that was a hard one I was
just in my bathroom for a really long
time trying to find three products that
I can't travel without so the first one
is my party
coconut body oil because it serves as my
lotion I really don't use lotion anymore
I just use this stuff smells amazing it
doesn't feel greasy my skin gets so dry
in the winter so this stuff really helps
second is my fairs witch hazel
based owner I usually get rose rose
petal but they only have lavender so I
just got a new one because I run out of
this
it's basically for after you take your
makeup off you just get a cotton swab or
a cotton ball and just kind of go over
your face with this I love it just feels
clean obviously my Valencia moisturizer
because hello
it's my moisturizer and I can't live
without my moisturizer again because my
face gets so dry in the winter so this
is awesome if you have dry skin I
recommend this moisturizer it is pure
glow brightening moisturizer and I put
this on when I wake up in the morning
before I put my makeup on and I have the
Valencia nighttime serum but you guys
said I could only pick three so I will
do a nighttime routine soon and show you
all of that I think I'm gonna end this
vlog so I can start editing it and
getting it ready for you guys for

hair it's gross what's good Oh someone

could combine three our three favorite
celebrities into one who would it be my
first one I think would be Nicole Richie

crush and they don't know about you've
always known about that boy crush I have
known that you in love with Ryan
