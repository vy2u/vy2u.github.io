today I just wanted to shoot a video
over some of my favorite lipsticks um
right now when I post an Instagram photo
or youtube video I'm getting the most
questions on lipstick color so that's
why I'm doing that today I just kind of
wanted to round up my top favorites and
just do them all in one video and go
ahead and hit the subscribe button if
you aren't already subscribed I'm going
to put it right here that way you can
just click it and you are subscribed and
let's just go ahead and get straight
into the video I'm going to start out
with Maybelline blushing beige and this
is more of just like an almost
barely-there color this is definitely a
nude more on the pink side as you can
see it's got almost no color to it it's
really really pretty when you're wearing
whites and pinks for winter so I think
this kind of complements well without
wearing an actual pink because it's got
a little bit of news to it
the next nude we have is NYX in the
color LSS 5 2 2 and this this nude is
more on the Bobby kind of brown side so
this one's going to show up a little bit
more than the one that I just put on
this one can get all over the face it
was probably best to line your lips
first and then apply this one because it
kind of is it's a little bit it's not a
super matte lipstick it's got a little
bit of liquid in it so it's easy to get
all over the place so definitely line it
first and then put your lipstick this
doesn't all settle with those notes
grateful next we have bronzy by L'Oreal
this is probably my my newest lip color
I think I've worn it maybe three times
but I've gotten so many compliments when
I do wear it and this is something that
I would roll up the tube and say oh this
color is so weird and not for me but I
took a chance and I bought it and I
actually love it I don't necessarily
think you need a lip liner with this one
because it's pretty matte and stays in
place and smells nice so I hope you
smile in this length film just to
schedule
next I have Milan EES Matt naked in the
number 61 and this is a true true true
moth with hardly any colour at all and I
think it complements well with any
outfit or any time of day so I
personally love love this one
most matte lipsticks completely dry out
my lips I love the look of a matte
finish but I can't wear them because it
always dries out my lips but this stuff
feels like chapstick it is so amazing
there's so much moisture to this so you
get the matte finish without the
cracking and the drawing throughout the
day so for me this is the perfect matte
it's the perfect color so good job
Milani this stuff absolutely rocks
next I have purple Prelude by l'oréal
this is more of a gloss rather than an
actual lipstick so it's got a gloss
brush with it and you know this is
another one of those colors that I
looked at and I was like this is not for
me but I bought it anyways
and I loved it I get so many compliments
on it and it's also very moisturized as
well which is great I'm actually really
surprised that I love this so much
because I hate wearing gloss because I
feel like it makes my lips look way
bigger than I want them to me um every
time I wear a gloss people are like what
did you do something to your lips and
I'm like no and just the gloss makes
them look huge so this is the gloss that
I can wear without feeling like I have
to balloons attached to my face so I
love this it is like a true purple which
is crazy because I never thought I would
be a purple lipstick wear but I totally
am now thanks to this color my next
color is also another one by Milani it
is rose femme and I've been wearing this
for about two months now I love it it's
a ma / purple color so it's basically a
combination of purple prelude and matte
naked if these two had a baby this is
what it would be so this is obviously my
go to my favorite it's something that I
carry in my purse all the time
and last but not least we have sangria
by Milani as you can tell I love middle
Milan Louisville as you can tell I love
Milan EES lipsticks they stay on all day
long and they never smear or smudge and
it is basically what you would think of
sangria would look like it is a purplish
kind of pink mixture with maybe a little
bit of like a red undertone it is my
go-to nighttime color for fall winter
and probably will be for summer because
it does have a little bit of that um
kind of pinkish red color that you can
kind of see I would definitely use a
liner with this one only because it is
so dark and any little slip-up you can
see I didn't use a liner and I think
I've got like a little bit of kind of
weird things happening there make sure
that your new apartment has as much
storage as you can get and if it doesn't
don't bring a lot of crap with you
nobody will follow that rule I feel like
we did it a little bit we tried to
convince what we still brought to my
stuff find any little milk and cranny
late you can show things in exactly
where we're condensing that's what we're
doing for the rest of the day we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
