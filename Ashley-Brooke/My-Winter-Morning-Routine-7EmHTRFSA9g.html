channel today I'm going to show you what
my winter morning routine now that we
are starting a new year I'm back into my
routine and it feels so good I just feel
like my weekday and my workweek just
flows better when I'm at a nice routine
and it just really makes things a lot
easier throughout the week so when I
wake up I usually set my alarm around
5:45 and end up hitting the snooze a few
times but I really really try to wake up
at 5:45 so for the sake of it let's just
say 6 a.m. first things first we have to
make coffee because I don't have coffee
I'm not a functioning human being I wish
I wasn't like that but I am so I usually
start my day by making a vanilla latte
yeah I like to sit down while I'm
drinking my coffee and just really go
through my day my schedule to speak kind
of what I have for the day after I drink
my coffee and kind of look at my
calendar I like to get ready to go to
the gym I try to get ready as quickly as
possible meaning you know I'm not going
to put makeup on or really do much to my
hair because well Jim no way to leave
there not early anyway so it doesn't
really matter so for my morning gym
routine I like to start out with 30
minutes of cardio on the Stairmaster and
I do a five to seven-minute warmup
and then I like to view of five-minute
intervals of skipping a steps at a
slower pace and then hitting every step
at a faster pace so as you'll see in the
first clip this is me skipping a step at
a slower pace and then after that
obviously hitting every step and I do
this for 30 minutes for 5-minute
intervals now I'm doing my absurd so I
will take you through that really
quickly this is a six pound ball that I
like to put between my knees and just go
side to side and it really works some
muscles on the side of your stomach this
will really make you hurt the next
and each of these ab exercises I do a
circuit of four with 20 reps eat that
will pretty much guarantee not being
able to get out of bed the next day so I
do four circles of that with about a
minute rest in between each circuit
after I am done with the gym I come home
and make my smoothie smoothie time so I
add this young green coconut smoothie
pack and just an FYI this does not blend
well at all so I like to let it run
under hot water and then throw it in the
blender and I add strawberries this
really ugly banana I promise it's a
banana my peanut butter then I add my
vital protein collagen peptides while
I'm drinking my smoothie I just like to
sit down and see if I've gotten any
recent emails after that I'm just going
to get ready for the day so I'll have a
quick shower and I love this birthdays
peppermint and rosemary body wash it
really wakes you up it's like a nice
minty peppermint kind of aroma
so nice in some of the products I use
after the shower Campari
coconut oil I kind of use this in
replacement to lotion my Valente appear
glow brightening moisturizer and my
sancho pay self-tanner I normally put
this on my chest my shoulders my neck
and my fave
after I am dressed and my hair is done I
am going to put some makeup on I'm
working from home that day I usually
will just put a little bit of BB cream
and maybe some mascara just to let my
skin breathe but when I go to the office
I do like to put a little bit more
makeup on if I have time I will make a
quick breakfast I usually like to do a
veggie omelet with a little avocado and
some toast and of course work while I
eat because why not
so my workday goes one of two ways I
either stay home and work which means I
will be editing I have to pick out
outfits for filming something of the
sort and if I go to the office that
usually means that I have meetings or
calls or I really need to get out of the
apartment and get into a conference room
quite environment away from distractions
and really just concentrate on what I
need to do obviously today I'm headed
out to the office because I have emails
and phone calls and just kind of a
distraction-free environment alright
guys it for this video my morning
routine I hope you love it and I would
be in this video hi
you know we've easier though you just
hold really long so there's little now
if you can't bring out because you have
a problem this is the thing is it take
that probably can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
