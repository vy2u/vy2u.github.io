shooting a how to style video or video
where the camera is gonna be so close in
my face so today I'm using my vanity
planet skin spa and I love this thing
because it comes with three three
different brushes this guy comes with a
daily cleansing brush and exfoliating
brush and a silicone brush and I really
want to like get in there and get all my
pores cleaned out and really get any
imperfections or like dry skin or
anything I've got going on thing takes
batteries so you don't have any weird
chargers like laying around it's super
easy to pack because it comes already in
a travel case couldn't be any more easy
than that look how gross this says this
is residue makeup from last night and I
thought I spread my face so good so wow
the exfoliating brush does not play like
I have this smoothest skin right now

brush like twice a week I'm obsessed
with it and let me also mention that the

happy Saturday you guys strain hair
don't care why would I wear my hair
straight oh yeah that's right because I
have like naturally curly hair and it
takes forever to straighten I think I'm
ready to make my announcement why am i
nervous about telling you guys okay I'm
still on bit I am starting November
second doing YouTube full-time I have
always worked ever since I moved out of
the house when I was 18 I have always
had a job so this was a big leap for me
it was a big decision it is a big deal
I am fully committed to what I'm doing
with YouTube and with you guys and with
my channel I'm so invested scary
honestly I am scared to death but it's
good it's good it's a good scared I'm so
excited I decided to do this because now
I can invest everything I have into this
channel and into you guys I will be able
to talk to you guys more throughout the
comments left by her lookbook is going
to be off the chain so good the vlogs
especially I want to vlog all week I
want to have 20 minute long vlogs for
you guys kind of showing like what's
going on in my life with my business
it's my youtube channel like I want to
let you guys in on that so I moved from
Texas to New York because I wanted to
fully expand my career in the fashion
industry I wanted to be on more of a
corporate level and not so much retail
and really like do do it to the fullest
like do it up and I took that and after
I did that I found YouTube and I found a
new fashion outlet I wanted something
more and after I started my youtube
channel I grew life by her and that is
now my my passion my focus and I want to
grow that it just got to be um like hard
on myself because I I am working 40
hours a week at my job and probably
around 30 hours a week on YouTube and
life by her I would go to work from 8 to
5 you know come home sit straight at my
desk work until 1:00 to 2:00 in the
morning and then get back up at 6:00
work on life by her and then go to work
so that's just kind of in my schedule
for the past three months and there
comes a point where you know you have to
make that decision you have to get on
one side of the fence
I couldn't be fair to myself if I kept
trying to do both so that is where we're
going that is where we're moving on
