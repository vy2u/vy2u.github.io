channel today this look is all about a
no makeup makeup look and it's kind of
like when you want to look natural when
you want to look like you're not wearing
a bunch of makeup it's perfect for
school or running errands it's a look
that says you know I'm not wearing so
much makeup but I didn't just roll out
of bed so this is the finished makeup
look that I've already completed and if
you like this and want to see the
tutorial keep watching and don't forget
to subscribe and like this video if you
liked it I'm going to start by using my
Smashbox photo finish primer
before my foundation I'm going to be
using the Maybelline fit me foundation
matte and poreless in the color 220 and
I'm also going to be using my NARS
luminous weightless foundation so I'm
just going to cover my face with little
dots flow then I'm just going to take
one of my foundation brushes and kind of
just smear it all over my face to make
sure that all my foundation my two
colors are blended together I always use
my blending to make sure that everything
is blended together and I don't have you
know like a clump of dark over here and
a clump of life right here so my blends
a just make sure that everything is
smooth out I'm going to grab my
Neutrogena
brightening eye Perfector and I'm just
going to do a couple of clicks of the
sky and just kind of make sure I don't
have any crazy dark circles now I'm
going to take my blend II once again and
blend everything in nice and smooth
next I'm going to do my eyebrows and
since I am going for a more natural look
I'm going to use an eyebrow powder
versus a pomade I'm not going to do a
close-up today of my eyebrow routine
district has it takes quite a while so
I'm just going to kind of fast-forward
through this I do have my current brow
routine posted up on my channel right
now it is using the Anasazi of our legal
palming versus the NYX powder oh now
that my brows are done I'm going to take
my hula um my hoola by benefit bronzer
and since we are going for a new makeup
look I'm going to just kind of not do a
full contour I'm just going to kind of
brush over my you know hot spots on my
face so I'm just going to dab and I'm
going to actually pretend like buff it
off so there's not so much on the brush
so you just want to glide it on to give
yourself a natural look and just kind of
blend it
swear I never saw you
I'm going to what just grab this mineral
powder by botanics I love this stuff
because it has no color it just sets
your makeup and makes it last all day
without any kind of weird smudging
Nisour weird movement going on my brush
what's that
where
so I'm just going to go dab a lot and
then just dab a little bit of this and
just kind of brush it along and this
really blends in your your bronzer and
your foundation right work my eyeshadow
well oh here it is
but for my eyeshadow I'm just going to
use my Maybelline autumn poppers palette
these have very very natural colors and
then when I'm going for kind of you know
a natural makeup look I love going to
this palette I'm going to use color
number one as my base and I'm just going
to glide it kind of like all over my eye
very almost non-existent nude pink color
then in my crease I'm just going to do
color number three and for my lid I'm
going to do color number two it's kind
of like a it's kind of like color number
one but it just has a little bit of like
a metallic sheen to it which is perfect
for
I don't know what else
it's just part now that that's done I'm
just going to grab my Maybelline Dream
bouncy blush in the color coffee cake I
like this color for a natural look
because it's not too pink or to red it's
like a very nice kind of mob mixture of
the two colors so I'm just going to dab
a little bit on my cheekbones
and lastly I'm just going to grab my
favorite mascara in the whole wide world
my L'Oreal telescopic shocking
extensions you know I love a full lash
look but for this look I'm going to just
put a little bit on I'm going to try to
refrain from using you know like six
layers so I'll just try to cap it too
and see what happens we might we might
do more we'll see what happens
okay I gave me totally honest with you
guys I put three layers on which is way
better than these six I'm sleeping on so
I'm feeling comfortable I feel like this
is okay I can definitely like get down
with this three layer mascara look so
for my lips I'm just going to use a lip
liner and then just kind of feel my lips
feel I'm going to feel my lips in I'm
going to fill my lips in with the liner
just like a kind of like a settled color
for my color I'm going to use like
rubbed all the letters off because that
