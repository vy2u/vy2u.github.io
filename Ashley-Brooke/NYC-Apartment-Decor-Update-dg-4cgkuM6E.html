watched a new show on Amazon called hand
of God
I'm Z just dove into that and probably
didn't leave the couch for like six
hours it was awesome and we never do
stuff like that so it was just really
nice and then yesterday we kind of went
out in Soho it was raining most of the
day but it was nice just to kind of hang
out and do a little like neighborhood
searching and just kind of like
exploring so speaking of exploring
what's going on right now is Monday
we're back at it today but we did so
much around the apartment I will show

YouTube video my last vlog someone
commented and they said Wow

best to be like extra smart in this vlog

if someone licked it no someone someone

don't want to bother him but really but
but actually goes nah I heard him he was
in I said no pepperoni yeah yeah well

approving photos of cool shirts the
photos right here sure this one we don't
approve of social media Instagram
YouTube he watched you admire chanath
wanna look at her last apartment of the
year
she's gonna be your neighbor but we just
don't know where she's gonna live and I
bet you'll be super indecisive because
you ate a dog treat earlier okay I'm
deaf I closed for lunch and Stella got
her legs all the treat and it got here
and post mates is like very predictable
like they sometimes just send stuff that
you didn't order so I opened the thing
oh by the way I'm starving at this point
like so hungry so hungry she can't even
like talk to anybody
haha and I open her
like three little corn muffins so I like
Alec wheat you didn't order these and
actually we didn't order those and I
know
no and I smell them and I was like wait
he's my dog treats and Ashley's home and
she's like throwing dog treats and then
I like smell them hard I was like wait I
do not they don't look like then one day
with a dog treat because we only got
three different other things one cookie
another cookie still dog treats both
cookies were accounted for what's left
that's because they were out if they're
out of dog treats they don't send three
corn muffins they send other dogs sorry
I took a bite of the but you know what's
funny is that usually when you're not
sure if something is you like take a
nibble you like popped half of the thing
in your mouth because yeah cuz then she
was half a treat down all right I just
finished actually I just finished my
gallery wall but I actually just
finished a video about the gallery wall
what it's looking like so far so we've
got photos here and then I'm gonna do
shelving here with some books on it my
chairs just got here Stella's checking
it out I'm really nervous because I
don't know I just hope they match this
is like finding furniture online is so
hard because you just don't know it's
gonna match her it off so fingers
crossed that it looks good I'm gonna go
