what a tease but this is the Rose mate
we're gonna get ready
well
okay before we get started in this vlog
I just wanted to give a huge thank you
to everyone who made this life mayor
Meetup possible we hide and pizza zest
desserts bull more bear burger all of
the brands that made the swag bag
possible obviously Jenna for making this
happen yeah I just wanted to say thank
you because this this is definitely one
of many and I really hope that we can
collaborate with all of you guys in the
future to make these meetups even better
and second thing I really wanted this
collaboration to go into my Q&amp;amp;A but it
just didn't happen instantly did a Q&amp;amp;A
about blocking and YouTube and a lot of
people were asking me how I was able to
move to New York and like the process
and stuff and like what the most
important thing is and I'm partnering up
with credit Sesame because when I moved
to New York it would have been so much
easier had my credit been better when I
moved to New York my credit was in the
red section like in the no-good section
it kind of got screwed over in college I
was sharing a bill with somebody and it
just completely ruined my credit because
I didn't realize that my name was on the
bill and the bill wasn't being paid so
it just completely ruined my credit got
older I realized oh to get a nice
apartment to get a car to get a loan to
get a business credit card for life I
hurt I need good credit so funny because
I've been using credit Sesame since the
way before this collaboration I've been
using credit Sesame for years trying to
get my credit up and now I'm actually in
the green I have almost a perfect credit
score and it's something that Ryan and I
actually have both been working at
because he got screwed over by next
business partner years and years and
years ago and it took him this long to
build it back up and back to moving to
New York whenever we first moved to New
York we had to use something called
insurance and insurance is basically
like a paid cosigner so we had to pay
someone to co-sign for us because we had
the funds we saved our money for a
really long time to be able to move to
New York
but we
didn't have the credit and that's the
only thing that was stopping us kind of
learned over the years that you're never
too young to start worrying about your
credit so credit Sesame is free to use I
would never pay to get my credit score
check didn't monitor it when I could
just use credit Sesame for free but it
is free and it also gives you the tools
you need to help you throughout the
month and to help you kind of plan for
your future which is really nice you
know a lot of people are worried about
ID protection when it comes to credit
scores it's kind of an iffy thing but
this credit Sesame actually backed you
up up to fifty thousand dollars so I
think that's really cool as well I am
Telling You are just through personal
experience of having a terrible credit
score and having an excellent credit
score the difference that it makes when
you need to make big decisions in your
life so I'm challenging you if you are
in the red by this time next year I want
you to be in the green Oh get to the
vlog now I just kind of wanted to touch
base on those two points because I
wanted to thank everybody for the meetup
but then I also kind of wanted to answer
that question because it was such
requested in the QA and I knew that I
was collaborating with a credit Sesame
and just didn't know win so I couldn't
really fit it in that video but
hopefully all of you guys who asked me
that question are watching right now
because moving to New York would have
been so much easier at my credit score
been better so um good credit will get
you so far in life
topic here but let's get into the vlog
now
hi guys happy waitwhat stage right
Friday we are getting ready for the life
