building right check up this is just
like far down there
no it's an apartment building Ryan I
looked at them but they were like really
rude and it smelled like trash cans
isn't only for like 50 shades of gray
kind of people maybe it looks like it
right so we decided market across the
street does it appear great like what
this guys doing
it's beautiful should we be scared we're
going to get kidnapped
Taylor why not
cuz I'm really freaking strong like I've
kicked somebody in the nuts before great
I don't know if I can even kick that
high ready wow my hip-hop really tried
to spread my fan
so
hailer and I are not ready we're both
like neither one of us really match very
well but it's fine we are going to run
some errands I say run errands but we're
like gonna go shop a little bit
let's go to the bank because I
accidentally threw away my debit card
Ryan was so mad he like exploded on both
of us hey where's the reverie between
Ryan and I it's like she has to mediate
both the bus up where's my list it's in
my purse
all right we made a list because we like
to get organized duh what we're wearing
my full leather hat from H&amp;amp;M sweatshirt
fuzzy coat ripped jeans watch hands are
my favorite sailors got on tall socks
again jeans shirt I like this body suit
it's on your body soon it shows the girl
like it Lala yeah babe hat and you
definitely need a scarf all right
wait what's up okay so
just got through at H&amp;amp;M and Zara applica
overall I got overalls
I got skews that I don't really own us a
moment but maybe one day it's gonna go
back and get them there were two right
feet yeah we got up to the register and
I was trying to convince you that they
weren't two right feet but then you were
right they were to write G so she didn't
buy them okay so we're going to go to
the grocery store to get stuff worth in
and go to the gym I don't want to walk
home it's so cold
I haven't even been cold like this
little time I've been here but today I'm
like shivering my nuts off it is super
rainy and gross outside Taylor has
talked me into selling and cleaning out
my closet a lot of had I donated but I'm
selling a few things on Poshmark so we
are gonna list
Taylor Fred and I are gonna list um some
of my items on Poshmark
I'm gonna show you guys those of you who
don't know how to sell on Poshmark what
to do really quick I'm going to take a
couple of photos of some of the items
and show you how to pose here is my pile
of stuff that we decided that I just
don't wear anymore so we are going to
post all of this alright so I just
opened the app and this is what the home
screen looks like I'm going to go to
sell I'm gonna choose my photos in the
description you can really put kind of
like the shape that they're in if they
have any wear and tear or any scuff you
just want to make sure and disclose that
in the description
original price what you're going to list
it for and this is how much you're going
to get because obviously Poshmark takes
a certain percentage of what you sell so
then you can actually go to your closet
and there is your new listing here's my
closet now as you can see I've sold
quite a bunch and I'm about to add all
of this so it's going to grow a little
bit I will also put my code right here
and in the description box then it will
give you a $5 off of you our first order
and it'll give me $5 off of my neck
sweater - so when when I'll put it here
and in the description box below one of
you guys were asking me how I press it
like how do you know how much to price
it for about 50 to 70 percent of what
you paid for it is a good reasonable
price now if it's like like here's one
of my items the skirt from Banana
Republic and it still has the tags on it
so obviously I'm going to price that a
little bit higher because it's brand new
I think I wore this like once for a
photo shoot
and then just didn't take the tags off
and then never wore it again because
it's a little too big for me go take
this stuff for me because I cannot have
it laying around anymore and Taylor's
probably enough forced me to get rid of
I want to download it so we can trade
stuff in mailings of course ah thank you
guys doing most of you stuff we just got
done working out okay what's oh wow and
I forgot to bring the cameras sorry did
a really good AB circuit workout so I'll
have to show you guys that sometime this
week it was so good making grilled
chicken potatoes and green beans
we are like one big happy family right
now mm-hmm
so we just ate dinner and we made acai
bowls for dessert and I accidentally put
rinoa with pecans and Taylors ah I
forgot she's allergic to pecans so well
now in about five minutes if I break out
in the heisman my face is this big Ryan
uh finishing my pecan Bo Ryan's
finishing both of our acai bowls plus he
finished off the strawberry halo top
clean up her cleanup crew and he's
acting like he's not happy to watch The
Bachelor but let's get real it's
starting see you there or see you wanna
know that
never

like Justin Bieber yep
that's number one Corinne is a ho-bag

Taylor's never watched The Bachelor in
her whole entire life a nice so dumb and
she reeled me into it and now I'm gonna
have to do this every week oh I knew my
hair got me a cyber leader

well good news the good news that came
out of this is Taylor didn't have to go
to the emergency room because of her
allergic pecan I made it guys Eve are
