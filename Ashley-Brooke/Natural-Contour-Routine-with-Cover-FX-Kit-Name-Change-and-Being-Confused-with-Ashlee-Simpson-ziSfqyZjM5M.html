over my everyday contour routine I
prefer more of a light contour because I
do you know go to work every day and I
feel like a heavy contour is best for
nighttime you know when you're going out
to dinner or when you're going out
friends so I am going to show you kind
of my everyday you know good for were
the first school contour routine so it's
going to be very light nothing too crazy
also I don't know if you guys notice my
eyebrow right now my hide an accident
this morning and I will tell you what
happened
I was plucking my eyebrows and just kind
of shaping them up using my Sally Hansen
little brush and if you take the lid off
this is so dangerous like I don't know
why that they did it this way but
there's a comb on one end and a razor on
the other end so I'm like combing my
eyebrows and I see little pieces of hair
stick sticking into my eyelash like what
the hell if I was raised during it off
instead of using the comb so um I had to
use like extra you know I brought
palmate this morning to cover up my huge
gash in my eyebrows so if you can see it
then that's what happened and if you
can't then I used amazing eyebrows and
just goes to cover it up today so
hopefully you cannot see it so if you
haven't subscribed to my channel I will
put the subscribe button right here I
love chatting with you guys about
different products I think I learned
more from my subscribers and the
conversations we have in the comments
than I do you know watching other
YouTube videos and stuff so you know the
more the more the better I love
hearing all the products that you guys
use and you know the comments that you
have for me are so helpful so hit the
subscribe button come join my little
YouTube fam and we'll have a good time
definitely shave off our eyebrows so I
am using a powder and cream contour kit
today I am using my Kat Von D shade +
light contour palette for the powder and
for the cream I'm using my cover FX
contour kit so this is what the inside
of this one looks like and this is what
the inside of this looks like okay so I
am going to start by using my cover FX
cream contour palette and I am going to
like do this color number one right here
it's a very very light color so I'm
going to put this with my finger because
um like it's just one little bit better
when you use your finger I am just gonna
dab this under my eyes a quick side note
I do have my full foundation on right
now so when you are conferring you do
want to put your foundation on don't put
any powder or anything like that just
start with their foundation and then
build on top of that I'm going to take
the same color and go down my nose
and up on zoomit forehead chin and I
have lipstick on right now but if I
while I can try to do it you want to put
it on your Cupid's bow
but um yeah I put lipstick on okay so
I'm gonna take my blends II and I'm
going to blend all of that in
so now I'm going to take color number
three and my cover effect kit I'm gonna
take a little brush and I'm just going
to go down the frame of my nose the
grandma window to the bridge of my nose
okay so you want to take your flimsy and
lens back in that's moving on to my Kat
Von D shade and light palette so first
thing I'm going to do is take this
middle light color right here I'm going
to do under my eyes because the cream
contour that I put on before kind of
sinks into the wrinkles the cracks under
my eyes so this actually sets that and
helps from creasing okay I'm going to
take the same color and I'm going to go
right below a cheekbone
for my shading I'm gonna take this
bottom middle color right here and I'm
going to take my angled brush and I'm
just gonna go along my cheekbones right
here
I'm gonna go under my jawline
if you're getting too much of a
different color in your neck and your
face you can always you know take a
little bit of your darker color and go
down your neck these people honking
their horns obviously have no
consideration for my youtube videos road
next I'm going to go along the top of my
forehead
I'm going to take that same color and
I'm also going to trace the rim or
bridge of my nose
now to make sure that everything is
blended in and I don't have any super
defined lines on my face I'm going to
take my bow Tanic it's just like a light
mineral powder and my big fluffy brush
to just blend everything in I'm going to
take this guide and I'm going to take
just a little bit on the end of my brush
and just kind of go all over my face
I just say that mineral powder is me or
stayin ever because every time I open it
I feel like a huge dust cloud just like
blows up in my face and like chokes me
sometimes actually okay so that is it
for my contour routine as you can see
it's not a super super heavy contour you
know it's just I think it's perfect for
the daytime and I'll put the subscribe
button right whoops come really deep boy
is that scary
I don't know this subscribe button right
here in case you haven't subscribed it's
some really cool stuff coming up for you
guys right and I are about to look for a
new apartment here in this video so I'm
thinking about vlogging that whole
experience so that was something that I
kind of you know would like to share
with you guys and um so that is coming
up soon so stay tuned for that
and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial you
know if you have any tips and tricks for
contouring please let me know in the
comments and as always I love hearing
you know how other people do their
contouring in their makeup routine so
let me know
always getting in the way
No so let me just give you a quick
reason why I changed my handle to
actually brought vs. Ashlee Simpson so I
was trying to create my Facebook page
just so I could share more information
to you guys and I was trying you know it
was asking me for my first and last name
and I was like Ashlee Simpson and it
said you have to basically have your
name as the unofficial Ashlee Simpson
hold on whoa whoa whoa whoa I am
official okay
so that is why I changed my youtube
channel to actually broke it as may you
know first and middle name so I thought
that would just be easier for social
media purposes so I hope you understand
I'm sorry for the confusion with that
but yeah so whenever you see Ashlee
Burke pop up it is mwah
you know sharing the same name as a
celebrity is a struggle because it's
hard to you know have social media
accounts without Ashlee Simpson popping
up all over the place remember when I
first found out who actually Simpson was
I was watching seventh heaven and um in
the credits her name popped up and I was
like mom oh my god there's a little girl
with a baby but now I was like oh my god
people start singing pieces of me every
time you don't you hear my name No
now also post a link right here for my
drugstore cheat sheet my list of
drugstore favorites so I'm go ahead and
click that to download it it's a great
download I promise you won't regret it
when you download it you will get a PDF
email to your phones that way you could
just have it on your phone and you know
when you go shopping for these products
that's right here so you can just look
at that anyways that is all I have for
this routine so I hope you enjoyed it
and I will see you on my next video bye
little from the others
