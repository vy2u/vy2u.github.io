spray and I've heard good things about
this one so I picked this up Ryan we
have so many limp brushes at home you

high waist with these cutouts on the
front it's really cute and I love this
metallic gold next bathing suit this is

gonna grab some coffee we're gonna go
stop at Whole Foods and get some snacks
and some food for us for the week and
then we're gonna head to our hotel we're

section
excuse me I'm talking here the section
for the single packet of the protein
biggest good a really good 30 grams
sugar alright so we'll do chocolate all
right captain groceries score we also
set off some kind of alarm yeah this
doesn't look like pool weather no
bathing suits so that's
okay just putting all this in the car
I'm you're such an empowered independent
lady and I love it no man to put micro
you need no man but the man needs
snuggles and loves give you all these
things yes we are not going to Disney
but we're going into Disney so we are
not we me I'm in the hotel room right
now I am so crazy scary dark right now
because I just put Bondi stands on so
that's why I look like an oompa loompa
rewind to yesterday we went to Target
and I picked up a few things and I just
wanted to let you know what what my
thoughts are on some of the things that
I got yet brush I absolutely love I use
the brush to put my tanning stuff on my
face and my hands and my feet just to
blend it all and get it nice and not
like it's super heavy layer like the
globe does second is the pixie makeup
setting spray I hate it oh my gosh I
hate it so much I used it today and
first of all it smells like baby powder
and I am NOT like a baby powdery fresh
scent II kind of person so that was
number one number two is it made my face
feel so dry all day you know when you
have a face mask on and it's time for it
to come off you like open your mouth and
you can feel it cracking that is how my
face felt all day probably just going to
get this video edited a work a little
bit in bed and then you go to sleep
because I'm so tired and we have a long
day tomorrow I'll see you guys in the
morning
good morning
day one kind of a safe day one this is
our third day here in Florida day one of
the event the weather is so nice it
feels like LA it's like warm but the
wind is chilly excellent
what's crazy is that there are these
signs all over there's one right there
it says watch out for alligators and
snakes wet
there's lots of construction going on
that's going up but these are all of the
rooms they're these cute little cabañas
and then the actual lobby hotel is way
over here so we're kind of far away from
everything yeah you can't just like oh
those are rooms too that's for the
fitness center oh my gosh the fitness
center so far you had to go all the way
over there the new room we transferred
to be closer to the fitness center
I know that seems kind of crazy but the
fitness center is probably like a
15-minute walk from our old room so we
just called to see if they have anything
available they did so this way here is
our new room okay
which bed is yours because I'm
definitely getting my own bed well I'm I
want this one this one's mine wait so
wait you're not letting me have my own
bed what this is nice new bathroom
and what are you filming me filming
you're sweet lots of counter space for
shenanigans excuse me do you come with
the room we're doing can I take you home
really want my own we are about to head
back over to the event and I'll get some
clips of what's going on there show you
guys sure what we're doing you funny
entrance yeah Tony Robbins is speaking
on Saturday that will be fun

and sky watch her room and we're both
starving we haven't eaten since
breakfast it's like almost seven o'clock
but since we've got our stuff moved from
one room to another
our fridge stuff isn't here so like all
of our Tofurky basically like all of our
dinner stuff isn't here and so they're
trying to find it right now but I bet it
got thrown away somehow so we might have
to make another trip to Whole Foods for
both hangry we're like on the same side
so we're not like we're not like being
angry to each other
because we're both hangry together I
guarantee they threw it away it's
looking like it was it's not looking
good it's looking very tossed but at
least we get to listen to Disney tunes
on hold wait what were you singing
earlier the Ducks Oh duck tails that
tail song if you were born in the 80s or
early 90s you know what duck tails sing
it for me I forgot to you're singing the
Power Rangers theme song but with love
toy Rangers is not Disney that's hamsa
bond so please vacate the premises we
don't really sings we'll give you the
food situation this is what we get for
asking to change rooms though this is
our karma you guys we weren't trying to
be bratty when we asked to change rooms
we were just seeing if maybe they had a
room available closer to the fitness
center and so they said yes so they said
it was no big deal so we took it and
