those of you who are new here my name is
Ashley and I do predominately style
videos but today I'm sitting down and
showing you some of my favorites all
ready for springtime a combination of
beauty accessories and fashion favorites
sure most of you guys are like me as the
season changes my favorites change
because my skin changes my style changes
everything just kind of takes a ship I
will go ahead and start with the beauty
products and before we do get started I
just want to thank Kula for partnering
up with me on this video my skin is
super sensitive to sunscreen so this is
a nice healthy sunscreen that my skin
responds really well to whether it be on
my body but especially on my face my
first product from Kula is the 70%
organic full-spectrum 360 Sun silk drops
and this is a indoor/outdoor
environmental and digital UVA UVB IR and
HEV protection which is so great that
means it protects outside as well as
inside when you're on your computer when
you're on your phone to help prevent
from indoor and outdoor signs of aging
after doing some research I learned that
the UV light can't cause skin cancer
directly but it can cause pigmentation
issues which I have no idea about until
I did research on the matter especially
for those of you guys who are like
myself I'm costly on my phone consoling
on my computer times like it's this
close to my face with I don't have my
glasses on and I can't see as for the
texture of it I've been using this for a
couple of weeks now and it is really
fast absorbing and it's really
moisturizing as well so after I put it
on it feels like a really light
moisturizer but it absorbs really well
so it doesn't interfere when I'm putting
my foundation on or when I'm putting my
nighttime serums on so the next product
I have from Kula is their somewhat an
anti-aging face serum and I love this
way more than I love my San Tropez face
like tanning lotion is because I can
actually mix this with my other serums
with the lotion it kind of gums up on my
face when I'm mixing with my serum so I
really really love this of I'm actually
wearing it right now my next beauty
product is the way rose hair and a body
oil I'm gonna be honest I
super love this for my hair love my
geese new hair oil I will never not use
that I use this mostly for my body if I
have a little bit left over I'll go down
the end but I wouldn't just like put
this completely on my hair because it's
like it's an oil pit but it smells
amazing on my skin so I'll throw it on
before I'm going to the gym after the
shower just any time during the day I
need a refresher I will throw some of
this on next is a hair and body milk and
this smells amazing it's kind of the
same idea as the as this but this one's
a little bit more liquidy and not so
boilie I am just fresh out of the gym
and you know I'm not washing fully like
fully washing my hair I can spray a
little bit of this and it makes it smell
clean and nice and fresh and you can
also spray it on your skin put some more
of a rose scent and then this one is
more of a coconut beachy brush then and
love them both equal don't play
favorites with my children so next I
have two things from drunk elephant one
of my favorite brands in the whole
entire world and the first thing I have
is my vitamin C Sarah after I get out of
the shower and in the mornings I will
put this on my neck and on my chest
I don't always put it on my face because
there are other things that I've been
putting on my face but the good thing
about this if you do put it on your face
it doesn't wash off it seeps it and even
says that like you can't wash this off
it literally just like seeps into your
pores and stays
I guess science I don't feel super
moisturized because it absorbs and you
literally like it disappears it's like
not there anymore do you notice the
difference in the skin texture and the
skin tone of my chest is the drunk
elephant baby facial and it took me a
month to actually spend the money to buy
this stuff but after hearing just
amazing things about it just kept
hearing like this is the best of ever
and I'm just like really like how how
can it compare to a facial so I went and
I broke down and I got it and oh my gosh
I'm so glad I did it is so amazing that
I can't even describe the feeling of my
skin after using it
once a week makes my makeup go on better
even if even if I use it and then two
days later like I still feel a
difference in my makeup and if I stop
using it then I definitely notice a
difference in my skin and it's not as
good as if I'm regularly using the
stuffy next product I have is a lip
sleep mask and you can kind of see
Stella got a hold of this one but it's
been so windy lately and my lips get so
chapped when it's windy and so I just
cook this on my lips every single night
I wake up and it's like a baby soft lips
there's no dry skin there's no flakiness
this stuff is lip miracle if you are
prone to chapped lips next I have the
Josie Maran Argan milk and this is what
I mix with my foundation and it's just
enough of a not so much oil but just
like a little milky silky texture to
give me a small dewy look on my skin
with my mica a little bit goes a long
way for my whole face
I really just need like one little drop
and it spreads nicely it is my bright
skin licorice root serum and I get the
stuff on Amazon almost done with this
bottle but it really just brightens up
my skin and it makes my skin texture
more even I put this on usually once a
day and I have noticed the difference in
the texture of my skin smells like
licorice chew for those of you I know so
many people hate licorice but I actually
love licorice so if you don't like
licorice then maybe stay away from this
if you hate this bill because it smells
like a twizzler the black ones
so my last beauty product is the Sunday
Riley another one of my all-time
favorite brands a Sunday Riley is the
ultra clarifying face oil this is an
acne fighting oil smells terrible and
it's green but I don't know what is up
with my skin lately I just been getting
breakouts all right here right here and
I clean my makeup brushes like I don't
know what's going on so um I bought this
a couple of weeks ago and I have cleared
up so much I don't know if it's a
hormone issue or or what but or
something I'm putting on it's not
agreeing with me but this has cleared up
my face so much if you guys are prone to
acne or if you're prone to breakouts
definitely give this a try
the pricing thing is is usually acne
oils are very drying but this is
actually very moisturizing it almost is
like a serum when you put it on and rub
it in it's very you can see it's very
oily although I really wouldn't expect a
product like this just smell good it's
almost kind of comforting that it stinks
because that means there's stuff in it
that's fighting off your pimples so I
have one home item and it is this candle
is who makes this I guess Rome makes it
but it is the New York scent and oh my
gosh it smells so good is this like
weird I don't know why I'm like a weird
scent person I'm not like a mango or a
vanilla I like weird note that says
amber Burch mineral and patchouli said
this is my kind of candle I love the
volcano candle from Anthropologie by
Capri blue it's probably my favorite
this is kind of comparable to the the
scent of that this is a little sweeter
but it's also kind of I don't know I'm
sitting here trying to explain a smell
and you're probably like just stop
talking okay next we will get into
actually no you know what I've got a
book the America morning I read this
last month and it is life-changing for
those of you guys who are feeling stuck
in a rut don't get on on a better a
better mindset this is a very mental
type book if you are wanting to change
your mindset in the way you're living
your life or the way you're doing your
routines
definitely pick this up right so we'll
get into the fashion section
I had these are my new reading glasses
look how cute these are I just loved the
color I thought they were very spring
and I can see really well when I have
that they're just reading glasses
they're not like prescription glasses
but I just thought the color was cute
and I love the little tiny
I on them next is this necklace I have
been loving and it is from child of wild
you guys always asked me where this is
from i layer this on with pretty much
everything it's just a basic coin
necklace for spring I love nothing more
than like a deep V and layering on a
bunch of necklaces I think it just looks
really cool it looks really put together
even though you're just wearing a basic
t-shirt okay two rows to show you so I
will start with this one this allows the
tags on it because I actually just went
and bought this color I have a few other
colors but it is this one right you
think it's their newest bra but there's
no underwire they have beautiful colors
I also got this really a pretty like
chocolate
mommy color it's really pretty as satin
and clings to it it literally feels like
you're wearing nothing but it also gives
you the support at the same time no
padding it's just great it's like the
perfect comfy bra but also like sexy
because it's that and trying to trying
to get rid of my target grandma rob
trying to find something I love more but
I think this might give it a run for its
money my next one are my sticky boobies
and I just discovered these from
Victoria's Secret and Mayer in the pink
section they come in nude and black and
I bought four of each color do you wear
them you can just throw them in the
washing machine let them air dry and
they get their sticky back they're good
for about two uses and then you wash
them I've my black pair I've worn and
washed like 15 times and they're still
as good as do so these are a great
investment they have the nipple right
here doesn't have sticky on it I know
there are some sticky boobs around like
oh my god and like you rip your nipple
off but these are great because it is
like nipple protection times 100 the
next thing I have been loving is just a
basic clutch and I am a I'm a small bag
person I don't love a big tote unless
I'm needing to pack a bunch of stuff for
efficiency but I mostly like small bags
and I've been loving this clutch lately
I don't know I'll just randomly grab it
with an outfit and I I don't know
like Who am I who is this new accessory
person next we have a white shoe on this
one I have been loving more than all my
other white shoes this one is from Zara
and I don't know I just think it's so
great casual it's great dressed up it
gives you a little bit of height they're
very comfortable it's kind of a good
alternative to a white bootie if you
guys are trying to get into the white
boot trend I mean you're just like not
feeling it you can't feel like you put
it you put a good outfit together try
this that's an alternative this one's a
little bit easier to style than a basic
white bootie you think I want to show
you I'm showing you for more reasons
than one number one is the color number
two is just the overall idea of it so
I've been loving this color for spring
I've been just kind of buying anything
that I'm seeing that is this color I
think it's really pretty with denim it's
pretty with black it's pretty with white
grays and it's very girly but very sexy
at the same time kind of like a muted
dusty rose pink agate reason is just the
jacket I love a good long satin duster
for spring who wait who has that olive
green one
I think it's Topshop has a null link it
below pi can find it but it's this
beautiful olive green satin duster and I
just think it's so cool over jeans and a
tank top and some layered necklaces I
think pieces like this are so easy for
Springs lightweight but it's also a
jacket at the same time for those days
where it's a little bit chilly and you
want to look layered but you also don't
want to burn up I think something like
this is perfect so I've been loving this
and lastly I have been loving denim
jackets and not your basic denim jackets
I've been loving patchwork denim cropped
and I just kind of wanted to show you
guys this one that I got from forever 21
it's kind of like a very 80s vibe denim
jacket with the elastic band on the back
so this is something that I've been
loving is kind of oversized
lots of dimension it's got this big
lapel and like a fluffy collar so I
really love this one scrunched the
sleeves up carrot with denim
all denim look is something that I've
been loving alright so that is it for my
favorites these are some favorites that
I have been loving for spring I know
we're just now into spring but I do want
to do another favorites towards the end
of spring with these are some products
that I've been using over the past few
weeks but I've been loving some even
longer you know if you want to see more
