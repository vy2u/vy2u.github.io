was just at a New York Fashion Week
party for neesh at the Twitter
headquarters and I got home a little
early so I thought well why not film
again unready with me um so yeah let's
go ahead first of all and get out of
these clothes and into my row step
number one I don't know about you guys
but when I get home
the order is bra off first makeup off
second so now that the first is done I'm
going to take my makeup off and I
usually do this in the shower but I will
take it off for you guys out here so I
can show you what I use to take off my
makeup or my makeup removal I put some
good old Vaseline on my eyes just feel
like this most gentle thing for my my
skin I've really sensitive skin around
my eyes so what I like to do is just
pretty much coat my eyes with Vaseline
and if I have on a matte lipstick I'll
also put it on my lips and on my
eyebrows then I like to get a either a
warm washcloth or mostly a makeup wipe a
favorite makeup wipes right now these
for a brand charcoal exfoliating wipes
right the Tarte fresh eyes eye makeup
remover
well after I let my Vaseline sit for
about 30 seconds I'll just get a makeup
wipe and just basically go to town on my
eyes my lips my eyebrows and then after
that I'll either flip it over rinse it
out or get a new wipe and then do get as
much of my face makeup off as I can or
my face scrub I use my Mario enzyme
cleansing gel and this really just helps
get all of the excess makeup off all of
my dead skin cells it's really really
gentle on my skin which I love doesn't
really have a smell or anything it just
kind of makes my skin look a little bit
fresher times if I don't get all my
makeup off when it when I get out of the
shower my skin almost looks a little
dull and this kind of brightens it and
just makes it feel really really clean
for my last step in my makeup taking my
makeup off and washing my face
my Mario acne facial cleanse I'm kind of
prone to breakouts not as much as I used
to be but definitely still prone I have
pretty sensitive skin when it comes to
like oils and stuff like that so this
really just helps maintain breakouts and
it also helps me if I do get a breakout
it helps clear it up so I really really
love this stuff like I said before those
are things that I would normally do when
I'm in the shower but it is kind of want
to show you guys my makeup removing
routine so products that I use while I'm
in the shower alternate back and forth
between these two body washes my molten
brown eucalyptus I love it eucalyptus
scent it's like one of my favorites
something about it just clears your head
and it just like so good or my seaweed
bath company body wash as well it's
really good and it feels really clean as
soon as I step in the shower I like to
do a couple of drops of lavender oil as
everyone probably knows lavender is no.2
calm and relaxed so just kind of letting
the bathroom fill with steam and then
some lavender drops it's just like
really relaxing anise I've been doing
this for a while and I just it's one of
my favorite things I like look forward
to it when I get home and one of those
people that showers at night and in the
morning well I cannot go to sleep unless
I have showered like I feel dirty
especially in New York you walk outside
for five seconds and you just feel like
you're dirty I don't know it's weird I
have to shower in the morning because it
just makes me feel good it wakes me up
makes me just do better throughout the
day I can concentrate more I just feel
more energized and awake so I know a lot
of people tell me it's not good for you
to shower twice a day but I don't care I
shower twice today now that I showed you
guys what I'm using i'm actually going
to hop in the shower and use these
things and i'll see you guys when I get
out
after my shower I like to like to start
by putting my there's witch hazel toner
on my face
and this really just makes me feel like
my pores are tightened everything's
tight where it should be and it really
just gives you that like clean feeling
after you take your makeup off will
helps get rid of excess makeup if
there's anything left your toner will
get it for you next I'm gonna do my SK 2
facial treatment essence and this just
really also helped me feel like
everything's locked into place
it really helps tone down my like if I
have any Browns sunspots or any like dry
patches on my skin this should on my
moisturizer I'm just gonna use this
fresh say in my glasses on deep
hydration face cream I'm only gonna use
this kind of around my eyes because I'm
starting to get a little dry I think
because of the weather so I'm just gonna
put a little bit of this around my eyes
and maybe a little bit on my chin for my
skin like my body my body's good we used
this herbivore Sun oil it's after Sun
oil I haven't really been in the Sun too
much lately but I'm like I said earlier
the air is getting a little dry so my
skin starting to feel dry
it's like coconuts it's really really
good and it makes my skin feel good so
I'm gonna use this instead of lotion
today I'm gonna do a little bit of hair
oil first edge towards the end of the
day my hair starts feeling a little dry
so if I let some hair oil sit on my ends
overnight I kind of wake up with more
moisturized and just soft your hairs -
hair oils that I like to swap out are
these two and they're my absolute
favorites this one smells better but
this one I can also put on my face as a
face oil I think it just has more
natural oils in it so I like to swap
between these
all right thank you I don't get a new
wheel on my my skin or my face I'm just
gonna go ahead and throw my hair back up
into a ponytail so I stay
that's my skincare haircare after my
shower routine now it is time for the
most important thing of the whole night
lounge clothes put my comfy clothes on
I've got this like oversized sweatshirt
from Free People and just plain black
leggings super comfortable I'm gonna
make some tea and then every night Brian
and I will make some tea put on a show
that we've deep yard and then finish up
emails for the day while we watch our
show so big multitaskers around here I
think tonight we're gonna watch suits
because it came on last night usually
either do I've got my little tea bowl
here I usually either do green tea for
lavender chamomile and I think I'm gonna
do this one tonight
we
dragonfly my head
him dead
bedtime if you can't tell I'm in but at
my PJs and just brush my teeth and got
in bed and it's really weird blogging
and filming in bed it's like super weird
but this is real life I'm in bed and
this is what's happening so so usually
at night I like to keep my lamp on for
about an hour
read a few chapters in my book and
always turn on my oil diffuser as you
can see right here I'll link it below
now I have the lavender oil in but I
would super crazy on Amazon and bought
like a pack of 12 oils oh I got like
gardenia lilac I got a pack so I'm gonna
link it below so you guys can check it
out but so far I like love my lavender
wine yeah umm if I have a headache or
something or if I'm stopped up or a
Ryan's allergies something I'll put the
eucalyptus one in there and it's so
great so if you suffer from allergies
try the eucalyptus there's a dude sleep
with my hair in a ponytail
only because dello in the morning when
she wants me to get up she'll bite my
hair so if it's up in a bun it's just
harder for her to get to now I am
reading you are a badass and I actually
started it month and I only got through
two pages and then like forgot about it
because I was like at the pool or
something but all of the girls mostly
girls in the life by her group Facebook
group have read it and said that it's
really good so I'm gonna read it now
though I'm gonna go read my book I'm
gonna go to sleep it's getting kind of
late now and Stella's super tired
she's like passed out so yeah I'm gonna
go and I will see
in my next video
akward diarrhea face
or this is the second meet morning guys
I'm going to my first Fashion Week event
