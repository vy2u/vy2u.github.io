name is Ashley if you are new here and
this is the very last video in my office
style series the first two videos were
kind of more geared towards tips and
tricks and hacks it's going to be more
outfit focused with like a side of tips
and tricks I don't know what I just said
it is blocked out but and just bear with
me all of my spring shoes are in storage
right now I think I have maybe two pairs
of spring shoes in my closet right now
New York closet problems I do not have
room this video is geared towards the
trouser I wanted to pick trousers
because I feel like it's still that
weather where it's bright and sunny it's
still a little chilly so we are grabbing
our trousers more so than we are our
skirts right now do a whole video on my
four favorite pairs of trousers that I
own right now I also wanted to talk
about kind of transitioning into spring
so I have two springtime trousers and I
have two all year round trousers and
also keep in mind if this doesn't apply
to your dress code I know everyone's
dress code is so different um just kind
of take take it with a grain of salt
kind of work around it work towards your
dress code and we'll just roll let's go
ahead and get into the outfit first pair
of trousers that I'm going to be showing
you guys are these really beautiful
bobby rose colored pink wide leg
trousers and this is a really spring
focus color I think an item like this
really brightens up your outfit and I
just think it's so beautiful for spring
if I was going for a really bright light
all-over girly look I would definitely
do a cream or a white top with some sort
of detail on itself is cream and it has
a really cool like ruffle and not even
so much a ruffle just like so many
different dimensions to this sleeve it's
comfortable and I think it goes great
with the pink browser you could do a
little pink on pink so you can create
this monochromatic look with all
different shades of pink which I really
love and this tee is a little casual for
work so I would definitely do a blazer
or a bomber or something like that over
just so you're not wearing a basic
t-shirt now this
is a little see-through so I would not
personally wear this one to the office
there are so many different shades of
pink tops out there that you can find
that are appropriate for work and next
is one of my favorite color combinations
and it is this pink and black I think
this is just a really really cool color
combination I think it's kind of
unexpected I love pairing blacks with
pastels I feel like it's kind of like
mist mixing girly and edgy which is so
my style it's something that I do on a
daily basis so I really love this color
combination and I think it's great for
the office it's kind of eye catching in
a standout eye next pair of trousers are
these white culottes and this is
actually a pair that I wore during the
fall in winter because they are so thick
it's a really thick material so it can
kind of take you all season I was really
lucky to find these because every time I
find a pair of white pants are always
more geared towards spring and summer
one of my favorite ways to style white
pants for spring is with a white top I
know groundbreaking but I just love a
white on white look and these pants are
actually more of a cream white and this
top is a little bit more on the cream
size so again you've got a monochromatic
look but still kind of breaking it up
with different shades of the same color
if you wanted to layer up and add a
blazer I picked up this one from Zara
actually linen and this color is just so
beautiful I feel like this color can
also carry you into fall but it's still
a very spring and summer material
because it is Lenin this love the idea
of almost made out with the camera of
the idea of these two colors colliding
you could do a white on white look with
this blazer and you can even do a white
top and then the splits are over it as
well and I think that's a really
beautiful combination also my are crazy
today crazy so next we're gonna talk
about the good old black trouser and
this is something I feel like all of you
guys have we all have a pair of black
trousers in our closet especially if
we're going to work
you have you need to get some because
this is like a lifesaver for me anytime
I'm like needing a cool pant even if
it's with a graphic tee or a dressy
blouse I always go for these if I don't
want to wear black jeans so and to
lighten things up a little bit and make
these a little bit more springtime I
would pair them with some sort of
printed spring top now of course you
could do a solid like the light pink top
I showed you but that's kind of boring
if you want a fun if you want it cool
then I would do something like this
I think the silhouette is really great
not everyone is a print person but I
totally am so if you are more
comfortable wearing a you know pink
solid or like a light blue solid that's
great as well just as long as your
apparent these spring colors in the
spring prints to kind of tie in with the
black and lighten things up a little bit
so next is another spring pant that
could go either way could go fall it
could go somewhere it could go spring
and it is this pair of navy pleated
super wide leg super wide leg culottes
it's such an all year-round color and I
think it's such an understated color i'm
i've been using navy more of as a
neutral like i would black or white i
think maybe it's just like a really
great color to have in your closet to
alternate between your black and your
wife lighten things up and to make these
a little bit more springtime i would do
some sort of really nice white button
top of course i love a fun sleeve so
this is my first choice i think this is
a really great outfit it's simple it's
basic but it still is stylish and it's
trendy because of the fun sleeve and if
you wanted to add a little bit of print
and a little texture you could always
add something like this over it this is
obviously more on the code side so I
don't know if I would just sit at my
desk and wear this all day I would
probably take it off as soon as I got to
the office but if you guys have Blazers
like this I think this is a really cool
color combination when you're talking
about navy white and in this really
pretty
mazie
right here kind of a really cool color
story if you are looking for something
to wear throughout the day with this
outfit I would do something like this
this is a chambray duster actually from
Target and I just picked this up a week
ago and I've worn it three times already
I love it so much so I think adding
something like this is a really good way
to add layers and it was a little cold
this will keep you warmer but you could
do this as a coat or you could do this
as kind of a third piece as like a
duster blazer type situation which i
think is always it just adds a little
bit more into your outfit if your style
is more on the simple side and you
aren't printed and you are a layer kind
of girl you can always go for something
like this this is just a basic blush
pink top with some navy trimming around
the sides and I think this is a really
good outfit too it's basic it's simple
it's not super dressy it's kind of
relaxed and I really love this outfit
alright guys I hope you love this video
and I hope you love the outfits that I
threw together for you trousers are
making a bigger comeback than they ever
have because menswear is really a focus
right now and I feel like cool trousers
are so attainable and they're so easy to
find in most stores yeah I just really
wanted to give you guys some trouser
inspiration and I really hope that you
guys love this video and I really liked
