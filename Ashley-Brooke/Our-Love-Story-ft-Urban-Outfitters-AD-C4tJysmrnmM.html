I have teamed up with Urban Outfitters
to share my Urban Outfitters flop story
I'd like to introduce my guest for the
day right right
this is cute and how did Ryan and I meet
I remember super not being into it at
all there was a pool parties it was the
beginning of summer and he came up and
introduced himself to me he's like hi
I'm Ryan nice to meet you and I'm Ryan
what's awesome nice to meet you is very
standoffish is very kind of
disinterested I thought I was really
nice
I was really nice now that I think about
it got actually phone number from the
friend who is this are you texting me
finally we actually got together it was
like a group date they took me to a
direction and I ended up finding him
very charming and funny at the end of
that night he knew this she's an amazing
person that's like what if happening
thing I don't want to be in a
relationship month and a half to two
months after that I knew this day was
old movies dinners and concerts to have
a great time we were at our favorite
Mexican to the place I just looked at as
it's like I really really enjoyed and
what's going on she's my girlfriend
and I said yes so that is how I ended up
I thought it was so sweet when you asked
me to be your girlfriend we'll be trying
to be - it was trying to be like suave
romantic but how do you ask that
question I had already had a week nine
to move in New York City so with you my
girlfriend is a long-distance thing for
a while at first I wasn't a fan of Mila
yes New York in those fast attack
to be with my we kind of like started
again
over moved in together a couple of years
later we just decided that we miss New
York and we just wanted a change and I
just said hey why don't at the end of
this year our lease is up here why don't
we just go acting you all up with
everything is enough and we drove from
San Antonio's network city so much fun
stop there like Target Walmart and we
would get like sandwich nothing would
pull over make sandwiches signal back to
you all in just promise us you know we
started a business our company wife by
her and really more of like empowering
women and a great community that we have
so nice to be able to have your partner
and your best friend alongside with you
to go on all of these these journeys the
huge part of our life together has been
actually supporting me too because I've
had incredibly hard times with my own
business last they came along I had that
drive I knew I wanted to build a life
she drove me to build my business what
it is today
Urban Outfitters into us the most
amazing Valentine's Day care package and
show you guys what we got who wears the
pants in the relationship you know start
with that yes this is the look at this
color when did you know Ashley was the
one I've never enough thought but I knew
Ryan with the blends the way he treated
his mom he's so great to his mom and
he's such a family person and it just
came off the genuine you know that used
to do this you can't take my answer good
smell mine it's really cool packaging
make Miami your answer but I will say
the first akheon rose de Parfum human
facial this is not reports aligned crime
with llamas who is the better kisser
so let me the she caught them and I know
a bit of the kids really do deserve to
watch ankylosis cover when annoying
thing that they do and take to the
eyelashes out times me picked it it
makes the squishing sound and it will
makes my skin like bath bomb the
eyelashes are really long any since they
get tangled like you can see whether you
know they don't keep gift items here the
packaging is so cute I got some spray
body coffee scrub I've always wanted to
try this news I still do romantic things
for each other it's so what I had leaves
me note so hide them and sometimes I
won't find them for light week it was
really gonna kill okay they're like in a
book that I'm reading I'm such a sucker
for cute bra less and underwear set so
pretty and it's seamless in the back
