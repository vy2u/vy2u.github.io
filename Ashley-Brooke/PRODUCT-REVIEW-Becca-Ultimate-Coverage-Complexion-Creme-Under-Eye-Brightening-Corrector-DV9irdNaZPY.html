my channel if you like the cameras just
a little bit okay today I am doing a
review over the Bekaa ultimate coverage
foundation and I'm also what doing just
kind of like a side coverage over the
under eye brightening corrector I didn't
have a hard time picking up my color at
all
I you know just kind of did like the
time when I ever
okay I never like whenever I find our
nation I always go to Sephora without
any makeup on that way it's so much
easier to test out my colors so I got
color matched for the color cashmere and
it is a really really good color match I
don't have any immunity on my neck so
this is kind of like exact match and I'm
so happy with it this is actually my
second time wearing it I just wanted to
test it out first just to see if it was
even worth doing a video over and it was
definitely was I am doing this video
without any artificial light this is a
natural light I just wanted you guys to
see like what it really really looks
like without anything shining directly
into my face so you can really get like
a good idea of what the foundation
actually looks like I do have like a
small light over here just because my
windows here and then like my kitchens
over here so there is a light shining
here but this over here is a whole
natural light so you can like really see
what it looks like so don't forget to
subscribe to my channel I am going to
put a subscribe button right here so you
can just click that and Global Users you
should see like a little icon somewhere
up here to subscribe so just click that
button and I'm awkward
I'm gonna start by doing a couple of
pumps of the foundation on the back of
my hand just getting one one pump is
enough one pump goes a long ways so I'm
going to grab my foundation brush and
I'm going to just cut oh you guys like
half a pump is plenty there's like so
much on my hand right now I'm just going
to kind of smear that in
he kind of smelled like paint but no
time bad way I mean I guess if you don't
like the way pants mousy probably
wouldn't like it but I like doing things
mom it looks like I'm going to have to
go in with my blends II and blend it out
because it's not really taking that well
to a foundation brush probably because
it's such full coverage so I would
definitely apply it with a foundation
brush but you're going to need a sponge
you're going to need a sponge do you
blend it all out it looks really nice
though very full coverage now I'm going
to go in with my Becca under-eye
brightening corrector and you know I now
that I look at the consistency of this I
probably would have put this on before
my foundation but let's just put it on
now to see what happens it feels like
lip gloss so that's kind of strange but
I'm just gonna go ahead and use my
finger to apply it so now that I have
applied both products that I am testing
out today I'm just gonna go ahead and
finish out my makeup routine just to see
how everything builds on top of it and
how well everything kind of molds
together and stays in place throughout
the day so I'm gonna be adding is some
under-eye brightening cream
and I'm just gonna do a mineral powder
just to kind of set everything in place
and also spill it all over myself
you
so my first impression is if you're
looking for a full coverage foundation
this is definitely great applying it
onto my face it's definitely full
coverage without kind of that cakey look
as soon as I switched from my foundation
brush to my blends II everything kind of
blended in I was kind of worried at
first but after I use my bloody
everything blended in it looks great so
far I don't have anything going into my
crocs here or under my eyes so that's
good I don't know if you've ever tried a
foundation in the store then you get
home and it's like a completely
different color that's not so much the
case for the stuff like I tried it on at
the store and it's exactly the color
that I was hoping for so that's always a
good thing
the only negative to this so far is that
does smell like wall paint I don't know
if you know smell bothers you I mean
obviously when it goes on it doesn't
smell like paint but just on my hand it
smells a little bit paint which is kind
of weird and the under eye brightening
corrector I would definitely next time
put this on before I put my foundation
on it's I mean it's amazing I have dark
circles and I also have our problem with
like dry skin under my eyes and this
this is great everything blended in
really really well so that's amazing I
will use this before I put on any
foundation no matter what it is but like
I said put it on before your foundation
because I'm kind of seeing like a little
like shininess right here after I put my
setting powder on it kind of went away
but um yeah so put this on first I am
going to do all my other stuff that I
was going to do today and I will come
back to you guys later tonight
let you know how it lasts throughout the
day and give you a couple of like
close-ups to see like what's going on
with all of this okay I hope these tips
what is that been there this whole time
so I'm back and it's been about eight
hours since I shot the first time and I
just wanted to kind of give you guys a
quick little like review from my all day
where from both products um love the
foundation and I was increased in my
smile lines at all like not even a
little bit and it's creased
a little bit in my eyes but I think if I
put more like a setting powder under my
eyes that will help that so love the
foundation I'm going to be using this
from now on it is a great full coverage
foundation what I was really stoked
about was this under eye brightening
concealer I have been looking so long
for a product that is moisturizing under
my eyes that covers my dark circles and
I think I haven't found it there you
have it I love both products that I
would recommend them to anybody that's
looking for a full coverage foundation
anyone that has drier skin I have
combination skin but I do get dry spots
under my eyes and kind of like around
but other than that you know it's so
great so there you go once again don't
