freefall / end of summer hall I was
going to be super consistent about
posting halls but this time of year I
just like I'm not into it at all it's
such a tricky time of year because it's
still so hot outside yet every store has
like sweaters and jeans and I can't get
into it I had to get some stuff so I'm
doing kind of a like buy now where now
all the things that I feel like you can
incorporate to your denim shorts and
stuff like that so I have a quite a bit
of stuff here so dump it out so I only
got one thing from H&amp;amp;M so we'll just
start with that and get it out of the
way I got this sweatshirt I think it's
so cool the print the color everything
about it I love you can incorporate it
like right now I would wear it with some
denim shorts with the sleeves kind of
like rolled and scrunched all the way up
and this is just such a cool print and I
love like the varsity neckline H&amp;amp;M has
like the coolest print I always get my
best sweatshirts and bomber jackets and
stuff like that from H&amp;amp;M
so say usually do really really well
with that kind of stuff here is the nail
polish like this some pick a bronzy
purple it's really cool it's called
stunner it's five bucks I love it they
got two foam cases because I couldn't
decide on them so it is black with like
embroidery flowers but steps with it I
think this is so pretty for fall I'm
such a phone case person and then the
second one I got is on my phone it is a
lace kind of like watercolor one and
it's like literally
two inches wide so that's kind of an
issue you see the watercolor print on it
so all of them are different some of
them have more blue some have more pink
I took like all plenty of them off the
rack and have them laid out on this
table trying to decide which one I
wanted I'm embarrassing but you know and
then we will move into the zara stuff
I've got this Navy ruffled tops I just
thought it was pretty big know how I
feel about ruffles just give me
everything with ruffles on it this is a
shear here and then a cheer up here the
part like cover with your boob area
perfect for going out or even during the
daytime with like a light wash skinny
jean I think is so pretty
and it was super affordable this was oh
that's not in u.s. dollars I don't know
how much it was I love it oh and I like
the dark navy also it's not black even
though it's close so still maybe my next
art purchase is a pair of know why I'm
showing you guys these so comfortable
and I was like you know I need a good
pair of like airport sweatpants um yeah
love these you'll see once they're on
they're pretty cool they're like a drop
crotch tapered off the ankle I love them
had to happen there's a matching
sweatshirt shoe so I did not get that
because I don't know how I feel about
that my next zara purchase having a
button malfunction so me next zara
purchase is this tweed top is tweed with
um lace down the front and then lace on
the bottom
hello and it's short-sleeved which I
like that can wear it with shorts right
now or like jeans and like a cool jacket
over it in the winter or false whatever
like how it has like shredding on the
sleep I don't know you know how I like
love detail and this top is like a
detail itself Oh like I have to have
this really cute on to so this would
look good purchase for me my next one is
one of my favorites and it is a cropped
scalloped sweater and it's glittery
scallops on the bottom is what got my
attention I was like that's adorable and
I was like it's metallic done I'm even
me to try it on I'm just gonna take it
they have this color and then they have
like a blush-colored umm I really wanted
the blush color but I already have to
blush sweaters and I was like you just
need the gray Ashley just get the gray
it's perfect for like slack highway
skinny jeans
stop it those adorable and this was only
49 which is kind of making me want to go
back and get the pink one but no you
don't eat it one of my favorites are
purchases is this little velvet bag this
is so cute and so old lady I love it so
much look at it it's just plain black
look if you put it against something
black just this is your whole outfit
this bag can fit maybe
three things in it but it's everything I
love it so much I think it's so cool I
love you
and my lapses aren't purchased is my
sequins headband which I'm going to be
wearing in my how to style video on
Sunday so look out for this is so cute
and it makes me feel like a gypsy which
is perfect I love this so much I can't
hear much because it's really thick and
tight on my hat and it's covering my
ears but I just think it adds so much to
your outfit like this because your
outfit I'm sure the lady checking me out
was like what is wrong with this girl
and a little sparkle crazy and sarra
that's fine I accept it but my next haul
is from forever 21 this long-sleeved um
really it's a pretty long shirt it's
like a tunic shirt I think it's it's
very flattering um if you paired it with
some flares or some skinny jeans I love
this and it's got a choker fabric built
into it and it's a pretty low V and it's
also thick like one of those good thick
shirts that you know it's gonna last you
a long time excited to find this because
I've been wanting one of these shirts
for a long time I just put up find the
right one so I'm really glad that I
found this guy and then this little
beauties I was so excited to find so
yeah I thought the odorant on it I'm not
sure like why I wore this today earlier
and like as soon as I put it on you know
when you know you got the odorant on it
you put it on and you like slow motion
feel it just like rub down your armpit
in your life
I love this leave this is the cutest
thing ever
and your hand does actually come out of
it you know how some of these things
that like covers your whole hands like
this look for me they're great for when
you're going out and you want to wear
just like a little bra lit under it or
if you want to layer it under dresses or
shirts oh I would probably layer it
under this shirt that I'm wearing now
which is also sparkly I have a problem
next is this little oh my gosh this is
one of my most simple yet favorite
purchases of the whole haul it's just
just plain black mock neck long sleeves
swing dress both perfect layering piece
that you could ever imagine you can put
a fur vest you can put a long duster
blazer you can do an army jacket are a
million different things that you can do
with this I think this is like one of
the most important fall staples that you
could ever have it's only $12 so and
it's thick it's like kind of that
stretchy bouncy bit cotton so this looks
like one of my favorites the true test
see how cute old lady for life we're
excited about this one oh I love this
one also this one is just kind of this
my star shirt is laced up kind of like a
say she starts all over it means thief I
love this one and this was $15 perfect
it's not my favorite sleeve the one that
cinches at the wrist because you know I
love scrunching my sleeves up so I love
this top I think I'm wearing this in my
intro to my Hobbit style video you'll
see that on Sunday as well i next Shh oh
let me get it ready for you next
purchase was this little lace t-shirt
and I wasn't so crazy about it on the
hanger but then I tried it on and I like
totally got it I was like this is super
cute um this is definitely one of those
by now we're not pieces that you can put
it on with like a pair of denim shorts
and just kind of like dress it down a
little bit you can also like wear it in
this fall with a leather jacket and then
you can see that like lace underneath so
I thought this was just like kind of
like I needed it and it ties in the back
got a little tight tie closure the
long-sleeved off the shoulder rustle
overlay top and it just looks like a big
ball of fabric as I hold it up but
you'll be able to see when I like put it
on in the video that it's like actually
really cute colors are pretty it's like
light blue with black so it's really
pretty with light blue denim guess what
it's got stretchy sleeves my favorite so
it's just like a cute like easy top you
need a top to go out for the day or at
night this looks good grab and go top
and next we have this basic mock neck
like ribbed long sleeve shirt with a tie
back only you can't really see it but
I'll show you in the video I was wearing
denim shorts when I tried this on and it
so cute with them in short so we're like
high-waisted you know it's just like an
interesting detail it also a good
layering tops it's this if you put
something over it it's just like a good
under layer piece to have so it's kind
of versatile you can wear it with
whatever next is this drea is like it's
hide ie print but it's got right just
like me struggling trying to show you
the bottom this is like an all
year-round dress you wear this in the
summer with black sandals or you know
something like that but in the fall I'm
thinking with a black booties and a
black leather jacket I think would be
very boho what kind of cool look so I
love this I thought the the tie-dye was
cool I love all the Blues in it and then
I got these socks because they reminded
me of Brian for those of you who have
been following my channel for a while
and my snapchat you will know why these
remind me of Brian so these are my new
orion's that is it for my all I hope you

things to lapse me through like the
random days where it's kind of cold
during the morning time and then still

things to get me through this random
transition so stay tuned when it gets a
