I'm doing a very long overdue call I've
been done one of these in so long and
I've accumulated quite a few things so
I'm going to go ahead and show you some
things I've gotten over the past I guess
like months a couple of months maybe to
have my clothes set up in different
piles by store
and one miscellaneous store but it's my
favorite item so I'm going to save it
for last
we'll start with store number one River
Island we'll start with my vinyl skirt I
smell Festivus I do not have one of
these and I always love them every year
every fall I just never get one throw
this year I was like getting a vinyl
skirt and it's going to be awesome
so yeah I'm excited and it's just a
basic Morin gold zipper detail on the
back really lightweight this knife it's
not too short or too tight just
absolutely love the skirt next start
some denim Bermuda shorts and I know
some who you're probably gagging looking
at these but I love them I've been
looking for a good period Bermuda shorts
for a while you definitely have to like
know what you're doing when you wear
them either need to like dress them up
to be cute or like super dress them down
with like sneakers and a tank top
I'm just going to be really mindful when
styling they're probably going to be
like my casual because they are pretty
leg loose and they are super shredded so
I was really excited to buy these
actually I think these are sold out on
their site but I believe they have
another pair very similar that I will
link below my last piece from River
Island is this really pretty off the
shoulder almost like a bone colored top
is so gorgeous
and it actually has a really long tie in
the back but you can do like a bow or a
knot and have it hang down and it's not
this looks really pretty and feminine
and the color is really soft for fall
it's not like a true white so I think
this will be really pretty with like
black like black high-waisted skinny
jeans for like dinner going out or
something all from River Island I think
my H&amp;amp;M haul is pretty small so I will do
that first is this bathing suit that I
got
like to screen velvet and I thought it
was so cool it's like this olive color
of course I get like a zebra in the
bottom and an 8 in the top because boobs
I tried on the zero in this top and it
was basically like just a nipple cover
icon a size 8 in the top but even like
this part still fits me really well
I don't know their sizing is a whack
then other I love these Lea high-waisted
kind of like fold over jeans and I think
these are I've been looking for a pair
of these for so long and I bought that
bathing suit and I was walking out the
door in the Saudis and I went back I was
in the one Times Square I went back and
waited in line for another 30 minutes
because I'm one of them so bad just love
these with like a crop top or like a
long blazer or just something to kind of
accentuate what's going on in the way
next I will do Urban Outfitters this
rougher and I posted this on and stories
yesterday but I really loved it it's
backless kind of like an
off-the-shoulder situation and it's cut
out on the sides and it's this really
pretty floral color not color it's black
with floral print and next is this
suspender skirt by BD g and i love this
it's like this all of color ties in the
waist and then has the suspenders and I
just thought this was perfect for fall
even with like this top that I'm wearing
now I think it's so cute you can do like
a bra top underneath a banjo a sweater a
mock neck there's just so much that you
can do with just love this and I got a
extra small a on 9 o next from Urban is
basically what I'm wearing right now
except in a swim inform you that quite a
bit but I love it it's like a very cross
in the front and then has these huge
batwing squeeze and it kind of comes to
a closure at the bottom it's really cute
I mean just look like some jeans I don't
know I am such a sweater person so I
need like oversized I want cropped
textured colors prints I just love
sweaters in the ball really easy to just
throw on with jeans even use chains on
them right now how cute this outfit too
some hair that's fuzz I'm not liking
this part next is my target stuff and
this little cutie is from who what where
it's like a plaid bomber it's so cute
though it's very like varsity jacket
style I love this like how cool with
some black jeans or even like a black
skirt or something
I love this I just thought this the
coolest thing so I hope this I got these
flaps and they're by Massimo but they're
just kind of these like black wraparound
kind of new Miu inspired flats and
they're really comfortable I wore them
all day not that long ago and they did
be good all day long so I really love
these so next is the motherlode cold
laura has a laptop I'll start with my
two pairs of shorts so I thought these
high-waisted elastic band short they are
navy and black striped they're so cool
they're almost like a Bermuda short they
are long and I know I just love these or
something so like masculine and tomboy
about them but yet I could still wear it
like a crop top or like even tank top
with it I don't know I just think these
are really easy to throw on in style and
they add like a really cool element to
your outfit next our actual Bermuda
shorts but I'm just so excited about
these i order them online and they're
this really pretty like Hello almost
greyish olive color and I carefully tell
we find them like giant ring buckle
detail I think my mom had me Maties
I remember seeing pictures of us
together and she's very mean I'm like
you're so stylish but you can even take
this belt off and add your own belt if
you wanted to you know if you were doing
gold accessories maybe take off the belt
and add your own or leat without a belt
the belt loops are kind of like
very obvious so I would do some sort of
felt maybe is this chemical top I love
this I think that the strap is what got
me it's like this really edgy button
strap but yet such a feminine top I just
love the combination of edgy and
feminine and this shirt is like the
definition of that so I was really
excited to find this I would just do
this with jeans or shorts even during
the daytime and then with like black
skinnies at nighttime so something I got
on sale I still don't know if I know I
like this or I like this it's this
off-the-shoulder ruched sleeve dress I
was like it's a lot of material and it
has a ribbon tie and I was kind of this
was part of their spring collection I
believe but I didn't so see this in
fault with like some black ankle booties
I think that's probably what I'm waiting
for to wear it but this I got a pretty
good deal on it I think I got like 60%
off I love this I think the color is
pretty it's like this peachy salmon
color next is this little sick of very
thick thick dress but it stripes with
buttons and this is something that I
would throw on should be comfortable
during the day while I'm working but
still feel like I'm kind of dressed I
don't know I don't work well if I'm
wearing like my sweats and stuff during
the day I try to throw on at least like
something so this is kind of like my
something piece I hear an abundance of
sneakers and I'm good to go I love this
I actually tried to return it but I
couldn't find my receipt so now I'm
going to keep it but now I kind of like
it though isn't it
next is another art of community all
right oh my god feel really good about
this once when was 130 and I got it for
40 and it's like this really cool red
trench coat okay it looks orange in the
camera but it's not it's like a it's
like a very true run so I'm going to
touch this if there's no hardware the
buttons are like the same color as the
jacket so nothing sticks out it's just
like I don't know I would almost maybe
wear this is like a third piece as well
we'll see
but it's cool I love it alright next I
have to
or shear tops and the first one is this
black fishnet and I love this fishnet
basic black fishnet good for layering
good for by itself with a black bra lit
black window.i most simple thing but it
can just make it a whole entire outfit
so yeah very tight though and I got a
small and I was like in the dressing
room trying to like squeeze it on so
maybe I shoulda got a medium I don't
know too late now I'm going to make it
work next is one of those items that I
saw on my way out of the storm and it's
this one right here again good for
layering good for by itself I just think
it's so cool how pretty that is
I love it something so feminine about
this that I just loved this one was only
$15 so I thought it was a good little
add-on to my purchase since a very small
piece and I should not believe that I am
buying jackets right now if I am but it
is this guy right here I just I had to
have if I could not let it talk they
knew it would sell out I got an extra
small it runs oversized for short
oversized I mean obviously it's like a
batwing but I loved how the sides
tie up see this there we go got like a
buckle as well so it looks really cool
when it's closed I don't know I just
think this is going to be a really good
fall layering piece to just kind of
throw over certain things and then I
love like the faux shearling detail on
it so that is all for my haul hope you
guys liked it I feel like it just flew
by but now I'm looking at my pilot oh my
god my favorite thing hold on just
forgot my favorite thing in the whole
Hulk it is really so three people this
dress
and I'm just so obsessed with this dress
I'm so excited that I got it I'm so
excited I found it and I just love it
you're gonna have to look at it on the
screen because it's like obviously so
much fabric details are just too cool I
mean like so much went into making this
dress so this list because it is tasking
through it's a little bit more on the
pricey side again just kind of one of
those things if I found this in a thrift
store for 10 dollars I would love it
just as much as I do now and you know I
definitely believe in you know not
buying things because they're expensive
and designer but find them because you
genuinely love them two hundred and
thirty dollars for a dress might not be
a lot to some people but it is to me I
feel like that's kind of a lot for one
piece especially something so specific
you know I'm not going to get a ton of
wear out of this but I just loved it so
much so enough doesn't it I have to have
it and I'm glad I got no regrets then I
should just put the compliments did I
get my use out of it before full know
what I can wear this in the fall I can
put like a block tuck it over it like a
black leather jacket might be cool a
size extra small and the armpit dress
still a little droopy so side boob you
gotta wear the slip though okay so that
really is all I have for you for this
haul hope you loved it I let some items
accumulate and I'm sure there's others
floating around but I will put them in
the next haul if I find them and it's a
weird time of year you know it's like
transformation from summer to fall and
it's really hot but there is fall stuff
and it's like what do I do I love it all
so I'm kind of still buying like bathing
suits and also jacket so that's where
we're at right now but I'm really
excited to start getting more into all
my favorite time of year I love fall
clothes and there'll be more hauls to
