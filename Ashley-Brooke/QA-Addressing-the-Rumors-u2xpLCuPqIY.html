brother my pretty mouth okay well I am
like all shirts right now
that was the shirt even all fitting in
the frame okay welcome back to of my
channel today we're doing a Q&amp;amp;A it's
been quite a while since I've left done
one especially with this one Ryan do you
guys want kids and how many Justin just
someone wasn't a yes or no yes we
definitely want kids how many I have no
clue idk bro more than one yeah oh no it
will get to a point where we're just
want to have like a little baseball team
you can only accessorize with one tonne
gold silver or rose gold why would it be
gold all the way right look and you
protect your hair in the humidity both
use living proof the whole anti frizz
line is amazing I wanted to ask you if
you are absolutely sure about your
relationship with Ryan all the time or
if you doubt it from time to time if I
ever get out a call if I ever doubted my
relationship I wouldn't be with that
person there's any doubt in your minds
and you either need to address what
you're doubting and maybe figure it out
with yourself or with your partner of
scutes
what were you like as a child and in
high school so as a child I was a really
mature child because I think I'm the
first born I've seen old movies but I
was a very quick grown up child because
they didn't have any siblings to play
with and I'm sure a lot of you guys who
or the first child understand and your
parents say the same thing so and I was
around adults all the time because my
parents were in college when they had me
so I was constantly around like adults
and I wasn't around other children but
as in high school I was bad I was not
good I'm sorry mom it was the hardest
part in your relationship long distance
when we lived apart when I lived in New
York and she was
taxes for a while so I learned for yeah
it worked but it was hard being a part
because we missed each other never doing
how many days a week do you work out I
try and go like four four or five times
a week if I'm I don't have a lot of time
I'll just try to fit in like some sort
of cardio some sort of physical activity
if I don't have time to that and I just
have like 20 minutes to spare I'll do
yoga with adriene or just kind of a
quick at-home exercise you know like
almost oh really yeah
so Tracy hi Tracy and Tracy wants to
know how I grew my channel so fast and
the Ryan's take on other clients my
channel grew really fast because I kind
of found something that I was good at
and duck stuck to it and was really
consistent and even though I was working
a full-time job I just kept putting out
three videos a week over and over and
over and over and so why still do three
videos a week but how am I here at
second my son yes the fast growth the
fast growth in my opinion was because of
consistency your videos a week quality
remarkable content a meeting remarkable
life its unique and quality and you can
see how that works in your analytics
when you look at your shares are people
sharing it because yes and that's a
really good sign that you need to keep
that up keep creating you super unique
content that's a signature to you about
clients know my business isn't about
growing YouTube channels my business is
ecommerce pay-per-click management so we
manage money people spend to show ad
instead of Google what are some of your
tips for moving to New York
well number one you should go back and
watch the tips no no all those are still
very relevant sell all did you afford to
move to New York it saved our money for
a really really long time every friggin
year yeah I'll be hard not just like
wanting to pack about and move because I
know I'm the person that means like
instant gratification and it was really
hard to save for a year but then it just
made you appreciate it that much more
and appreciate
your own hard work for saving what was
the hardest part about moving to New
York evening our family yeah
leaving family so hard when we not
selling abundance here why not to go
change stuff okay I had to change shirts
because my bun kept getting caught on my
buttons so thank y'all will ever move
back to Texas maybe to raise a family or
retirement yes yeah we will probably
move back to Texas at some point I don't
think we'll ever retire though it's just
not in our nature
we'll always be doing something you've
never moved to LA yeah we talked about
going for like a month in the winter how
do you and I have financially split
costs in NYC when it's so expensive do
you so we do what we essentially share
finances at this point we've been
together for long enough when we first
moved so we split everything I could
never expect Ryan to pay for anything
more than me ever one day I was at work
when I was working my like corporate
jobs some of the girls that I work with
I was weird that Brian didn't pay for
the rent or he didn't pay for all the
bills and I was so mad I was like is not
his job to pay for the rent if I can
easily split it with him I don't know I
just didn't want him paying for all of
myself though has been very adamant
about that but even when it wasn't very
easy for you to slip rent you still
weren't sent an opponent yeah I just
have that nature about you and Ryan made
way more money than me honestly I mean
way more but I still wanted to split
everything because I just didn't think
that it was fair for him to work so hard
and have to pay more and she always
during those times and still does think
of me first
big on doing surprises and getting me
random things even when she chews on
hard times which is just a testament to
holla me
whoaaa yo Loman lova 20 hours do you
sleep per night
hello not a matte fixture like five and
a half just lug nuts what the look on
your sleep app on an iPhone as the
bedtime feature in the middle I always
do that and it usually says about like 5
min after 6 hours would you like to
create a clothing brand if yes what
would you name it well and clothing line
is in the works obviously it's it's like
buy her clothing line so it's coming and
it's coming good do you get married soon
I don't know what she asked me he can't
cling to the apartment she claims
department no I do a lot of dishes yeah
and I make the bed and does your main
job and how do you decide to deal with
YouTube I try to split my time was like
5050 between YouTube and life by her as
your go to breakfast smoothies almond
milk I finish um better frozen banana
frozen strawberry vegan smart vanilla
protein powder date you black bees so
why don't you tell what your Sochi
smoothie is very simple smoothie man
water protein powder banana maybe some
strawberries are you guys stay motivated
do you ever feel like you're doing the
same things every day it's tired of it I
just stay motivated because I love doing
what I do that's what motivates me so
you know what motivates me to go to the
gym is because I like the way I feel
when I'm at the gym after the gym and I
don't like the way I feel when I skip
the gym four days in a row I love you
know running wet by her and I love
YouTube and what motivates me is just
seeing it grow feel like if you're
constantly searching for motivation on
one certain topic then maybe you need to
reassess what what you're doing it for
you know if you just can't find
motivation then you need to just search
for the reason lab select really dig dig
for motivation then it's just probably
not for you
motivation is complete
subjective meaning it's up to the
individual what's going to motivate you
so if you're any trouble thing
motivating you to identify a goal and
try to accomplish it that's how we stay
motivated we have goals that we want to
accomplish reaching and stretching for
those requires a motivation so if you
want like motivation to go to the gym
set a goal for yourself why do you want
to go to the gym to this ten pounds okay
let that be your motivation you know you
can't you need like he said an end goal
in mind if you weren't doing YouTube /
creating fashion content what would you
and mine be doing Brian owns his own
business so he he really just helps me
with YouTube and content so I guess what
would you do if you didn't have your
business I would be doing something in
marketing general I'm fascinated with
marketing and how to put something out
into the world and have people be
interested in it next question how old
are you and I when you met here you're
23 and I was 25 25 oh my god and now
you're 31 hush what tips do you have for
making friends and wife working events
and different like volunteering you know
if you love animals volunteer in the
animal shelter and you'll make friends
there I'm sure I think they're just
putting yourself out there and I know
it's so hard because so many people in
New York are just working all the time
I've been there and trust me I
completely understand but try Facebook
groups too I know that there are
Facebook groups of like women who live
in New York who you can kind of like get
to know and then meet up with the
easiest route would be in your immediate
social circle that you work with get
people similar interests that's the
easiest because you have proximity to
them any of your friends through them or
your guys favorite thing about each
other very thoughtful you always put
yourself before I mean you always put me
before you always so myself me like
favorite thing about Ashley is that
she's absolutely selfless when it comes
together dinner so make sure I'm making
water to do all the laundry without me
asking she just always tries to make
sure I'm comfortable if I'm sick it's
just like waiting on hand and foot
making sure I'm okay about medicine and
my back hurts I have a heating pad
everything about the experience together
is she's just so selfless and trying to
make me feel better no not me how do you
do with hate about your figure of body
or people criticizing your side you know
I know I said this before but when
people criticize my body time I weigh
low a lot I honestly could not care less
the only thing that bothers me is that
other people who are maybe struggling
with body issues they see those comments
and then they think negatively about
themselves or all of my family our
families watch my youtube videos and you
know it hurts them to see these words
thrown at me you know my twelve year old
sister see some of the terrible things
that some of you write your words don't
hurt don't hurt me at all I have very
thick skin and I don't get offended
easily I think when you're offended it's
such a waste of time and energy I do
worry and my heart hurts for people who
are seeing your nasty words and our
families you have to see that and stop
to that really good quote we actually
just read together yesterday attention
in general and says don't let the parade
go to your head and don't let the hate
go to your heart thanks dad Liam that's
great you guys ever struggle with the
jealousy in your relationship so how do
you overcome it you have never had a
jealousy issue you know we don't put
each other in uncomfortable situations
to where the other one would we don't
have jealousy in our relation yet it is
not there there's no reason to have it
we never
we have but until your other point like
just as humans we have like in animate
default to measuring ourselves against
what we see with other people just like
the default state I see someone has that
that'd be so cool to have that so that
but you have to make sure that it's a
good type of motivational jealousy if
you will and not like and I hate this
person and I hope that they fail because
they have all these amazing things going
for them you can't think like that you
have to see this person with so many
great things and say I want to work so
hard to become well perspective you go
to Starbucks
I'm gonna let you answer that because
you can never remember my work grande
iced almond latte two pumps of talking
on how long have you arrived been
together six years in October
and how quick did you move in together
it was kind of one of those things where
Ryan furtively even like his clothes his
toothbrush and and he just kind like
never left one day to overcome your own
insecurities of loving yourself body
earth - hole I just think that comes
with age or experiences maybe those
company everybody goes through
insecurities when they're younger but
there just has to come a time where you
you need to just learn to love yourself
and learn that nobody's perfect everyone
has insecurities not everyone is just
100 percent like always just happy with
themselves and almost just embrace your
vlogs and just accept yourself for who
you are and once you do that you will no
longer care what other people think
about you anyone ever think Ryan is
running around ryan hollins
Ryan thanks Ryan is Ryan Reynolds I did
I'm the only person that thing I just
want to be his friend you want to be in
no I want to be his friend that'd be
weird to be why because I wouldn't do
with
gladly Blake's great she seems so great
who are total mystical what are the top
three things you would each say is vital
in a successful relationship
communication honesty unconditional love
I think we've answered this before
because these say the same thing I have
seen I wish you a great time with your
family in Texas my question would be
what are your go-to apps on your phone
what music do you like
edible Spotify Sonam Lightroom mint some
well it's not audible the podcast app
zero the fasting after being together so
long how have you guys results arguments
what have you found that works for you I
think staying calm and really knowing
what the issue is like if we're in an
argument we usually just sit there and
say okay where where it's the issue
coming from and how can we resolve this
right now really have to be self-aware
in an argument and realize hey what are
we actually fighting about with what's
going on how can we resolve is because
nobody wants to fight you know it's not
pleasant if they try to make it in the
but pretty quick usually and any
argument like with them so how does Ryan
managed to run is on business while also
being so heavily involved with filming
for you lb8 to all the other projects
you both do
how do you stay organized or motivated
to excel on things every day will never
have enough hours of the day to do all
that you wanna do that's just something
you have to accept and to best manage
everything what we do is means Google
Calendar we slack to communicate we use
asana for project management that is how
everyone who knows what they're doing
every single day take which is a lot of
terrifying to your system yes I got I've
had my business for 10 years now and
it's been a learning process on how to
stay organized and I have more time to
allocate towards life by her stuff is
because I have a team for my business
that handles a lot of day-to-day things
will you stay plant-based for good I
can't see us not being landing I can
think at this point we do not are so
not being planning I strict and
consistent are you do you ever cheat
like you need pizza or ice cream
hamburger when you are on the go and
don't have time to plan your meal yeah
because then you wouldn't be planning he
was just not be plant-based what is the
best memory you two have together I say
when we first met so many fun memories
because of you are like just getting to
know each other yeah and then I would
also go animate yeah but also saying
when we road-tripped from Texas to New
Zealand that was so much fun when we dip
the road trip we got the u-haul and we
drove from Texas to New York it took us
three days staying in hotels along the
way
that's an amazing memory on them again
no have you always been that confident
about wearing your own style I often get
comments like oh you're kind of
overdressed or are you going partying
after work they don't say it in a mean
way but still bothers me and sometimes
for example when I'm in the mood to wear
my fake fur coat I decide not to just
because I don't want to hear these
comments anymore yeah I hope they're the
same thing in college I was a
kinesiology major so obviously we were
in a bunch of health classes and usually
all the girls were dressed in gym
clothes and I was dressed kind of like
this I would get comments all the time
and I I kind of just learned that maybe
they were insecure with themselves or
maybe something was going on with them
and their insecurities so they felt the
need to try to embarrass me I don't know
what they were trying to do don't take
it personal I don't think it's you I
think it's something to do with them
don't let it bother you I mean where
would you want you know obviously
they're noticing which is a good thing
how is being vegan going great for me in
hi and move our favorite cell b8 ladies
you have recommendations for kids proof
lip products or does Ryan have a
technique to not get more it's kind of
do the kids and then the wine yeah she's
a kiss way at the end of the QA but I
got so many questions about my boobs I
can tell you they were like 50% so we
just thought I'll go ahead and talk
about it while we're doing the Q&amp;amp;A just
did get them done I feel like it was
obvious I wasn't
time to hide it from anyone because
that's not something you really hi there
was actually a month either just shy of
a month or a month where there was no
blog because that was my recovery time
and even the very next vlog I never
raised the camera Brian held the camera
the whole block so we did pre film
outfit videos for film three three or
four yes there is warm I've been wanting
them done for a really long time since I
was you know in my early 20s but I
wanted to wait until I was older I felt
that was the right decision just to see
pure mind changes or if you grow now
that I'm 29
I figured that this was the right time I
saved money for it it's really something
that I wanted for myself and I did it
for myself I think my best advice if
you're wanting one to talk to the people
who you care about most and who know you
the best and who you respect and trust
for me I asked my best friend I talked
to my mom my grandmother Ryan's mom
Brian's sister and that's really the
only people's opinion that I cared about
when thinking about getting this done
and they were all so happy for me don't
do it to please your boyfriend or your
husband don't do it for any reason but
for yourself and I think that's you know
why I wanted to wait until I was older
to go to go through with it because I
have so much growing to do still you
know your mind when you're 21 isn't the
same as when you're 29 that's where
you're growing days are and made the
decision to wait almost 10 years to
decide whenever I was starting my
journey I was on real self calm and it
is the best site that I recommend for
when you're thinking about getting
something done because you get to read
people's experiences it's like a black
blog and trees and photos and what they
went through and that's actually how I
felt my doctor went to how many
consultations for five four plus the
last doctor revisited I just knew it
just I felt it this is the one I'm so
comfortable with him I trust him we're
doing it yeah see what size I wanted and
I told him
completely trust you I just want it to
look natural and real on my body and he
was like got it I had my consultation
and then I had to wait two months a lot
of you say that you're scared of
anesthesia and I wasn't scared at the
anesthesia more so as I was that the
after-effects of anesthesia because some
people get depressed and I just hear
like you're just not right for a while
which happened to me I didn't get across
but I wasn't right for like a while so I
was not really nervous about anything at
all I was really excited so I went in it
happened so fast when in garden IV
hooked up woke up had boobies and went
home but if you were asking me how I
worked and how I put three videos out a
week and I actually didn't take any of
my pain medicine so I could be conscious
and so I could focus and work and I
really wasn't in any pain in there the
first few days were really rough because
it felt like there was an elephant
sitting on my chest and the swelling and
the tightness was just like so bad
recovery was was fine I mean you the
most painful thing about the whole
process was I had to lay on my back to
sleep at night and when you're laying in
bed all day and all night
it takes a toll on your back so um that
was the most pain that I went through
was then after a few days I was able to
get out of the bed by myself and slowly
discharge being able to function but you
definitely need somebody to take care of
you you cannot do this alone I don't
know how people do it alone but yeah
they look really scary for the first
month like they're up to here for the
first month or they're pretty good but
then they end up dropping and settling
back into place and to look like a
normal boob and yes I mean you get to
sleep in sports Rob every night and
sports bras every day I was going to do
a video on this like a full-on video but
I'm still in the recovery process I just
hit my three months mark and but a lot
of you guys were really really wanting a
video so I just thought I would go ahead
and answer it now I'm doing good
if I'm laying on a hard mattress like on
my side I feel a little a little bit of
pain but my scars are completely gone
the scars are like not even there I
don't like my doctor is amazing so but
thing is is everyone's experienced like
I was on real self and there were some
people that scared me so bad I was like
I think I'm gonna cancel my appointment
I don't want to do this anymore like
some people's experiences no bad in your
sense yeah but my experience was a
complete breeze and of course there was
swelling and bruising and tightness but
for the most part it was great but
everyone's different so that was a grand
salt because everyone's bit different so
our camera battery keeps getting too hot
our camera gets too hot so we are going
to end this Q&amp;amp;A and if you have any
questions regarding surgery or anything
just I will answer be monitoring the
comments section so feel free to ask any
questions if I missed something cuz I
know you guys have a lot of questions
about the surgery so just ask and I will
answer but yes we're going to go make
food now and don't forget to sign up for
