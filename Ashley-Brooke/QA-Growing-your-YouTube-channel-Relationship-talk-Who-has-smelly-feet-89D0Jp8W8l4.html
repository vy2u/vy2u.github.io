what is your advice for eating healthy
I'm gonna try and answer some of this
chick is he eats way healthier than I do
I think a big part of eating healthy is
not having junk food where you can just
like grab it all the time so just don't
keep it in your cabinet don't keep junk
food just lying around because you will
eat it even if you say you're not you're
going to and I believe everything in
moderation gotta keep your sanity
friends eat yo sandy don't eat any sugar
period
you just need a big plane of redstone
I mean that's fair this sunday' but also
I'm big on chairman investment
yeah Bryan does a lot of fasting
Google that yeah you're interested in
bouncing look into it it really doesn't
make a difference I've I've done it
before but I get so hangry
you're the hay every time I come in
fasting all right you okay in here just
like totally right in the middle
I'm gonna sit down to finish this Q&amp;amp;A
who are your favorite youtubers to watch
still I when I do sit down and like
watch a little YouTube I love Casey
needs dad I think he's Casey neistat's I
love watching Eric and Jessica Eric
Conover and girlfriend Jessica they live
in New York City and they kind of did I
think they just vlog they just seemed so
humble and so nice and they're always
themselves and I love this woman who I
just love her she's got like this
calming by when she talks and I love her
her name's what's her name's Lydia Elise
millon Lydia Elise millon so I'll link
her channel below to you she's in the UK
but she just seems so sweet and so nice
and she always does halls and stuff like
that so I think she's a good person to
watch also speaking of this question who
Diaz I think that I should collaborate
with I never done a collaboration before
and I've kind of been wondering like
what that's about and I don't know let
me know that you guys think Ashton
instead of letting me know you should
well yeah you should let me know but
then you should go send that person a
comment and tell them but they should
collaborate with me kind of get the ball
rolling you know do you believe that
emerging bloggers needs to move to the
big city to make it PSE miss you on
Instagram I just posted an I'm sorry
message to you guys on Instagram because
I really haven't been on Instagram
lately I don't know what's wrong with me
sorry
I'm kind of I'm back coming back do I
think emerging bloggers need to move to
the big city to make it absolutely it's
not no way you can start a blog from
anywhere or your followers fall in love
with you and your style and not where
you live
don't let that stop you don't let living
anywhere besides the big city stop you
from starting a blog 100% start wherever
you are how do you stay motivated and
how do you manage to wake up so early I
stay motivated because I do things that
I love I didn't love doing YouTube
videos and style videos and styling in
fashion then I wouldn't be motivated to
do this but this is something that I am
so in love with and I'm still in love
with you guys and the interaction that
we have that is like you see motivated
so if you're doing something that you
truly love doing you'll always see
motivating you won't have to worry about
that and how do you wake up super early
I know when I was in college and that's
all through high school I could sleep
until 3:00 p.m. and not even wake up I
don't know I think it's just as you get
older you I don't know I'm wide awake at
6:00 a.m. I think it also has to do with
the fact that I go to bed around 10:00
so my body just automatically wakes up
at 6:00 if you're not an early riser I
suggest maybe going to bed earlier that
way you can wake up early and just
really have the whole day ahead of you
so I mean I'm getting all please say no
also do you use different lenses for the
how to style videos because you
mentioned you use a sony a 5100 in a
different video yep
Bryan and I use the sony a 5100 for
everything have been looking into a new
camera that we might get soon but I will
let you guys know once I switch cameras
that way you're just kind of in the loop
and know what's going on behind the
scenes I'm gonna keep you in the loop
don't worry I'm not gonna change cameras
and Unseld you guys are we planning to
restock the battery top
that's a good question to be determined
I don't know if I'm gonna restock the
Bowery top I do know that there is
another really cool product coming to
you guys soon
can't wait how do you look for such good
music for your videos SoundCloud
number one YouTube yeah there's YouTube
channels out there that's called
nocopyrightsounds trap nation join the
family come AR you gotta do you like it
when I talk like that to SoundCloud trap
city trepanation nocopyrightsounds
hero board and are you writing this down
it's not like we just typed something in
and we find something it's like digging
down into voice yes it's listening a lot
a lot of our bad songs to find the good
ones
yeah we've listened for hours but it's
your favorite song for the moment and
favorite song of all time I met Natasha
Bedingfield the other day so I've been
singing her songs non-stop in my head
but I only know one I'm trying to find a
lighting ring to start making YouTube
videos which ones you use or what do you
think is best
I have a deeper ring light I don't think
I've used it in months because I
normally just sit in front of my window
and let natural light come in green
light it's good for when you're shooting
at night or when you're shooting an
up-close makeup tutorial and you really
want to highlight everything on your
face I've done the Amazon and it's great
I will link that below because we search
for ever trying to find one that we
liked so it would have been super
helpful if I if someone was just like
here this is the one you need buy this
one all right next question Ryan you are
a business owner what tips new
my dad Keith but douse me all the time
cuz I'm the first on his favorite list
so someone also asked me how to grow
their YouTube channels
I'm not Ryan take this one because I
feel like kind of more his expertise
something that he's really good at he's
very smart though so to grow a YouTube
channel you need to figure out what
market you're in
meaning what type of videos you want to
make us a lot of what other people are
doing and see what is working and what's
not working and you can judge by that to
see how many views they're getting what
their subscriber base looks like what
videos get a lot of activity and then
you can essentially make the same type
of a video but you can put your own spin
on it need to make sure that your titles
are optimized for what people are
searching for saying it's like all in
the title there's a lot of it in the
title and in your description and your
tags as well utilize those tags so right
and it's from those who you guys met
actually in one of our vlogs they are
starting a project called young rich and
fit and it's basically kind of a
community you know how like us like me
and you guys are like a fashion
community you know we love style we're
positive you know we're successful like
that's what we're about we're about
building each other up Ryan and his
friend Louis are kind of doing the same
thing on the opposite spectrum with more
of a male audience I don't know I think
it's just such a cool project and I
really wanted to share that with you
guys because if you have husbands or
boyfriends or even if you're interested
you know in seemless grow like something
cool to know there's an Instagram page
up right now YouTube channels coming
soon and yeah it'll be interesting we'll
talk a lot about how we've built our
lives in a certain way to where we can
be fit and having fun and kind of work
from wherever we want and just how to
build a life around that and we want to
build a community of guys that are all
about that want to create that for
themselves because it's truly possible
for anyone go follow the Instagram page
because they post a lot of
just quotes like really cold
motivational quotes and and every time
I'm having like a day where I'm like
stealing kind as I'm motivated I always
see young rich in bed come up and
they're there photos are so amazing and
just so inspiring last question and we
were almost done but then a question
just came through what is your secret of
your long relationship I feel like a
perfect relationship doesn't just happen
overnight nor is there any such thing as
the perfect relationship but I would say
Ryan and I have built our relationship
on trust honesty communication those are
three key ingredients to a healthy
relationship let's use the word healthy
instead of perfect because there is no
perfect relationship
we actually just kind of mastered our
communication like this patio you're
here yeah because we're also like not
only are we you know in a serious
relationship but we also have business
partners and he has a business mind I
have a creative mind and they work so
well together but they also clash a lot
trust obviously I think any relationship
is built on trust and if you don't trust
the person that you're with it's never
gonna work
I know before Ryan I was in an unhealthy
relationship where there was no trust
there's no communication and there was
absolutely no honesty and you know you
just know like you just know and
something's not right don't do something
about it don't make yourself it all
comes down to kind of just be a good
human being overall if you're doing
something you think this is a kind of
shady don't do that don't be that person
that does weird things for no reason or
don't be in a relationship well yeah if
you want to do weird things and just do
whatever you want and choose to not be
in a relationship because you don't want
to burden another person who might be
more into it than you that's not cool
but I've known for ever since like a
month after I met her that I wanted to
be with her for the longest time
evers for ever's now I have a question
for you guys right now in this moment
whose feet stick mirror my feet
yeah I smell I don't smell anything
I think it's like whoever smelt it dealt
it no we don't play by childish rules
here we played by scents and smells Oh
God just even though I think that is it
I think that's all the questions right
now
sorry about that times a-tickin now we
gotta get going
oh yeah am I gonna be holding this talk
no it's like long sleeves punish your
breasts and like strawberries no super
fresh drink you drank a fresh tree why
how fresh like the earlier times
hey rain so don't you hate it when you
lose your keys to them they're in your
hand no no
No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
