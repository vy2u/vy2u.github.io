cream you're you're kicked out of the
video man Arthur
root beer bars its Bork that's a G that
is a cumin and as a G what's up guys we
are gonna get started with our Q&amp;amp;A here
um I asked you guys on snapchat for some
questions for our QA and I was like
let's talk about business fashion and
relationships don't don't be afraid to
get a little TMI which some of you
definitely did how long did you wait to
get it on with Ryan oh that is TMI like
actually or is it so I've gotten a few
questions about what city I would like
to live in after New York we would
either go to LA just because that's
probably where we travel the most
outside of like home or I would just
probably move back to Texas probably
like Austin Austin sounds fun la v12
okay question where did you and Ryan go
on your first date and what it's your
most awful date story we want our first
date papacito's what would you say your
worst date story is with us I think I
know mine probably the first time I
farted in front of you it's hard to call
it a date but yeah they always say it's
all about the first kiss but I think
it's all about the first part there's
more of those moments where you hear it
you like that really just happen I miss
driving I was in the passenger seat we
were getting pulled over I was super
nervous because Ryan was driving my car
and I didn't know how that works like am
I gonna get in trouble because he's
driving my car and he's getting pulled
over so I was looking for the insurance
like frantically the cop was like coming
to the window and I just like gotten
nervous and farted oh I didn't know how
to feel about this how did you know your
other half was the one and when was that
moment I when Ryan and I first met I had
already planned to move to New York with
a few my girlfriends
I was so scared to tell him we just
started dating I moved anyways and he
was totally okay with that he was said
go do your thing we've been dating for
what like two months with her three
months and I moved to New York we did a
long-distance relationship and he was so
supportive throughout the whole entire
thing and never met someone so secure
with themselves and in a relationship he
is so selfless you know not being upset
that I move without him constantly like
calling me texting me like he let me
live my dream for a while to do what I
wanted to do and was totally okay and
secure with it and that that's just the
kind of person you want to be with
doesn't get much better than that have
you and Ryan ever been close to giving
up on each other or breaking up no it
sounds when I definitely want to walk
out of the room how many relationships
have you already had I've had one
long-term relationship prior to Ryan and
then I hate he and I broke up I wanted
just to be single for a while and just
kind of figure myself out and do my own
thing but then I met Ryan and I tried to
stay away because I just wanted to be
single because I just got out of this
relationship but I kept just gravitating
towards him and couldn't stay away so
yeah that's about right sounds about
right
what's your relationship instead
relationship what's your relationship
secret sinks having a healthy one after
five years and not getting bored of each
other I know we've talked about this
before but the key is just communication
and honesty you got to be besties yeah
you gotta be that's eager like the same
TV shows that's so important because if
you didn't like um like Dexter or like
Dexter is how we bought the walking down
the first night some exceptions though
like PL oh come on
pretty little wires like mom well you
know wait you don't worry about it
because it's coming to end the end of an
error you see ever yeah
era
the end of an era all right little play
on words sir how do you don't get bored
with each other I think like you said it
comes down to just like being with your
best friend yeah you know like one and I
think of going to do something I was
thinking like I'm rather do it with her
than almost anybody else yeah even if
it's just going to another part of the
city I experienced that with someone is
your bestie there are times that we're
here working just like he and I and we
don't say two words to each other for a
few hours because we're both working so
it's not like we're constantly
chit-chatting we have to move positions
because the lighting and we lose in
light where is our favorite dinner spot
in the Midtown area let's say our
favorite spot on three okay one two
three home we don't eat out a lot so my
favorite spot is wrong we did a couple
not really a couple but a place nearby
us BFP yeah ba ba ba
hmm 44 next 44 next 44 and a half we go
out neat we used a light go towards West
Village area or Tribeca or something
like that what special things do you do
when you feel stressed frustrated or
overwhelmed kind of Li like having a
conversation with Ryan really helps me
like we'll go for a walk or we'll just
sit on the couch and just talk it out
and usually it's not that big of a deal
once you get down to it and have someone
to talk to about it
and if you don't have anybody to have a
conversation with you can on this we're
being talked to yourself about it you
think yourself why am I upset right now
identify I make a list of what you're
really upset about and then ask the
question is this really a big deal
that's a good advice that I totally
agree with you okay have you ever dealt
with insecurity or trust issues in your
relationship with Ryan never like I said
before he's like the most secure person
with himself and in this really
chip I've never dealt with any trust or
insecurity issues with him honestly I
did in my last relationship and I look
back on it and I'm thinking to myself
like why did I put up with that for so
long not trusting the person that you're
with and just kind of feeling insecure
like things are going on
why does do that for so long now it's I
know what it's like to be with someone
who is such an honest person so no I I
never ever ever felt any type of feeling
of that nature you and Ryan want kids
yes you want kids one day right have you
finally told the story about your
contract with Ryan you mentioned it once
that you're not married but you have a
contract and there's a story behind it
okay so Ryan and I are domestic partners
really GLE domestic partner we went to
the courthouse we are legal domestic
partners we did this because number one
since we live so far away from family if
something were to happen to either one
of us and we were in the hospital we
could make decisions for each other
because legally we're considered family
from being domestic partners the other
reason is because I'm at with my own
business and that makes insurance health
insurance very very expensive actually
work for a huge company that has health
benefits and your legal domestic partner
can get access to the benefits as well
for incredibly cheap and I get insurance
for like 120 a month versus if he were
by himself he'd be paying like what five
hundred dollars I hire dollars so
swollen all that work only makes sense
was it hard moving in together how do
you deal with arguments is one of you
quiet and the other one likes to talk it
out if so how does that work
moving in together wasn't hard at all we
honestly were like inseparable from the
time that we like first started dating
so he moved in pretty quickly and it
just felt normal I think there is not a
specific date like I don't think you
should wait a certain amount of time I
think it's just all about how you're
feeling like if you feel like you're
ready then just go for it deal with
arguments for the most part like to talk
it out we might just kind of step right
in the apartment for a little bit and
cool down
we have an argument then we always end
up coming back together after a few
minutes to just really like squash it
talk it out also it helps is changing
the atmosphere of the situation so
joking around alright it's getting a
little dark so we're gonna wrap it up
for tonight goodbye for now alright guys
let's finish up this Q&amp;amp;A I just rode my
bike through a terrible rainstorm so I'm
really trying to have a good attitude
right now what hour the most challenging
thing that we've had to deal with while
living together is in the beginning when
you don't know someone else's habits
yeah I think it's always the first few
months or like always the most awkward
because you're really trying to like
know each other's habits and fix things
and adjust the thing so I think that's
probably like just in general the most
like awkward part of living together
it's rent expensive in NYC and how do
you manage to do so much in so little
time
yes print is pretty expensive in NYC
compared to most places New York is the
second most expensive city to live in is
it really yes in the US and the world
and the reason being is because it's
such a small island and there's so many
people here I think there's like eight
or nine million people that are here so
space this tiny little island space is a
premium so that's why they can charge
more
the second how do you manage to do so
much in so little time well I just spend
all of my time you know I was working
towards this goal of being able to do
this full-time and I spent all of my
time on it and I worked really hard so
now that I have achieved this goal and I
am leaving my job and doing YouTube
full-time it's just going to be about
managing managing my time properly it is
it's impressive to be able to put up
three videos a week consistently for 3-4
months straight full time job do you
have any siblings question number one
yes I do I have two twin sisters that
are 12 and I have a 23 and 23 year old
brother
shut up hello camera : Oh
I'm staying in NYC long term we only
just discussed that far in the future
we're here for now and the Sunbeam yeah
if you love it okay let's do one last
question it's starting to get dark
because of the storm it's raining so
hard as your typical free day look like
and more what I eat in a day videos it
will definitely do more what I eat in a
day that was so much fun the whole free
day would be probably us just like going
to the park hanging out going to a
coffee shop I'm sitting you're acting
like it's not 40 degrees outside
um emails in the morning make sure
there's nothing that needs to be
immediately responded to and then just
like relaxing all day hang in our
comforters like sweatpants comfy clothes
watching Netflix watching movies hanging
out um maybe talking a little bit about
like content for the YouTube channel
stuff like that wake up coffee Jim relax
content emails he/she makes purpos'd and
shows shows TV always TV and a movie
ever known yeah what's a good movie to
see yeah let us know what is the
recommendation what's in theaters
recently tell us what should we go see I
kind of got stuck with crappy weather
both days that I was filming and it's so
dark in here right now so I definitely
want to finish this QA about so many
more questions so many good questions so
we'll finish this in next week's vlog
it'll be Q&amp;amp;A part to be mostly focused
on fashion industry questions all of
that I'm saving those for next Wednesday

it easier because next week is Q&amp;amp;A
