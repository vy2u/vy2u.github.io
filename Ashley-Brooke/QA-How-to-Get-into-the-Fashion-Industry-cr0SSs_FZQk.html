Q&amp;amp;A that I started last week so today's
topic for the QA is fashion related
fashion industry related um kind of a
broad fashion type video a lot of you
guys are asking kind of the same
question about how I got started in the
fashion industry and what steps I took
to get where I was said of answering
each question I'm going to just kind of
tell my story and how I got to where I
was first I will go ahead and answer
some of the other questions that I
received and then we'll go ahead and get
into the whole my thought my stomachs
growling can you hear that first
question is my all-time favorite perfume
and I went got it for you guys so I
could show you my Balenciaga perfume is
bogus oh yes I all-time favorite perfume
I do have perfumes that I used for
different seasons but this is my
all-time all year round favorite perfume
I think it's like daytime nighttime this
is my scent that I have every single day
and two squirts away from being out so
don't worry I've got a backup in my
nightstand ready to get it out at any
time
love this love this in fact unknown what
does that mean what would I call my
fashion style really wouldn't call my
style anything sometimes I'm feeling
girly sometimes edgy you know more
trendy basic so I just kind of wake up
and put on whatever I'm in the mood for
I don't really have a certain type of
style I don't know maybe you guys seeing
my style could name my style better than
I could because you're kind of on the
outside looking in China there's your
favorite winter piece actual favorite
winter piece is like a puffy coat
because it's so cold here low-key that's
my favorite winter piece honestly think
um a pretty coat stores like Zara and
places like that are starting to make
really good winter coats I saw one at
forever 21 the other day it was gray and
it had a faux fur collar and it was so
beautiful I would say a really pretty
winter coat is
good staple for the wintertime next
question what makes you so passionate
about fashion and how often do you shop
and keep up with the trends what makes
me passionate about fashion I think is
you know for the longest time I couldn't
have cared less about fashion I was such
a tomboy growing up I think because on
my street there were all boys so I was
into like building ramps for my bike and
you know packing a backpack and going to
find bugs and stuff like that I didn't
really get passionate about it until I
was in college do college I started
getting to where I would just find these
cool interesting pieces things that I
could even afford I would sometimes go
into Saks and just wander around you
know not being able to even afford a
stick of perfume but you know just being
so intrigued by everything it's find
it's so intriguing that people can
express themselves through what they
wear and what they put together I think
it's just so cool how 10 different
people can take one item of clothing and
style it you know to who they are how
often do you shop and keep up with the
trends I don't go and shop purposely
like I don't walk out of the door saying
I'm going shopping unless I'm doing a
how-to style and I need an accessory or
something like that in New York City and
walking around all the time I pass so
many stores that I just kind of wander
into but for the most part I don't
really say ok tomorrow I'm going
shopping she leads into the question
that I get asked a lot is where do I get
my inspiration from if I'm interested in
buying like a black vest or you know a
fun sweater I'll kind of scroll through
Pinterest to see how other people are
styling it and if it's even worth
investing in inspiration for me is also
looking in my own closets I have a top
or something that I'm like okay what am
I going to wear this with I'll put it on
my bed and lay out all my bottoms and
just really kind of play with it and see
how can we style this how can we make
this look unique the inspiration in your
own closet you'd be surprised how many
cool outfits you can actually find in
there next question how do you always
stay so positive I guess I didn't
realize I was always so positive and I
thank you that's so nice I know being
positive just makes me happier if
something negative happens in my life
why would I sit there and be sad or
negative about it that does nobody any
good and it just keeps you dwelling on
things you have to just make it a habit
in your life you have to just sit there
and think why am I being negative it's
not getting me anywhere you have to snap
out of that anyone I've ever known that
has had great success in their business
or just in their life is never a
negative person yeah of course there are
times in your mind you're displa a few
world you have to get over that you have
a pity party for five minutes and then
just get over it like why are you
welling on things don't do that and
positive is a much more happier life
much more happier much more happier I
don't know that's right hmm you know
what I mean though my stomach is
growling so loud Laura says that
everything in her closet looks the same
and she doesn't know how to put some of
the pieces together so what inspires me
to change up my wardrobe you notice the
day I'm not wearing black I'm wearing a
pink sweater the times when I'm shopping
I will see something I like but it's
something that I am like mmm like I
don't know about it sometimes I just
step out of the box and buy something
that's completely out of my comfort zone
and then add pieces that are in my
comfort zone and make it an outfit try
when it comes to styling not to not have
a comfort zone because I feel like
that's when most of my outfits kind of
come into play is when my comfort zone
is just like out the door every time I
would go into a store make it a point to
buy something with print or with color
and then mix it with my black white and
grays and then you slowly kind of build
up to a wardrobe where you can really
play with things it doesn't happen
overnight
unfortunately next question why are you
singing oh my gosh no what can I be more
fashionable in my job as a lawyer I feel
that there are limitations um rather
than having like a creative job no you
when you're in when you're practicing
laws and you know professions like that
you do need to dress a little bit more
on the conservative side so maybe I
really cute stylish printed top
underneath your your trousers and your
blazer maybe something with a bow or
it's high a print something just to kind
of give it a little bit of a flare it
still look sophisticated but you also
have print and a little bit of
embellishment you know something and
maybe try not to mix the two together
maybe if you're doing a printed shirt
don't do an embellished type blazer just
kind of stick with one one item on your
body to have something fun to it how I
deal with negative comments regarding my
weight you don't really care people
thank but it gets a little annoying to
hear it yeah I can totally relate to
that I've always been so thin all my
siblings are very thin frustrating
whenever I post a video and someone says
she's anorexic why would you say that
like why would why would you type that
out and hit enter like some people blow
my mind I've learned for the negative
comments on YouTube for the most part to
just brush them off my shoulders because
there are so many positive people on my
channel for the most part my subscribers
are amazing and so positive and lift
each other up so when that one asshole
comes along and you know wants to just
be an asshole I just let it roll off my
shoulder that's how I deal with it I
just don't it goes in one ear and out
the other because what are you gonna do
about it you know what was your first
job ever in the fashion industry I was a
sales associate of Juicy Couture yep
damn those track suits I just remember
the Juicy Couture track suits
well you ever get the legging but it
absolutely nothing worse than an itchy
butt when you're wearing leggings and
you're in public
what is something you've done that
you've never do again oh my gosh
definitely the wave pole at UM like Six
Flags have you guys ever been in those
things I thought I was going to lose my
life that day no joke
my family was like it's so fun you get
into the pool and the waves start coming
I almost drowned you guys I thought I
was gonna die there is no way you can
ever ever get me back into a wave pole
for the rest of my life no you have any
pet peeves when someone stands too close
to me in line behind me like no do not
stand like there should be this much
space between us and line if I
kill your breathing or if I can hear you
breathing you're too close when you're
practically standing beside me you're
too close and here are you chewing your
gum you're too close have you ever been
super broke what did you do or what was
the lowest point of your life and how
did you overcome it yes I was a college
student and I was super broke I remember
I had my dad gave me a credit card and
oh boy did I you know not use that for
emergencies I'm like shoes are an
emergency okay all through college and
then even right out of college you know
I was just starting in like retail and
like I didn't have any money and any
money I did have I I spent it all
lowest point in my life was probably oh
my gosh there was one point where I was
living when I was living in San Antonio
Brian and I you know we're living
together and I just like hated my job I
didn't know what I wanted to do with my
life I was just at a point where I was
like like what the hell am I gonna do is
just I was stuck I was in a place where
I was hitting myself instead of doing
something about it
i sat there and I would cry and I would
bitch to Ryan and I was just a miserable
human being there finally a time came in
my head and it clicked and I was like I
need a change I need to make a huge
change in my life and I don't mean a
small change I need to change my
attitude I need to change my career I
need to change my location I needed a
whole life change just the door my pity
party we moved to New York and started a
whole new life and Here I am now and
thank you for that question that was a
really good deep personal question which
I don't mind answering because I'm sure
there's someone out there right now that
was me at that point a few years ago so
do something about it you'll thank
yourself later trust me you had to
choose between SmartWater being taken
away forever or coconut milk which would
you live without Oh
thinking about that
me anxiety what is your favorite type of
food and favorite date night place to go
to I don't know I I love all food
equally as much as the other my favorite
date night place to go to oh my gosh
there are the cutest little restaurants
in West Village then it's called Bell
book and candle underground it's like
dark the music's good it's like really
romantic and cozy if I want something a
little bit louder and whatnot then we
usually go to fig and olives in
Meatpacking love the ambience there it's
dark it's also romantic but it's a
little bit bigger more people either or
I just love food what can you do to show
your employer's that you're cut out for
the fashion industry while you're not
studying fashion I think the best thing
you can do is have like a killer outfit
and you go into an interview no matter
what your resume says on paper like
dress yourself to the tee then that is
so important not as typical like you
know wear a suit type interview you know
you need to put a little bit of style
into your interview outfit showing them
that you have that is really step number
one in impressing an employer when
you're going into an interview this is
where I will do the second part of the
Q&amp;amp;A just kind of going over how I got
into the fashion industry and I went to
college I still had no clue what I
wanted to do didn't care even through my
first couple of years in college I was
majoring in kinesiology which is the
study of health and fitness and I wanted
to be a physical therapist I didn't have
any girlfriends in my classes because
the girls basically I just couldn't
relate to them always would make fun of
me for you know wearing different
clothes like I would come to school kind
of dressed you know not in like workout
gear I'm I would wear like a cute top in
a cute pair of jeans and I don't know I
just I just that's just what I wore so I
just couldn't relate to them and
obviously they couldn't relate to me I
realized my senior year in college I
don't want to be a physical therapist
like nothing bores me more than then
that as a career path that's just what I
thought I wanted to do that just that's
what seemed
right I feel like I was taking the right
steps but I wanted a career in fashion
and I didn't know how I what I wanted to
do or how I was going to get there
graduated college worked at a boutique
kind of doing really just a little bit
of everything you know from visual
merchandising to kind of like operations
and I just wasn't making any money I
wasn't happy that was the time you know
where I was at like a low point not
knowing what I wanted to do and knowing
that I wanted to work in fashion but not
knowing exactly what I wanted to do I
could tell that I wasn't in a good place
so he mmm that's good life we like this
we decided we were going to move back to
New York wanted to work in fashion still
like wanted to be in visual
merchandising not sure how to do it it
was applying to every position I could
find online
I applied probably over a hundred jobs
and never got one call back I started
finding jobs that I really wanted on
LinkedIn and instead of applying through
the website I just found did some major
stalking found the HR people from the
companies I wanted to work for a company
like intermix because they carry so many
great designers so I found a bunch of
people in HR work for intermix on
LinkedIn and just directly message them
and immediately our response responses
back and immediately got an interview
and then immediately got hired the
process is almost like a shortcut
instead of applying on their website I
just went straight to the source and was
like hey I'm interested in working for
this company here's my resume let's set
up a time to talk they don't respond
then I just stopped them until they
respond to me eventually someone reached
back out to me and they were like thank
you so much for sending me a message
directly was in the final stages of
interviewing when I moved to New York so
that was kind of risky not having a job
when I moved but then I ended up getting
hired like a week later just because the
interview process is so bomb works for
intermix for a while doing visual
merchandising absolutely loved it but
for you guys who are wanting to go into
visual merchandising just know that it
is not like a glamorous job at all
you're in uncomfortable clothes you're
usually like there at 7:00 a.m. early
mornings sometimes till 10 o'clock at
night late
nice it's a fun creative job but it's
also very like labor-intensive don't
necessarily have to have a fashion
degree to get into fashion to get into
the fashion industry it looks great on a
resume but it's not necessary at all I
have no degree in fashion whatsoever but
I had experience on my resume so that
helped me out I started to started my
youtube channel
while I was at intermix and you know the
hours were just kind of crazy so I was
like I need something Monday through
Friday 9:00 to 5:00 so I can still on
the weekends with Ryan that's when I
started working for Allison Libya which
was actually like not even maybe two
months ago I was the corporate store
operations manager as scheduled was
getting a little insane so that's when I
decided to make the move of putting my
job and doing YouTube full-time I love
answering these fashion industry
questions because I truly believe that
you know you can have what you go after
and what you work hard for but you do
have to start at the bottom I think so
many people think that they can just
jump into a high-paying high-fashion job
but you know you really need to start
out as doing retail or an internship I
think those two paths you know that's
where you need to start internship
working retail and just kind of work
your way up pay is terrible starting out
you know you have to do like pitch work
but it pays off if you can truly like
tough it out do some online digging of
what you think you know you would fit
best into there's buying planning visual
merchandising PR HR like there's just
you know there's design there's gosh
like so many different areas that you
can go into it kind of aside from
everything some tips for getting into
the fashion industry dress the part you
know even if you're on a budget there is
stores like forever 21 and H and I as
the college student had no money so I
went to forever 21 got an outfit for
under $50 and I ran that outfit
six or seven interviews like no shame in
that like do what you got to do a killer
outfit number two take chances reach out
to people don't just sit there and apply
and apply online and think that things
were going to be handed to you they're
not
you need to gallon LinkedIn and you need
to send everyone you can a message find
store managers of places that you want
to work for by an HR find recruiters
like you just constantly send people
messages on LinkedIn until you get an
interview until you get what you want
alright so that is it and if you guys
want to sign up for my life by her
lookbook which you definitely should
again it's a month's worth of outfit
inspiration photos video we have a
private Facebook group so come join us
but um you can't get into the Facebook
group unless you have the lookbook so if
you don't have the lookbook and you're
trying to get into the Facebook group
that's why so those two things kind of
tie in hand-in-hand well that is it for
this fashion edition qat this was fun I
really like shared sincere with you guys
like hope you loved it and yeah I'll see
you guys in my next video bye hi guys
this is Taylor ah Taylor is probably one
of the best friends that I've ever had
in my whole life she's such an amazing
person and she's here to stay with us by
the weekend we have such a crazy night
last night I stayed in and had wine and
sandwiches
petrol pump and Girl Talk that
retirement home life for Ryan I know
