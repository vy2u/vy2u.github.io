those of you who don't know me my name
is Ashley and I've had my youtube
channel for two years now and it's
predominantly fashion some Q&amp;amp;A is live
style vlogs but mostly fashion a lot of
you guys have been coming to me about
doing this Q&amp;amp;A so if you are a blogger
or if you were a youtuber and you're
trying to grow your channel you're
trying to see what you're doing wrong or
right you've come to the right place
you're already you're already a step
ahead of everybody else because you're
doing your research and your homework on
how to be better did a quick Instagram
Q&amp;amp;A and I have so many good questions
mostly I got questions about my
background so I'll go ahead and give you
guys that before we get started and that
can probably help help answer a few of
those questions for you so before I
started my youtube channel I worked in
the corporate fashion industry at doing
a visual merchandising then about two
years ago I put up a YouTube video it
was a random hair tutorial I never even
watched YouTube myself I just it was
spur-of-the-moment random crazy thing I
did just kind of went from there I
started getting serious about it once my
views just started getting bigger and
bigger I was like okay this this could
be something kind of cool
so I started consistently doing videos
three times a week no matter what look
six six or eight months I don't think I
missed a day I did three videos a week
while working a full-time job
and about almost a little over a year
ago I quit my job because they had to
choose it was just getting too demanding
on both sides so I had to choose so I
chose this I chose to do this full-time
dump the gut on everything and it just
my creative mind leads with everything
so this is the perfect setting for me I
love doing this and I could not be
happier with the decision that I made I
have my blog which is sty logics and
that's just kind of where I post my
personal outfit photos that we do shoots
whenever we film for YouTube so I post
all of those photos there I have my
YouTube channel and then I have life by
her which is a side business that
created to be a community of women who
empower each other and who support each
other so my team and I create a monthly
lookbook and it's kind of like a
magazine basically it's got fashion
interior beauty health etc everything
you would see in a magazine and it goes
out once a month and we have a Facebook
group that comes along with that so and
it's just kind of growing and expanding
from there I mean we're talking about
clothing lines skin care so you know
having a brand like this is really kind
of setting you up for really big things
that is what I have going on right now
and that is kind of what I've created
for myself and it's kind of developed in
the past year question number one since
you are self-employed what does your
daily work schedule look like and what
do your interns do my work schedule is
different every single day but for the
most part I do have like a routine down
in the morning I'll wake up I'll go to
the gym get my coffee check emails check
my calendar what I have for the day and
then I do my daily routine I mean my my
daily schedule and that's either
consisting of filming working on the
life by hair lookbook having design
meetings for t-shirts and clothing we
have weekly team meetings just to kind
of go over the lookbook and what our
subscribers are wanting to see we have
content meetings where I plan out my
content in advance so that's kind of
what my week looks like my interns I do
not have an intern I have a Jenna at one
Jenna and she is my editorial assistant
for the life by her lookbook and she
only comes here two days a week she's
working all the time I can't like I need
so many more Gemma than my life
she's here two days a week and we work
on the lookbook when she's here as a
youtuber as a fashion youtuber how do
you afford to bring in so many new items
for your videos our sponsors our store
sponsorships involved at fall that's a
good question
whenever I first started I could not
afford to show new items all the time I
just couldn't I I've never gotten help
from my my parents to pay my rent or my
bills I've always taken care of myself
and I wouldn't have it any other
ever I feel like it kind of makes you
who you are and makes you a hard worker
but I couldn't afford that I can just
imagine asking my dad for money for
clothes he would hang up on me go to
Zara and H&amp;amp;M and just kind of pick one
statement piece and you know fingers
crossed I had enough money in my account
for it and I would get it it's really
responsible right and I would just take
clothes that were already in my closet
and style around it you know it doesn't
matter if you can or can't afford so
many new items a month you know show
what you have be creative you know I
feel like that almost produces better
content when you use your brain and
you're creative about just styling one
one piece or featuring items over and
over yes store sponsorships are involved
and I work with River Island all the
time and it's a great relationship they
have amazing clothes at an affordable
price it's available almost worldwide
and we have a really great relationship
and as well as a few other brands you
talk about your YouTube camera gear and
why you picked these cameras so I have
the for blocking I have this sony a 5100
and I use I'm trying to get the lens
right now cuz I'm on it right now
what is this lens I just Brian because
he's in charge of all the camera gear
today
the sony 10 to 18 lens and that's for a
wide-angle so when you're blogging
you're getting like a good picture of
your surroundings and it's not just like
your face
hold in here for doing YouTube videos
you have the sony a6300 for video we
have the 50 millimeter 1.8 and lens
which is great both Sony's come with
great kit lenses we have the 85
millimeter 1.4 G master that sounds
really fancy expensive well any
recommendations on how to start a
fashion YouTube channel um I think my
first piece of advice is to start it
come up with good content film something
that you love and put it out there I
know that's like the scariest part if
you want to be if you want to have a
youtube channel you have to put it out
there you you just have to do it so that
is that step number one and then I think
everything else kind of falls into place
you'll kind of get a feel if you like it
or not often do you work with companies
and what do you look for when sorting
through potential brands for
sponsorships and collaborations oh I
only I only collaborate with brands that
I love and that I would spend my own
money on like there have been brands
that have reached out to me and they're
like oh here we'll offer you this much
for promoting our product and I'm like
yeah that's a really cool product but I
don't know that I would spend my money
on it so I wouldn't expect you guys to
spend your money on it you know when you
are getting deals when you are getting
emails of collaborations just be really
mindful you don't want to lose your
trust and your subscribers over a big
paycheck for example I just turned down
a really big collaboration with a makeup
brand who is not cruelty free because I
literally just hold told you guys I
literally just told my subscribers that
I'm trying to transition away from
buying cruelty free makeup so what does
that say about me if I'm like the face
of this this brand they just choose
products that you would spend your own
money on and that you believe in because
people will see right through you and
see if you're a phony and if you're
raving about this product oh it's my
favorite but then you
you was use it again people aren't
stupid people know and it's embarrassing
to be honest so just be really mindful
when choosing brands to collaborate with
it's curious as to how you come up with
ideas for original content there are so
many fashion focus pages these days I
feel like it'd be impossible to have
ideas that aren't so mainstream so
nothing is original someone got
inspiration from somewhere to create
this item like if you type in how to
style I just did how to style plaid for
fall there's probably a hundred other
video as a platform fall peripheral
which is totally fine but what makes it
creative and what makes it unique is
your style you not everyone puts
together your outfit there could be a
hundred how to style plaids but is there
any of them like yours like the outfits
you're putting together so don't be
afraid I mean be original obviously
don't blatantly copy somebody's ideas
and outfits but you know take
inspiration from something and put your
own creative twist on it and then people
really appreciate that
what is something most people don't know
about the way YouTube and or blogging
works this is a good question I think a
lot of people don't know the back end of
a sponsored video I think that that is
something that is just not thought about
which why would you think about it but
for example I you know you whenever I
collaborate with with another brand I
have to sign like a 10 page contract
which is why I have an agent she looks
over that they have lawyers on their on
their on their side when you're when
you're signing contracts like this you
know you need you can't just sign it
like you don't know what you're signing
and this is something that I was kind of
surprised to see when I first started
collaborating with brands is like you
create this video and they get two to
three rounds of edits so you might have
to create this video two weeks in
advance and then they're like nope
change that note we didn't like the way
you said that so by the time it's done
you're just like oh my gosh oh my gosh a
lot goes into the backend of sponsored
videos they don't just send you the
product and they're like here we trust
you just show it show the world some
brands will tell you give you basically
a script
we'll say word for word you need to say
this and that's of course when I'm like
no I'm not doing that appearance is also
when I'm wearing sweat pants right now
I'm wearing like a nice top and jewelry
but I'm also wearing sweat pants on the
bottom because I'm sitting here when
people are here and talking at the
camera and they look nicer either not
wearing pants or they're wearing sweat
pants I promise you what was your
corporate job before this I worked for
intermix where I did visual
merchandising and then I worked for
Allison Olivia where I did operations
the editing in your videos are always so
good thank you how did you learn to edit
so well um I just taught myself if if
ever I need to hire somebody to do
something or I always teach myself if I
can't figure something out I always
teach myself first I go to Ryan because
I feel like Ryan knows everything about
everything but I always try to do
research myself and just to get it done
I feel like that's the easiest way
but now editing I can do with my eyes
closed to me it's so easy at this point
but when I first opened Final Cut Pro I
was like oh how did your lips look
before lip injections and what made you
want to get them excuse me that is not
the topic today but I'll show you
anyways hi ash I recently decided to
start writing a blog and I was wondering
for someone just starting out to be
successful at this and hopefully make a
living from it but you can't start a
blog already wanting to make a living
out of it have to think like what value
what value are you giving what are you
providing that so good that someone's
gonna want to pay you to do you just you
have to take it one day at a time and
you have to be consistent and you have
to put out content that that are that's
providing people what they want what
they need what are you doing to help
somebody so I think start there start
start it and enjoy it and provide good
content and the rest will come I have to
do it for a long time I mean you need
you need to expect one to two years of
consistent content in order and I'm not
I mean maybe I don't know maybe your
content so great you might like take off
in three months but for the most part
one to two years what are your favorite
videos to film
I like filming my seven outfit series
because I get to pick out seven outfits
and I love picking out outfits and I
like putting things together so probably
that one I have started my youtube
channel but whenever I find someone who
has my same same sense of humor or like
similar film style but they're way more
known I get unmotivated and don't want
to seem as if I'm copying them and get
trolled on Twitter okay I don't know why
you think this is a bad thing um so
there's someone who's has so many
subscribers so many followers and may
have your same style in your same
personality in your same sense of humor
that's great news for you because that
means that there is a market for you out
there because this person's made it so
why can't you um I don't don't don't be
sad about that be actually very happy
people you say troll I don't use that
word troll because I don't even know
what that means it doesn't make sense to
me but if someone's trolling you on
Twitter you're always gonna have a troll
always like there are so many trolls
someone thinks you're copying someone
else who cares but if you are then don't
do that but if someone thinks you are
and you're not and you know you're not
you know deep down you're not and don't
worry about it people are gonna say what
they want think what they want don't
worry about it keep doing you you're the
one putting yourself out there you're
the one creating content just keep doing
it how long does it take you to edit a
video in what program do you use I use
Final Cut Pro I know there are other
good ones out there but I just kind of
got the hang of that one quickly so I'm
using that sometimes it takes me in
three hours to edit a vlog and then
sometimes it takes me like six hours to
edit like a whole series like a lookbook
and that's from like start to finish
that's from like this is right just turn
the brightness down a little bit um
sometimes it takes me six hours and
that's including like the thumbnail
finding shopping links for you guys and
all of that so it just just depends on
the video do you ever feel like you have
to look a certain way to be successful
as a blogger you can obviously wear
anything you want and it looks good but
any tips to feel confident with your own
body and actually not be that what is
she summed it up what I mean is if you
have any tips to not get pressured
the fashioned skinny this is a top body
image is such a huge issue that I don't
want to get so deep down into but all I
can say is that there are bloggers and
models of all shapes and sizes out there
you know five years ago
there's photoshopping there's retouching
there's anything to make skinny people
already look skinny and I know this is
so you guys are probably like shut up
coming from a very thin person but you
know don't feel like you need to look a
certain way there buddy like I don't
have a normal body type I'm abnormally
skinny and abnormally small and I know
that there are models and bloggers from
all all shapes and sizes colors races
you name it so don't please don't feel
like you have to look a certain way and
don't feel the pressure to if you're
worried about this start a movement if
the more self-confident you are with
your body the more it spreads
self-confidence spreads like wildfire so
if if you're certain size and you're
uncomfortable about it and you're so
confident and you're you know you know
you look good and you know you put
together an awesome outfit and you're
rocking it other people will see that
and be like oh yeah she looks so happy
she's so self-confident I want to be
like that so create you create your own
space create a positive role model out
of yourself for people to look up to is
there anything you miss about having a
corporate job yeah I miss talking to
like my friends every day I don't know
whenever you're in a job and you're
working with really cool girls and it's
just kind of fun to like go to work and
talk and then go out for drinks
afterwards and I missed that interaction
cuz right now it's just Ryan and I and I
have to interact with him all day and
that's okay but I'm just it was nice to
have that interaction and my girl time
but obviously that's not what work is
about but I think that's probably the
one thing that I do is you guys film
lookbook stays home everything in the
same day do you run errands and film in
between so yeah most of the time
we're filming them all on Saturdays so
we're usually working on a Saturday
filming and I'm usually editing all day
on Sunday until the video goes live but
we've started doing it to where we like
film one outfit a day for like four days
and that's I don't know you just kind of
have to find your balance
and like what works best for your time
schedule that week do you make a media
kit and do you send it to brands when
they contact you for partnerships I
everything goes through my agent
Caroline she has my media kit that she
gives to brands but before I had an
agent I did make my own media kit I'm
it's just good to give you know if
someone just wants to inquire but
they're not sure if they want to move
forward at least they know kind of like
what they're working with so it doesn't
hurt to make one and it looks
professional as long as you make it look
nice
it doesn't hurt anything the Ryan have a
desire to start his own YouTube channel
no do you know not right now he says how
far in advance do you plan your creative
content so I'm the first week of each
month I will sit down with my calendar
and plug everything in for the whole
entire month now things change you know
like say I'm wanting to style like denim
jackets but I found like two really cute
pairs of trousers and I'll be like okay
maybe I should do the trousers instead
of the denim jacket but my content
schedule is always the same so it's
always fashion video on Sunday vlog on
Wednesday like random video on Friday
always my question is how are you able
to figure out a way to make your stand
out opposed to other bloggers with your
lookbook Facebook group style etc I'm
not really sure how how it how my style
differentiates me from the rest of the
blogger community so as for style
everyone has their own personal style
you know if you put all the clothes in
the world out there and not one person
is gonna pick the exact same outfit I
think it's just really about knowing
your style and knowing who is watching
you in catering
to those people when it comes to your
your blogging or your youtubing you know
I took the idea of how to style you know
I'm not the first person to create a how
to start a lookbook on YouTube but I
created it in a way I took cinematic
shots I created like this really cool
slow motion with the music and I really
wanted it to take you to another place
and for you to like feel something I
know that sounds super cheesy but that's
kind of what I was going for and you
know you just have to come up with your
own original ideas for example come up
with a series you know that someone else
might already do but make it your own
put your own creative spin on it have
you thought about starting your own
clothing line yes I have that it's
coming it's coming what helps you the
most when you have a challenging or
frustrating moment or days in business I
think whenever I have frustrating or
challenging days I really try to step
away from work because obviously that
frustration is coming from somewhere
else maybe you're overworking yourself
maybe you're just not on the right
mindset at the moment so I think it's
really about clearing your mind so I
step away from from what I'm doing for a
little bit figure out what my
frustration is why I'm frustrated and
then I do something that I enjoy even if
it's just taking Stella outside for five
minutes or running running outside to
get a coffee getting fresh air and
usually by the time I come back I've
mentally kind of pinpointed what what
the deal was and how can we how can I
work through this with myself what do
you love most about being a youtuber or
influencer youtuber slash influencer um
I'm not I'm really not crazy about the
word influencer I think it's kind of
taking on a new meaning
I love the true definition of
influencers I want to be a good role
model and I want to influence people to
whether it be like a skincare product
that that I
found that is just great or if it's you
know a new app that I think is so cool
that would save you money so I want to
influence people in the right direction
so that's probably my favorite thing
about it is is that I get to control
what I influence and what I don't having
two younger sisters I so much about
young people especially young young
girls growing up in this crazy world of
Technology in social media and I really
want to spread the message that you know
everyone puts their best self on
Instagram and social media everyone has
problems so and everyone is dealing with
those problems behind closed doors no
one should ever want something that
somebody else has or want a life that
somebody else has because they think
it's perfect so my favorite thing about
being an influencer or a youtuber is
spreading that message to young girls
because I just I want to hug all young
girls and just let them know that that
it's not always what it seems to be on
the Internet how do you organize your
social media do you have a specific
posting schedule or do you just post
when you feel like it
I didn't sue here I might just post it I
feel like it but YouTube I have a
schedule down but I think I just shared
with you guys well ago Sunday Wednesday
Friday same same set type style the
videos on those days how do you decide
what to film and what is too personal do
you ever have meltdowns or emotional
days or those parts of things that you
choose not to film I do not have
meltdowns and I have days where I'm very
busy and it's like I've got so much to
do but I don't know that I've ever had
like a meltdown I'm I'm not I don't know
if this is like to a fault
I'm just not an emotional person I've
never have been I do have days that I
don't want to film obviously there are
days where I'm just you know not feeling
like like I have days where I'm
literally just sitting here at my
computer all day and no one wants to see
that so I do choose not to film those
days or you know if I'm going through
something
personal life either with family or
something obviously I don't fill in
those days but there are things that are
personal in my life that I don't film
and that kind of takes me back to the
social media thing not everything you
see online not everyone is perfect
people show what they want to show
including me I mean including everyone
but to answer your question if you're
questioning filming something because it
might be too personal film it and then
while you're editing I mean just take it
out you don't have to put everything in
if you're watching it you're like oh I
really don't really want to show that
side show that story just take it out so
many people think bloggers and youtubers
have such an easy job what is the
hardest part about your job don't find
what I do hard because I love doing it
genuinely love doing it so I don't I
don't think a second of my life is work
because I enjoy what I do if you love
what you do you don't work a day in your
life I love that quote because it's true
the hardest part I think is consistency
because when you are in this position
you are your own boss and you are the
creator of your own brand in your own
YouTube channel and your content so you
know you could if you wanted to just
sleep in until 12:00 p.m. every single
day of the week and take a week off but
that's not a good idea
you do have that option so I think the
hardest part is getting in that routine
of being consistent and not lose
yourself you know when you're getting a
ton of subscribers and and you're
comfortable and right now I could if I
wanted to not post anything for two full
weeks that's a terrible idea I would
never do that you you just have to be
true to your channel be true to your
subscribers and stay consistent and
delegating all the hours in the day um
you know don't I I could easily right
now just stop filming say oh you know
what screw this video I would rather be
shopping but you can't do that you know
you you have to value each hour in the
day and get as much done as you can
never I also never feel like
it's enough like I wish there were more
hours in the day because at the end of
the day I still have things on my to-do
list that I haven't gotten done so it's
like you I am always so hard on myself I
never know when to stop and sometimes
it's easy to overwork because there's
some just never a stopping point I feel
like when I'm lounging and not doing
anything that I'm wasting time and that
I'm being lazy almost so you know with
my old job I would go into work at 8
o'clock I would come home at 5:00 and I
just have the evening to myself to do
whatever I wanted and I felt no guilt
but now it's like if I'm doing something
besides working I'm like okay what are
you doing besides consistency what is
the best way to build a following good
content you have it right number one is
consistency but good content why are
people following you you know you can't
just expect all these people to start
following you for no reason you have to
put good content out there original
content creative content be original be
genuine belong with the consistency that
is like the recipe for you know being
able to turn your dream hobby into a
dream job if you're consistent and have
good content that people enjoy reading
and you're giving them great advice for
one to two years and you're good how do
you maintain your friendships while
working so much and spending time with
Ryan well Ryan and I spend time together
throughout the day because we don't have
a choice we're both here all day so
that's really not an issue but my
friends most of my friends do not live
here in the city mmm they are live in LA
they live in Texas so I really don't
worry about that they'll come and visit
me for you know we get a time or I'll go
visit them so then there's really no
working involved why do you love your
job and what makes it so special and how
does it compare to your regular
nine-to-five job um I loved my
nine-to-five job like I said earlier I
loved working in the fashion industry
but what I love most about what I do now
is that I'm able to be creative and
kind of set my own standard still let
before when I was in my nine-to-five job
like if I had an idea that I thought
would be great for the brand no one
would hear my idea and no one would care
so now that I'm kind of in control of
myself and what I create then I am I'm
free to be as creative as I want and to
execute all of my ideas and all my plans
how do you begin getting paid for
posting and how do you navigate the
beginning of monetizing your blog or
Instagram you begin getting paid when
you have an audience and you get an
audience by being consistent and
creating good content audience is
everything like if you think about a TV
show you watch your favorite TV show and
it's great your favorite TV show gets
canceled why did it get canceled
probably because not enough people were
watching that TV show so you have to
continue to build your audience in order
to get paid from brands I think a lot of
people don't dissect why are brands
paying me they're just so focused on
when am I gonna start getting paid well
what do you think you deserve to get
paid you know you you have to give them
something in return that you're not just
gonna give you money and product for
nothing
you have to have an audience you have to
put their product in front of your
audience and the bigger your audience
the more you're gonna get paid started a
blog and now I'm scared to show anyone
it's more of a lookbook for my mom and I
to look at my outfit how did you gain
the confidence to begin YouTube and
block out any hate only no way to tiptoe
around this when you're starting a blog
or YouTube channel you have to have some
sort of fearlessness in you and have a
confidence and you know it gets better
with time you know you get a little bit
more and more fearless I'm gonna be
totally honest I was kind of scared to
post my first video I didn't want to so
I get where you're coming from if you
are wanting to start it you just have to
hit the public button public just make
it public just do it the first time
scary and it's better after that and if
you really are just too scared then
maybe you just keep it a personal blog
for you and your mom to look at I hope
you gain that confidence and you gain
that fearlessness too
make your blog public and as for
blocking out hate what exactly what does
hate mean to you it's it's it's just
words that somebody writes on the
Internet you don't know this person they
don't know you why is this meaning
something to you why is this hateful
comment needing something to you
honestly I almost just feel bad for
these silly people who take the time out
of their day to go and write something
about me whether it be like terrible or
a little bit terrible I don't know hey
this almost just kind of a form of
flattery there are some ones taking the
time out to think about you and to write
about you and you just kind of have to
be numb to it you have to have thick
skin and I'm gonna I'm being completely
honest you know if you are wanting to
put yourself out there you need to
expect it my first hate comment when I
was like two months in and I'm gonna I'm
not gonna like it I was like excuse me I
don't even you don't even know me I
don't even know you you weirdo it's
literally something that I looked at now
and I don't even think twice about it
because it's I'm numb to it and you will
get that way eventually but you do have
to get past those first little few humps
of nicob negativity but let it get to
you don't let something as small as some
small little person who obviously
something internally is wrong with them
don't let someone like that get under
your skin because chances are if
someone's saying something negative
about you or talking about you
they're unhappy with themselves this is
me as a person I was just like a human
being there's so much going on in the
world I worry for my sister's my
generation of younger girls I'm so
worried about stuff like that I would
never go online and talk about
somebody's boobs
somebody's lips somebody's what they
look like I mean for God's sake people
like you know we're living at a time
where we need to be kind to one another
woman's a woman man
woman to man I mean it doesn't matter so
any sort of hate you get just feel just
feel sad for that person I do and I I
hope everyone else does also so just
think about these little makes me the
bristle Bryant told me while you think
about someone everyone loves think about
Oprah think about George Clooney who did
I see today that I love Ellen Pompeo
Meredith Grey people hate them there are
forums that people that hate George
Clooney who hates George Clooney
somebody hates George Clooney I didn't
believe Bryan so I wouldn't typed it in
and there was a website and it's like I
hate George Clooney there's not one
person in this world that everyone likes
someone's not gonna like someone for
something but don't worry about it if
you're a good person and you know it
just be yourself do you and be happy
hey Ashley I just wanted to know if all
the songs you use in your videos are
royalty-free yes they are cuz if they're
not then I don't get paid how do I
create a following while having a full
time job what I did was I you know
worked I had to be at work at 7:00 a.m.
and I sometimes had to stay till like 6
p.m. and I put out three videos a week
and I was sometimes filming at midnight
and editing until like 2:00 a.m. to get
my video live the next day and be at
work at 7:00 and I did that for almost
eight months so I mean you just have to
be prepared to put the work in you know
these these things aren't handed to you
and I understand you know some people
don't have to work their funds are taken
care of and that's and that's a great
but for people who have to work in order
to support themselves you know you have
to put extra work in but you know what I
feel like that just makes you appreciate
it that that much more and it makes you
work a little bit harder once you get
the feeling of being able to do what you
love full-time I'm gonna give you a
little recipe that I found that worked
works for me
so here's what you do you find the niche
that you're in whether it be fashion
beauty cooking interior you find the top
three people whether it be a blogger
youtuber in that niche
and create your business model after
them so go and see what is working best
for them what is resonating with their
audience and use your own spin to create
what they're creating don't copy do not
copy at all use your creativity to make
it spin off of what they're doing
they're doing a video that's three
healthy recipes a week and they're
killing it with it you know do something
like that of your own create your own
recipes if you're vegan three vegan
recipes a week vegetarian um five a week
you know maybe try to outdo yourself a
little bit because I always say and I
heard this somewhere I don't know Gary B
said this always try to put yourself out
of business because someone else out
there is trying to do it that being said
there's always competition so you need
to always try to put yourself out of
business always try to do better than
you did last week last month last year
always try to outdo yourself and if you
want to grow super super fast and put
out a video every single day um I know
some of you are probably like are you
kidding me no try it how do you manage
to respond to so many comments on
YouTube I don't understand why people
don't respond to comments on YouTube it
blows my mind it's if there's one thing
that I have learned from podcasts that
I've listened to you and webinars it is
to always respond to your audience I I
get it it's so weird to me that a lot of
people don't respond to comments um I
used to respond to every single comment
and now obviously it gets it gets too
hard to respond to everything but I
always try to respond to as as many
comments as I can and my advice to you
is you are never too big to not respond
to your audience so you go and answer
people's questions you know they're here
for you they're watching you you can't
give them this advice and then they ask
you a question you just leave them
hanging so you know if you take anything
any advice for me that just please know
to respond to your comments to your
subscribers and never never not respond
at least try towards I know you know
time is money and there's not enough
time in the day but just try to respond
to as much stuff as you can right so it
has been real and real fun talking to
you guys about this um this Q&amp;amp;A and let
me know if you guys want to see another
Q&amp;amp;A like this I hope it was informative
I hope I hope I hurt and I will be
monitoring the comments section if you
guys have any other questions for me
please ask and I will do my best to
answer them all but until then keep
doing what you're doing keep rocking you
know like I said in the beginning of
this video you are one step ahead of
everybody else because you are
researching how to be better and how to
grow so good for you you're on the right
track and I believe in you that being
said I'll see you guys in my next video
