tuning in today we are gonna get up
close and personal all very up close as
you can see on my every day makeup
tutorial so today's look is going to be
all about light coverage so if you're
looking for a heavy coverage this
probably isn't the video for you this is
something that I go to every single day
it's basically super light because it is
summer I don't like a lot of heavy
foundation because as soon as I walk two
steps down into the subway my makeup
just starts pouring so anything light
anything sheer is basically what this
video oh sorry a kitten my camera um so
basically it's during the summer I'm
from Texas so I'm used to the heat but
here in New York I'm telling you guys it
is so so so so hot especially when you
go down into the subway sometimes you
have to wait like 15 minutes for your
train are you kidding me it is so hot so
as you can see this is the final product
I've got a little bit of shimmer I've
got a little bit of under-eye coverage
it's a super easy super quick tutorial
this is my go-to for summer it's been my
go-to for a few weeks now a same product
same same routine so during this video
you're going to notice one similar thing
I did leave one part of my routine out
I'm not gonna tell you what it is you
have to watch the end of the video and
wait and see but definitely subscribe
now because I will be doing a tutorial
on this secret thing that I'm leaving
out um so I hope you enjoy okay so as we
get started we can see that my face is a
little bit Brad I just exfoliated about
10 minutes ago so I've got a little bit
of redness on my nose and like right
above my lip and a little bit on my
forehead oh I'm cute so we're gonna
start with my Smashbox concealer it's
amazing it literally feels like silk
bedsheets on my face and I love it so so
so much it just makes your makeup glide
on so
so the next step we're going to do is
put on my NARS sheer foundation it's
super super sheer it hardly gives any
coverage whatsoever so I kind of just
used it as as a builder to wanna build
oh that's a lot to build other stuff on
and I put this on with a foundation
brush by Real Techniques it's a little
bit a light light for me obviously it's
kind of it's my winter foundation so it
is a little bit too light but I do build
over it to make it a little bit darker
as you'll see towards the end of the
video
now I'm applying my Bobby Brown
BB cream this is literally my favorite
stuff in the whole entire world usually
when I'm just stepping out to go grocery
shopping or just like running errands I
will put this and only this on my face
it darkens up my foundation a little bit
as I was saying earlier it gives a
little bit of color a little bit of
coverage it's basically like the perfect
summer foundation because it's barely
there but it still gives you a little
bit of coverage not this stuff so much
so now I'm going to cut well maybe if I
can get the cap off I'm going to cover
up my hideous dark circles with my G
bunchy under-eye concealer this is
really just like a color corrector it is
a little bit full coverage but that's
basically exactly what I need for my
dark circles because they're like out of
control right now
so I'm just gonna play this to under my
eyeballs and a little bit on my nose and
my forehead just wherever I think I need
some color correction sometimes when I'm
in the Sun for a little bit too long I
get this one like annoying hideous dark
circle like on the middle of my forehead
and it will not go away unless I haven't
been in the Sun for a few weeks so I
used that to cover that little guy up
when I'm blending in my concealer I
birth rather than using a beauty blender
or a blending brush I love using my
finger I just feel like the warmth of
your your finger against your skin it
just blends really really really well
and creates our really nice like smooth
matte kind of photoshopped finish
so now that I've concealed my dark
circles I'm going to use my coverfx
brightening cream to kind of brighten up
under my eyes and a little bit on the
brim of my nose this really really makes
your if you contour it makes your
contouring stand out it makes your eyes
pop I just think overall it makes your
makeup look a little bit better
and again it gives you that kind of
matte Photoshop finish without such
heavy heavy feeling of a full face of
makeup now that I'm done with that I'm
going to add my Laura Mercier
brightening powder this stuff is heaven
in a bottle if you get creases like me I
swear I put my concealer on in two
seconds later I've got two creases under
my eye so this takes control of those
creases and basically makes them
disappear I usually put this brightening
powder on the second I finished blending
in my under-eye concealer I let it sit
for a little while and then I'll use my
small blending brush to kind of just
brush off the excess powder
next I'm going to use my NARS just may
be sick face powder with my big fluffy
brush to set my foundation and just to
give it more of a finished look I always
recommend doing a powder over a
foundation just to kind of make
everything moved out before I put my
eyeshadow on I always use my lemonade
buy benefit this will also help with any
creases you get where you put your
eyeshadow it's super super helpful for
when you're gonna be wearing your makeup
all day long this helps keep it on all
day and from creasing because nobody
wants that it kind of has a yellowy
color so it's also really good for
covering up dark circles as well for my
eyes I'm going to be using my naked 2
palette by urban decay this is my
absolute favorite palette in the whole
wide world I'm going to put the color
foxy the very very far color on the left
I'm gonna put that on first onto my
eyelid to make everything seem a little
bit brighter whenever I apply my other
colors
for my crease color I'm actually going
to be using my hoola bronzer I'm just
gonna grab my fluffy brush and spread it
across the creases of my eyes I'm gonna
go over it a couple of times just
because since this is a bronzer it's not
super pigmented so it goes on a little
bit light for my eyelid color I'm using
in my naked 2 palette the color called
half-baked it can't really tell in the
camera because I'm going 90 miles an
hour but it's a really really pretty
shade of shimmery glittery gold it's
there's hardly any color to it it's
basically just a shimmer I love it so so
so much it blends really well over the
hoola bronzer
and lastly I'm going to be using the
color chowder wait that does not take
chowder I'm gonna be using the color
called chopper to do right under my
eyebrow to do right under my eyebrows
it's basically just kind of like a pinky
shimmery again hardly any color to it
it's very very metallic it's so amazing
it's so great for under your eyebrows
and in the creases of your eyeball
when I apply the color chowder / chopper
into my the creases of my eyes I usually
just use my finger because I can't tell
you how many times I've stabbed myself
in the eyeball with a brush trying to
get it in there so yeah I'm not really a
fan of eyeliner during the day so I'm
going to take my naked 2 palette and dip
it dip my my little skinny brush into
the color called what does it say
suspect and I'm just gonna kind of like
make my own eyeliner with my ass
shoutouts definitely one of my favorite
ways to create an eyeliner look during
the day you know it's just not so dark
it's light it's not heavy and it like
doesn't bug me throughout the day
now I'm taking my hoola bronzer to
actually bronze my face this time so I'm
gonna grab my angled brush and I'm just
gonna kind of lightly go over my
cheekbones my jawline my forehead and
I'm gonna also contour my nose as well I
have been using L'Oreal telescopic
mascara for the longest time I don't
know I just can't make myself buy
another mascara this one makes my lashes
so long and it stays on all day you know
sometimes you buy mascara and by the end
of the day it looks like you aren't even
wearing mascara so that's why I love
this mascara so much I highly highly
recommend it and I just FYI I like to
put maybe like five or six layers of
mascara on I don't know why I just love
a full lash look because I hate wearing
false eyelashes I hardly ever do because
I just actually don't even know how to
put them on without hurting myself
I like using lipliner when I'm wearing a
lighter color lipstick because I feel
like when you in the summer when you
wear lighter colors the shape of your
lip can get a little bit lost versus in
the winter when you're wearing dark
purples and reds you know it's it's
clear you can see the shape of your lips
but when you are wearing your pinks and
your corals and your nudes the shape of
your lip can get a little bit lost so I
usually do a liner sometimes I don't but
most of the time I try to just put a
little bit of liner on at the beginning
of the day
and for my last step I'm going to take
my cover FX contour palette and I'm
gonna dip my finger into color number
two it's the shimmery metallic color and
I'm just gonna kind of brush on the
metallic color on samay the right above
my cheekbones where my bronzer starts
this gives you just kind of a little bit
of shimmer to your face it's really
pretty it's very summery it really gives
you like a nice glow just make sure not
to put too much or it will make you look
super shiny and scary
wait can we just take a second to talk
about how cute my eclipses are so that
is the end of this tutorial I hope you
liked it it's definitely it's not the
lightest coverage but it definitely is
right up there I do like a little bit of
concealer under my eyes just because I
constantly have like dark circles and
during the summer I get some some brown
spots some little sun spots on my
forehead so I do like to use a medium to
a heavy concealer most of the time but I
will go ahead and tell you what I did
leave out in case you didn't guess it
was my eyebrows yeah so my eyebrow
routine takes a little bit longer and I
didn't want to bore you with that today
with the whole like summer look so I
will be doing a brow video of my brow
routine next week so definitely

that pops up there is a link on the
screen somewhere that says you know what
to make it easier I'm just gonna put it
