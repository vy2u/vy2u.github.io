my channel I'm shooting a makeup
tutorial today I feel like it's long
overdue and I actually got an Instagram
message from one of my favorite
subscribers yesterday telling me that
she was bored and that I needed to do a
makeup tutorial so I won't mention any
names okay Nina so I am doing a makeup
tutorial today over this look right here
rose-gold and I have been obsessed with
rose gold girl I painted my nails for
this this is SC buy me a cameo buy me a
cameo whatever that means
they pay my nails and this is what they
look like guys I'm not a professional
nail painter so look what it is then
without even realizing like how much I
was loving rose gold I bought this phone
case ok
the phone's not in it because I don't
know like when I buy new things I wait
to use them because then it's like
they're not new anymore oh this is
literally even like sitting in the sack
for like the week and a half now I just
I haven't used it I'm gonna use it today
though but I think I just broke
there we go it's got a mirror in it it's
kind of cheesy you gotta check your
teeth you gotta check and see like
what's going on like what do I look like
right now
so I promise I'm gonna like take action
and use this today all right so let's
get into the video so I'm going to use
the blushed nudes palette by Maybelline
look how pretty these are these are
amazing and keep it will say it's like
not easy to open so here's what the
colors look like a clothes on the back
it gives you a little map of how to use
the different colors I don't know if you
can this get a focus so you can see but
it like numbers it and then shows you on
the eye where to put all the colors
going to start by priming my lid with my
eliminated by benefit not a drugstore
product but this is the only one I have
you can find an eyelid primer anywhere
I know L'Oreal has a really good one I'm
going to be using these four colors
right here and then I might also use
this one because I think it's really
really pretty
going to start with this almost like
true white color and I'm just going to
spread this all over my lid
next I'm going to go in with this darker
color right here and I'm going to use
this brush for my crease
so after I'm done blending that out I am
going to go in with this this is almost
like a true rose gold color I'm going to
go in with this color and I'm just going
to go over where I just put the darker
color on my crease and I'm going to go
in with this really really light
champagne color right yeah I'm going to
go back over my crease then to top that
off I'm going to go back in with this
white color and I'm just going to
lightly brush over the champagne color
and I'm also going to take this color
just with my finger and I'm going to go
in my eyelids so now I'm going to take
just a small brush I'm going to go in
with this pink color and I'm just going
to barely line underneath my eyes and
above my eyes on the crease
I always like to highlight underneath my
eyebrows so I'm going to take the
champagne color with my finger and I'm
just going to brush it right underneath
my brow arch so once the eye shadow is
done I'm going to go in with my
Maybelline Dream bouncy blush in the
color coffee cake and this is a very
Mabi rose gold color I use it all the
time and it's like a mousse it's not so
much a powder it's like an actual mousse
so I remember the first time I used it I
like put my brush on it and it wasn't
working and I won't think what is going
on it's mousse so after that I'm going
to go in with Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in the color opal and I'm just
gonna do right above my cheekbones where
I put me blush to finish off my eyes I'm
going to go in with my mascara and this
is the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black
so really quick I just had like a total
disaster with my mascara umm I like put
my mascara on and then I hit my eye and
then my bottom lashes just smeared all
over my face so I had to like it's been
20 minutes since I've told Jose and put
my mascara on anyways I'm going to put
my lips on so I'm going to go in with my
lip liner by Rimmel in the color spice
and I like to put a lip liner on because
I'm I don't really like the shape of my
lips I feel like they don't have a shape
they just are so I like to go in with a
lip line
um something super light nothing too
crazy
and a message and so the lines aren't so
dramatic and drawn on I'm just going to
kind of color it in with the color of
the pencil no my lips are shy opt for my
actual lipstick I'm going to do Milan
E's math naked as you guys know one of
my all-time favorite just kind of go
with everything
lipstick and I think this is perfect for
a rose gold look
just heard something Ryan
Alessa a little scared because we
watched the boy last night
so like everything I hear I'm like
oh that's cute oh and if you saw my last
video about what was my last ago the P
instanatural video where I didn't have
any bobby pins in my whole apartment and
it comes with a bobby pin opener in case
your frail little fingers can't open it
yourselves
I have yet to use the bobby pin opener
let's try it out
well how are you supposed to use the
bobby pin opener if you can't even open
the package to get it out I mean like
haha this is impossible this just
doesn't open the opener doesn't open
their instruction warning choking hazard
yeah true in case you were wondering why
I was sitting on the floor and now I'm
sitting right here it's because there
was a huge window in front of me and I
feel like when I'm doing a makeup
tutorial it's better like natural light
for you to actually see what I'm doing
so I moved up here for the actual
tutorial so swollen case we're wondering
and if you weren't well now you know all
right that is it for this rose gold
makeup tutorial I hope you loved it and
definitely go by the blushed nudes
Maybelline um palette it was I want to
say it was like $11 so for a drugstore
um palette with all of these colors in
it that was amazing I was looking I was
just kind of looking through all the
eyeshadows and there were a bunch of
palettes just for colors that were like
$7 so I think this is the best bang for
your buck if you're looking for a good
summer eyeshadow palette I as you know I
posted my blog video the other day and I
got a lot of really good responses so
thank you so much for your as sweet
comments I am going to have a workout
routine up for you soon
and I think I'm going to do a Q&amp;amp;A in my
next blog so if you have any questions
for me definitely post them in the
comments below or on Instagram whatever
you're more comfortable with and I will
get those answered I did get a few
questions on my last vlog so I will be
answering those in my next vlogs my next
vlog which I'll post sometime this week
