that I posted this video yesterday and
then quickly took it down a few hours
later there was quite a bit of
controversy regarding my faux fur vest
it is not a real fur vest I should have
specified from the beginning that it
wasn't real for so that's probably my
fault
it is a faux fur vest and I will I
bought this on Poshmark a few years ago
I will try to buy me in fact faux fur
vest so I can link it below for you guys
I think it's because I posted a
shearling vest a couple of weeks ago on
my channel and obviously it was faux but
I never actually said it was faux you
guys just kind of knew so I just assumed
when I was talking about my fur and my
shearling that we were just kind of all
on the same page that it was so but my
fault for not specifying 100% I will
moving forward specify that it is faux
when I'm talking about myself
I I took the video down because the
comments were just coming in and I
started responding to to a few of them
saying like no it's it's faux I've it's
faux fur they just have coming so I was
like oh my god so I'm gonna take the
video down post this little clip before
the video so there's no controversy
moving forward I just wanted to get it
out wave I will say that I completely
appreciate you guys standing for what
you believe in
anti-cruelty anti-fur I am so like I get
it I totally get it and I can appreciate
where you're coming from I took out the
best part just to avoid any controversy
moving forward you have not seen fur on
this channel and you will not see fur on
this channel so I'm gonna leave it at
that and let's get into the actual video
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel it's a little dark bear with me
we're going through a storm here in New
York so obviously I always film at the
best times when it's raining in dark
infinite video I
we just wanted to talk about splurging
versus saving I do get a lot of
questions on snapchat and Instagram on
you know what should I invest my money
in what should I save my money on no it
really is all about personal preference
but I've kind of thrown a few of my
favorite fall items together just to
kind of show you guys what I save and
what I splurged on but we all have
different lifestyles I feel like a lot
of you guys a lot of my subscribers are
either college students career women
full-time moms career women and old die
moms about this video putting this
together might help you guys on what you
should save your money on and really
invest in and when it's okay to take the
alternative route which is getting your
money maybe spending it towards
something a little bit better the first
pair of shoes that I decided to show you
guys were some studded boots I was so
obsessed with the Givenchy black boots
with the silver studs but I decided to
what save on Southern foods I live in
New York
I am constantly walking around just step
in like poop and puke and I don't even
know what else I know you guys always
see my blog I swear every time I'm
vlogging I step in dog - I do not invest
a ton in shoes I'm not to mention
walking so much they get completely
destroyed souls busted out I'd step in
puddles and if I were to spend $1300 on
a pair of shoes and I ruined them I
would never be able to forgive myself
that I'm dizzy paunchy booties I opted
for these from forever 21 I feel like
they give me the exact same wolf that I
would be going for with the Givenchy
ones except these were only $29 instead
of 1350 and asked for the gold Chloe
susannah boots which we all know and
love I like seriously if someone just
gave me the red ones I would be so happy
I opted for these guys also from forever
21 again they give you the exact same
effect the exact same detailing but at
lower-cost I save on my studded boots my
next pair of shoes are my over the knees
stretched play boots and I decided to
splurge on these guys these are Jean
Michelle Casa bot but I know you know
stir wiseman mates
very similar almost the exact same pair
I am obsessed pasi's have very thin legs
and so it's hard for me to find one that
really fits my leg and holds up and
these are such a classic they're never
gonna go out of style so I plan on
having these for years and years and
years I don't wear them that much so
they're not gonna get beat up within the
first year of me having them I really
just spread them out dinner or if I'm
you know for a special occasion
so I decided to splurge on these guys
I'm so happy I did they were such a
great investment if you're a career
woman and you're going to the office
eight to five and you're hustling and
you're you know walking around going to
meetings you know definitely definitely
splurge on a pair of good shoes I mean I
think Louboutins are that comfortable I
have a white foot and I feel like
Louboutins are made for more of a narrow
foot but aqua Zara makes her really
comfortable shoes I would invest about
five to six hundred dollars in a good
pair of plain black pumps you know if I
were going to an office job every day
but for my lifestyle I would definitely
save on a pair of black pumps just
because I don't really need them as much
as someone who goes to an office job and
would have the need for them moving on
to the accessories I pulled my - next
scarf I decided to save on these that I
know Gucci makes really gorgeous ones I
decided to save on mine just because
don't wear them enough to spend you know
three or four hundred dollars on a scarf
you know they make really really nice
ones like the brand's I mentioned before
you know they're real silk they're so
nice so if you are a smart girl
definitely invest what you know if
you're wearing them on a daily basis
invest in one but I decided to save just
because I only wear them for fun
sometimes
I'm around my bag but that's about it
for me for the scarves this one was I
want to say 550 from forever21
this guy was I believe $12 from Zara my
next accessory is a trendy belt and we
all know and love the below the belt
I forget the name I forget what it's
called but it's the one with the double
silver buckle I decided to save on mine
and I opted for this one from Topshop it
looks the exact same
I've see below the belt one I believe
that below the belt one the buckles are
quite bigger than this one I decided to
save because I'm still getting the same
effect I don't wear it and not to spend
$200 on a belt especially when they make
ones that look exactly like it so I
saved on my knee below the belt the rose
gold what now that is something that I
would invest in because it's really
unique and you don't really see it out
there a lot so I would probably invest
in that one but this one the silver one
I'm Savin saving my money on this one
then I also found this one from Topshop
it's just a single a single buckle you
know when I when I'm not going for such
a dramatic look I decide I just put this
one next I have a plain basic black tote
and I definitely explore it on this one
this is a saline tote and I carry this
all the time I decided to splurge on
this because this is something that I
knew I was going to be carrying on a
daily basis this is something that I
carry to work there is so much room in
here it holds up it's so so soft the
leather is amazing I think a good black
tote is key for any wardrobe because
this is always something that you can
grab and you want something that is
timeless at the classic that's going to
last under your bags I don't like to
invest a whole lot of money on just
because I know I'm going to get tired of
them or I'm gonna want to get a new one
as the season changes but
good black tote I definitely think is
worth the splurge that is Nick for
accessory is moving on to outerwear
I grabbed my leather jacket I splurged
on this one so the thing that I like
about this leather jacket is on it it's
vegan leather it's not real leather so
if I get caught in a rainstorm or snow
you know it's not gonna ruin the jacket
if it gets wet so I think real leather
jackets is as beautiful as they are and
as good-looking and good-quality as they
are I just don't trust it in New York
when I'm walking around all the time
because it rains out of nowhere I would
be so pissed if my $1,300 leather jacket
got ruined so I spent about 200 on the
side I've had it for its great quality
of had it for like five years a splurge
splurged on a leather jacket definitely
invest in a good-looking one gonna also
have fun leather jacket that I save on
including this one from forever 21 I
don't wear this a whole lot because it
is very specific to a certain type of
outfit so I definitely save my money on
this one I think this was maybe 20
dollars from forever 21 or my next
outerwear piece is a blazer and I am
obsessed with this blazer blazer was
$200 and I feel like I stored a little
bit on this one I say a good blazer is
definitely a splurge even if you are
fresh into college
you are going to need a good blazer I
think it's something to invest in even
if it's even if you need to get it
tailored invest in the tailoring invest
in something that is going to make your
outfit look amazing you're gonna need it
for interviews for work you know even
for fun I love getting a pair of
boyfriend jeans and throwing on a good
blazer so yeah I think for anyone's
lifestyle situation a good blazer is a
good key focus for anyone's closet so
next I wanted to show you guys some
trendy denim for example I know that a
big trend right now is the uneven hem
denim which can range I've seen you know
from you know $80 is all the way up to
$300
I definitely say with any sort of trendy
denim definitely save because anything
trendy is more than likely going to be
out of style within the next you know
three or four seasons no in the past I
have definitely splurged on trendier
items that I totally regret it totally
wish I happen because they're just
sitting in my closet not being worn
because they were trendy and I'm over it
you know how that goes as for the uneven
hem I don't know if you saw my DIY I
bought this pair of $20 denim from H&amp;amp;M
and I just did kind of a DIY uneven hem
which I'm obsessed with and I wear them
all the time I get so many compliments
on them so I decided to save on these
and then I have a pair of striped denim
and kind of florally denim that I
definitely saved on and I'm so glad I
did because I don't wear them as much as
I thought I would so when it comes to
printed denim or anything of that sort
super trendy denim I definitely would
save my money but when it comes to just
denim in general I would definitely
splurge if you find a good pair of jeans
that just fit you perfectly
not only what I splurged I would
probably buy like two pair one in every
color you will not regret it because you
will have them season after season after
season especially if it's like a black
skinny a denim skinny a white skinny a
good flare I think I don't know I love
flares they might be a trendy item to
you but to me I will probably always
wear like a good flare jeans and lastly
I just wanted to go over a jewelry
really quick with me it's Aramis the
jewelry because I try not to invest too
much in a statement necklace you know I
think for dainty or gold pieces that you
can wear every single day I think
definitely Lauren John though for more
like a statement necklace I would save
my money I don't know there's just a few
exceptions with me because I see I
bought this guy from like a little
jewelry store somewhere here in New York
and it was like $15 and I literally do
like I never wear it it's very rare that
I need
a good statement necklace and glad that
I didn't go crazy on this so then I got
this guy this was $200 and it is
definitely a statement necklace but I
just thought it was so cool I couldn't
pass it up and I would have completely
regretted it if I didn't get it um I
just think it's like the coolest thing
ever I was just obsessed with this whole
brand I was like I have to have this
I've worn it maybe three times but I
just love having it in my closet I love
knowing that it's mine so this is
something that I have no problem
investing money in because like I just
thought this belonged in my life so I
bought it
alright guys it is getting really dark
now I've got to end this video I really
hope you enjoyed it again this was just
