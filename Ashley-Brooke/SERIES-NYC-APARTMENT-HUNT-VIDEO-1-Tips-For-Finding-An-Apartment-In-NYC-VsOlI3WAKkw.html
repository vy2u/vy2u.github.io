know unless you are new to my channel
Ryan and I are hunting for a new
apartment here in New York and we
decided to kind of make a series out of
it and blog our experience into doing so
this is going to be video number one
where we just kind of explain what we're
looking for and at the end we're going
to share some tips with you guys that
we've learned along the way of finding
an apartment here in New York so right
now we are currently living in New York
we're on in Midtown on the west side we
love it but our lease is up very soon
and so we're looking for a new place to
move into because our apartment right
now is just a little bit small we've
kind of grown out of it we wrote down a
list of tips these are tips that people
have asked us before in the past and
just kind of general things that we
think would benefit anyone who's looking
to move soon to the cities so we will
start off our tips section by letting
everyone know that we are not experts
and this is just things that we have
picked up along the way um so if you
have any suggestions and tips please put
in the comments below these are just
things we've learned along the way so
you know and it's totally our opinion so
if you think we're wrong about something
or if we're not going about it the right
way definitely keep that too soon so in
our apartment search we are looking at
things from luxury buildings to walk-up
buildings kind of older style so you'll
be seeing a little bit of both because
we're open to anything
I like West Village a lot it's closer to
her friends are I think our
neighborhoods kind of like an
up-and-coming neighborhood also they're
constantly opening up new restaurants
and new bars and new places to hang out
so I mean I wouldn't mind staying in
this area because I do feel like new
things
opening up no I'm hip number one make an
appointment we learned this on our first
trip here our first apartment hunt here
we had to we came prepared luckily we
made an appointment with like I think 14
different buildings and brokers and I
mean you have to have an appointment or
else they won't let you in because I
remember there was one place down in
financial where we were trying to look
at an apartment and we didn't have an
appointment so they just wouldn't show
it to us not every place is like that
tip number two is you don't always have
to have a broker you can either do the
no broker route or the broker route if
you do a broker route it's gonna make
your life so much easier but it's going
to be expensive
it will cost you yes so we chose the
first time around to have no broker
because after we found out how much a
broker's fee was I almost had a heart
attack and we did it ourselves then we
found a great building um we spent a lot
of time in Italy we had appointments at
like 14 buildings but we literally
looked at like 25 yeah you have to be
willing to put the time and effort in it
aren't gonna use a broker because a
broker basically finds great buildings
they set up the appointments for you
it's and they can tell you right off if
something fits what you're looking for
because ya seen it most likely and they
know more I think yeah we'll need one if
you look on websites like Street easy or
any other ones for apartments in New
York whenever you go on street easy and
search for apartments you can click an
option for no fee and it'll show you
every apartment and your criteria that
doesn't have a broker's fee so that's a
nice option to have it is useful the
next tip is amenities so amenities being
a gym a pool cafe a lounge area lounge
area I have more space a rooftop yeah
all those things are considered
amenities so when you're in from we're
from Texas when we were looking at
apartment
here being from Texas the gym and the
pool and everything's included when you
live somewhere but here it's not it's an
additional amenities package that you
have to pay for and it can range it can
be seven hundred to a thousand dollars a
year per person or it can be a monthly
thing where it's more than that like two
hundred dollars a month or something you
need it's optional you don't have to get
it to live in a building Oh
tip number four that will run for tip
number four is laundry laundry laundry
laundry do you oh do you do laundry we
do a lot of laundry I were like three
open today that's so not true I guess
what I was like at work clothes I got
lounge clothes Yeah right wears a lot as
a laundry
so basically when it comes to laundry
you have three options a it's in your
apartment unit B it's in your apartment
building or C you have to walk to a
laundromat now since we do would do is
it do do I would settle for having the
laundry in the building why do people
here I think pay other there's a service
on their services to come and pick up
and take your laundry and do that I
would never want someone else to wash my
dirty laundry yeah got her yeah I'm
stopped to say you do have someone
watching your gorilla she takes care of
it all number five is proximity to
subway the subways how we get around
that in bike riding now also our
building and I know a lot of buildings
in this area have a shuttle bus that
takes you to and from the subway during
work hours meaning like when you're
going to work and getting off of work
but during the day when you need to go
to the grocery store or whatever you
have to walk so keep that in
consideration so the screen might look a
little different we had to take a food
break so one great tip number the number
we're on is storage make sure that your
new apartment has
as much storage as you can get and if it
doesn't don't bring a lot of crap with
you nobody will follow that rule I feel
like we did it a little bit we tried to
convince what we still brought too much
stuff find any little nook and cranny
that you can shove things in exactly
where we're condensing that's what we're
doing for the rest of the day we yes you
are yes you are
we're getting rid of stuff no Lou you're
getting rid of it and we're gonna donate
it because we don't wear it you might
wonder I've got the coolest graphic to
use this Oh storage part-b kitchen
storage is another thing most apartments
will not have lots of cabinetry at all
cabinetry cabinet space so are you for
one pot one pot two pots moon pot two
pots to your pan because you can stack
on top of each other
stretch it stretch them bad tips please
please get off of storage next is o
first no reversing no reverse no George
part see that we need to remember is
that if you buy a count that can also be
used as storage you got a leg up like we
bought a couch that has a big storage
thing in the chase so lift that up it's
from Ikea Oh all linen stuff is stored
in there yeah it's not anymore
go get that from Ikea is so cheap in its
color triples called a Frieda present
it's the favorite friend for guidance
I think it's frightened hi for 9 minutes
does anyone know how to pronounce IKEA
stuff um I know from our personal
experience they need so many documents
from you it's insane it's a lot
different from the big process in Texas
so be prepared to provide two years of
tax returns a letter of employment if
you're employed with a company paycheck
stubs to pay stubs and bank account
statements like printouts of your bank
account yeah I think there is one other
thing just make sure that you know what
they make sure you have all that in
order and have it all together because
they literally give you a 24-hour window
of okay I see you applied for this
apartment now we need all of those
documents in 24 hours or we're giving
the apartment to somebody else so it's a
really quick moving process and um so
just yet make sure you're completely
organized another tip is to act quickly
if you see something that you like
because right and I saw this cute
apartment in West Village on street easy
we saved it we were going to make an
appointment to go look at it and the
next day it was off the market someone
had already rented it so if you see
something you like act fast
don't think if you see something it's
going to be there a month later because
chances are it's probably not part G no
yeah
7 7 G so okay this one is very important
if you're serious about moving listen to
this one so closely getting an apartment
is not easy
um you personally in in most buildings
that I've come across have to make 40
times the monthly rent the monthly rent
you can get a guarantor most buildings
will allow Karin tours someone in your
body yeah
in order to do that they have to make 80
times the monthly rent either you have
to make 40 times your monthly rent or
your guarantor has to make 80 times the
monthly rent now if you can't do either
one of those options see is insurance
insurance will basically be your
guarantor it's a company here in New
York that backs you up and basically
acts as your guarantor and you pay them
a deposit of your gross amount of
whatever your rent should be so they
keep that and then you pay them a fee
which is like 105 percent of what your
grocery
should be wait did you / honestly like
I'm sitting to feed from you
I just hate eggs oh one last note what
instrument is that it does require good
credit so but you can also get a
guarantor for engine you can yeah that's
another loop oh so you could have your
guarantor be your grant or for your game
you don't have good credit
yeah lots of guarantor guarantor layers
neck tip number eight walk-up versus
high rise the differences so when we
lock up love the high now it's not that
simple he put that on there not that
simple
no that actually hurt oh if you're
planning on moving I would come and stay
a week and kind of browse around
different areas and different
neighborhoods to kind of see what suits
you best because for example you know
the Upper West Side is completely
different from say meatpacking or West
Village do that mm-hmm come for like a
week you need more than a week but it
was a cool at least a week we'll be here
yeah let's go grab coffee hang out bonus
tip whoa why bonus to where I got bashed
up number one in case I think of number
two later at a city bike membership city
bike is the best Thank You bones tip
city bike is like a bike everywhere in
the city wherever you need it to be it's
perfect we really we really thought hard
about do we want to get a city bike
membership or do we want to just buy our
own bikes but you know I saw roller
store bike in our apartment and um cuz I
know that was your into we're absolutely
not happening anymore bonus tips that I
need to know about probably alright Ryan
has another opponent stick bonus tip
number be told me to tell you forgot
I'll come back okay so now that our tips
and bonus tip is completely done it will
start posting our apartment tour videos
we've seen four buildings so far one of
them which we aren't allowed to post
because still under construction so
those are coming within the next week I
would say be looking for that so we're
gonna try to be as helpful as possible
that way you know if you're planning on
moving and you're watching this right
now we answer all of the questions that
you guys have and nothing goes
unanswered okay bye
I mix these two together because I do
put a tanning stuff on my face so a face
my face is a little bit darker I just
had more of this to kind of balance out
the lighter color makes sense right it's
not a booger or like what is up the skin
I think it's skin for my eye shadow I
just use my NYX powder with my Mac eye
shadow brush that has seemed to jump off
