it
need problem number one with apartment
number two it's not it's right above
empire cake which would be a huge issue
for me cuz I love cake so much
they chains underneath bound to his now
because we were running
get out deal with a broken heart and
loaded
need you put up for 15 minutes nobody
wouldn't be paying really you look like
you're sitting on the ground I love this
chair though here get up second yeah I
like it
wait Jews the earnest Hemmingway I like
this apartment a lot I think you know it
was a two-bedroom for the price that's
really great how you don't see whatever
it on the camera is that the whole
apartment was on like a slope was like
downhill from the kitchen all the way
into the bedroom which I mean I guess
it's not that big of a deal but it's
just kind of weird and kind of makes me
question the sturdiness of the building
I would always feel like we were like
about to fall I don't know I'm a huge
natural light person if you've seen my
apartment that I'm in now it's just all
windows floor-to-ceiling because I love
natural light this apartment had none
you can kind of see a window in the
living room and you can see one in the
first bedroom but it's facing a brick
wall and so I can just imagine you know
on a cloudy day or early in the morning
it's probably so dark and I like some
light pouring in in the video I show you
the bathroom and the toilet was like up
on a step and I don't know I'm just
since looking for apartments I've seen
some weird things and I think that's
definitely one of them have never seen a
toilet up on like a throne so that was
weird Ryan and I walked in and we were
like what in the hell is that why is
that there the bathroom was renovated
which was great the kitchen was
renovated the layout was kind of weird
in the kitchen and living room area the
kitchen is like three times the size of
the living room like it's a huge
unnecessary kitchen and then a tiny like
space for your couch and stuff so I kind
of wish the living room went into the
kitchen more I liked it I don't love it
but like I said price and location was
great so that's something to consider I
loved how it was right above Empire cake
I know I mentioned in the video that I
love cake but like I love cake have to
try to control myself
I'm zero self-control when it comes to
desserts it's like an issue but yeah let
me know in the comments below and you
guys think of this way and you know just
any general comments about it let me
know decisions like these are hard and
it's good to have kind of an unbiased
person giving you feedback so let me
know what you think the search continues
and stay tuned I think I've got three
three more videos coming for different
buildings that we've seen so stay tuned
for that and I'll see you next time bye
okay that one was way too small we
didn't know I did video yeah it was way
too small the area is so great but I
don't even think that our bed or couch
or anything would fit in there very
small the bedroom was about the size of
the screen you're watching this video on
yeah it won't fit our bed like right
right in here right there that's where
we'd sleep and then it's go straight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
