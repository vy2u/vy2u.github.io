the area is so great the only thing that
we were concerned about is the storage
situation because there's you know a
tiny closet and there's one tiny other
little closet in the living room I don't
know if you can see it was funny because
we were waiting for the leasing agent to
come let us into the building we were
downstairs you know ringing the buzzer
and I like look over and there's this
half-naked man mannequins with these
like tiny little man panties is that a
like section right next door and Ryan
was like oh my god yeah it is it's weird
when you go to West Village you'll see a
lot of little like funky places like
that where there's just some really
interesting things but um it was up on
the top floor it was quite a hike going
up five flights of stairs I don't know
if I'd be willing to do that every day I
did that before when I lived downtown
and it was pain in the ass and you got
you know six bags of groceries but we
loved the apartment you know it was
updated there was a cute little wine
fridge and there was lots of natural
light coming in and I'm such a sucker
for a brick wall and this had a brick
wall in the living room and in the
bedroom so I was like oh my god my brick
wall dreams are coming true Ryan and I
forgot the camera so it's iPhone video I
hope it's good quality I haven't
uploaded it yet I don't know I think
maybe the iPhone video makes it look a
little smaller but it was actually quite
a big like living room space you might
could actually fit a dining room maybe I
think there could have been a dining
room table somewhere in that area maybe
pushed in the corner somewhere
oh there was a washer dryer inside the
unit let me tell you though you cannot
open the dryer and the dishwasher at the
same time because they will collide only
in New York right I remember my last
apartment like the kitchen the laundry
room in the bathroom was all in the same
like room area so you know you just kind
of get
stuff like that after a while but we
loved it obviously we were actually
thinking about maybe moving forward with
this one but unfortunately it got leased
like a week after you know we went and
saw it this one wasn't meant to be I'm
les totally fine you know what happens
happens and we are going to keep looking
hopefully we're wrapping up this whole
apartment search soon because I need to
start looking for furniture and other
things that you feel like you need to
buy when you move like plates like I
have I have plates but you know since
I'm moving I feel like I need new plates
yeah I just love new things yeah I'm all
about like looking for new home stuff so
if you have any suggestions on where to
buy you know like sofas and beds and
little like knick-knack e decorative
things let me know I'm currently
obsessed with dot and Bo comm I found it
the other day and I literally have like
a million things in my wish list so it's
a great website so if you haven't
checked that out check it out it's
really cool but um let me know if you
have any cute little websites that you
know of so I can go spend money on
things I don't need okay homie a whole
you if I'm 5/3 what does that make this
apartment at least five four whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
