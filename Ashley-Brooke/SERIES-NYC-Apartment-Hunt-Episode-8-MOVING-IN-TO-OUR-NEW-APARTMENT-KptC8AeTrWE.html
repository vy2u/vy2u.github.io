losing's because we were running
get out deal with a broken heart and let
it Mellow need you here rise on my side
homie
Dane's underneath bound to snare
losses because we were
get out deal with a broken heart and let
it
we need you here right inside homie
Oh
what's up everyone so we are in our new
apartment
finally we're still getting moved in and
everything as you can see we have empty
picture frames above us so yeah we just
gave you an empty tour and before we
moved in it was kind of hard coming from
our old apartment because in our old
apartment we had a small bedroom in a
big living room and here we have the
opposite we have a big bedroom in a
small living room so it was kind of hard
adjusting to a furniture situation this
is better and we now have a king-size
bed
and it's like so much room I can get
away from her okay that's not true
because we can't fall asleep on opposite
into the bed and every time I wake up
Keith's like this it's neither here nor
there all it means is you like to keep
it at 52 degrees in the apartment and
any warmth who doesn't like 52 degrees
at night I like blast the AC at night
with the windows open though because
right now right now we're not we don't
February we're not paying for
electricity right now so our buildings
still kind of under construction so they
like have it there just like we don't
have to pay it right now so I'm like
taking full advantage and blasting the
air conditioned our management said it's
on them for a while Donn house not gonna
say no we're so excited we love the
place and it's just so much more natural
labs easier to wake up in the morning
our last bedroom was like a little cave
super dark no windows and no guys like
it done there's nothing but windows yeah
so we've been waking up at like 6:30
because that's kind of when the Sun
starts shining in hey movie mark Girl
Scout cookies very much smaller I mean
with the Thin Mints then we got you
covered we already ate all the Samoas
there's these Tagalog Tagalog so good
Thin Mints are better write them into
the bomb
so always argon competing so those are
the best obviously you know what we need
to buy two boxes of Samoas next time
thank you multiple boxes other some more
here's the thing about these they're
peanut butter which is very good we all
love peanut butter but I have a feeling
these were really cheap peanut butter
for these not talk about our stuff I
carry one oh why because we've been
eating just as peanut butter you don't
know Justin you make friends of them is
at your local grocer in the peanut
butter oh yeah joe census Stephanie good
man
provides a very good product so factory
I was saying girl scout company they
should contact Justin incorporate the
peanut butter inside of the tag along
hey listen good idea that's got no it's
probably not even real peanut butter
though it's partially defeated peanut
flour you mean deflated no the faded the
fatted fat okay but yeah those d faded
peanuts
I can't we know it has peanut butter
this peanut butter
yeah she's it cool alright I'm scared
because I don't recommend any of these
you look on the front
natural oil of the peppermint okay but
what about all the other 30 ingredients
as you put it in your mouth cornstarch
stop dropping from do not help me at all
enriched flour that's already done
caramel coloring caramel coloring this
is brown how did your hair get into our
eating snacks what we're talking about
before Oh our apartment more importantly
Justin on time no scoffs my favorite
things about this apartment is my new
plant well anyway it's our apartment we
decided on this one because it's it then
what's the same neighborhood that we
were living in we the building still
under construction we don't have a gym
yet we don't have a pool or
like a courtyard or anything yet so
that's kind of still being built in
there will be a full tour coming soon
once we can kind of get everything put
back in storage and kind of set the way
we want so tell him what happened you
knew we're across the street on the Lord
Jesus there's a fire
that doesn't mean flame anything
it was far there was a fire the building
across the street for months was on
actual fire roof for the whole block was
shut down there were ambulances and
these cars and fire hydrants
oh the fog they brought the fire
hydrants in the fire truck the
firefighters they were all up and down
the street it was so crazy there was
smoke coming out of the building I
thought we should evacuate but Ryan's on
No
we're still not quite done with this
series we're gonna just kind of probably
do a couple of our videos on just kind
of how the apartments coming together
and you know what's going on I don't
know if I'm gonna include this in the
video yet because I don't want us to get
in trouble by our building in case
they're watching this but since this
building still under construction and
there's really not that many people
living here at all
they leave all of the apartments
unlocked on each floor so the first time
that we were here we like snuck into all
of the we really didn't see again
because there always were open so we
were like going to each apartment
looking in all the floor plans and some
of them are so nice too far it's like we
were like let's just squat here somebody
moves in let's just like move our stuff
into the flood Oh some of them are way
better than ours yeah they are quite
better than ours I think she should
include it I don't think so because I
don't want to get in trouble we didn't
touch anything
we touched yeah we didn't touch anything
we were in and out super quick we just
wanted a little peek and a good peek if
anything we were protecting it
yeah we were guarding it oh my gosh
