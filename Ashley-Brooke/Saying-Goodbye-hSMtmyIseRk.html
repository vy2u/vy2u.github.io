is starting out a little differently
than normal blogs we just kind of wanted
to sit down and just I guess thank
everyone for being so understanding and
the nice messages that we got about our
dog cotton yeah very very sweet message
because really nice so mister Graeme -
yeah everything so there wasn't a video
last Sunday and we were kind of in my a
from like snapchat and then stories
because we had to suddenly put our dog
asleep we had to put him to sleep we
rescued cotton six years ago yeah we
volunteered at this organization called
Austin boxer rescue and we were
fostering cotton and someone wanted to
adopt him and we just decided like no we
want to adopt it nobody else can happen
so we ended up adopting em soon he's
such a good boy he was eighty pound
death yes boxer because who would step
on your feet any chance he got and just
kept on going when the organization's on
cotton he was almost dead he was so
skinny and he'd been beaten pretty badly
so we just couldn't help but take him
home and take care of them and then a
lot of you guys were asking why he was
in Texas and not here in New York and
that is because whenever we were saving
money to move to New York
we were air being air bein being we're
putting our apartment on Airbnb and we
would stay with Brian's parents and
cotton just loved Ryan's parents house
you know they have a big backyard big
house - Roman - and by the time we were
moving to New York
cotton
was getting off Rytas and he just wasn't
in the best shape and we felt like his
his life in New York wouldn't be great
if we ended up bringing him so we left
him with Ryan's parents where he was he
stayed back so he could have a yard and
just be more of an outside dog versus
being here cooped up and dealing with
super cold winters and yeah it was just
better for him that way so um he had
cancer and he's had cancer for a while
um but he was just too old to have
surgery so we found out that he just
kind of took a turn for the worse and we
knew that we were gonna have to put him
to sleep but we didn't we didn't realize
that it was going to be so soon we tried
to get a flight to go to San Antonio but
um we just decided that it would be best
and the vet also decided that it would
be best to just do it as soon as
possible because he was suffering and he
couldn't walk anymore in English it just
got really bad really quickly so that's
why you know this blog probably isn't
going to be very long because we just
we've just been you know being with each
other and just kind of yeah their
messages have been so great and so many
of you it we were even talking about it
so many of you have had to say goodbye
to your pets and you know so just know
