what's up guys welcome back to my
channel today I have teamed up with DSW
to show you guys some of my favorite
spring trends when it comes to shoes I
absolutely love spring and summer shoe
trends because I feel like sometimes
that makes your outfit when it comes to
style and fashion I like to add a third
piece to kind of elevate my outfit
sometimes it's just too hot to do that
so I always consider my shoe it's like
my third piece like that's cheating a
little bit but still work before we get
started I must say that DSW sponsored
this video so the partnership that just
seems to fit you know we're going into
spring and I love talking about shoe
trends with one of my favorite things to
talk about will really make your whole
entire outfit so with that being said
let's go ahead and get started
we have minimalistic slides
embellishment and espadrilles
I started with the embellishments and I
pulled this sandal by Sam Edelman love
anything with pom-poms on it and I
thought these were perfect they've got
the beading up at the toe
they've got palms and they've got a
suede um ankle wrap and you can either
take the wrap all the way up your leg or
you can tie it around your ankle thought
the colors were so nice nice earth tone
cold this dress from Zara because I just
thought that this was a super casual
spring you know really comfy dress and I
thought that this will kind of perfect
the pumps or have dark gray and then so
I thought that this went really nicely
with this outfit
for my minimalistic shoe I grabbed this
one from Audrey Brook it is a fuchsia
super minimalistic block heel sandal and
you know when it comes to minimal shoes
I always like to do either a print or a
color because I feel like it's a really
nice way to add something special to
your outfit I did just a basic pair of
denim jeans and then I did my printed
birds top because I thought the black
and white was really nice with the pop
of pink it's also sets you up to do some
sort of print in your bag too if you
have a bag with beads on it or some sort
of print that you could add with the
fuchsia I really like this outfit this
is something that I would wear you could
throw on black jeans or for nighttime or
you can leave your denim on and do kind
of like a daytime a little bit more of a
dressy situation you can even dress up
to basic pair of jeans and a white tee
with this sandal and like a really cool
bag and I feel like you know once again
proving that your shoes and your
accessories can really make your whole
entire outfit
for my next shoe I did this espadrille
by Dolce Vita and it's kind of a basic
cine platform espadrille and I 50s
really casual because I think this is
such a nice casual shoe to grab it's not
like a basic speaker it's got a little
bit of you knows detail to it so I
thought that was nice
styled this with my stripes kula from
zara decided to do a white t-shirt this
one that I'm wearing right now and I did
a leather jacket because it's still a
little cold and to be honest my shirt
was really wrinkled but I drew a leather
jacket on because that's just how I roll
you know who starts wrinkled put on
jacket this is a good travel outfit
comfy casual cool outfit so this was
probably one of my favorites and the
shoe also comes in like a brown Japan
tannish Brown I believe but I chose
black because I've been accumulating a
lot of brown shoes lately and I thought
this was really pretty in love
so I sit another espadrille because I
just couldn't pick between the two you
know one was really casual the other one
a little dressy so I did two espadrilles
I got this one by unisom I don't have
them saying that right just a flat form
lace-up brown sandal and they do have
other colors in this I believe they have
denim in this too which was really cool
but I went with the Browns I feel like I
could get more use out of this sandal
since the does have a bit of a platform
you can dress it up or down I did kind
of an in-between look so I did a this
lace top from Zara denim light wash
denim and then these
and lastly is the mule I will probably
be getting more use out of this shoe
than any shoe in my closet for spring
it's this guy right here and I love the
color I mean I try this on with I'm not
kidding I've filmed a few videos in the
past few days and this shoe has gone
with everything so I was you know I was
trying so hard to define a color to get
in these they have multiple colors but I
wouldn't the knew just to play it safe
I'm so glad I did because this is going
to be my new go-to sandal I actually
dialed it with this outfit right here I
you know I did this with a black denim
and I didn't want to do a black shoe
because I thought maybe that was going
to be too harsh for spring so I think
this is a good option for when you do
want to lighten up your outfit and
really give it more of a spring feel
rather than a winter I like to wear all
black so I feel like I can count on my
shoe to really make my outfit a little
bit more in season rather than throwing
on a black bootie with everything and
calling it a day I think this is a good
alternative to that alright guys that is
all I have for you today thanks again to
DSW if you are still in need of some
spring shoes I'm telling you go to DSW

choosing five pairs of shoes I set in my
inbox for probably two to three days
