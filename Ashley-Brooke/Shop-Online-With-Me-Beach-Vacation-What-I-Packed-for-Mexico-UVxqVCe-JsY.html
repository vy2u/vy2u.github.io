long time no see if you are new here my
name is Ashley Brooke and I have just
been in Mexico so I promised everyone
that I would show you guys what I packed
where I wore it to and all that good
stuff a lot of you guys said you were
going on vacation too and you're
wondering what's back and I will link
everything below so you can go check it
out so this video is sponsored by shop
Tiger I partnered up with him so many
times before and I get so many messages
still from you guys being like this is
the best extension and app ever and I'm

save from online stores and it'll give
you a notification when the item goes on
sale when the price gets dropped when
there's a promo when it's back in stock
you can even like narrow it down to your
size as soon as I knew that I was going
to Mexico the end of last year I started
shopping immediately for my trip I'll
just use this belt for example because
this is a belt that I got for the trip
to anthropology calm down this belt I
saved it to shop tiger put it in my
folder it put it in the correct folder
and as soon as it went on sale I got a
notification and I bought it a lot of
the stuff that I'm about to show you
from my Mexico trip I did not pay full
price for I shopped a lot online because
I just kept getting notifications on my
phone like this item went on sale having
it up and I saved almost 400 dollars
just about using shop tiger for the
things that I got some of them went on
sale and some of them they were just
having promo so I got like 20% off here
and there which was so nice get it add
it add the extension on to your computer
get the app it's so easy to use it's
completely free there will be a link in
the description box for you guys to go
download it if you are going on a trip
or if you are saving up for a new
wardrobe for spring or new work clothes
definitely download shop tiger and
you'll be so happy you did when your
notifications start coming in luckily
this light I got two free bags so I just
packed options because when you're in
Mexico you just don't know if it's gonna
rain or and especially with the big
group of people you just don't know what
the plans are gonna be first for a
dinner option I got in this guy from
Lord and Taylor
and I thought this was just perfect for
Mexico I was going for bright colors
just like really fun color blocking
awesome and like ruffles down the front
I just thought this was the cutest
little dress and then the back is solid
right and I actually wore this for a
moment in the vlog this is another kind
of one of those dresses that's like
which I think it's very important to
pack items that are versatile so I could
wear this on the beach with sandals or I
could also wear this to dinner with some
like platform sandals or wedges or
something like that so I really love
packing versatile dresses like this for
tropical vacations another versatile
dress that I have is this one from Free
People
and this came in so many different
colors so I had a moment of panic at
checkout and switch the color at the
last minute to this really pretty like
seafoam green color but it's just this
really flowy big giant boho dress and I
wore this over a bathing suit and then I
also wore this to kind of like walk
around and just be comfortable so it's
very airy and flowy so even though you
are kind of covered it still lets the
air in so you're not so hot I'm already
getting o to a pile that's not gonna
stay okay please stay then I got this
swimsuit cover from Zara and it is okay
I think I told you guys this on the blog
but this was almost $200 and I got it
for like we'll just write it like $20 I
don't know it's so cute it's so like
very whom is Sony looking I love the
colors I love the pattern it's perfect
for a cover-up it had these really long
tassels that literally went down to my
knees and I was like this is not gonna
work so I just grabbed scissors and cut
them and it looks completely different
so very well worth the 25 dollars next
is this dress from Free People and this
is just a little
I don't know this a little peasant dress
and I believe this also came in a few
colors but I thought the cream was
really pretty because you could see the
details really nicely it's just another
little babydoll dress and it comes with
a slip underneath but if you're wearing
it over your swimsuit you could lose the
slip so you could kind of see your
bathing suit kind of peeking out and
dresses that come with little slips
because then you can have just like a
bin of little slips like this that you
can pair with other things as well or
this little black baby doll dressed to
dinner one night because I was so
sunburned and this is so sheer that it
barely touched my skin and I it was like
a super chill night and I didn't know
like where we were going so I kind of
wanted to be safe with all-black I think
packing a dress like this on vacation is
important because for those unexpected
kind of like don't know who you're gonna
be with or where you're gonna go you
kind of want to go with the safe option
so I pulled out my safe option and I
used it it's cute little short baby doll
and then it's got some really cool
detail this is another one of those
dresses that's super versatile it's just
this crochet kind of multicolored dress
I ended up wearing this over my bathing
suit but you could totally wear this to
dinner you could wear this like just
walking around doing touristy things
it's kind of I mean it's pretty thick
it's like a true crochet so I don't know
if you would want to wear this like
walking around in the Sun but it was
great for is swimsuit coverup and here's
this little oh man this is super
wrinkled I washed it and let it air dry
sounds pretty wrinkled but it is just a
denim jumpsuit this is from
Anthropologie and it is a peplum top
denim jumpsuit and it's got these really
wide I know it doesn't look white cuz
it's all scrunched up but it's kind of
like a wide-leg jumpsuit this is kind of
another safe option if you don't want to
wear bright colors or prints this is
kind of safe for dressy or casual or
just kind of any any crowd you're going
to be around I think this is a really
good safe option it's really pretty with
red lipstick so I love I love this dark
denim and like a bold red lips so that
was kind of my like theme for that night
that was my pop of color was my lipstick
next I got in this dress from forever 21
and it's just a polka dot little wrap
dress and I got some white flaps to just
wear with it I never I don't think I
wore this this is great for touristy
things you know if you're going like
into the into the town and going
shopping I think this is a
good option it's comfortable it's airy
and flowy and it's light it's off the
shoulder top this is by aqua this is
from bloomingdales but I just thought
this was really really fun about these
really fun wide very wide sleeves but I
didn't I wasn't crazy about this on the
hanger but I was like oh that's probably
one of those things that will look super
cute on so I'm glad I tried it on
because I really loved this another
purchase from bloomingdales this is LM
MLM label and it is a black off the
shoulder top
with a cutout right here so it's got
this bow detail and then a cutout right
under the chest and it's got these
really pretty blue sleeves this was
really cute look just like denim sure
it's super easy good to go another top
that I got is this one off the shoulder
and I did wear this and I did vlog in
this so you guys have already seen this
but oh it is a navy and cream polka dot
top with these really pretty little gold
speckles I don't know if you can see
great with denim shorts we were kind of
by the beach having dinner and it was
kind of breezy so one arm was semi warm
and the other one was cold so it's great
for by the beach oh I love this one I
didn't get to wear this dress though I
was kind of sad this was this was the
day that I was like in bed with a fever
so I was really sad I didn't get to wear
this but how fun is this dress it is
another off the shoulder another cutout
right here such pretty colors and such a
really cute flirty silhouette I just
love this dress and I think it's like
very appropriate for vacation and just I
mean I don't know if I would wear this
in New York it's kind of bright for New
York but maybe on a trip to like LA or
something I think this would be perfect
then I got this just kind of cute little
easy low-cut black top from forever 21
and it's just like a really girly flirty
roughly low-cut top I thought this would
have been cute with like denim shorts or
a denim skirt and just like some white
flats or something
this is my favorite dress I loved this
dress I saw this in anthropology and
they were having a huge sale so it was
50% off and then another 40% off of that
and I think this was like almost $300
and I got it for I don't know I want to
say like that whatever percentage that
is was what I got it for us so fun look
at the colors it's just like this really
a big potato sack II trust with fun
colors I just loved it and it was really
great for my sunburn because it didn't
touch my body love flowy fun stuff like
this everyone was like you're wearing a
muumuu and I'm like yes I am wearing a
muumuu so proud and has pockets so you
make fun of me all you want but I've got
pockets and this I love this I actually
had in my closet that I've never really
gotten a chance to wear it's a bathing
suit cover from anthropology as well but
this brand is really cute so I just
wanted to show you perfect for Mexico in
a brighter eon it really pretty blue and
white embroidery and it is by I don't
know that that even says a brand there's
an M right there but that can't be right
I don't know I'll figure let you guys
know I'm sitting here like telling you
how great it is and I have no clue what
I'm talking about
and then I got this little top from Zara
I just thought this was so fun for
Mexico any like tropical vacation I love
that it's like a bold bold stripes and
then it's got this really cool print on
the sleeve
so I thought this was cute with some
denim shorts and it's cropped it tires
right here so I think it'd be cute with
like a fedora and some denim shorts and
like a fun bag I love this this is our
sale light I think I got this for like
five bucks I did like a quick Zara run
before we left the day before and I
found that and I was like Oh panic I'm
just gonna get it I'm glad I did all
right
then I got this bag from anthro so cute
another sale item I think I got this for
$12 but it's a really cute clutch to
carry to dinner I carried it with the
black baby doll dress and it was just a
great pop of color you can match your
lipstick to anything you can do like an
orange shade or a red shade of lipstick
and
Theisen the back I did this little
bucket bag another Zara sale item
it's like canvas and then it's got some
embroidery and some oversized tassels on
both side this bag I probably got
complimented more on vacation than
anything people were coming up to me at
the pool asking me where it was from
this one lady was like is that from
Columbia and I was like mm no I mean
maybe but I don't think so all right so
for my shoes these were two staples on
my trip I've had these for over a year
and then I saw them in this color and I
was like oh my god that's perfect so I
actually took both of these they were
the only like heels that I took and I
wore both of these so much just because
I mean a good black pair and a good
brown pair it's really all you need and
they're so comfortable to walk in I know
you guys are probably like what they are
so comfortable to walk in I could walk
all day in these and be totally fine
whoo then I've got these by Franco Sardo
and they sell this brand at Lord &amp;amp;
Taylor but they did not have this shoe I
had to order this online it runs a
little bit so I went half the size down
to the FYI yeah I thought these would be
cute in the summer with dresses and
shorts they're probably my favorite
vacation sandals they're so fun and I
got these at Target rope tie sandals but
look how fun the Rope color is impact
this job from LPA I'm not even gonna
bother showing you guys like I mean it's
just a strand of fabric I don't know
that this is something that I would wear
just like walking around New York and I
feel like this is very much a vacation
top can you guys see me walking around
with this top on in New York City it's a
vacation shop but it's really really
cute I'll just pose a picture of it
right here so you can see what it looks
like on it's just a cute little wrap top
and I really love it and I think the
color is so great
next from revolve is this dress which I
love and it's so comfortable
and I think the pattern is really pretty
- it's plaid which I've never really
seen these colors together with plaid so
this is kind of interesting but it's off
the shoulder ties in the front and then
it's got to cut out here and it's like a
mini dress and I just packed a lot of
these sort of things like a lot of
headbands
I knew we were going on the boat and
it's just so windy on the beach so
headbands were like definitely a key in
my packing I think I packed like four of
these just because you can't pack to any
head pants okay you definitely can all
right the white flats that I got and
things the Shelf tiger I did get these
15% off which is great because I can
definitely see myself wearing them a lot
during the summer time so I was really
happy that I got these I actually didn't
get to wear them in Mexico but I will
get so much use out of these just in the
summer and spring time this is probably
one of my best purchases I fell in love
with this at the store at Anthropologie
but I think it was like a hundred and
twenty-five dollars and I was like oh I
don't know for like a clutch I just
don't know so I saved it to shop tiger
at got identification when it went on
sale got another notification when it
got mugged on even further so I ended up
hanging I think like twenty five dollars
for this and let me see this is the belt
that I got from anthro so this is a
really good combo I always like brown
color things so this is like the perfect
little brown clutch it's really excited
about those aren't things for the most
part that I packed for Mexico so my
outfits if you guys are going somewhere
tropical and fun I hope this gave you
some inspiration and maybe a little
guide into helping you pack and kind of
what's back but yeah don't forget to
download shop tracker if you have
anything coming up start saving F&amp;amp;T be
happy you did when you get your size
before it sells out because once things
go on sale like they go so fast there
was actually one thing that I got
notification on shell tiger and I was
like oh I'll go back tomorrow I'm back
tomorrow sold out I was so so definitely
go give that a download and it's in the
description box below the link is I'm
glad to be back from Mexico I'm glad to
start getting back on to my regular
