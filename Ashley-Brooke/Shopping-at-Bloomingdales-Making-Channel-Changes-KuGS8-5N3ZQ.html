about to have ice cream so I called
downstairs um and got a couple of things
delivered up to the apartment and I was
like I just need a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's
non-dairy ice cream and I always hate
making them go and tell me what what
flavors they have so I said I'll just
take whatever chocolate you have and
they sent up caramel espresso which is
literally the last thing I would have
ever picked so I'm kind of excited to
try it because I would never buy it
myself so I'm always such a creature of
habit I always order at the chocolate
fudge chunk one so caramel espresso
butter rock we're starting right now
season season two of black mirror what
do you mean Oh season 4 season 4 a black
mirror we're all laying on the dog
blanket you're my spot Oh yo girl that's
not your spot hey the legs a little bare
wait how cool are you right now the
light was literally right there those of
you guys who haven't seen black mirror
about the future like if things like how
things could look in the future with
certain that can't explain it but um I
just remember out some of the episodes
had to do with like social media and
like the amount of likes you have depend
on if you can fly like first-class and
what else like the parties that you can
get into and the kind of car that you
can get it's it was that episode was
pretty crazy but I am warning you some
of the episodes are pretty graphic and
pretty like messed up so if you start it
and hate it please don't blame me
because I'm giving you a warning right
now
I told Missy to watch it and the first
episode she was like what usually every
episode is different like a different
stories well I'll let you know after
this episode
hi guys so what I just sat down and just
did my makeup because I am filming today
but I thought I would just kind of catch
up a little bit and you know catch up
see I have a few things to talk about I
really should have done this while I was
putting my makeup on because now I feel
like I'm just sitting here and I don't
know what to do with my hands a lot of
really great feedback that I got on my
latest style videos and then I have some
things to show you that I got from
Trachtenberg so what am I gonna do first
let's talk about the video the most of
you guys know I did kind of a newer
style not newer it just like changed it
up a bit got some really great feedback
and you know whether it's a good or bad
feedback is feedback sometimes the bad
feedback is even better because you know
it tells you what you need to change
maybe what you need to revisit and look
at it leaves a comment in there like I
think you don't need to do this anymore
and it gets like a hundred 200 likes I'm
like okay you're probably right
oh let's start with the Friday video
everybody seem to really love the Friday
video the step-by-step and I think I'm
actually gonna turn that into a series
because I just really liked it and I
think it's informative and I think that
you know it can we can get some really
good topics going with that so I really
liked that series this Monday video um I
got a mix of feedback like 99.5% of you
guys really loved it I had one person
say it was cheesy one person say it was
too fake which I mean come on guys
that's not that's really like not how it
is at all I had a really fun filming
environment we like turn the music up it
was just a really like fund a really fun
filming you know that's it's not fake at
all like we were genuinely having such a
good time filming and I don't know like
it it wasn't fake and I'm really sorry
that you felt that way but actually I'm
not stupid
for the cheesy part I mean I feel like
everybody's a little bit cheesy it's
just like you know not taking yourself
too seriously all the time and just
having fun with it and constructive
feedback that I got was some of you
miss the doctor portion and you know I
really was like switching it up a little
bit and I'm saving the talk-through
portion for Friday's videos some more
feedback that I got and I think a few of
you guys were missing the aspect of the
city like you missed the walking on the
streets of New York and originally the
plan was to do a mixture of both the
weather it was like seven degrees that
day so it was just I mean impossible to
film all of those outfits outside stuff
originally we wanted to do like half and
half we wanted to do some inside some
outside but it was just impossible so
just bear with me until the weather kind
of clears up and it's not you know in
the single digits outside I was so I got
I remember I was so sick in December and
I like never want to go through that
again that sucked in general I'm still
testing things out I'm still seeing like
what works and what doesn't
but what's helping me is your feedback
even if it's you know you need to change
this or I don't like this like I
appreciate that sort of feedback just as
much as I do the positive things like
positive feedback is always great you
know people letting you know they like
it and keep doing what you're doing but
what's also great is when people are
like I don't think you need to do this
but you also need to give me a reason
why like you can't just be like oh I
hate that I would really appreciate it
if you are gonna say you don't like
something to make me just give a reason
why not that I need validation I just
want to know like what direction to go
in if that makes sense I would really
appreciate that even if you want to send
it to me privately that's fine too
whatever floats your boat always seem to
get these comments on my videos about
them not being warm enough or not being
cold enough but you guys have to
understand that there are people from
all over watching these videos um like I
know there was somebody in oh my gosh
where was she and it was like negative
12 like the windshield was negative 12
and then I had someone from Phoenix
saying it's 80 degrees worth so you know
everyone's in different climates I just
I leave it up to you whether you put on
you know how many pairs of leggings
under your jeans if it's freezing or
maybe like do a lighter sweater if it's
really warm I'm just kind of showing you
like the base the basis of the outfits
and then I'm kind of leave it up to you
to work around your weather situations
what am i doing I'm just like mixing I'm
sitting here talking you guys and I just
mixed like three colors right now so I
don't know what I'm doing I need to stop
I need to stop that's why your watch I
mean everything's always linked below
but I know it is helpful to have that
little you know bar come at the top to
tell you kind of where everything is
from so I'll definitely start doing that
as well open the package is now from
Dara I Trachtenberg let's see what's
going on so we got Sally Hansen gel
polish manicure set I'm so excited I'm
gonna see if Jenna will let me do her
nails I don't think she will because
she's very particular but maybe I'll
just do it which it's not like it I'll
be like Jenna what's that over there I
can't wait to use this speaking of nails
yikes this is one of my favorite brand
so we get we got shower foam mint and
eucalyptus Dara knows that's my favorite
our foam for men Ryan you got shower
phone oh my gosh bubble bath have to be
careful where you put eucalyptus and
mint items when you're in the shower
because if you get it in the wrong spot
it is this sensation that does not go
away for a while

Brian hurt his back yesterday no the day
before at the gym I feel so bad for you
you look like you're in pain right now
are you okay hey this is like an awesome
package and I can't wait to try it this
should be doing at home gel manicure for
next vlog and then like a test to see
how long it lasts I think we should do
that oh my gosh look how cute this is
it is my dream come true to have a spa
here at the apartment I know I never
like I always tell you guys I hate
playing phone games I think they're such
a waste of time but I do have one game
on my phone that is strictly for
whenever I just get so tired of working
and I'm on the airplane and it's called
savvy spa I've been playing it for like
how long have I been playing that game
for like five years and you basically
run your own spa and I got my sisters
hooked on it and we all like have our
spas that we run and you make money and
you have to help your customers and like
you can't piss them off you can't make
them wait or they don't tip you or
they'll just leave and then you don't
get their money so I feel like a real
lifestyle a spa can I do your nails all
right I am gonna go I gotta go find
somewhere to put all this stuff I'm so
excited but I will see you guys in my
next vlog thank you for listening to me
ramble on about just like updates and
new stuff I don't even know if you guys

Sunday's video back to three videos a
week it was it was a
nice little break that I had and I
appreciate you guys are hanging in there

blogging or youtubing space you know
like sometimes you just get so bored
