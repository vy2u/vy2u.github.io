out of Styles this week because I'm
going to be gone for Christmas so I'm
gonna have them shot and ready to go so
I'm not filming when I'm trying to spend
time with my family but a couple of
stores thinking um Zara Bloomingdale's
brandy melville mini ain't it it was
real
lots of good stuff right and I really
need to come down here more I forget how
much I love so I think I just worked
here for so long that I'm length was
over it for the long time
back from my adventures in Soho all
right I got us some soups
I'm soup yeah to go with our sandwiches
and don't worry there's nothing else in
here what is it don't worry about it is
it filled with sugar are you ready oh
are you ready I saw it and I like hmm
Pathan by composite buy okay so we got
two packages I'm gonna open this one
first because I know what it is you go
here's your sugar-free vanilla yes so
you can stop crying about it as it
should have been
oh thank you you're welcome
page number two mystery package you just
cut yourself yeah yeah you're not
supposed to do it that way why did you
do that
way to go so here's a lesson never do
this you do this no that's still no you
have to hold their box
it's a box in a box oh no it's one of
these oh you're not good with you wait
wait oh that didn't take you long
oh my gosh this is like a dream come
true
pentane makes mini bottles Shampoo oh
that's for sure not shampoo yeah that's
alcohol-free hairspray what was I just
saying yeah no what was I just saying
the other day but I needed hairspray
obviously hair and protect this is ah
amazing you know what's so perfect that
they sent me this because literally
almost out of
my conditioner this is smooth and sleek
I've never tried the repair and protect
so I'm going to give this a whirl I
don't even know this existed actually
what's good that they sent me a
different one because I've literally
been using the smooth and sleek for like
years I don't know about you guys but I
feel like my hair gets so used to a
certain shampoo so I always like to keep
Pantene and rotation with like my John
Frieda my theory my living proof so
those are pretty much my four staple
shampoo and conditioners because I do
feel like my hair gets used to a certain
kind but the good thing about Pantene is
that they have so many different um you
want to say flavors what I own yeah
flavors so many different Oh Heinz four
different flavors oh you know my
favorite is this kind oh just about to
say my favorite Pantene chocolate that's
so nice thank you guys so much for doing
this here is lunch I decided to nix the
sandwich because I forgot I got a giant
piece of cornbread so dark and cloudy
today you can't see anything in the
apartment Suns kind of coming through
back here though I'm going to wash my
makeup brushes start getting really
dirty and I'm going to also put a cup re
coconut oil mask on
just put my coconut oil mask on and then
I put a little self-tanner on

is so pale so I put some tanning stuff
on hopefully it'll make me look like I'm
a real person right now I'm going to go
pull some outfits for we're shooting two
out of styles in the next two days all
right so I've been working for about an
hour trying to put together outfits for
the next two have styles and this is
what we've got so far so much easier to
film them here in New York than in Texas
because otherwise I would have to pack
all of that in an extra suitcase and
that is not fun I should let Ryan just
take over for the rest of the night so
hey there we're all watching see you

everyone's off the elevator we're safe
come here look how cute our workout
stuff is together all right
it's up but in like technology form
that's a kid it's all set up like that
but if it was really maybe more like in
mine would be like daring organized and
like very much set up for an Instagram
post at any moment here's this like dirt
do stir dinner tonight is sandwiches and
soup
it's Monday the day after Sunday when
Walking Dead airs and we missed it
we missed Walking Dead I don't even know
who we are right now pretty disappointed
in us me too
we'll be watching a lot of worse world
knocked over I've got two episodes left
to Westworld you know I told you guys
that I was partnering up with an app
like a fitness slash a healthy living
app you're making a meal you can put all
of your ingredients in and it tracks
exactly what you're eating is a scanner
on it where you scan each product I'm
like obsessed with scanning I hope you
guys a part of the app My Fitness Pal
it's kind of like that but it's better
because it has more features let's see
so I'm adding dinner you can scan hold
on I gotta show you with scanning
everything
you just put how many servings you're
having and then you add it to your
dinner scanning everything Ryan used
MyFitnessPal for a long time or dude but
this is better you think very it's easy
to look at everything's bigger honestly
as you get older your eyes kind of like
fade she uses glasses to read so that's
yeah I'll take sharpie
you can easily track your water intake
it's very visual working on this really
cool video that kind of explains
everything just wanted to give my
vlogmas special little heads-up
it's the app is free to download but
there are like in-app purchases like a
premium membership type thing don't get
the Premium Membership yet cuz I'm going
to do a discount code when I post the
video did I scan this I wouldn't
consider it cheating on halo top but
we're definitely going after in the
light and ice cream as well I had a
couple pointers before they are pretty
pretty good so 100 calories in this one
for the whole plane 90 in this one 4
grams of sugar that's crazy yeah I was
searching for the remote and I left this
here because it's your job to clean
stuff I left this here and I was trying
to find the remote just digging through
I see this little friend you might
remember this from yesterday's vlog
where Ashley pop the champagne after you
know 8 minutes of trying what should I
do with this dough do you wanna um throw
away guess that would make sense yeah
cheers Cheers all of you guys who are
snapchatting me I Love You Man clips
right and I are like cracking up because
I'm so funny the next two videos that
you're gonna see on my how to style
series is or are really how to sound
serious
yeah you're right my mom would kill me
for that one my mom's an English teacher
sorry mom
how to style coats which I know you're
excited about and how to style prints
for winter one just commented
that she wishes I would style prints and
I was like what read my mind girl
the next challenge we do I think should
be the whisper challenge I've been
seeing a lot of requests for it ask me
if I'm wrong but the whisper challenge
has two people one person puts
headphones on with blasting music and
the other person says the sentence and
the person with headphones on has to
guess what that person says feel like we
do that already like maybe we did it
earlier actually did we did that earlier
not even thinking about it we do do that
it's not a challenge slight alright well
we'll do it for YouTube purposes you
comfortable hahaha
you know I sometimes get in a weird
position sometimes I'll go in the
bedroom
and like Ryan's like halfway between the
bed and the floor sometimes especially
if I'm in gym clothes I don't like to
sit on furniture if I'm sweaty so I'll
just kind of like kissing the on the
ground and then land against it you got
a you got to do it now say what you
practice Hey so we'll see you guys in
our next vlog nope no that's terrible
okay so we'll see you in our next vlog
perfect
I see all fixed yah so now we're going
to use this this box and as you can see
there's two smaller boxes inside of it
with color just over your cheekbones and
then back to punching yourself in the
face because you can also get an arm
