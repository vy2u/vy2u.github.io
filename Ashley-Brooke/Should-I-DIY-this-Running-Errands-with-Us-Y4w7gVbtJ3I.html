settlement was about it happy Sunday
I'll tell you how lazy this weekend has
been yesterday it poured rain from the
time we woke up to the time you went to
sleep like corn all day hey don't think
I got up from the couch I've been
watched council cards like I've never
been watched anything before in my life
it was amazing
feel like you need that every now and
then to just kind of catch potato all
day Haven hen and ice it's been like
raining on and off a little bit but I've
been working on a project for my hallway
this is what it's looking like don't
worry don't worry I'll show you once
done but it's the end of the day and
we've just kind of been like it was like
a cleaning day you know those days where
you wash all the sheets all the towels
laundry
you know like mop all of that so today's
been pretty much that in a pretty good
weekend time to start making dinner and
I gotta show you something if I told you
guys this in the last blog I might have
but I might have forgotten so Ryan and I
are trying out blue apron and I'm so
excited I sponsored this part of the
video but I was really really excited
because you guys know how much I love
cooking and you know our grocery store
here is either so expensive and or they
just don't have what I'm looking for
when it comes to like making dinner
because it's such a small store so this
was really cool getting everything
delivered super fresh ingredients right
to my doorstep before I get started of
course your guys up with a discount code
so the first 50 50 subscribers who go
and sign up for blue apron will get the
first three meals off to their first
order for free so let's definitely go
sign up I'm so excited to start cooking
so let's get started then a refrigerated
packet so all of your stuff stays fresh
with
inside of it obviously right and I
thought be to the two-person plan you
can get a family planner into you person
which is nice because then you don't get
too much food so let's open it up
YUM Tabata rolls how cute is this these
are your knickknacks I can't wait to see
what's in here
here are the recipe cards but it comes
with so this is what we are making
tonight spicy pepper and ricotta
calzones obviously we're going to nix
the ricotta because of the whole you
know not eating meat dairy how good does
that look
I'm super excited really hope that my
looks like this is what you know all of
your ingredients are this is the recipe
and then this is a instructions right
here on the back pictures and everything
right hold on I just solved this other
recipe and now I'm torn sugar snap pea
