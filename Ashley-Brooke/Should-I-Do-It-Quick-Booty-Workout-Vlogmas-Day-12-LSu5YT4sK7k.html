filthy animal morning guys
I have just sat down to get myself ready
for the day today we have two shoots no
video shoots we just have River Island
I'm gonna shoot that really pretty pearl
gold detail sweater and then we are
shooting a Topshop the outfit that I
picked out yesterday at my personal
shopping appointment trying to stay nice
and layered shooting outside and New
York gets very cold so you have to be
kind of practical when you're picking
out these outfits you know oh you
thought but first I'm gonna put my
makeup on and you guys assumed you were
wanting to see my makeup cases and where
they're from and all the info on that so
I will show you that really quick
me too makeup cases are from Target and
they are blue this really teal blue
velvet and then here is the big one so I
like this because it holds my brushes in
this side and then my makeup right here
also got the floral as well because it
kind of it's not obviously it's not the
same it's like floral but it still plays
on the colors the color scheme so you
have kind of a nice little solid and
print makeup set and I also have like
the travel set too which is great but
they're from Target well I will link
them in the description box if I can
find them time to get started
and maybe some feedback in personal
stories if you guys can relate to this
but I hope you remember this but back in
June was going to get my eyebrows micro
blade it made the appointment in Texas
but I just kind of ran out of time my
mom and I were gonna go and I didn't end
up getting them done but an opportunity
has come about where I can get them done
here's the thing with my eyebrows like I
have like these are my natural eyebrows
this this with nothing on them and I
have pretty I don't know not thick but
pretty filled out pretty filled out
eyebrows so I was just wondering any of
you guys out there who have kind of my
style of eyebrow that's filled out but
still kind of like patchy in areas have
you guys ever gotten the micro bladed
and what do you suggest for someone like
this with my situation sometimes I go
back and look at my videos and I'm doing
my eyebrows and I'm like oh yeah these
are good and then I see a picture of
myself from that day or a video from
that day and I'm like oh my god Ashley
like you'd Co completely overfilled them
or you like missed a spot or this one's
like higher I don't know I do cuz I do
my makeup in the morning after my coffee
and my hands like this what I'm trying
to put them on I don't know anyways off
topic I would love your advice and your
feedback on what you guys think I should
do let me do one and then show you what
the difference
here is the difference between filled in
and not filled in so obviously this one
just kind of defines my natural shape a
little bit more and then it's a little
bit darker it did get that microbe
Leonid I would probably go a little bit
lighter than this although this matches
my natural hair color and this also
looks better when I have like a full
face of makeup on I know it kind of
looks like it's sticking out without
makeup like a makeup on but I feel like
it matches when everything else is on so
I don't know you guys tell me alright I
just finished my hair and my makeup my
hair is a little dirty so I'm probably
going to wear a hat today for the shoot
and definitely wash it tonight I just
didn't want to wash it today because
it's really rainy and gross today so I
just figured it's probably gonna get wet
and frizzy Ryan is hard at work right
now what are you working on your time in
accounts what would I do without you
alright while I wait on Ryan to finish
up with our retirement stuff I'm going
to make some lunch
I'm not quite sure these because it's my
first time having them but I'm gonna put
them on a salad because when in doubt I
put just anything on a salad so this is
what we've got and they look delish
you could either boil them or sautee
them so I decided to sit here and like
crispy things so I like to like semi
char anything I can yeah polish they're
so delicious oh my gosh have like nine
more beets on the bridge boys tell me
what your favorite recipe is how you
make these oh so you like them they're
so good we're gonna go stuff my face in
private okay
always craving something sweet after I
eat so I'm gonna dig into our protein
bar bold this is my we keep all of our
protein bars so this isn't a protein bar
but I like when I see the toasted
coconut I don't know if we're gonna be
able to shoot two looks today because
it's lookin pretty rainy pretty dark out
and you can't have chocolate that'll
make your tummy very hurt all right mmm
I'm still waiting on Ryan and I'm on
protein bar number two this actually my
right now one of my favorite bars brah
Rev glow Jenna and I call them the wet
bar because they have peanut oil on them
so they're so slippery like they'll
literally slip out of your hand
funny because whenever I'm at Whole
Foods and I reached my hand into the box
to like grab a handful my hand comes out
oily wet it's so weirdest thing I guess
some of them leak the peanut oil but
they are so good they lovin grams of
protein 13 grams of fiber and
only two grams of sugar and they taste
like peanut butter fudge all right
here's the Topshop outfit so I started
with this hat then I did just some
layering pieces my plain black top and
my plain black jeans and I did this
little camo snap jacket and then this
faux fur little cropped jacket which I
love this jacket and then my first
shearling the bag okay try not to throw
my keys away we only have one set try
not to throw my cube away we're going
back to the apartment we both forgot our
wallets and we need to go to the store
we need Stella's treats her favorite
treats we ran out and sanitary products
we should get um some avocado oil like
everybody said stop using olive oil and
I have an idea of what this blog title
should be what job top top top what
I totally don't get it
remember that song no Brian I was so
confused one make but I'm crying right
now
I'm so confused why why I don't
understand you've never heard that song
before I grabbed my wallet and not you
were diapers - it gets really really
weird sometimes
set it like the cadence of his song now
to gotten it
all that's going in
pretty good
right the five goodbye
all right so we're all too
rush with the groceries
they have the go veggie which I really
like but they also have all of these all
your hearts which are also very good I
already grabbed this freaky you for
doing taco salad tonight so avocado is a
must
avocados are usually $4.99 there 249
today this is great news
so Ryan's filling out the form of shame
from throwing his keys away yesterday
quick workout hopefully quick because I
still have a lot to do today today
spurred me how love just freaks me down
come inside like when she leaves to
slowly lift the ground have you come
like a wine key to chasten
let me like you too soon so we can learn
babies right away maybe I regret you
will not regarded me the Sun burning
love go sweet John that one child this
world starting wrong cause it's just
manually
just got done at the gym that is my
third workout since I had that cold flu
and I must say I feel a lot better
getting back into shape man you know bad
spell of a cold or flu really puts you
out for a while in the gym but I'm done
I am so tired right now my body hurts
but I'm gonna go shower wash my hair all
that stuff and I will see you guys for
dinner taco salad night hi guys excuse
my wild mane right now we are in the
process of air drying so we're a little
crazy right now I'm about to start the
taco salad and we're gonna do the usual
suspects plus the Beast burger on top
and it's been working so hard he hasn't
left this spot like since I went to the
gym hours ago but I love you
we can
and they keep building together now
we're strong I'm questioning the truth
we'll break your chains we have the key
your eyes and see
please ignore the mess but we caught a
bed of lettuce with a side of avocado
beefs burger with melted pepper jack
some chips some beans some salsa and
then for the drink we've got some rose a
kombucha hey guys welcome to answering
comments the taco salad was a great
thanks for asking I also want to give a
shout out to this cup from Target
it says hello sugar on it and pour my
ice water in this cup at night and wake
up and it is still full chunks of ice
that's how good this cup is so this is
my nighttime cup that I put my nighttime
liquids what is your go-to lipstick
these days hmm I really been loving salt
life by tart still that's just one of my
all-time favorite colors because it's
got like a hint of gray in it and I like
cool tones but there have been three lip
liners that I've just been kind of
rotating and then filling in with a nude
I don't even know who makes them or the
color but if I remember tomorrow I will
let you know she's the man reference for
the win Emily I think you're the only
person that got my she's the man
reference it's literally one of my
favorite movies it is the like one of my
best friend Sam you guys have met her
before
every time we're together we watched
that movie and just like laugh our butts
off it's so funny what is your favorite
place to buy home things I really love
Target like I could probably furnish my
whole entire space with target target
West Elm cb2 and then I love places like
home goods do for my bigger items like
my big furniture I would definitely do
like West Elm or cb2 for all of the
decor and everything I feel like Target
has just the best the best home decor
and like bigger bigger decor pieces like
this mirrors from West all of my mirrors
are from West all motherlode is cheat
for Sims bonus book I'm not hearing
cheat codes for sale
this is just what its gonna have to be
because this I can't get to but the
odorant do you use I've been trying to
find a good natural deodorant I use la
vanilla the yellow one Elena said on her
very first shift at Starbucks she was
cleaning the toilet and dropped the keys
in the toilet mid flush and they you
feel my pain I'll tell her you it's hard
to tell in your video I am five five
have you ever heard of credo it's like a
Sephora but all the brands are cruelty
free and a lot are vegan there's a store
on prints and they ship what I'm
obsessed with the black and throw hobo
but I can't find it online do you mind
telling me the name of the designer
there's literally no designer name in
the bag I even turned it inside out and
looked everywhere it literally just says
anthropology on the tag I'm so confused
boy oh this is so funny did you know the
man that's walking with you guys through
Times Square if not he was staged by
creeping in the background that was
Ryan's dad how are you not cold in those
leggings so if any of you guys own faux
leather leggings you know that they are
probably warmer than wearing three pairs
of jeans on top of each other there is
no wind and no cold getting through faux
leather leggings and my H&amp;amp;M ones are
probably the warmest ones I've ever
owned in my life I've always wanted to
move to New York one day and your blocks
make me want to do it even more it might
be a little hard coming from New Zealand
but I'm determined right and I actually
have friends that live here in the city
that are from New Zealand where has how
to style gone so how to style hasn't
really gone anywhere it just took a
small break we were gonna film that how
to style that one day then all that snow
came and it was just impossible to film
that day so we had to take a pause on
that but don't worry don't worry it's
coming back we just had to we couldn't
film that day where is your small pot in
the kitchen for uh it is from Urban
Outfitters you have my favorite vodka
from Iceland I tried it for the first
time when I stayed with my fiance in his
family six months last year where did
you buy it
yes it is vodka it's like water
sure
it says vodka on the front of it where I
thought it was water when why you didn't
take a huge slew of it - how does it
feel to be a fake vegan and a bad mom
yeah those this ie packets come in an
unsweetened version for less sugar I
know I've gotten them before and they
just do don't taste as good I want to
call this sugar get this question may be
hard for you to answer
do you have blogs or blogs particularly
love in your lbh community I'd love to
see you promoting some of the girls in
life by her I get that there may be too
much fabulous and is for you to promote
the mall yeah honestly every single
person that has a blog or a YouTube
channel on the life of our community
it's just so good everyone is like
next-level in that group I would just
feel like I can't promote one or two
people without promoting the rest of
them and there are so many and it's
almost like having to choose your
favorite child I just I love all the
girls and I love all of them there are
blogs and their YouTube videos on
Thursdays we have a thread and it's
called this is me Thursday and every
Thursday in the thread everyone posts
their latest YouTube channel their
latest blog post something that they've
created so that's so we get to promote
ourselves within in the group which is
is really nice I think because then
that's a really good way to get to know
each other and see how everyone's
creativity is so different it's really
cool here's the comment from MSL 5 what
is your name I always see you comment
and I always like see this what is your
real name so I can I talk to you if you
don't want to tell me that's why I was
just wondering so that I'm a
touchy-feely smeller in my videos and
she's the same way yeah when I see like
flowers or something with texture I
always want to touch it and feel it and
to totally me you totally call me up
that you guys should watch the holiday
and Love Actually movies I have to watch
every holiday season do you have any
must-see holiday movies the holiday is
definitely
one of my favorites my other favorites
is the family stone that is a just one
of my leg go to must-see Christmas
movies freaking loves Christmas movies
alright let's talk about it well the
holiday the holiday so you agree the
family stone I just yes I did it's like
Uncle Phil no you can't do this family
stone has been one of my favorites for
like years like before I was born
how do you get your b12 that is my main
issue when I'm full vegan so I take a
spray b12 and I just get it on Amazon
and it seems like also other people not
that I'm reading the comments everyone
else says the same thing they have a
spray but I have low b12
I even had low b12 when I got blood work
done like two like a year and a half
before I cut out meat and dairy so I
just normally have really low levels but
I used to spray and I don't notice the
difference but I also feel like I don't
have low energy so you and Ryan got
married okay I see confusion no I think
what happened was we finally figured it
out that in my description box of the
last video I said does anyone else's
husband give them a hard time but I
meant to put husband slash significant
other and I guess I just completely
forgot to put this thing to pick another
part so the people thought Ryan I had
just like gotten married I guess I loved
this after the kids go to school I stay
with my morning coffee and watchable
Aguas that's how cool I'm glad that I
get to be a part of your morning your
team that's always really cool when you
tell me that you're a part of I'm a part
of your morning or your night routine I
really love that yes Ryan is a lot like
my husband quiet and humble that is very
much described Ryan you eat meat
sometimes no I don't Peter is adorable
he looks so nice Peter is
so adorable you just say Peters adorable
suppose the best
oh yeah Peter is the best Ryan's got RBF
and you have our BV so true
live in Santa Barbara and have had to be
away from home for the past five days
due to the fire so I feel festive
vicariously through your vlogs even when
it's 80 degrees where I am oh you know
Kristina I'm so sorry that you're having
to deal with that that is so unfortunate
and it's so scary when something like
that is out of your control and it kicks
you out of your home and you don't know
when you get to go back so my heart goes
out to you and I really hope that you
get to go back home soon especially
around the holidays not being able to be
home and just feel that warmth of being
home just really makes me sad for you so
I really hope that um I really hope that
things get better for you curious if
you're still using Invisalign um I've
actually have been done with Invisalign
for like four years have to wear my
retainer at night but yeah I liked I
like I mean I didn't like it but you
know what every time I first be on meat
burger tonight kind of reminded me of
cat food when I was cooking it but it
did not disappoint you know what as long
as it didn't disappoint that's all that
matters do you ever look back at any old
how to style videos and cringe at the
outfits you put together um I mean I
guess it's kind of like when you look at
a picture of yourself from middle school
and you're like why did I wear that but
at the time it was trendy and super cool
and I guess even from last year when I
was doing how to style the trends have
changed and like some things are yes the
answer is yes I remember Ryan putting me
balls in everything in every dinner last
vlogmas oh yeah everything was a
freaking meatball Fez when is Ryan going
to propose is this something you guys
might see happening in the future yeah
honestly I mean it's something we
definitely talk about but you know with
us living in New York
when we do get married one day it will
definitely be in Texas because that's
where all of our friends and family are
so I don't know I just feel like right
now planning a wedding in Texas just
kind of seems like a lot so you know if
it were to happen we would just kind of
have to take it slow and do the planning
process slowly but Kurt Russell and Oh
Goldie Hawn that's who Ryan and I are
gonna be we're just dating our whole
lives we're just waiting for for the
right time obviously if you were to ask
me today or tomorrow I would say yes
happily but just answering our question
why we aren't married and we've been
together for so long we just have there
are so many other things that we want to
accomplish before we plan you know a
whole year to plan out a wedding do a
video on how you how strayed Luna and
how she's doing a lunar routine please I
think she means Stella um oh but you
know you know what Nancy why I
appreciate how confident you were in
that comment
Smyly based on everything that's gonna
be Stella's a new nickname Luna give me
here silly Luna she's sleeping all right
my camera is getting hot I'm getting the
the camera is too hot signal it's the
only thing that sucks about this camera
is that it gets hot so quickly but I did
not answer comments yesterday because I
posted the videos so late so I really
didn't have time for like a ton of
comments to come in all right so I'm
gonna go I'm gonna go catch up on a
little bit of work watch a little TV and
then good sleep and I'll see you guys
