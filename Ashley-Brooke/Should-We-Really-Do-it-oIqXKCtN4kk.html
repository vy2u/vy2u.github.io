going on today we've already gotten in
about four serious fights almost kill
each other this was so stressful and I
just put hanoks up on so I'm like
probably ruining my tan because it's
trying to develop and I'm trying to help
this joker ping
I put painting stuff on me this morning
and I did Ryan's last night because I
don't know I'm trying to test out
different tanning lotions and he and I
have such different skin tones that I
want to see what it looks like Ryan
how's Ryan oh yeah the girl is coming to
pick up the couch this morning so we're
trying to take it apart and get it ready
for her
pliny is dying that's another issue that
I can't talk about right now all right
so the couch is gone what is going on
it's so weird we are going to run to
Starbucks I'm wearing overalls Pink
Floyd t-shirt black cardigan and my
slide I really match he and Yeol was so
nice and he actually helped us move so
we're going to grab him a coffee at
Starbucks and that time is on the clock
yeah Daniel awesome you are going to go
run a Starbucks really quickly whoa come
back so doe echo little or no echo II
go
I lovely we talked about how and we
always do this you talk about comments
on videos like in the last type of style
that overall fit there was somebody that
was like I love all of them with that
laughing was just terrible
I gave you guys a warning I was like not
everyone is going to like the steel rods
open one day over all I do is a kid
yeah some people's a stowaway cosign
you wake me with kisses
you made my head I'm not wearing makeup
they have the perfect you'll come down
your men don't ever wanna meet
I am so bronzed right now I still need
to rinse the tanning stuff off so it's
not going to be late to start I don't
know how dark it looks in the screen but
looking at myself right here in my very
dark
I like it just wanted to show you guys
what Tarte sent me look how nice this is
and then they sent me all these goodies
if you guys recognize any of these
products let me know how you like them
sometime this next week I'm going to go
visit them at their office here in New
York so that should be really fun I'm so
excited and Ryan I'm going to try to
take Ryan with me so he can film so you
guys can see what their office looks
like I really hope they let me film in
there because I would love to kind of
share that with you and show you what it
looks like so that's just showed you all
the cool stuff that she just got they're
not the only one to get to pull stuff I
just got a box let's open
ha wait hold Mego
look at that tape a lot I have a
question to you for the Sonny's weight
did you remember to get a tape dispenser
we don't need one
you didn't get a piece where you put
this in intake yeah we got to take them
and we've got the one that you use okay
so my pan has taken on a whole new level
of caring I cannot wait to rinse my body
as you guys know it is the weekend
before the light by her book book goes
out so I am banned to my apartment
that's all right thanks Bantu boom sound
- so I miss to tell you about this
earlier but I completely forgot so I
think fry and I are going to go on a
Whole Foods plant-based diet that's your
a lot of scientific research think we're
just going to kind of test this out
because they've just been reading a lot
of case studies and documentaries and
just like evidence behind you know why a
whole food plant-based diet it's just so
much more healthy for you so we're gonna
try it out we'll let you know how it
goes
but uh starting today yep I think we
just have a little bit more research to
do before we you know fully make like a
grocery list and all of that you know
how it goes all right back to work I
cannot wait to rinse this off so morning
guys it is Sunday and I love to do today
I have to finish me how to style segment
that goes live to day yes I have puts it
off to today so I'm going to get ready
into that and I have got all of these
amazing tort products that tart sent me
yesterday so I'm going to do a full
basis makeup in tart because it's all
sitting here and it looks so pretty and
I like cannot wait to use it
and then I have to switch out my plant
pot my new plan Olivia because I'm
pretty sure she's dying her leaves are
getting crispy at the end
I sent a photo of her to my grandmother
who is an amazing gardener and she said
that the pot is too small for the pan so
we're going to do a little pot switching
and who you can't see right now it just
says that that's nature that plants die
not acceptable right let's start getting
ready
in my control
poor ignorant you're intoxicated
forestry and artistic change like in
dream involuntary statement once it's
over you can make the crass people and I
guess we are about to publish today how
to style the storm line how to style
casual weekend wear and I told you guys
in the video that I'm going to be taking
a poll so here we are going to sit on
the floor be like instead of how to
style skinny jeans or how to file next
card it's going to be just like a weekly
roundup of all of the outfits that I
wore this entire week
and I just think that it would be more
appealing and more beneficial because
it's like a variety of all different
kinds of things rather than speaking
rather than speaking to one certain
theme so you might get skinny jeans one
for one look and then a skirt and then a
dress and then a date night and then a
more dressy you know staying in your
fields they'll get links you'll still
get like cool music I just think it's
going to be really cool so I will put a
poll I think there's a poll option in
YouTube to go vote and let me know what
you guys are thinking if you want to
test this out and see what it looks like
even and like I said in the how to style
you know if you guys hate it and you're
like no go back to how to style go back
to the way it was and we can definitely
go back but I think it's good to explore
options and I'm not saying I'm going to
get rid of that how to style series
completely I just think that mixing it
up and doing something different would
be really cool so maybe stick with the
how to style you know once a month and
make it be something good okay
so first I'm going to get a towel so the
dirt doesn't get
okay so we are going to go to I can go
to the hardware store down the street
and I'm sure they sell oil so we I don't
get that
can you remember where that hardware
store is nice
so tonight for dinner we're making vegan
black bean burger super Krista oh yeah
we are having some trouble though on
dessert yes we are like vegan and
flourless there yes
holy they come with the blue light
oh hey queer where you going the diet is
really making it hard to grocery shop
yes just ate a little leftovers from
last night because I just ordered a food
processor and it is not here yet and I
cannot wait to eat something what we got
because why
oh my gosh it's huge okay we are making
black bean burgers
if bread of the sprouted variety
multigrain sprouted pretty sure that
means good how are we looking you derrin
good because we're certainly smelling
good it is not that I honestly do yes
eating healthier lots more plant-based
whole food eating less dairy / meat
eating nothing artificial well try our
best for nothing artificial but no dairy
no meat we find with no dairy no meat
I'm not a big meteor anyways like I'll
be fine without me
but it's like
Gary so hard to get around no cheese no
cheese no milk pretty much only if I
don't really like milk but um cheese
eggs and eggs no ice cream
ah yeah though hey laptop we were at the
store we were at sunic earlier and this
girl was talking to our friends there by
the ice cream and she looks like zebra
tries to handless help I've never tried
you look up and I wanted to be like I've
tried table top but guess what I can't
have it tonight we're making healthy ice
cream tonight we are freezing some
bananas and some dates and we're going
to blend that up and put some cacao
powder and pop it with pecans and
coconut like all about that all about it
so official report then black bean
burgers are the and now we're going
to get aggressive with the evening we
are making ice cream so we've got frozen
bananas frozen dates
Medlen that up frozen Anna frozen date
really problem yeah and shop oh yeah we
should do peanut butter if you just burn
um a while ago I was putting something
in the blender and then I left the spoon
in the blender what the spooning the
blizzard this is like a place smoothie
Bowl texture I cook it here making an
insightful but that's because they
didn't let the bananas completely freeze
all the way we just put the bananas in
the freezer like a few hours ago but if
you freeze bananas and then blend them
up they have a consistency of actual ice
frozen bananas
little bit of frozen strawberries cacao
powder tops lip pecans almond butter
