I am Ashley Brooke for those of you who
this is your first time and this is one
of my fashion Friday videos and in
today's video we are talking about
talking about ankle boots sock boots
printed boots over the knee boots just
in general all different kinds of boots
we are going to be talking about what to
wear with your boots what not to wear
with your booty hey telling you guys
what not to wear was something because
style is really help you project
yourself out into the world so I hate
telling people you know you shouldn't
wear this with this this is just kind of
my guide my tips and tricks on how I
like to style boots so take you with the
grain of salt if it's not your thing
then you do your thing even if it's
something that I say you shouldn't do
who cares it's your style into your
roles this is my guide to how I like to
wear boots during the winter and even
even spring and summer there are some
options in this video for those of you
guys are having a very warm winter which
I know a lot of you are keep that in my
- and you're watching this there are
some skirt options if you're in New York
City obviously that is not for you
unless you are brave enough to wear
tights right now but yeah let's go ahead
and get right into the styling so the
first food we're going to talk about
it's the combat suit I didn't want
something with a bunch of studs but I
wanted something that had a little bit
extra detail so I went with this one
from Zara with it has like a it has like
a really subtle gunmetal chain down the
front of it what you don't want to wear
a combat boot with is a pair of cropped
culottes culottes are cropped so I'm
gonna retract that statement and just go
with culottes you don't want to wear
these with culottes as you can see it
just does not go together it gives off
kind of a stumpy effect and it almost
just looks kind of silly but you do want
to wear the combat boot with is a nice
pair of skinny jeans you can do skinny
jeans you can do leggings either one of
those works for if you're like me I do
like to pair my combat boots with a
dress now I know it is winter but for
you guys does mormor climates and just
kind of moving forward into different
seasons I love doing a combat boot with
the dress I love mixing the edgy and the
girly in the right way so the next shoe
we have is the sock boots
I love these soft booties I don't like a
soft bootie to go super high because
then it kind of it makes my legs look
like
my brother's like my little brother and
I have the same leg when I wear a higher
sock booty it's not a good moment for me
I like to wear soft booties with pretty
much anything even when you need just
like a subtle shoe and you don't want
any fuss going on you just kind of want
a simple little pointy toe sleek black
boot sticking out I like these you also
want to pair these with your culottes I
know we were talking about culottes and
look in the previous look so this is
something that you can work a lot with
want to make sure that your booty is
tight to your ankle that way it shows
that you have an ankle because a blue
lot is so wide that you need that shoe
that kind of hugs her ankle and shows
everybody that your ankle does exist
somewhere deep down inside your shoe the
next thing called booty I have is the
white booty I love white booties and I
get so many questions on my opinions and
tips and tricks on styling these guys my
pair is patent and they are a Jeffrey
Campbell and I don't wear these a whole
lot but not a bootie that you just like
go to and grab all the time like you
would just a basic black ankle bootie do
you say wear these with lighter colored
denim and denim overall I think white
and denim just go so well together no
rules when it comes to white boots I
just think they're fun and cool when you
first put them on you're kind of like
whoa when you look at my outfit you see
all like my white boots to get around
not I try not to wear them with all
black I don't mind it that's just not my
first to go to it so I don't really want
to say that's a don't because I think
all black just looks so chic no matter
what you do just try to make sure that
your bag maybe has a little bit of white
and then the next boot we're gonna talk
about is a colored and of course I pick
red because I love a good red boot just
like such a nice pop of color and I love
to kind of pair with the red lip when it
comes to styling a red boot there's a
fine line between do's and dont's
because again kind of like the white you
want to have fun with it I'm a red boot
I mean it's got to be fun it's going to
be fun even if you don't want it to be
so I say do you pair this with classic
colors paired with neutrals you can even
pair it with a print make sure that it's
neutral and that it's toned down for the
dose you want to make sure you're having
fun with your outfit but also kind of
keep
toned down a little bit of color goes a
long way so don't let the color of your
boot dictate your whole entire outfit so
for the next food we are gonna talk
about printed boots there we go boots no
printed boots are a great way to show
that I'm having fun with my outfit they
want to make sure that you are styling
these in its color story it would
probably pair this with a lighter pink
top again it really doesn't matter like
what color your bottom you're wearing
just as long as it kind of ties into the
color story of this boot you can wear
dark denim with this you could wear
light denim it comes to don't so make
sure that you are styling this with its
own color story so with this boot I
probably wouldn't hair like a burnt
orange with it I would definitely try to
stay within the color story of the boot
all right so we're gonna work our way a
little bit up towards the leg with the
mini boots it's not a mini boot let me
start over
first we're gonna work our way a little
bit more up leg with a knee boot I
absolutely love these boots okay I'm not
gonna say that in obviously I love
living is they're mine
they are a wide shaft boot look really
great with skinny jeans so that is kind
of like my first go-to is a skinnier
slimmer pan anything with a wide shaft
you want to make sure you're wearing
with a slimmer any just over the knee
boot knee boot or mid-calf boot you want
to wear with the skinny pant like no
matter what even if it's leggings and
you want to wear a tunic with it even
like tights is great but I would
definitely stick with a skinnier bottom
100% I also love this boot or with a
midi dress even though you're not
showing leg you can still see that
you're wearing an actual boot under it
and also do this with the shorter dress
or a shorter skirt especially if you're
in a warmer climate if not you can
always put some tights on you don't want
to pair these with our straight leg
jeans just kind of look like you shoved
so much material and it just doesn't
look right
so when you are wearing these with pants
stick to something that's a slimmer on
the bottom so my next food is a
over-the-knee boot I should not be doing
that these were very expensive hardly
ever wear them because I never want to
get them dirty
anyways these are my over the knees
stretch suede boots they're just a
classic they are a favorite the wide
shaft boot is a little bit modern in
trendy but this boot is definitely
something a little bit more classic I
know we'll be on trend for every single
winter and fall so this was a great
investment and I'm really happy that I
got these again obviously a do for this
is a skinny pant especially these
because they do go up so high so you
want to make sure that you're doing a
legging or a skinny jean and since these
are a tighter stretch suede if I would
be careful what denim I wore them with
you don't want to denim that has a thick
seam at the bottom because it will show
through the boot and give you this weird
lump effect the bottom another do for
this guy is a shorter dress or a shorter
skirt because you do get that little
bitty peep of skin on your thigh and I
think that's not only sexy but like very
chic at the same time depending on how
you style it I think with an oversized
blazer it would look so nice for my next
ankle boot we have this Western ish
looking boot and this is kind of like an
Isabel Marant dupe that I got from Steve
Madden with the sticker on the bottom
still that's embarrassing I'm really a
winter appropriate but I also like these
look like a boho skirt I feel like a
Western casual boot like this is really
cool it was like a slouchy sweater a
midi skirt like in the same color family
and then maybe a fedora or something I
think is super cool so you can
definitely create a really cool boho
look something like this so something
for this video that I kind of wanted to
touch on was not really so much a shoe
but a pair of jeans and what you to wear
with it so I just wanted to talk about
the flare Jean for a moment these are my
favorite pair of Flair's they're velvet
flares by Jay Brandt I make sure that
you are wearing a pointy toed shoot with
a pair of flare I think it creates a
longer leg effect for at your outfit and
for yourself and it just looks a little
bit more chic and a little bit more put
together if you are wearing a round toe
with a flare you almost get this like
90s Madden girls eye
and I've definitely worn that outfit
before in middle school try to make sure
that you're wearing a pointy toed shoe
you don't want to get you don't want to
get lost in like the 90s when it comes
to wearing around so with the Flair I
