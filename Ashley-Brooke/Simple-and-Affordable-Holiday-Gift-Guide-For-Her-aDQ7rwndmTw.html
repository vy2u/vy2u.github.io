you are new here welcome my name is
Ashley and today I'm going to be showing
you my Holiday Gift Guide are getting
pretty close to Christmas time so I
don't know if I would consider this may
be borderline last-minute I'm prepping
for this video I really tried to kind of
get everybody on your shopping list this
is a mostly gift guide for her I will
show us some brands um at the end that I
like for men but this is mainly for your
sister your mom your grandmother your
mother-in-law aunts cousins to keep this
practical and I wanted to keep it
affordable and even if some of the price
points in my items are a little bit on
the higher side I will definitely link
below some options for you if you are a
little bit on a tighter budget but I
just kind of wanted to give you guys a
range of different types of gifts I also
wanted to thank Orban Outfitters for
partnering with me for this video and
providing a ton of the items anytime I
ever need a gift for somebody urban is
always a good place to go because first
of all they have men and women they have
jewelry sunglasses knickknacks Beauty
just any little thing you can think of
urban will have it and they will have
something for everybody so I thought
they were just a perfect brand to
partner with for this video
for my first item from Urban Outfitters
fingerless gloves I absolutely love
these obviously not on freezing cold
days but on days where I just kind of
want to throw this on I'm running to the
store I need my hands for my phone these
are a really great gift I item and I
love this purple color I saw this color
and I was like oh that's really cool and
it's not something that I would
personally buy for myself but if this
were a gift then I would definitely wear
them I usually tend to buy more of the
blacks and the neutrals struggling to
find the thumb haul where is it the next
item is a scarf another one of those
items that people just don't like buying
for themselves anytime you're looking to
buy a gift for somebody who is in a
colder climate or you know they're
traveling less you know there a pattern
person I would definitely stick with
more of a solid neutral color because
you know they're gonna get a lot of wear
out of it you know it's gonna go with
everything so when you're buying a purse
for somebody for Christmas I feel like
you really have to know their style
because a bag is such a personal item
for somebody it's something that is
going to be the statement piece of their
outfit and something that they're going
to keep for a long time we're buying a
bag for somebody I would definitely play
it safe and not get something too crazy
so I chose this one from Urban
Outfitters it is very trendy because
it's the box structured style the trunk
purse I think is technically the name of
them but it's black it's got just
minimal Hardware right here another
trendy part of this is the thick seat
belt like a strap looking for a bag for
somebody try to stay within a realistic
form of a bag don't get something too
crazy too printed I think this is
something that someone would get a lot
of wear out of X I have a pair of Adidas
running shoes workout shoes so if you
know somebody who is just into fitness
or wanting to get into fitness and just
needs that extra little push I think a
really cute pair of Adidas sneakers is
the perfect gift love the nmds because
they're so comfortable they're like
walking on a cloud
they're very cushiony
have a great fit and they come in so
many different colors I have the white
ones but I do have my eye on the
Penguins and the camel ones next gift is
again if you know somebody style really
well and you want to get them a an
article of clothing I would stay away
from jeans sweater is a really good item
to get because the sizing is a little
bit broader than if you were to get a
pair of jeans you know usually sweaters
you can kind of hold it up and tell if
it's a true small or a true medium or a
true large I picked both of these from
Urban Outfitters and I think this one is
more for the person in your life that
wears the darker clothes maybe like
black a lot or brown but still has like
a really funky sleeve but not too crazy
and then the next one is for that person
that wears a lot of lighter colors light
washed denim pink Gray's it's a little
bit more bright a little bit more out
there so you know you definitely want to
know their style in terms of are they
colorful or are they more of a neutral
type of person next is another workout
another gym attire piece but it is a
brand that I absolutely love called
gsella and this is one of their sports
bras but they just have the best workout
clothes so if you know somebody who's in
the gym all the time or like I said
before really wanting to get in the gym
sometimes you know cute gym wearing cute
shoes is the best way to give them that
little extra kick and I know that's so
weird ridiculous to say but I'm the same
way if I get into a pair of gym leggings
I like cannot wait to go to the gym we
could brand great sizing literally the
best high waisted gym leggings I've ever
had in my whole entire life
next thing might not be for everybody so
again I'm trying to get a broad range of
gifts for a broad range of people but I
love lacy bras it's just something that
I love to wear they're very comfortable
to me I love it when people not just
like anybody not like Ryan or my mom
gifts them to me I just think that
that's one of the best gifts because
really nice lingerie if you will lacy
bras they can get a little bit expensive
and I hate spending so much money on
something like that because only like
I see it no one else sees it it's not
something that you're wearing on the
outside of your body a really good
quality lace bra is just so comfortable
and I just love so I chose this one
right here and I love this color
and I actually got the matching
high-waisted underwear that go with it
it still has the padding in it even
though it's lace still has padding so
it's very comfortable and that one's a
little bit more on the sexy side but
this one's a little bit more flirty and
kind of cute I would definitely do this
with like a t-shirt this is the front
and then this is the back it's just got
like one clasp in the back it's almost
just like a tank top or something but I
think this is really cute with t-shirts
and high high neck top so you can you
know see a little bit of lace sticking
out
next I'm going to move on to the more
techie items for all of those tech
people in your life so first I have this
if Fujifilm Instax photo printer and it
prints
Polaroid's and I have made so many cute
projects with this thing and they print
out like little mini Polaroids and there
are filters on the app so you can do
colored or black and white this is
really great for the people in your life
that love photos that love doing DIY
projects this is perfect I've gifted
this three times to different people on
their birthdays and I always get a text
back saying how much they actually use
this and I love seeing the projects that
they've created with it so next I have a
phone case from Elemental cases and this
is my absolute favorite phone case brand
they are on Etsy and they just make the
coolest cases they're very girly and
pretty if you are looking for a guy gift
as well they do really great cases
especially for people who have just
gotten a new phone or you know that just
have had that one phone phone case on
their phone forever that it's turning
brown that was me before I got a new
phone they're really really pretty
they're really well made and they've got
this really pretty matte finish it's a
nice package you know it's like a clear
package it doesn't come just you know in
a plastic bag like a lot of phone cases
do is my JBL speaker i it's so dirty I
have gotten so much use out of this I
take it in the bathroom when I'm getting
ready in the morning it can go in the
shower because it is water-resistant so
I usually listen to audiobooks and
podcasts in the shower while I'm drying
my hair while I'm cooking cleaning this
thing just kind of travels from room to
room with me and the sound is amazing so
this is pretty much a good gift for
anybody I know it comes in white blue it
comes in different colors so you know
that you make different sizes they make
bigger ones smaller ones so whatever
your budget is you could probably find
something like this next are a pair of
good headphones I love my beats because
they are pink and rose gold no I'm just
kidding I love these because I am
editing at least four to five days of
the week and they are so comfortable too
we're for long periods I like you yell
what I have these on I'm sorry the
battery lasts for I mean sometimes I go
without charging for like three days and
it's totally fine they're not noise
cancelling but you can't hear anything
when you have them on so it's a really
good sound really good bass and I also
wear them to the gym as well fold up
nicely they come with a pouch so you can
travel with them put them in the in your
bag after the gym they're just really
really great I will you know these are
pretty expensive for headphones I would
say these are for somebody that is going
to use them all the time you know I
don't mind investing money into
headphones because I wear them almost
every single day and I use them almost
all day so this was a great purchase for
me but I will also link some more
inexpensive options below
these are my two favorite body lotions
at the moment they are by origins this
one is soothing souffle and this one is
ginger souffle this one's a little bit
spicier it smells like a gingerbread
cookie so good and then this one is more
minty definitely mom I hope you're not
watching this I am definitely getting my
mom both of these for Christmas because
I know she'll love them anybody who
loves bath stuff and lotions will
definitely love these so next time we
run Outfitters I have the Frank body
coconut and coffee scrub and this is
great for people who like to exfoliate
so people who get dry skin in the winter
people who regularly fake tan in the
winter this will get every inch of
self-tanner off of my body so I can
apply a new coat it smells great the
packaging is so cute so it's really
great for a stocking stuffer if you need
one of those but I mean this is a really
great gift I don't even know if I would
use this as a stocking stuffer um I
think this is wrap worthy for sure start
two items that I absolutely hate
purchasing myself and it is a
straightener and a blow dryer and I just
Oh like I hate spending money on that
because I don't know it's just one of
those things kind of like perfume like I
hate buying it for myself so gifting
that is such a great idea
so many different brands out there of
hair tools but I really love this Harry
Josh I've been using it now for a couple
of weeks and oh my gosh it is like
salon-quality realness and I absolutely
love it so I have a straightener and I
have the blow dryer this blow dryer is
compact and so tiny and dries my whole
hair in like five minutes which is
incredible actually have the blow dryer
right here so this is what the blow
dryer looks like super small and it
comes with two heads it comes the longer
one and a shorter one but it's super
lightweight it's super quiet and it's
just a really really great hair dryer
next are for you our makeup junkies or
just people who like storing things a
little makeup bags I'm obsessed with
makeup bags and I love love these two
from Target these little individual ones
are great for stocking stuffers or if
you're buying
the glasses or something and you want to
put them in one of these I think that I
think that's a really good gift or what
you could do is buy the whole set not
the whole set because I think there's
maybe 12 pieces but you know if you
wanted to buy like three or four two or
three you could definitely wrap this and
make it a gift because these are really
nice and they're so girly and fun and
another thing that people you know hate
buying for themselves but in depth
meeting I think travel-related I hate
buying suitcases I hate buying like
travel cases because I'm like I don't
use them very often but when I have them
I'm so glad I do have them next are any
type of little lip kits or anything like
this
lip glosses lipsticks I think these are
just really pretty packaging for the
holidays so I think these are great
stocking stuffers and you can pretty
much find stuff like this anywhere is a
this brand is lip bland and the
packaging is so beautiful and it comes
in some really really cool colors next
are great stocking stuffers I don't know
about you guys but I always in my
stocking from Ryan's mom I get like
toothpaste the new toothbrush so I think
these are just really cute stocking
stuffers it's not your same old like
Colgate or crest floss you know it's
like a really cute a really cute gift
idea orange and strawberry and look how
cute they are
someone actually commented on one of my
videos saying that she works in a
dentist office and this is what they use
and everyone loves it so next are some
perfumes that I like if you are shopping
for your girlfriend or your wife and you
are stuck on a scent you know you want
to get a perfume because perfume is a
great gift it lasts forever but it's
kind of expensive so it's a good gift my
jaw is one of my all-time favorites it
is it's pretty strong a little bit goes
a long way but I think it is good for
all year round it's good for daytime
it's pretty good for nighttime it's not
as heavy as I would like in nighttime
perfume to be but this is definitely
good for just spritzing on for the day
so two of my favorite classics are
Balenciaga and Chloe and I think these
are both like this is purple
my six bottle Chloe and my fifth bottle
of plenty Agha they are both great for
everybody I think everybody that I've
ever come across
likes both of these scents both very
specific steps I walk by somebody and I
smell it on them I'm like a little Chloe
that's nice
there are really safe options if you're
looking for a safe option if you have no
clue what she likes go with one of these
it's a little bit more specific but also
one of my absolute favorites favorites
and it is the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana and this is a this is probably
my go-to nighttime perfume either this
one or Tom Ford Tom Ford's a little bit
more specific it is a virus drug so you
know that's I don't know if I would do
that one it's a gift I think this is a
good alternative and I do wear this
during the day sometimes only if I'm
going somewhere I don't know that I
would just like spritz this on and then
like head to the grocery store but it is
good for a special occasion and the
bottle is really pretty another good one
to get that I don't personally own is
the Michael Kors original scent I can
always smell that one on anybody
and I will start with jewelry
accessories first this I got from urban
outfitter Urban Outfitters talk today
it's great for holding earrings I keep
it in my closet it's kind of empty right
now because I've been traveling and
they're all on my travel case but this
is a really good way to stay organized
and urban has so many jewelry organizers
like this and I'll link them below next
are these two cases and this is
definitely for the traveler in your life
and this one holds high I mean looking
for these this one holds earrings and
then it's got an empty section here and
then this slides up so I like to keep my
hoops in there and then this one I'm
scared to know what's in here this one
Oh perfume one holds your necklaces here
it's got a pouch here and then a spot
for your rings right here great for
travelers who like to travel at the
bunch of jewelry and the color is pretty
it's like this iridescent purple next is
the actual jewelry and I only have three
pieces here but this is always a safe
option these are gold hoops from Urban
Outfitters and I love how thin how thin
they are and these are brand-new that's
why they're still here
I was actually traveling with my gold
hoops a couple of weeks ago and one fell
on my ear and I have no idea where it
went
so really glad I got a replacement pair
X is a little bit more of a funky brand
it has called child of wild and they do
really cool jewelry I mean this is
probably one of my favorite places to
buy jewelry you'll just have to go to
their site and check it out
but if you are shopping for someone who
you know this is their specific style
this is a really good brand to go to
next is a watch and I never buy watches
for myself but I ended up I ended up
getting in this one and I absolutely
loved it I loved how dainty it is it's a
very everyday it's not super specific
and it just looks really nice with so
many things and I'm really glad I got
this because I really do wear it almost
on a daily base
first we have a book and this is for
people I loved getting books especially
from Ryan because he picks out the best
books but this is a really good one for
somebody who is love who loves like
self-help books podcasts that have to do
with like better in yourself bettering
your business you can actually just go
online look at this one and then look at
the recommended if this is something for
you or you know somebody that just
graduated and doesn't really quite know
what to do with their lives I haven't
quite figured it out yet I think a book
is honestly the best gift you could give
them or get material things forget stuff
like that this will be a good not this
one specifically but a good book that
can help them guide their way to see
what they want to do really just kind of
help themselves figure themselves out is
the best gift that you can give them
next is another gift that I love getting
and no matter what and it is a good
candle this is a great gift if you are
going to a party and you need to get a
hostess gift candle is always a candle
and a bottle of wine always a good
choice are some of my favorite stocking
stuffers so I love these little lip
balms from drunk elephant they're super
small and cute and fit in my purse and
then I love this cuddly beauty elixir
spray any little tiny like travel-size
cute stuff like this is perfect for
stockings and candy don't forget the
candy and then these socks from Urban
Outfitters I love these
I plan on lounging in these and also
wearing them over over my boot to wear a
little bit of the floral sticks out I
think they're just so cute urban
honestly has the best stocking stuffer I
mean I could probably stuff 20 stockings
with their stocking stuffer like
accessory section so go to urban if you
aren't looking for stocking stuffers
so that is it for the actual physical
gifts but I think a lot of things people
overlook and these can actually be great
gifts if it's something specific or if
you just kind of ran out of time and
you're like I have to go to Christmas
tomorrow and I am empty-handed so any
type of subscription I think is such a
great gift for beauty obviously one of
my favorites is birch box you get
monthly samples in the mail you get
perks so you get discounts on you shop
and I think it's like a point system and
then of course there are food deliveries
so if you know somebody who's trying to
eat healthier or just doesn't have time
to cook get them a six month
subscription of plated blue apron Sun
basket there are so many to choose from
or if you know gym junkie who loves
smoothies I subscribe to daily harvest
and it is one of my absolute favorite
subscriptions they basically send
prepackaged smoothies once a month and
they do soups Sundays smoothies oats so
it's perfect it's perfect for people
like me who love smoothies but I get
tired of the same smoothie every day so
you literally just fill it up with
coconut milk or water put it in the
blender and you're good to go wine
subscriptions those are so great for
people who love wine who really
appreciate it I think a good wine
subscription is such a great gift as
well for people who are really wanting
to get in the gym and that's our new
year's resolution is to get in shape or
lose weight either get them a six month
gym membership or I subscribe to daily
burn and it's basically workouts on my
computer so all I do is put my computer
into my TV and I have my workouts right
there and a lot of them are live they do
the different workouts daily or I'll go
to my favorite ones and do them twice a
week so they have all different kinds
you don't need any equipment there's
yoga I mean there's just everything so
subscriptions do not forget about those
and gift cards as well I feel like gift
cards and subscriptions kind of go
hand-in-hand they're like silently
really great gifts they're small and
almost non-existent but they're really
great gifts don't underestimate a good
gift card or a subscription and I'm a
big monogram giver I love doing
monogrammed things I have like my
favorite websites that I get things
monogrammed on but this is my
this is my actual card holder and it has
a B on it in gold and it's embossed this
was actually sent to me by a brand and I
absolutely love it I've been carrying
this for over a year now and I love it I
get so many compliments on it this is a
really easy gift to give and it's very
cool I think pretty much this is a great
gift for anybody men or women I will
link below some of my favorite websites
to shop on for gift this video is so
long I know it so I'm not going to get
into the men's section but I will post
below in the comments I mean in the
description box some of my favorite
men's websites to shop at for gifting so
you can pretty much find everything in
this in the description box use that as
your shopping list as your gift guide I
will link so much more than I talked
about here happy shopping
but don't forget the most important part
of the holidays is spending time with
your family your loved ones your friends
so don't let that you don't get caught
up in all of the gift-giving just really
enjoy enjoy yourselves and take a moment
to just be in the moment with your
family over the holidays see you guys in
