today I'm showing you how I create a
soft hair soft makeup look perfect for
fall I also think it's a good look for
when you're just running errands or you
know you just kind of want like a soft
natural look I think it's great for work
the only time I really do a full face of
makeup is what I'm either filming or I'm
going to an event or out to dinner a
nighttime function dressy daytime
function but other than that I pretty
much live in this so I invited you guys
along to get ready with me I'm about to
head out and run some errands with Ryan
and I just wanted to create this look
and just take you along with me so you
guys can just kind of see the products
I'm using and how I'm doing it so stay
tuned and let's get ready alright so I'm
going to start by doing my makeup first
thing with any sort of makeup routine
especially a natural makeup routine
you definitely want to make sure that
you are using the right primer and the
right moisturizer before you apply on
your makeups I am using origins matte
moisture with willow-herb and I've
actually partnered up with origins which
is one of my favorite brands they their
products just never fail me like any
product I get I'm never disappointed and
I'm loving this one what I put on before
I put my makeup on and I actually keep
this in my makeup bag and I have another
one for when I wake up in the morning it
is their newest product and it is
exclusively available at Sephora I like
about this product is that it hydrates
and mattifies really hard to find a
product that does both I feel like you
either buy matte and it dries out your
skin or you buy hydrating and it makes
your skin look a little oily so the fact
that you get like a two in one is a plus
is that it is really important to choose
your primer correctly because you want
to look glowy while your a barefaced
without looking shiny if you know what I
mean you want that glow not that shine I
will put the this product in the
description box below if you guys want
to check it out so for my actual face
I'm going to use Laura Mercier's tinted
moisturizer like this like I would treat
a foundation I'm not gonna rub it in I'm
actually gonna like actually blend it
just because I feel like it gives me
kind of gives me more of the look that
I'm going for when I blend it when I rub
it in with my fingers I almost feel like
it looks smeared so I always try to buff
things out with a brush no matter what
it is I was no amount of tinted
moisturizer can cover up these dark
circles I'm just gonna use tarts
waterproof 12-hour concealer and just do
a few little dots I'm not gonna bring it
all the way down like I normally would
into a few little dots right there
though since this is more of a more of a
natural look
I'm not going to completely contour my
face I'm gonna bronze my cheekbones just
a little bit with my hoola bronzing
stick this just gives you a little bit
of definition or your cheekbones
see there's just like a tiny little hum
contouring of the cheekbone I'm not
gonna do my whole face again cuz you're
not going for a subtle look you don't
want a fully contoured face because I
feel like that just defeats the whole
purpose
so my eyeshadow I'm just gonna do my
Sigma wildflower palate color called
peaceful it's almost like a champagne it
just gives you a little bit of a glow on
your eyes
so next I'm going to use my tart blush
and just give a little rosy cheeks and
things subtle but still a little bit of
color
I always feel silly when I put my blush
on I like some mild ones though you want
to blend this all ahead and scrap your
beauty blender your booty blender for my
brows I am NOT going to fully use it I
usually use my tart clay I'm not going
to I'm just gonna use my benefit gimme
brow it's almost like a little mascara
for your eyebrows but comfortable not
not shading in your eyebrows go ahead
and do it like you normally would just
maybe go a little bit lighter don't
fully fill them in otherwise you're
gonna look like you people are gonna
just see eyebrows couldn't look at you
because you're gonna have this really
soft beautiful makeup look with these
really hard eyebrows
so as you can see it just gives me a
little bit of color and a little bit
more shape when I use this stuff the
thing about this is that it runs out so
fast i how small it is like how much
product actually in this girl
I should have plucked my eyebrows before
I started this kind of growing out my
eyebrows so they're a little like a
little crazy right now
tada so next I'm gonna do what my Tarte
gifted mascara and I'm not gonna put on
my normal 4 to 5 layers I'm just gonna
do one maybe one and a half because
again you want your features to be equal
so you don't want soft subtle makeup and
then these giant layered on eyelashes
you know you want to try to keep
everything subtle and the same when
you're doing an all natural makeup I'm
just gonna do something super subtle
very simple I am using tarts what color
is this rose and I don't know what this
is called but they're like just almost
just colored chapstick little lip
glosses so they go on really subtle
hardly any color and they feel really
nice too that is it for the makeup now
moving on tire for my hair I am using my
Chi iron whoop good catch Cielo damn
thing my Conner a good Old Faithful had
this first like literally six years last
night I wash my hair and I only
blow-dried the roots so I blow-dried
like from here down and I let the rest
air dry because I wanted a soft natural
curl my hair is naturally curly so this
is what it looks like when it dries by
itself at the bottom as you can see
we've got we're gonna we're in a good
start here so we've got some curls but
then there are pieces like this that
just almost look like rolled out of bed
kind of unkept a little bit of all
putting heat protectant spray that is
number one when you're put
any sort of heat on your hair and go
ahead and pin my hair up I'm just gonna
do two halves so I'm gonna happen and
then do the rest don't want to brush it
up because if you have naturally curly
hair then you know you're not supposed
to brush it or it'll just frizz up so
I'm just gonna run my fingers through
I'm gonna find any little pieces that
might have a little frizz to them that I
maybe slept on wrong and I'm just gonna
subtly curl them with the wand to make
them kind of look a little bit just a
little bit like the rest of my hair I'm
not gonna do the end I'm just gonna do
the middle I think this piece is just a
little bit frizzy so I just want to run
some heat through it like that as you
can see it kind of fixed it a little bit
where it's kind of more attached
together in one curl now that I've got
everything looking a little bit like it
blew what's that that's where we get a
little crazy so first I'm going to
straighten out these pieces right here
around my face but most part everything
back here looks okay you know when
you're going for the natural curl look
you don't want all of your curls to look
the same like you curled them with a
curling iron so you want different sizes
you know tighter curls looser waves just
to kind of make it look softer almost a
little bit messy but naturally
I think I've pretty much that's the way
I want to see so you can tell in the
front it is a lot better than it was
before I fix these little pieces and I
always always always because my hair is
on the drier side on the frizzy or side
I always do a hair oil I think I've
talked about my hair oils like I don't
know in the past before video so sorry
but I'm using my muse su hair oil and
smells really nice it works really great
it doesn't make my hair greasy or oily
looking at almost just tames my frizzies
and keeps my curls together and I don't
recommend that have naturally oily hair
I don't recommend putting it on the top
but since I have naturally more like dry
hair I always do this to kind of tame my
frizzy little flyaways that kind of poke
up sometimes I changed my mind
and I want to flip my hair over there
was it works sometimes it doesn't like
today not working okay so that is all I
have for you for this video I really
hope you loved it this is one of my
favorite looks to go to for fall because
I don't know there's just something so
cozy and natural about it yeah let me
