doesn't
hi everyone happy Sunday so it is twelve
o'clock and Ryan and I have been up
filming since about 7:30 this morning
yesterday we were trying to film for
today's video but it was just too windy
so we had to like put on pause and film
today for today's video which always
makes me so nervous so now what I'm
going to do is have just kind of like
relaxing the spa day at home so I'm
cleaning up around the apartment to do I
have some editing to do so we're just
gonna relax have a little spa day at
home my skin is nice and clean I'm just
gonna use my regular toner to even out
my skin tone and just make sure that
everything all the dirt and all the
yucky stuff is awesome and you always
think you clean your face really really
well until you use a toner on a cotton
the next part of this video is sponsored
by collar science I've been using
they're all calm clinical redness
corrector and I just kind of wanted to
show you guys before and after here so
you can kind of get an idea of what the
product does before we start so next I'm
just gonna let this stuff sit on my face
for the rest of the day and then I'll do
a mask later tonight it is the
colorscience allcom clinical redness
corrector SPF 50 for red and sensitive
skin i've also been using this as a
primer because it's a little bit has a
green tint to it and green neutralizes
the appearance of redness you can see
not only is it like immediately covering
up the redness but it's also really
amazing and actually if any of you guys
suffer from rosacea then you know that
the number one trigger for rosacea is
the sun so fact that this has SPF 50 and
it really helps control that the reason
it provides redness and sensitivity
relief is because of
patent pending by Oh soulless complex it
was kind of interesting around here it
just hurts my face I get burns I know
you guys know what I'm talking about who
have like read sensitive skin but it
just kind of like feels like a soothing
relief feeling and it feels amazing
click the link down below or search for
a retailer in your area for the stuff
you use this coupon code in your order
you will get a free mini brush on
sunscreen with SPF 50 so freebies are
always really cool and fYI Oprah
Magazine awarded this best sensitive
skin day cream so
okay so I just stepped on an edited for
about two hours and I'm going to put
some coconut oil and I think some
olaplex on my insipid I'm on the route
oh hell I'm gonna put it on my routes
just because I'm not ready to fully wash
wash my hair because I just watched it
like a day and a half ago so we're gonna
do a little treatment on the ends here
because I have been straightening it
quite a bit over the last couple of days
so I'm gonna section it off since the
front of my hair is shorter than the
back give myself a beer in here for a
second I used to do this when I was
little by the way I had a really long
hair and I would always make a ponytail
right here and pretend that I had a
beard hmm that's why I didn't have any
friends so first I'm gonna do a little
bit of coconut oil not a whole lot
because coconut oil is so hard to get
out it's gonna do like a little tiny bit
I'm just gonna cook things here so then
I'm gonna do my olaplex number three
this stuff works miracles so now I'm
just gonna do my sides same thing and
then to keep it out of my face I'll
usually just do a little pigtail braids
I also feel when I wear my hair like
this it also helps to not get all over
everything
no then I'm done with this I'm gonna
take a small break from editing to clean
up a little bit because I just feel like
I've been filming so much the past few
days that my apartment is just like a
wreck there's clothes all in the bedroom
laundry
Oh
I can't wait to see would you become
when you I just sat down to eat dinner
how do you feel having a nice sit-down
dinner with me looking like this hair
mask and everything the braids you like
the braids okay I love the bluegrass
instead of a bra
it's a bandeau a boob wrap I feel like I
just made dinner I'm having a barbecue
chicken salad I've got a bed of lettuce
scoop of quinoa avocado black beans and
then this is the tofurkey of barbecue
chicken and it is delicious isn't it so
freaky so good and my watermelon Perrier
okay okay bye so I'm about to complete
my little my little Sunday spa day which
I edited for most of it but at least my
ends are gonna be nice and I'm gonna
paint my toenails now because I do not
know if I'm enough time to get a
pedicure before Mexico so I'm just gonna
