I'm shooting another haul as you can
tell
today's haul is going to be a little bit
different we've got a really wide
variety of mixes so I've got clothes
shoes accessories I also have some
special occasion items because you guys
were wanting as you all told me this
wedding season and you are like what do
I wear to a wedding and I pulled some
items that I think could be good for
wedding slash like maybe prom and if you
have any other special occasion coming
up I think I got a few items that would
be hopefully what you're looking for
thought Lulu I got Topshop I've got some
more River Island Zara and we'll go
ahead and get started with Lulu's and
just to let you guys know I did partner
up with Lulu's they are sponsoring the
first part of this video for the special
occasion they just had so many great
pieces to choose from oh I thought it
was the perfect fit for you guys as well
as for me when it comes to showing you
kind of a different variety of that kind
of stuff
sponsored by Lulu's go ahead and get
started I'll go ahead and start with
Lulu so you guys can see what I got for
the first dress I pulled the Miss floral
print maxi and it's got a really low
back which i think is so beautiful so
the top comes up high within the back
gets down low and it's got a cross back
like that print it's just so pretty and
I was you know thinking for a wedding
guest or even just like a night out for
summer if you're going to like a nice
dinner I think this is so perfect it's
really nice because it kind of flows
when you walk the colors are so
beautiful so in this next dress is
something that I think you could do to a
more direct the occasion maybe something
like prom or even if you are going to
like a cocktail attire wedding I think
this is a good option it's just a red
one-shoulder very simple but very
elegant style of dress and I love the
color I think the color is just so
beautiful and I love the one-shoulder
how it has the chiffon overlay I think
it's really nice
I love this color with gold accessories
so if you have like a statement necklace
gold or like black and gold statement
earrings I think would be really cool
with this type of dress for my next
dress I thought this Navy I love maybe
special occasion dresses I think maybe
it's such a good alternative black it
still shows you know you're still
wearing dark but you're also giving a
little bit of color so this one actually
has a cutout right here in the chest and
this more of a halter style and I love
the ruffle detailing on the neck I think
that's so pretty
the back is actually cut out as well
this is something that I would
definitely wear it to a cocktail wedding
just because I do like to wear darker
things I think it's because my hair's
lighter so I think darker things look
good on my hair color I know that's so
weird to say but you I'm sure some of
you guys know what I'm talking about but
yeah I really love this and I think this
is so pretty with gold accessories as
well so I had to throw in a two piece
item of course so here is the top and
then here is the back laces up I think
that's so pretty I love this and I love
the colors too bottom is actually a long
maxi skirt the thing I love about
two-piece s is that you can also wear
them separately you know so if you
wanted to do a black croc with this you
totally could or if you even wanted to
wear this with like jeans and like a
blazer or a jacket it's kind of you know
whatever you're feeling at the moment
I can definitely see this for a more
relaxed maybe like a beach style wedding
or just a more casual setting of a
wedding because the skirt goes up pretty
high so you're not showing too much
stomach when it comes to like the crop
the crop tops so it just kind of depends
on where you're going but I do think
that this is a more relaxed style
next is my favorite I love this dress so
much I think the color is so pretty I
love this like mommy's purple colors off
this dress also has a cutout in the
front
halter and then an open back and then
the front kind of
it's got a chiffon overlay so it gives
you a little bit of flow or in high
school this is what I would wear to prom
I remember my prom I wore it was like
the more beads and the more layers and
the poufier the better so not so wish I
could go back in time and get this one
all of my prom pictures I'm like mom why
did you let me buy that and she was like
you loved it this is something that I
would definitely write a prom I don't
know it just might be a little too
dressy for if you're a wedding gasps I
think this might be a little bit over
the top
also just depending on what kind of
wedding you're going to I know some
weddings are very dressy so this might
work for you but I think for like a prom
type occasion this is really pretty
moving on - I have a bathing suit from
Lulu's so here is my bathing suit I love
this I love one-piece bathing suits and
this one just like screamed at me it's
great it's kind of great actually it's
like a baby gray some threading up at
the top and then the back is a low back
with a bow right here and then the bow
actually has little charms on the end so
I think this is so cute I'm not going to
try this on as my panning stuff only
goes from like here to here so not going
to do this but you'll definitely see me
wearing this a lot over the summer so
stay tuned presents bathing suits not
going to put you guys through what
seeing me in this right now and it also
is a very cheeky bottom it's not like a
full bottom it's definitely more of a
Brazilian style of bottom next is this
off the shoulder button-down and I love
things like this
I think throwing this on with skinny
jeans and adding like a papas print bag
or a pop of color in your shoe it's just
such an easy classic outfit I think this
is great for work also good for if you
can wear off the shoulder to work I know
some places are a little bit more casual
than others but I think this is a really
good dressier style of hop that you can
also dress down with just a pair of
jeans I really love this next from
Lulu's are
my yellow mules I'm so excited for these
I try to bond with the pair of like crop
denim and it looks so cute and yellow
such a good color especially this like
mustardy yellow I think goes with blacks
Browns gray so it's a really good pop of
color to add oh my gosh my dishwasher it
sounds like it's about like whoa these
are just really great for when you need
like a good pop of color in your outfit
I think adding like a yellow mule
something a little bit you know the
shoes not so crazy itself it's just a
basic simple mule but just adding a pop
of color can really make such a
difference lastly from Lulu's is my new
phone case I don't think I've had a
phone case on my phone and the longest
time so I was really excited to find a
black marble one I was waiting to shoot
the hole before I took it out of the
packaging because the packaging so
pretty so now I can like actually use it
and it's matte it's not like a shiny
cream mask oh we love this are my two
pairs of shoes from River Island and I
will start with my little slides you got
these guys more yellow I don't I don't
own anything yellow and Here I am with
two pairs of yellow shoes I am obsessed
with these I love how this is like a
metallic silver very cool and how this
is um textured and it also has metallic
in it as well so I think these are a
good slip on when you need a print
printed shoe next from River Island are
these chunky heel sandals I think the
color is so pretty but olive green
orange and black and I don't know if you
can tell that there is different
textures so this is like a suede a rest
or leather and then this is like a croc
embossed leather it's a really cool shoe
it's just something fun even when you're
you know getting something like this
from Lulu's a pair of jeans and then
adding these and it's just like a good
pop of color when you're dealing with a
shoe like this the shoe can pretty much
make your whole outfit so anytime I can
grab the pair of shoes like this I will
definitely grab it
so next moving on to Zara
that's the LMC
Oh first I've got this top from Zara
it's just a basic actually it's not
basic at all the floral print crop top
and Ascot of poopy sleeves and then it
also is a like losing my works with a
wrap top without the wrap it gives the
effect of a wrap top so it goes down
pretty low and then these can come
either off your shoulder or on your
shoulder and this actually comes with
matching shorts as well but I looked
like a giant seven-year-old child when I
put on this set I don't know what it was
about me I was like oh that's not going
to work so I tried this on with
high-waisted black jeans whether they
looked like my normal 28 year old self
next is this basic white again not basic
I don't know why I keep saying that
because it's not but it is a white this
is basic the part this card is actually
very basic and then the sleeves are
really cool so it's not a kind of a fat
wing sleeve and then it comes to a
stopping point at the wrist with a
little ruffle detail so I thought this
was really fun
you know when I'm just throwing on jeans
and a regular shirt I would probably
grab something like this next is I love
this I think this is so pretty
putting together in my life by her
lookbook and I put this top in it
spoiler alert for all of my love hookers
the stops in it and I just have to have
it because I thought it was just so
pretty I cut it with black jeans white
jeans blue jeans and I was like this top
goes with everything so I went to Zara
the next day and what because I love it
and this fits actually really nicely
it's a little cropped and I love the bow
scott a flowy sleeve and then it gets
cinched right at the wrist which I love
tops like that I think it gives you that
flowy look without being too flowy like
my sweatshirt right now is you know a
batwing sleeve but it you know comes to
a closure right here I know what I'm
trying to say I'm losing my mind
laughs top from Zara what is this on it
I have money
is this sleeveless or ruffled top
and I grabbed this to go with like fun
pants or just basic D&amp;amp;C I don't really
have much white mini white sleeveless
tops so I thought this is a good
addition to my wardrobe just to add with
jeans or like some pants tucked in to
give you more of like a dressy look kind
of a girly looks like how the buttons
didn't go all the way down so if I want
to tuck it in I can usually when I have
a shirt that has a full button closure
it's really hard to tuck in and kind of
blouse over so I like that the buttons
came to a stopping point so I have three
bottoms from Zara here are the first
pair they are just a basic pair of
culottes that are a little roughly I
love the color I actually tried it on
with this top and just fell in love so I
had to have these and they're so
comfortable they're like a cotton cotton
material you'll feed in the video it's
really hard to let me show you guys what
it looks like in the screen but I love
being in which it's a basic white key I
think these are cool my next bottom is
this green skirt and it's kind of
looking a little washed out in the video
but it's a really rich green color and I
love this I can just see myself wearing
this with black booties like a black
basic top tucked in with the belt I had
envisioned in my head I was humming it
on and I was like putting outfits
together because sometimes when it comes
to skirts and stuff I really have to
envision in my mind like what am I
actually going to wear this with because
otherwise I'll get it and it just sits
in my closet if I can't automatically
think of an outfit that I probably won't
wear it
so in role is I have to think of like
two to three outfits that I would wear
it with so now my thought process behind
that got two slits in the front which I
thought was kind of interesting and
different it's not like a full bottom
skirt all the way around so it does have
a couple of slits and it comes up really
high which I like a lot also
so my next skirt is not so basic it is a
little bit more of a girly kind of fun
summery skirt so I can definitely see
this when it's like really really hot
and I just want to throw on like a tank
for like a sleeveless blouse and just be
really really cool I dropped this I
thought the embroidery was really fun
and I love the ruffles I love any like
kind of diagonal ruffle and then it's at
its high which I thought just added a
little bit something extra in the back
it's just plain with the ruffle so
moving on to my shoes from Zara first I
got these little slides just slip on
super easy
I liked if they're just black and white
can throw these on with anything and
they were really comfortable why I tried
them on so good easy little slip ons and
next serves to samsara are these block
heel kind of page sandals and I like
that they were caged with a closed toe
so I can actually start wearing them
pretty soon carry them into fall kind of
an all year round shoe I thought the
heel was kind of cool let's take a
little fad heel which I actually just
noticed that so you're really
comfortable to a low heel but still a
heel so it gives you that height and the
elongated of your life but still really
comfortable at the same time then I got
two bags from Zara my first bag is this
Western inspired by with a buffalo I
just thought he was the cutest thing so
I got this guy and I like the color it's
like a cream it's not so what like
bright white it's like a really pretty
off-white color and I love the studs and
I don't know my Texas roots just kind of
made me love this value and want it it's
not a long-handled bag it's just almost
like a shoulder bag which I kind of like
you know I'm not like such a tall person
so most bags go down to my knees so this
is kind of nice to have this free
sticker okay
what else is in here connects tag is
this red guy and looks kind of orange in
the video but it's like a true red color
I thought it's so cool I love the chain
right here we like that the hardware is
gunmetal you know you usually see silver
with red so I thought it was nice to see
kind of a different color of heart
we have one item from Topshop and it is
this rose gold metallic blazer in love
with it as soon as I saw it was the last
one in the whole entire store and it was
like stuck in a random spot so you know
someone was trying to hide it and I was
like oh no I hope someone's not going to
come back for this but um Finders
Keepers
well Rica robbed this and I'm pretty
sure it was like a return because
there's like a janky tag no but I was
like threw it on and I was like I
absolutely love this I think it's the
coolest thing so give me a rose gold
metallic blizzard I'm happy
yeah it's long too it's actually in the
Topshop tall section so it's supposed to
be like normal length on a really tall
person but it was long on me so that was
even better I love long Blazers and
things like that alright so I know I
showed you guys these in my last haul
but I did not try them on so I told you
that I would so I'm just going to post a
quick video of me trying these on so you
guys can see what they look like on my
feet
they are Jeffrey Campbell for free
people so my princess happens choose I
haven't worn them yet cause it's been so
cold but I just love them so much so I
cannot we know this until I was looking
for the shopping link for these that
they come in a slide too so if you're
not like a loafer person or you want a
little bit more of a tone down jewel to
