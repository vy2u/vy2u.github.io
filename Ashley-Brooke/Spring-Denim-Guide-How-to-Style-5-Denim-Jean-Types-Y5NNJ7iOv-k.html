video we are gonna be talking about one
of my all-time favorite things in the
world which is denim specifically in
today's video I am taking five of my
favorite styles of denim before spring
that I'm constantly in rotation on and
I'm gonna show you how I like to style
them we'll be sharing with you a lot of
my dues I don't have many don'ts I hate
telling people what not to do I'm a big
believer and if you're comfortable in it
in it that's your style then you rock it
it's not my place to tell you guys what
to do with your style but I will tell
you some of my personal do's and don'ts
and you can follow me if you want to but
if not then just take whatever I say and
just throw in the trash you dare you do
what you like to do first pair of denim
that I have is the cropped flair if I
styled this denim I'm usually going to
an event I'm going on a date this is my
go-to dressy pair of denim it comes to
shoes for this certain pair of denim I'd
like to stay away from ankle boots just
because I feel like it makes my legs
look a lot shorter I could do something
with a platform a sandal of some sort
have a fun pair of denim such as the
cropped flair and you really don't need
a ton of styling I mean you could
obviously do a fun jacket you can do
whatever you want but it's not necessary
you don't really need to put a whole lot
of effort into the styling maybe just do
a basic top layer on some jewelry and
your jeans really speak for the whole
entire outfit
I love denim I have is the culottes and
I'm happy for I had these before
culottes came back into style I've had
these for like five years so whenever I
would wear these people would be like
are you okay what are you wearing
gotcha pop this is another pair of denim
that I do like to dress up and dress
down
I feel like this pair looks great either
way I can throw on like a ripped graphic
t-shirt and some sneakers and I'm good
to go run errands or like today I'm
gonna be styling it with a denim shirt
dressed up with the pair of heels shoes
I again try to stay away from ankle
boots if I do an ankle bootie it's got
to be something tight at the ankle just
because you kind of get lost in shoe and
Jean when you are styling these so I try
to show as much of my ankle as possible
comes to layering jackets over this I
know it's a role to not wear a big flowy
jacket when you are wearing such a wide
pant but I do like to do a kimono every
now and then but for the most part I do
a cross jacket just because you want to
see your waist you want to see wanna see
that you have a body and legs and hips
in the jeans this rare that I do a
kimono but if I'm feeling kind of you
know sassy I might throw a kimono over
it
so my next three genes kind of live in
the same family and oftentimes are
confused with each other to show you the
girlfriend the boyfriend and the
straight leg and tell you the
differences between the three start with
the straight leg basically a gene that
is tighten the waist
tighten the butt tighten the hips but
just goes straight down tighten the leg
that just go straight down and this is a
gene that you can pretty much treat like
a skinny jean all rules apply you can
pretty much wear any shoe with it except
I would stay away from wide ankle boots
and I would stay away from over the knee
boots because then you're just shoving
your gene into it I would stick with the
skinny is for that type of shoe from the
top you can pretty much wear anything do
a long top you can do a short top this
is so tight in the leg right here that
you can cover this part up without
losing yourself in the fabric today I'm
styling these guys with just a basic
white tank a linen jacket and a pair of
heels then since I'm not super tall and
by five I do like to wear some sort of
block heel when I am wearing a jean
length this is a jean that you can dress
up or down as well so you know I do own
maybe four pairs of straight leg jeans
because I do keep them on rotation for
when I'm dressing casuals or dressing up
the next cheese we're gonna do is the
boyfriend Jean and I have these guys
from revolve this is the brand
girlfriend and they make great denim
frenching is pretty much baggy all
around I like my boyfriend jeans to fit
me a little bit in the hip so they
aren't completely sliding down but
they're pretty much baggy everywhere
else they're not tapered at the bottom
they're straight down you can cuff them
if you would like depending on what shoe
you're wearing your free wearing an
ankle boot I would definitely give them
a little cup so you can see a little bit
of your ankle but I like to style these
with just a white team tucked in
something basic tucked in I feel like
when you're wearing something tucked out
of a boyfriend jean there is just too
much fabric going on you can style a
jacket with these I just wouldn't do
something with a lot of fabric I would
do something cropped I would do
something a little tailored in the arm
something to show that you have a body
everywhere else
in the last pair of denim that I have is
the girlfriend Jean which the girlfriend
Jean is going to be the same as the
boyfriend Jean except at the bottom is
tapered with the girlfriend Jean the leg
gets a little bit tapered towards the
bottom
it fits you a little bit better in the
hips and the butt and the ways a little
tighter than the boyfriend jeans so
think of the girlfriend Jean as just a
smaller version of the boyfriend Jean I
know this is so confusing but the
girlfriend Jean is probably one of my
favorites because when I'm wearing
skinny jeans I don't love wearing a crop
top and like having my button everything
exposed I don't know I'm just weird like
that so I can definitely feel
comfortable wearing a crop top and a
girlfriend Jean because I know my the
jeans aren't so tight on my butt and all
my legs so it almost acts as like a
jogger if you will so I really love
these these are one of my favorite pairs
and we survived bdg and they make the
best girlfriend jeans that's why I
styled them with just a cropped graphic
tee and some sneakers I love dressing
these down but again you can dress these
up as well so that's the great thing
about this style of Zi
but I have showed you guys my favorite
pairs of jeans for spring I would like
to know what Styles you guys are loving
right now and how you like to style them
am I missing something I know I'm
missing the skinny jean but I feel like
that's kind of everyone's go-to is the
skinny jean so I really wanted to show
you by something different other than
skinny and we are doing a full page on
denim and the life I heard lookbook next
month we always try to do with denim up
some sort in the magazine but this next
month is going to be a four page spread
on denim alone with lots of inspiration
and shopping links and stuff like that
so you don't want to miss that but I
will put the site right here as well as
below in the description box so go check
it out I will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
