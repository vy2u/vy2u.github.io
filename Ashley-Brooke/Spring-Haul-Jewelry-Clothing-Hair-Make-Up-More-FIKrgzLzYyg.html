today's video is going to be a variety
pack haul and the first part of the
video is sponsored by boohoo lots of
prints lots of color lots of good family
gearing up for swinging at families I'm
saying that already and they actually
gave you guys a 30 percent off coupon
code so that is very generous of them
and that will be in the description box
below second part of the video is going
to be hair accessories some jewelry
bulbs if you guys been watching my blogs
lately you probably knew that that was
coming
not that we are getting really close to
spring is warming up I'm going to start
putting in more summer and spring
clothes into my holes because I feel
like I am so done buying sweaters and
coats like I just cannot look at another
winter piece of clothing this is
actually from boohoo so my style you
guys know I love floral and cut out some
stuff like that so I guess this could be
the first item in the hall this is
basically just a black floral tie
squeeze ecumene sleeves or billowy and
then get tighter at the risk that way I
feel like you don't lose yourself
completely in the top to think that this
print is so beautiful I just love like a
good dark floral if second item from
boohoo is going to be this embroidery
rose t-shirt and you guys know I love
red love embroidery and I just love a
good basic so I think this is so great
to throw on with denim shorts or denim
jeans it's really really thin so you
know you can wear it when it's a little
warmer outside maybe scrunch the sleeves
up throw a denim vest over it to get
such a great amazing to be hobb oh I
love this top first of all the print is
so cool it's got Paisley and stars and
other kinds of like floral print almost
like like tile if you look right there
look how pretty that is
it is sheer so I probably put a little
black bralette underneath it so yeah
this top is right up my alley to the lot
going on and I love it so the next dress
is a little bit thicker but still
Springside because it is like a shorter
dress look like a thin sweat shorting
material and I love the fringe and the
color blocking I think it's different
and interesting and it also continues in
the back you know I love that subsea
when there is print and fun detail on
one side of something and then you turn
it around and it's bare and there's
nothing there and like wait what I would
wear this with maybe some over the knee
boots with it or a little cooler or if
it's warmer do some like cute waves up
sandals or something and roll the sleeve
a little bit I think it's so fun is this
striped top and I love the colors I
think it's such a unique color
combination the red and blue and the
cream so stand and comfortable but yet
not see-through but it's a really nice
oversized you know to do with life denim
shorts or like a skinnier Jean with the
cute sandal I think it's like a really
casual relaxed look so have a choker
detail in the front that you can button
get give it a little something extra ask
to get dark I know this is a bikini and
has stars on it of course so here is the
top to top is the one shoulder
cutout and I just I love this you guys
know I love stars I'm so predictable
when it comes to hauls like you can
probably guess exactly what I'm going to
have something with stars something with
print something with color something
black switchers deloitte you guys know
my terms are high all wasted but yet you
still have a little sexy cutout on the
side this is actually my first pair of
high-waisted bikini bottoms so I tried
it on and I actually loved it it was a
little skeptical I was like I have a
panel cut on me but I actually really do
like this so I'm excited to wear this so
next I will start with the shorts and
first I have this blush pink color and I
think these are so pretty all of my
shorts like this are black so it was
really happy to find this color I think
this is going to be a really big color
this spring obviously it was last year
and I don't think that that's changing
anytime soon I think blush is just soft
girly but yet you can still make it sexy
at this
times with like a white crop top and
maybe some cold sandals so my next pair
of shorts are shocker high-waisted denim
and I have so many denim shorts I do not
have gray high-waisted denim shorts so I
was doing happy to find these it's a
button closure all the way up
high-waisted they're cuffed at the
bottom no rips just a good basic pair of
gray high-waisted shorts next I have
actually a two-piece set and these are
the shorts so they're just little red
pom-pom shorts and they're a little
see-through so I don't know if I would
wear these necessarily um I was wearing
like a bathing suit under these because
they are a little bit see-through but
the matching top is actually lined so
you can definitely wear this with some
denim shorts or some high-waisted denim
well it is a pair you know if you're
going to go to the beach of the pool I
think this is great for over your
bathing suit or just this top with like
jeans or something I think it's really
cute and I love red I love the pom-pom
detail next I have a couple of scarves
for you guys and I featured one of them
in my latest how to style this one right
here think you all loved it I got so
many compliments on it and it's just
such an easy scarf work it's really
small super thin you can tie it you know
right here as like a necktie or you can
turn it around and do it as a choker
like layered with some necklaces I've
been going to this one so much lately
it's like the perfect shades of color in
it too it's red blue yellow and black so
pretty much kind of goes with anything
and the other one from the 7 collection
is this one it's a little bit bigger but
I just thought the colors were so pretty
and I would probably wear this one just
kind of around my neck maybe was like a
jacket or something I think it gives you
a little bit of print little action you
know she's got something basic on if you
guys saw my two blocks ago where run and
I went to Target and I load it up on
bowls and coffee mugs like always I cut
these bowls a lot of you guys are like
wait you didn't show us the bowl you got
so I thought I'd put them in the hall
here they are I love them
Ryan ate them so my first one is just
this black floral one and they all have
gold trim around the top so I love this
once when my favorites I actually got
the matching coffee mug with it
next is this grey and gold one loved
this one just as much next is this blue
one this reminded me of very like
anthropology that's obviously an
anthropology this would be you know $30
for one bowl instead of teeny $6.99 so I
had to get this one I got this one this
just has it looks like black and gold's
random different sized dots and I think
this is so beautiful too
I don't know I will my new bowl crack
but I'm throwing around a room with my
own bowls and just kitchen things in
general so I need to pump the brakes on
the bowl you're a vision break hold on
why don't you mind your own business but
it is my business I don't even want an
old substances me next item in my haul
is going to be a book and I have not
read it yet
but I have heard amazing things about it
and I cannot wait to read a so this was
on the New York Times bestseller list
and I come across it a few times and
just never picked it up and then I heard
so many people saying amazing things
about it so if you guys are in few
personal development and you know
bettering yourself bettering your
business better in your lifestyle this
is kind of like a modern-day version of
like a Tony Robbins book or um if you're
into that kind of thing yeah I will
after I read this let you guys know what
I thought about it but um if you're
looking for a good read and you're into
that kind of thing
pick it up and we'll read it together
and yeah um it's written by Mark Manson
and Ryan actually knows mark so you know
when I picked it up he was you know
facebooking mark like I like this read
in your book and I was like what a small
world that you know this guy and I just
bought the book so weird how things like
that happen comfort with skin care but I
think I only have one thing for skin
care so
sure-sure Maxton and i have never heard
of this brand and I don't even know if
I'm saying it right but I've heard great
things about these portraits so I
decided I would give them a whirl again
I will let you guys know how I like them
but I've heard amazing things so I
cannot wait to try them so if you have
one makeup product and it is by a skill
a stay all day liquid lipstick in the
colour beso at number 10 and this is the
lipstick that I've been telling you guys
about in my blogs and it was the
lipstick that I was wearing in my latest
how to style video I'll post a video
clip right here so you can see it but it
is the most amazing red lipstick I've
ever tried in my whole entire life
so it's liquid but when you put it on it
dries up and does not come off looking
for a good all day and long-lasting red
lipstick this is definitely it and I'll
link it below
obviously I'll link everything below but
um yeah I don't know where I got this
either I think I might have gotten it in
my Birchbox or Sephora like red card
reward member I don't know I found it in
my drawer and I was like oh I'll leave
you and never take you off because you
don't come off right so speaking of skin
and face and whatnot I will do my
panning products next and I said Bondi
fans and all of you all Chileans are
like it's not bomb biasts bomb guy but I
feel like with an American accent is
Bondi I don't know I'm probably totally
wrong so I'm just going to follow your
lead and same bondi bondi good i don't
know why i think my alien accent is on
point
that's so rude right note how bad I want
Australian accent so any chance he can
to tell me that it's not good he takes
it anyway the liquid gold oil the mousse
and I have the lotion so far the mousse
is my least favorite I feel like I put
it on and then the next day when I
showered it all came off so
the lotion and the liquid gold are
probably my two favorites I feel like I
like them both for different reasons
this first of all smells amazing the
only downside of this one is that you
can't see where you're putting it on so
you spray it and then you rub it with
your mitt and you're like a like the
first time I used it I have half of my
so it was tan and how about it was a
white lotion it goes on dark so you can
see what you're doing I don't know it
just kind of is your preference I would
honestly buy this one in the lotion and
see which one suits you the best just
want to be ten about two months ago
next I will do my hair product we have
three items here by the innate life and
one of them is a scalp treatment other
one is a hair mask is a rose hair elixir
I've heard really great things about
this brand so I grab all three of these
and I can't wait to try them and lastly
I have three items of jewelry and the
designer is by Alana and wearing these
pieces in my blogs and you guys have
been asking me about them so I thought
I'd put them in the hall if first item
is this little rose gold bracelet okay
so yeah I love that think it's so cool
and then my two favorite pieces and
Wendon is this coin looking necklace for
you so this is what the necklace looks
like really delicate chain and then
another little chain right here and then
here is the matching ring don't look at
my nails I need to get them redone so
here's the ring I just think it looks
really cool and like vintage looking and
since I've been wearing it I get so many
compliments so this was like my go to
you everyday ring alright guys that is
it for the call I hope you loved it
got a little clothes a little bold
prepare and ones of everything you got
is always good when you have a hall with
a different variety of items and yeah
let me know what you guys think if you
like seeing you know a mixture of
kitchen and hair stuff with clothes and
skin stuff
or if you'd rather just be closed up so
let me know what you guys think see you
