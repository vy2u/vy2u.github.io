I'm shooting a haul as you know I posted
the photo on Instagram of just like my
rolling rack and so many of you were
requesting a haul so here you go here's
your hump
today I have items from H&amp;amp;M Topshop
River Island and Zara so it is quite oh
in sweet people so it's quite a big haul
quite a large haul
let's go then get so I guess we'll go
ahead and start off by store
I think that's easier or do you think
it's easier to do like bags
tops dresses shoes I don't know you tell
me what your preference is in the
comments below
first I have got this bag from River
Island and I think it's so pretty I love
the print I love the color I think it's
really pretty
with denim because it's got this blue
also love the embossed handle so it's
perfect size easy open next I've got
this tote from River Island and it is
basically just exploded carry all tote
it's a nice and structured it looks
really clean and I also like the unfold
chain strap on I think it looks really
nice bonus my whole laptop is in here
this is a great travel purse because it
does fit so much stuff inside of it I
believe it comes in multiple colors I
got the black because believe it or not
I don't have a long handle black purse
so weird what else is from River Island
oh here we go and we've got this
camisole I think it's so beautiful it's
black and embroidered so it's got actual
embroidery on it it's not just print I
think the colors are so pretty too so
you guys know my style pretty much by
now and I like to wear this over a
t-shirt as you'll see in the video I'm
just wearing this over a basic white
t-shirt I think it's like such a great
way to layer without you know being too
layered up and too warm I think it's a
really good option next from a river
island
is this one-piece bathing suit think
this is so cool it's got like the best
colors in it with lavender with a gap
right here and a class in between the
bra wet and then the back just has a
simple line I think the colors are cool
I love the style I love the print I wish
I loved all my bathing suits much as I
love this bathing suit makes me want to
throw all my bathing suits away and like
start over no I will get into my H&amp;amp;M
stuff which is only one thing formation
and I got this bomber jacket and I love
a good mom I mean obviously I have so
many just like fun details bomber
jackets I never let one pop up I always
grab it because it's so easy to throw on
over a white t-shirt and jeans it makes
your whole outfit so I grab this one I
love the colors I love the little Tigers
on it wait there yes and it's quilted
and it's almost like good satiny
material it's really nice and then I
love the glitter detail in the UM the
color and surprise on the sleeve too
I got a size two in this because
oversized I mean you can get you could
go like a couple of sizes up or even
like one size down and I think you would
be fine because that's just kind of how
oversized things work so have one pair
of Topshop shoes that I'll show you
today quickly and it is these boots and
I've been wanting a pair they go around
the ankle like this actually I've been
wanting a pair of white boots for a
couple of months now my father's and I
thought that they were more my style
when it's something that was white but
also fun at the same time so I just
thought this was kind of exactly what I
was looking for and like how the studs
are bigger than they get small so that
way it's not like whoa so Yocum so go
under Boop just like you know minimal
studs like okay those are cute studs
rather than like older stud I love you
too when we have I will do my three
people items my first Free People
article is clothing this
stop the tag back in there this like
suspender one be like cool again and I'm
going to like this is your nod to see
the video of what it looks like on but
it's basically you can wear the strap
either down or up over your shoulders
but I think it's so pretty with just a
basic white t-shirt or you could do a
white button-down with the strap hanging
down it's a little big on me in the way
so I had to take the tie and actually
tie it around and tie it in the back
this is really pretty roughed color with
black pinstripes
I know it looks kind of red in the video
but it's like a dark rust stays where
you're just running to the store or
you're like running shopping you want to
be comfortable and you just like throw
these guys on or easy to get off easy to
get on and next I got a robe let me just
tell you I have had the same robe for
like six years and it is I don't know if
I'm growing or the robe is shrinking but
it just keeps getting shorter and
shorter and shorter and now whenever I
have people over I'm like can you turn
around I have to like reach up and get
something like it's is this Ouiser to
light up the year now and it's gotten
shorter and it's just a wreck so I just
put it in the donation bet it's doing a
really good shape but it's just it's
meant for like a tiny person now not so
much like a grown adult person so here's
my new row got this one obviously from
three people it's like a long robe it
goes down to like pretty well past my
knees but I just thought the print was
so pretty it's like florally print and
then it has let me show you like this
stripe and then be the tie is that same
stripe print also and then it has falls
on me and he's cutting in my way though
they kind of like hit me and when I walk
but um yeah I thought this was really
pretty it's super lightweight and can
roll up into a small ball for traveling
so I had some bees Jeffrey Campbell for
free people shoot up and before you say
- are you laugh at me are so cute on
there like Princess Jasmine juice and I
just think they're so fun they're
actually a little bit more goals than
they show up in the video they're like a
true-true gold so I'm going to try and
we don't do tryouts for shoes because
when I hold them up you can kind of
guess what they look like but I will try
these on so you guys can see them so
you're going to bite your tongue at you
say you hate them so next I have a
couple of shoes from Steve Madden and
these are the first ones I becoming
Brown to and I'm already need to order
them there's so cute so they're just a
basic faux suede black and I'm like a
chunky heel and they're really cute
dressed down with jeans or like long
skirts okay so the display those
stickers on it yeah I love these
like I said they come in brown and I
want to get them to conserve like that
pretty tobacco II brown color so I saved
up those go with everything my next card
shoes from Steve Madden are leave guys
and I love these they're like a
espadrille platform that's the drill I
like the netting material I think it
like allows your foot to breathe when
you're walking they're so comfortable
they're so so so lightweight usually my
platform shoes like this or so chunky
and heavy but these are like really
really light I don't know I can see me
wearing these with like cropped jeans or
shorts and they make me really way
taller so that's always good he's also
come and black shoe I believe so it's
kind of disappointing when I got them
because in the photo there are more of a
tobacco Brown like almost like this
thing when you get them they're like
pants but I ended up like loving them so
get into my Zara stuff now I think that
is it for Oh from Topshop I got this
black belt I have it in silver the one
from Urban Outfitters but I found this
one in fold I think it's so pretty it's
just a good good basic like I mean it's
about you my first item from Zara is
this striped first think this is so
pretty was just like almost anything I
mean you can add it to any type of print
and it's just so cool I've said so many
times before you guys in my life
our locals know when you're wanting to
mix prints it's always good to start
with a stripe because it's just such a
good basic print that will almost
correlate to anything I had to happen I
was like this will be so easy to match
with so many things from Zara is this
two piece set this is the top and then
these are the bottom the it's so
lightweight - it's almost too
lightweight because it's almost kind of
see-through but I think with the stripes
of kind of hard to tell but the pants
are kind of high waisted stretchy waist
culottes and they're so it's so
comfortable I love this set together but
then also I feel like you could wear
them separately you know maybe do like a
basic t-shirt with this or a blazer or a
jacket that way you're kind of getting
into Cooper one actually or not because
I had to pay separately for both of them
so take that Chris from Zara is this
lace top I love this I think this is so
pretty I always like getting things with
texture or lace or something to like
elevate your top and of grabbing a basic
top maybe grab something like this so if
you're just doing like a basic pair of
jeans adding this makes so much more of
a difference than grabbing say just a
basic white t-shirt so I think it's good
to have a few of these stopped up in
your wardrobe next is lip sweatshirt and
I've been wearing this around the house
like nobody's business but it's so it's
like clanks on everything because of the
studs so like that's what I sound like
when I sit down in a chair mine's like
um that's nothing I'm sorry I love this
I think this is great for traveling
great for like running errands around
the house it is a sweatshirt I know most
of you guys are in hot weather but I'm
still in like it's supposed to smell
this weekend so I'm still kind of buying
sweatshirts to get me through the next
like couple of months where I think it's
also to be like you know not so on next
we have and this button-down this is not
just any old button-down this hasn't
opened back with ties
and I think this is cool I love this I
have like seven white button-downs and
only one of them it's like a basic the
other ones have like embroidery or like
an open back or you know a split back
something I just love button downs with
fun detail because I think kind of like
this top it's just good to throw on with
a pair of jeans and yet you've got like
a whole outfit because your top has like
you know something cool something extra
to it we have this little cropped guy
what did I get on it
oh no that's prints this is more this is
um this is a little cropped this isn't
like a full-length long top this is
pretty cropped it has two ties on the
side and it is impossible to get it over
your head I remember when I tried it on
I couldn't find one that didn't have
makeup all over it and so I asked for a
new one I'm so annoying at home and
trying it on and I was like no wonder
there was makeup because it is
impossible to get off of your head I
think it's cute with like high-waisted
black denim from black culottes it's
just fun fun little top this dress it is
black lips and like a ruffle gray
detailing at the bottom and then on the
sleeves also I really like the
silhouette of this dress I like how it's
you know a little flowy but straight
down and then you really get a full
effect to the details on the bottom this
is kind of one of those things where you
can wear a little dressier but then you
could also throw on you know something
like this maybe not this color exactly
but like a black one something like this
and then you have yourself more of a
casual street style outfit is don't
laugh this sweatshirt with the giant
sleep how many of you guys were like
sending me a photo of this on Instagram
and they were like this is so you you
need to so you you have to have it so
I'm in Zara the other day and I saw this
and I tried it on and I was like this is
so weird I have to have it so I ended up
buying it because it is kind of cool I
mean it's like cool and what sort of
ugly like what is that type of way and
it was really grown on me I think it's
good for traveling and more obviously
more like casual you know throwing on
with a pair of jeans and flats and like
running to wherever you need to go but
this is so my style
flowy comfy
leave go fire is this dress a sweatshirt
slash girly dress which is just so me
all into one piece of clothing I love
this song cuff a tighter long cup so it
kind of rushes this leaves a little bit
toward there a little bit billowy in the
arm but I don't know this is just one of
those easy dresses that you can throw on
with like a wedge sneaker or something
or you could do sandals make it girly it
just kind of bill whatever you want it
to be this is what it is so some Barra
is this yellow that looks funny and gray
at top or is that green like green or
gray I just thought it was so pretty and
I don't have anything yellow in my
closet I just don't think it's a good
color for me no still not a good color
for me take the ruffles on the sleeve
and I like how it's cropped with a
elastic waistband and also elastic
armband and make it as long or as short
as you want but I know I thought it was
a really pretty color with blue or black
denim next we have don't laugh
this skirt from Zara and I couldn't do a
try on with it because I need to get it
tailored it's so big on me it just like
falls off and oh well so I'll be I can
try it on I need a tailor that I will
try it on I love it I love all of the
colors I love everything about it I love
the ruffles you hate it just give it a
chance just wait till it's in an outfit
wait till it styles and then you can
judge me all you want but for now let's
just leave it as may be and lastly from
Zara are these jeans and I just thought
they were cool because there is a good
dark denim strip down the side on both
sides and then you've got a little frame
right here so I just thought this was
like a good basic pair of detailed jeans
that I don't really need but I got a
size you always ask me what size I'm
wearing in my denim I had a size 32
they're very comfortable they're those
like really release stretchy denim that
you know when you squat down and come
back up it kind of the denim
moves with you it doesn't stretch out
and stay that way my favorite kind again
all right I believe that is it for now I
hope you guys love this haul and a
couple of more things so I'm going to
wait until talking trends for the next
episode but yeah I hope you loved it and
