channel got music playing in the back I
hope that's not distracting they should
turn that off yeah the day I had a kind
of a smaller haul than what you guys are
normally used to I just kind of wanted
to go over a few things that I've gotten
recently some bathing suits some shoes
some tops one bag so uh let's go ahead
and get started first I have this little
crop top
it is a cropped billowy off the shoulder
top I just think that this is so great
with shorts and high-waisted jeans and
skirts this will be really good go-to
for summer and spring and it's so thin
and it's so lightweight but have a hard
time finding things that are like a true
crop so I always look for something that
comes up to you know like right here so
you when I wear my super high-waisted
stuff you can actually you know it give
you the look that you're going for it
for a highway so I love this and I'm
pretty sure this was pretty inexpensive
I think it was like $25 or something
like that you know for the price it is
I'll get so much use out of it from ASOS
well it's just a one-piece bathing suit
and I just thought this was so adorable
and so springy and fun and girly it has
some really nice ruffle detailing down
the bust and even down at the side and I
love the two different contrast of
colors of floral and then the back is
also cut out as well once I actually
have two pairs of sheers and I just
thought it was so cool because they're
all about being comfortable and they
were talking the other day and we
haven't been out walking in a while
because the weather's been so bad but we
were out walking energy and our feet
were like airing out of exam I got back
and I got in these you know from earth
brand and these are this really
beautiful taupe color almost like a
grayish color with a metallic silver not
I love these then I grabbed these
rose-colored kind of little slip ons
that are so comfortable I cannot tell
you how comfortable these are but I can
see myself wearing both of these with
like denim shorts a white t-shirt is
being comfortable walking around the
city
so if you have a vacation plan this
summer or you know we're going to be
walking around doing touristy things
still want to look cute I would
definitely check these out they also
have some dressier options as well I
grabbed these because you for you know
very much my style metallic you know
texture color so I love these and I kind
of have a funky arch in my foot
so a lot of the times if a shoe is very
flat I can't wear it I'm almost more
comfortable in like a black heel the
theme to actually have reinforced arches
for flip stabilization so I think for me
that's why it makes such a huge
difference
three yes three bathing suits from
Target so this is a crocheted
multicolored bathing suit it's black
with this like really pretty coral and
pink trim here is the bottom the only
thing that bugs me is that it is not
crocheted on the bootay why wouldn't you
just continue the pattern and I actually
just noticed it um so Ian X bathing suit
I have from Target is in this guy right
here and I love the bright colors I
think it's so fun yet the bathing feeds
it itself it's a really dark kind of
almost a lush green color but as
Anisakis neon flowers on I think it
really sticks out we've got a sheer
panel down the front and then kind of a
sporty or crisscross back which i
thought was really nice here is the
bottom it's got a the same sheer
paneling on the side same print and
everything and last target bathing suit
is this guy right here like a coral pink
tie-dye with a cutout in the front and I
love how the top is a little gate in the
front of an ascot you know the piece of
material going through in the bottom is
kind of the same idea
regular bottom this is a cheeky bottom
by the way so this is a little bit more
exposed exposed on the cheek so is that
a bit full target it's just military
style vest of love this like an army
green color with some major major the
handling going on down the front so it's
got the oversized military button some
really cool patterns here and in the
back actually has the same pattern and I
love that the arms and the color are
frayed I think it gives it a little
extra something necessarily know if I
would style it the way I have it in the
photo that was in the video that was
kind of a top that I grabbed and threw
over it so you could see what it looked
like but maybe something a little bit
more minimalistic I'll get a lot of use
out of this I really like it I got these
pants from Zara as well
they are super like high-waisted flowy
white light pants and I love them so
much I think they're really great for
work if you have an office type job
they're not lightweight they're kind of
thick but you probably want when you're
dealing with white I think the figure is
abettor these are great with even the
crop top that I'm wearing for something
more casual or if you're going to work
with a nice printed like top tucked in I
think would be so cute and so great for
work but I thought these were nice and I
don't know that I would keep the tie I
might swap it out for a belt or
something just depending on what I'm
wearing I thought these were great kind
of classic pizza having my wardrobe from
Zara it's this pretty pretty springy
summery dress I love it so much
and it's got all of these really
gorgeous embroidered flowers this is
sheer and then everything else is lined
but I just love all these ruffles and I
love that it's short you know when
you're dealing with a ruffle dress you
don't want it too long because then you
end up just kind of getting swallowed in
all this material so I like that it's
more like a mini type dress rather than
something longer so next I have one
dress from hmmm
look what it looks like it's like an
eyelet really really thin material
really lightweight material dress and
it's just basically in kind of the same
situation as Zara dress but you know
same kind of sleeve ruffles at the
bottom not on the top which I love I
think are really pretty black like 1/2
1/2 quarter half quarters and I mix that
up
yeah I'm pretty sure the longer bralette
a lace bra let I think would be really
pretty
with this type of dress missiles only
nineteen dollars I was really surprised
because usually they're you know summer
dresses are usually like thirty nine or
something so I thought that nineteen was
a really good feel for just kind of a
grab-and-go type of dress next I have a
rubber little jumpsuit from Free People
is a beige color it comes in navy but I
think I like this color because I'm
already getting a lot of Navy so and
it's got yellow Navy and it's like cream
color embroider all down the front pants
so I mean it looks like a dress when I'm
holding it up it actually just looks
like a curtain when I hold it up to be
honest but um it's not either wear it
off the shoulder like this or you can
wear it up on your shoulder to be honest
when I'm wearing it off my shoulder I
almost feel like I'm losing it a little
bit so I probably and I'm wearing it for
the long run will probably end up
wearing it on my shoulders but you know
kind of whatever you're feeling at the
time anytime I can find a nice flowy
lightweight romper always good to grab
because it's good to just run out of a
house throw this on call it a day
alright guys that is it for this haul
link everything below really quick my
self is from Zara got my little ruffle
game
jeans or hmm belt is urban or Topshop I
think they both carry this but um yeah
