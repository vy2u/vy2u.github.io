routine I chose Sun watch here comes
Celebi cuz I'm filming so I chose Sunday
night because I do have a pretty set
routine on Sunday night just because I
like to get ready for the week and make
sure that I'm set up for the week and
that I have everything in order a beauty
routine is a little different on Sunday
nights and it is during the week so I
just kind of wanted to share that with
you guys it's gonna be like a vlog style
like real-time nighttime routine so I
hope you guys like that I've been
running errands all day I just got home
is 6 o'clock so I'm gonna start making
dinner I'm gonna go change into my comfy
clothes first and foremost as soon as I
get home change into my sweatpants Ryan
is at the gym so it's just gonna be
Estella and me I'm you guys and that's
it go ahead and go get changed what do
you say
you say yeah butts are on you know it's
Sunday when I make my bed like this just
zero effort whatsoever got my Tommy
Hilfiger's what's yarn on these
sweatpants they're lit just little
ripped shredded sweatpants are you ready
for the best part oh yes pink and green
socks least they're not my Christmas
socks I wear those last Sunday
let's go starting with dinner I don't
know what we're gonna make but we're
gonna figure it out real quick I'm
thinking something to do I have some
Brussels sprouts that need to be cooked
and possibly like a veggie burger patty
of some sort - - the bun sorry for my
boxes where we're getting ready to move
so a little crazy
all right dinner is ready first layer
here is sweet potato and Brussels
sprouts grilled up and then underneath
here is a bed of cauliflower rice and
then this is my teriyaki veggie burger
by sweet earth they're delicious and
they have like 15 or 16 grams of protein
so I just had dinner it was delicious
and now I usually it's about seven
o'clock and now I usually just like to
hang out on the couch watch some TV
and do a little bit of work I hate
working on a Sunday but it's so worth it
to answer any emails that I didn't get
to on Friday or if someone happened to
email me over the weekend it's just good
not to wake up with a ton of emails on
Monday so I try to take care of as much
work as I can um for at least like an
hour an hour and a half on the Sunday
night
it's been about an hour ish and I go to
the bathroom and start the Sunday my
beauty routine I never missed this on a
Sunday I always try to keep it super
consistent even when I'm traveling I
love routines and so I always try to do
this one wherever I am so I am about to
hop in the shower but before I hop in
I'm just going to tell you guys what I'm
using in there well I like to get the
water super steamy hot and then I
dropped some lavender oil in the bottom
of the shower it helps with relaxation
and the whole bathroom is most like
lavender for like three hours afterwards
so it's really nice and just take off my
makeup I'm gonna use my bioessence
cleansing oil this just helps remove any
makeup any dirt any oil just anything
you key off of my face and it doesn't
burn my eyes which is the plus you
exfoliate I always exfoliate two nights
a week Sunday being one of them I'm
going to use my josie maran exfoliating
powder and this is basically just powder
that mixes with water and it turns it to
an exfoliator it's really nice it's
really gentle on my skin it doesn't have
any crystals in it i'm so it doesn't
scrub too hard it's just like the
perfect amount of exfoliator but i'm not
gonna take you in the shower with me and
not this time at least but I'll see you
when I get out I'm out of the shower and
on Sunday nights I like to do a mask of
some sort to put my skin on the right
track for the week and I usually like
half three that I'm pretty set on
picking from unless I have a new sheet
mask that I want to try to something new
I will either do what these Sunday Riley
is sold for acne treatment this is for
when I've had a lot of makeup on over
the weekend I usually try to go makeup
free for 50% of the weekend but for some
reason I'm wearing a lot of makeup I'm
if I have events to go to then I will do
that mask on
Sunday night like to do at the object
secret Indian healing clay love this one
I don't love mixing it with apple cider
vinegar because I hate that smell this
is a really powerful amazing mask for
three my personal favorite is in the
drunk elephant baby facial mask
immediate result I'm obsessed with it
I have to let this sit for 20 minutes so
while this sip I'm just gonna go tidy up
the kitchen and clean up from dinner and
I will be right back
timer is set for 20 minutes let's start
out with my Sunday Riley good jeans I
love this stuff this is my second bottle
of this I just like to Pat it on we'll
say it smells like pure chemicals nice
it's like chemicals and candy my eyes
I'm gonna use the belief moisturizing
eye bone I always like to end with a
serum of some sort just some sort of oil
try to stay away from the moisturizers
unless it's in the morning and I bout to
my makeup on but for the most part I
normally stick to it oil so I am using
the Sunday Riley UFO which is the ultra
clarifying face oil and this is for acne
clogged pores anything like that I know
about you guys but I go to bed every
night with the oïleus face on the planet
look for my body I'm just gonna use the
cope re coconut balm because my skin's a
little dry and this seems to sink in
better than any lotion that I've ever
used you do have a fake tan on do not
use an oil-based product because it will
break up the tan and your tan won't last
as long but I don't have any tan on
right now so I'm safe just washed my
hair last night I normally just wash my
hair Sunday night I'll like leave a mask
on for a couple of hours but I just
watched it last night so I don't really
need to do that
I'm gonna use my keys ooh honey infused
hair oil where I put this stuff on
before bed I always wake up with a
really soft hair my favorite times of
the night I'm going to put my PJs on I
like these little bra tops with the
matching boy shorts that's always what I
sleep in I always get mine from either
Target or gap has really great ones
they're super comfy they're just like
cotton stretchy they're amazing I don't
like loose clothes on me when I'm trying
to sleep I just feel like I get tangled
up in them and so I love stuff like this
you do have to wear sweatpants until I'm
about to get in the covers because
I live in a my apartment is like glass
everywhere and there are neighboring
buildings sure you can see like all of
these buildings and they can see
directly into this apartment I know that
because I can see them so I know they
can see me so I like to wear my sweats
if I'm like walking around for example
I'm about to go make some tea right now
it's what I do every night either a
peppermint or licorice root or
elderberry tonight I'm doing peppermint
because while listening for my mask I
did giant bowl of cereal and I'm so
whole so peppermint just sounds amazing
right now
head to the kitchen let's do that I
think Ryan's home from the gym so we'll
say hi to him hey buddy
all right so when I first get into bed
yes I have my pants on the sill I don't
turn the TV on right away I like to do a
little me time so I'll either read my
book or if I have some more work to do
on my computer with the magazine I'll do
that but right now I'm gonna paint my
nails first because that's always a
Sunday must-have is starting out with
fresh nails for the week when I have a
fresh manicure just fix and you feel a
little bit better if you that and then
I'm gonna do a little bit of work on the
computer got my tea my candle I always
have a candle going
I don't light it right when I get in bed
actually I always light it towards the
end of the day because whenever I'm
cooking dinner I want to be able to come
into the bedroom and it smells fresh it
doesn't smell like cooked coconut oil or
anything like that it's like a good
fresh clean smell
never
all right guys nails are payment T is
drink work it's done now the real fun
starts we're gonna brush our deeds clip
to brush in the rose gold color doesn't
make sure that you're flossing I'm using
the cocoa floss in the flavor orange
this is my favorite brand of floss
I'm gonna show you guys my flossing
because it's pretty gross like to do now
is turn my heating blanket on heating
blanket is on all the way and I turned
my AC down super low it gets super
snuggled up under the covers and watch
my Sunday night shows Silicon Valley
last night on earth billions fear The
Walking Dead try to get through all of
them but I end up falling asleep so I
have to watch the rest tomorrow
