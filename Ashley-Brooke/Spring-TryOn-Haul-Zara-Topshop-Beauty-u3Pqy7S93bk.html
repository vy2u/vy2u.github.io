today we are doing a pre spring haul and
this may be the first of a few hauls
this is just my Sora stuff just because
I've just kind of been stopping in their
eyes are getting their spring stuff so I
collected quite a few things that I want
to show you will be more hauls to come
with not you know as much as ARRA stuff
those of you guys who don't love Zara or
if you just you know prefer shopping
elsewhere there will be other hope
coming so stay tuned for that we'll go
ahead and start at the beauty products
first I have the colorscience
total eyes three and one renewal repair
and it's really cool it's got this like
really cold piece of metal here so it
kind of like you know deflates your
puffiness it has a really really good
color and I actually I've been putting
this on before my foundation stick to
hide my dark circles and it's really
helped me so I'll do this the foundation
and then my milk concealer over it and
it's like perfect second I got the a
replica lazy Sunday morning perfume this
is just a great smell it's not too
floral II it's not too strong it's a
really good every day perfumer they're
pretty pricey but this is one of those
perfumes that will stay with you all day
wax is the Josie Maran
milk Argan hydrating treatment to put on
before my makeup so I will mix this and
my Tarte h2o water gel moisturizer and
it really gives me like a dewy
foundation look which I absolutely love
so this is gonna be like a new staple in
my makeup routine next is something that
I have heard so much about but I have
not tried and it is the glow recipe
watermelon glow a sleeping mask you guys
love the smell of watermelon
diamonds good alright that's it for
tonight little my little beauty haul it
was like four things I thought it was
more than that but we'll go and get into
the Topshop clothes the first thing is a
shocker a floral and dressed love the
colors I love how it's got like three
tiers to it and it's got this really
pretty ruffle at the bottom but I can
see this for a pre spring with like some
cool black booties to kind of make it a
little bit more edgy and it's just one
of those really comfortable easy dresses
Topshop is this black balloon sleeve
crop top got like a laser cut on the
neckline I'm sure it's pretty thick
balloon sleeve and then it's got an open
back and it ties you can crisscross and
it ties in the front or you can tie it
in the back whatever you prefer
but yeah I just saw a little tops like
this for when I'm going out and I just
want a good basic black top that's
fitted but not so revealing so this was
perfect
extra Topshop is this printed wat I just
love the print I think it's really
pretty in it kind of looks like
equipment does really great tops like
this except equipment tops are like 250
like 190 ish so I thought this is a
steal and I love a good print and I love
these colors pink metallic sweater and
it's got these really cool blue sleeves
wait hold on do I have a problem
I probably have a problem but that's
okay I think Brand yaf and I know
Topshop sells this brand on their site
as well as ASOS but I know I just
thought it was really girly and fun and
kind of interesting I thought it'd be
really pretty with light colored denim
or this like really dark color denim we
are gonna do is our stuff now I have one
sale item and I really try to not show
you guys sale items because here in New
York I mean there's still like a whole
floor of sale stuff and I know in like
smaller Zara's and other cities there is
not as much sale so I feel like it's not
fair if I'm showing you something and
there's no way that you can go find it
or buy it but I grabbed this while I was
there it's just a really long oversized
denim and fast I think this is such a
good staple to have if you're wanting
like a light-colored layer or even like
a lightweight layer I think this is so
great over like a cream sweater and I
like how there is no collar it's just
kind of like a raw cut right here and I
really really love that this is a pink
dress with this like metallic and black
woven threads in it it's so cool but I
would do this with a black skinny I
would layer a jacket over it you could
wear it as a dress with some booties
it's just really really pretty and they
had other colors but I thought this pink
was super cool I've been like really
loving this kind of Mabi dusty rose pink
lately next is this little basic balloon
sleeve top almost looks heavy like
almost a sweater but it's not it's a
very light weight so I knew I could wear
this when it goes
a little bit warmer outside if I'm still
wanting that balloon sleeve oversized
look this will be perfect for days like
that in the fitting room I tried in this
top on with all of the bottoms that I
had in there and it worked perfectly so
I know I'll get a lot of use out of this
top so this next dress I wasn't 100% set
on but I got home and I've tried on an
outfit and they really loved it it's got
a full leather pleated bottom and it's
just like a blue really pretty pin
striped blue button top to it and it's
short you know so many layered looking
dresses like this but they're long and
it like looks weird but I like this one
because it's short I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna keep this because after I tried it
on with a full outfit I was sold on it
is this button-down and it's just a
really long oversized button-down and I
feel like you can't have too many of
this type of top in just different
colors and prints great for when you're
wanting a long layered look it's great
for when you want to wear it open with
something underneath it this is just
really easy you dress it up dress it
down I love tops like this and I thought
the colors were just really fun again
it's this really pretty pinky peach
color and I loved um the green and the
black mixed in with it isn't this top
and I was not sure about it on the
hanger I was like this could be one of
those tops that I try it on and I really
loved it and I tried it on I fell in
love with it I just thought that idea
was so cool I love the sleeves and I
love the color just a really fun basic
top it's just one of those tops you know
if you're wearing basic black skinnies
and you're just looking for a cool top
to wear with it you don't want too much
going on but you want something kind of
trendy and fun I think it's all like
this is perfect is this blue button-down
and I fell in love with this top as soon
as I saw it there's really not much to
it but there's details in it that
I just was obsessed with like I love
this oversized pointy collar I think
that is so cool and very like Western
and I really liked the black bold
stitching and the big buttons also has
as like a side gap on the side side cap
on the side little unique things like
this about basic just blue button downs
I think is kind of which draws me to
stuff like this who's texting me during
my haul X I have some bottoms to show
you this skirt this isn't a pencil skirt
but it's also not a full skirt it's just
kind of a straight down with a little
bit of body to it and again it's black
with a bold white stitching and this
really pretty like oversized belt kind
of already built into it just thought
this fit was really fun you know you
could like dresses done with a graphic
tee or you could dress it up with the
blouse and wear it to work so very
versatile super super lightweight and I
love that it's black and white some of
you guys are gonna hate but it's fun
love it Bermuda shorts they are like a
gingham Bermuda short something my mom
would have totally rocked in the 80s I
just think they're so cool they're a
little thicker too so they're perfect
for you know like beginning of spring or
even really just all up spring probably
a little too warm for summer because
they are so thick but even if you are in
a colder climate like right now you can
do these with tights and it would be
really cute what do you know another
pair from you two shorts
I just got basic black I don't really
have a dressy pair like this most of
mine are like cotton material with an
elastic waistband so I thought I would
get a dressy pair for when I do want to
look a little bit more interessed up a
little bit more professional I thought
these were perfect next is the color
that I'm obsessing over it's pink dusty
rose color they look a little
pepto-bismol II pink in the camera but
they are a true dusty rose color same
type of
sighs belts and they're just like a
wide-leg culottes it's gonna be perfect
for spring and I love this color with
black - I thought you rose and black
it's a really pretty color contrast I
think like the dark and then the super
soft pastel light of the two colors
combined is just really pretty in
eye-catching I love these I had to go to
another Zara to find these in my size
but they are it's the TRF brand
collection from Zara but it's basically
it just these black paper bag high waist
denim supersoft they almost feel like
cotton like they almost anyone feel like
denim it's like that really really
really soft denim such a cute fit dress
them up dress them down I never thought
I would get another pair of high-waisted
black skinnies anything other than bdg
because that's what I've always bought
but I tried these on and just like fit
me perfect they are super stretchy I
can't believe I'm cheating on my other
black high-waisted jeans but they're for
thing and they're also fading so it's
time to replace when you squat down and
you stand up and you your jeans like
stretched out a mile these are the kind
of jeans that just like suck right back
in I don't know they're bigger boy hat
because that's exactly what I needed
my other Baker boy hats are like leather
and corduroy very like winter so I
thought I would get one that is basic
plain
like nothing to it no texture no you
know thickness to it just a little basic
really mess my hair up there now I have
two pairs of shoes let's see first we
have these for spring I want the scylla
McCartney ones so bad but they're so
expensive
so then when I saw these I was like okay
these will do and they've got a really
nice toe usually on shoes like these I
hate or round toe so these are more
pointed almost like almond D which I
don't mind at all I think they give it a
nice look cute and they're actually very
comfortable and they're probably gonna
get super dirty so next I got in these
flats which I've been eyeballing online
for the longest time and they were like
the first thing I saw when I walked into
the store so I had to grab a pair
because I was like those are perfect I
will wear these so much and this is a
good way to incorporate black into your
spring and summer wardrobe is to you
know have a little pearl and there went
a little bit of color in there alright
that is it for for my haul I'm sorry if
I'm a little mmm like weird and being
kind of quiet but you guys probably
don't know this because I'm editing it
out but I'm literally coughing every
other scene like hacking out my lung I'm
trying to like talk really quiet so I
don't bother my throat and I just want
to give a huge shout out and thank you -
Ingrid and Katie who work at Zara on 5th
Ave not the one in front of Bryant parts
but the one by st. Patrick's Cathedral
they work at that Zara she was like can
I start you up any room when I turned
around she was like oh my god you're
actually Brooke I know it's like you
watch the channel and she was like yes
then she went and got Katie and Katie
came over and we were just talking and
they were honestly so nice
it's reasons like that that I only shop
at that Zara because the employees are
so nice and that's just two examples of
just like Jimmy Wynn nice people
one of the biggest RS and they have so
many employees and I talked to somebody
different every time and everyone's
always just so nice so if you guys are
in the city go to that Zara I just
wanted to tell you guys on camera thank
you because I looked for you guys before
I left but I couldn't find you to say
bye
so here I am sing bye and thank you and
I'm sure I'll see you guys again soon
I'm sure you noticed all of the tags are
on the clothes and I know I've gotten a
couple of comments before I think the
reason that the tags are on is because
I'm gonna return it all after I do the
haul but I've literally never done that
before
I buy it because I like it and you will
see it in future videos so it's really
kind of a stupid thing to say and if I'm
on the fence about something I will
always tell you like the one blue dress
I was like kind of on the fence about it
but we're gonna try to make it work I
wouldn't tell you guys to go buy
something and then I'm gonna go return
it that's like not fair I would never
make you spend money on something that I
genuinely like wouldn't buy for myself
and style myself so the reason I do
these halls is it's not like you know be
like oh look what I got it's so you can
see what I'm going to be styling in my
future videos three weeks from now if
I'm styling one of these items and it's
already sold out like I'm giving you a
chance now
if you if you like it to purchase it so
you can see how I style it and get some
inspiration for that that's always for
more info it goes sign over the life a
hair magazine URL is in the description
box as well as right here somewhere so
go check it out digital magazine that my
team when I create it gets the non at
the person each month and
literally has everything from like
beauty home lifestyle health fitness
fashion all shoppable links a team is
just growing our design team is growing
so it's gonna be really cool and excited
to see what is to come I'll see you guys
in my next video and I can't wait to
