got on this bodysuit from Zara like a
green and navy tie-dye jacket from Free
People it's got little waist ladders on

booties from Alice and Olivia and then a
little fun bag from Topshop

huh
I'm sorry that the camera is gonna be a
little shaky but I don't have the Jobi
stick on because I don't know if I can
take that into the concert yeah wait
girl see you later man
oh my god I was so carsick like I was
getting the hot flashes and my mouth got
dry so I was like I don't care how far
away we are I have to get out and walk
we don't know this area of Brooklyn so
you know I don't even know we just need
to take s3 and then you can take it
straight going on just texting misty and
I was telling her that I wouldn't wish
this upon anyone this feeling of being
so carsick that you can't even like to
feel your face
good morning Monday no it's not it's
Tuesday so confused because yesterday
was Columbus Day but yesterday was
Monday so I'm happy Tuesday I am about
to go run some errands I have to take a
skirt back to Zara to exchange sizes and
I could do a couple of other things so
I'm gonna take you guys with me we'll do
a little come shopping with me and for
some fitting room some things that I'm
loving that I'm putting on my wish list
I can't go just yet I have to wait on
Ryan he's at the gym right now so when
he gets back we're gonna switch Stella
he's on dog duty so while I wait for
Ryan I'm just gonna show you guys few
like three or four of my newer products
that I'm liking just to waste some time
oh I got this Tarte and actually a few
of you guys have recommended it to me um
but don't get in the trash no mixing it
with my foundation and it is the tarte
maracuja oil and i love love love it
I can't I don't I only have one hand but
basically it comes in this dropper that
you just squeeze and it's really nice it
helps with my dry skin some dry skin
around my eyes and it's really
frustrating so I've been mixing a little
bit of this and putting it with my
foundation see my next item okay yes so
actually my new toothbrush I'm really
proud of its from quip I'm sure you guys
have seen these I don't know I think
their marketing and their branding is so
beautiful you sponsored this part of the
video they sent me this toothbrush it is
beautiful and I love it and it feels
really good on my teeth because I have
sensitive gums basically it just has one
mode vibrating bristles and then you get
a 30-second timer in between that kind
of switches out which I love comes with
a wall-mount slash little travel case so
this is what it looks like when it's in
its case
you could stick to the inside of your
counter but since my next shelf is right
here I can't really use this so just
after they sent this to me I immediately
signed up for the plan where they send
you every three months new brush heads
new bristles to the dentist full of
months ago and she was just kind of
telling me the importance of switching
out your brush heads a refill plan you
can keep the beautiful toothbrush and
just get the head sent to you every
three months for the next 48 hours you
will get 15% off of your first brush so
go sign up and I know they have black
they have silver again I have the copper
color well girlie I really like this one
so I'll put the link in the description
box for you guys something else my next
