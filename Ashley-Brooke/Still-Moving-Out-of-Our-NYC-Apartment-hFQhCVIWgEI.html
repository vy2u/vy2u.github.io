guys happy Memorial Day weekend it is
Friday
I'm never staying in the city this again
you know during like Memorial Day and
like fourth of July the city's sewed up
because people are going to the Hamptons
are going to Montauk so the city's like
dead which is so great but I do think
that he and I and Swiss Iranian I think
he and I are gonna go over to the old
apartment this weekend and do some
cleaning some painting some moving
furniture before his parents get here
next week so whoa I'm not excited about
that like painting but I don't like
painting over like I like painting new
colors but I don't like you know the
painting at bat part living room news
I'm kind of basing this all over your
guys's feedback from my last vlog about
color schemes and furniture I talked
about this last lock but one piggy was
so nice I'm just really like helping me
out but she suggested a light colored
rug and putting under this coffee table
which you know I don't mind doing I
think that would actually look night
whole section is gonna be really light
as well there's not going to be a lot of
dark here I think I would rather have my
Island look funny pushed over than have
it in my living room so we're just
trying to keep it as far over there as
we can some of you guys were asking
where the big mirror came from and it is
from Restoration Hardware we actually
got it at the outlet and it originally
was like $3,000 but we ended up getting
it for 400 because it has a nick in it
right here so it was discounted that
much and then they were having like a
sale on top of a sale yeah all right I'm
gonna go sit back down and work a little
bit get to see Ryan soon I don't know
what he's doing right now but
seein a lot of you guys were asking
about my playlist on Spotify and I think
we're gonna make a life by her playlist
people keep requesting it so I think
we're gonna make a life by her Spotify
channel and do like work music workout
music so that'll be cool because it's
requested a lot so I think after this
next magazine goes out next week we're
going to concentrate and just get that
done in a day and then I'll release it
in the next YouTube video oh and a lot
of you guys been asking about my glasses
I posted these almonds of story the
other day and a lot of people are asking
where they were from and some of you
guys might have heard of felix grey i
actually partnered up with him for this
video because i really really wanted to
show you guys these design to filter
blue light and remove oh cool air is
from screens so i noticed when i worked
sometimes i go out to the deck outside
and i work out there and i don't get as
much of a glare from the Sun so it's
nice I could work with them you can't
even tell you know how blue light
filtering glasses are like yellow or
blue ones these are like cool we're so
you can't even tell that I'm wearing
them they just look like regular glasses
which is awesome I used to have a pair
and I just like they work so well when I
would catch myself in the mirror I've
just have like yellow lenses I'm like
okay no prescription necessary I need
reading glasses and I need glasses that
filter out the blue light but yet I
don't have a prescription so it's nice
that it's available for people like me
with those types of needs you free
shipping and free return so you know
it's always nice to try them out if they
don't work free returns but I promise
you'll love these

go by doing read to get Ryan some
medicine you all then actually we're
going to target because I want to go up
some nightstands but I don't want to
spend a ton on nightstands I just need a
white night stand with the drawer like I
don't care what it looks like so we're
gonna run by Target in New Jersey then
the apartment then we're gonna start so
let's go Brian woke up feeling worse

Cole
we stocked up on your meds then email
from u-haul saying that now we have to
go to the Bronx to pick up our band
it has all of a sudden the one we
reserved not available
that would happen we got the u-haul
situation figured out um after a 15
minute phone call so we're going to pick
it up from the original spot I was
coming right now
also if they dress I really so they're
driving through meatpacking right now or
not really be packing more Selleck
Chelsea
so here's Chelsea Market right here if
you guys come to the city there's a
really cool flea market inside of
Chelsea Market as well as like some
restaurants and then this is the High
Line right here I'm sure if you guys
have ever come to New York you will have
walked down the High Line it goes all
the way it goes quite a quite a ways
right and doing a great job and driving
all right I got to go because I am the
Google member
I need a target
these are delicious and then this is
totally new try these out
actually have better macros than blini
and Larry tells from my parents come
because they need to bathe and dry hands
because we need to dispose of things
chips that she's hiding in that other
trashcan she knows we have too many
chips already in this piece of art where
this is gonna go but we like it
so we drove all the way over here come
to find out they don't have them in
stock I should have called but it showed
that they have them in stock so now we
have to drive 30 more minutes back up to
the Bronx where they have 18 in stock
and
so that's what we're gonna do I'm sure
you're like why can't you just order
another nightstand online I looked so
long and I just can't find a basic then
my modern-looking white nightstand
with a gold knob so we're just gonna go
we got snacks water air-conditioning
decent music that's flavor by the way
who agrees
you do I like the jalapeno in the
barbecue but I honestly didn't know this
flavor existed until like last year
never gone back
alright that took us 45 minutes but
we're here like a target marshals combo
you guys hear that ice cream truck I
remember when I was younger
oh my gosh when I would hear that I'd be
like mom I need a dollar
man the hardest part though was like
what are you gonna get it well you only
had a short amount of time to decide
here's the nightstand what do you guys
think you're just cute and basic just
well we need Reina do get another basket
cuz they're huge
just targets crazy huh
so when I went to the bathroom I came
back and s was like I turned my back for
one second and her some lady picking
through my cart that's how crazy this
place is I know it's crazy in here but I
think we picked that out there's labor
involved in that clearance bro all my

I made my coffee films my intro for
today's style video it's a Sunday by the
way I went to Siddhanta at the Philip
video and realized I did not film an
intro or outro so I had to get ready
really quick shoot that and I just
edited the video knocked it out in like
two hours which is like record time so
I'm going I did the thumbnail and
everything so we're gonna go to the old
apartment we're gonna run some things

Home Depot and get some primer to paint

paintbrushes tar blue tape that's not
ours and a ladder Ryan went to go get a
basket so I'm just waiting on him ooh
glitter paint I'm in like crafty heaven
now I was really getting to make
something off the alarm elevator
I can't take you oh wait I was a little
too excited while you were gone
we realized we don't have a screwdriver
to open the paint came over here to get
a screwdriver and she's a looking at
tomahawks and reveals that she's
basically a serial killer in the making
I'll go ahead and tell them
my parents would never buy me one it's a
good reason him I was such a tomboy
though when I was younger I was like now
playing in the dirt I look like a
backpack leave the house and not come
back to a dark for like dinner sound
like Tom Sawyer partly because I was
obsessed with that Davy Crockett so
that's where my knowledge of Thomas came
from your extensive knowledge so
well that's too much for that second of
all I'm not gonna support tools so that
you can use is on me for harmful
purposes Thanks nobody knows this but
she goes into fits of Rage that she
can't control herself sometimes make
like rubber ones rubber tomahawks you
could be Thoren could before he has the
saw Chris Hemsworth on TV this morning

all right we're here now at the old
apartment and we just had a little snack
bowl with an avocado and trail mix and
some like our little like juices stuff
like that so now it's time to paint
hey team shirt this is one of Brian's
like old t-shirts that he gave to me
though
did you bring an old t-shirt oh no we're
going to paint this wall here and then
the bedroom wall but I think the first
thing we are gonna do is primer so we'll
prime it first
hey we bring the ladder and then we'll
go over it with color like this color or
paint tomorrow

just drop the other camera hit it
with that bad news teens and in my hair
but we are done and on our way back off
and that uber has paint in my hair where
Ryan was nauseating he kept we were
going down the highway so he kept
speeding so fast you can clearly see
there's a red light but he wanted to get
to the next red light just as fast as he
could so he would speed really fast slam
on his brakes then gunned it and then
slam on his brakes again until he was at
a dead stop and he probably did that for
like nine or ten different life so Ryan
I both were like oh I think like food
it's gonna make me feel better so I
think we're doing did you do that
