and I'm so excited I love doing clothing
hauls you know I'm in New York so every
store I go to has everything that you
can find online so it's nice to kind of
share with you things that I find in
store that might not be in your stores
that you can you know if you like it go
buy it online and all that good stuff
before I get started I just kind of
wanted to let you guys know that I'm
getting a little bit more serious about
my channel due to just growth and
subscribers and growth in requested
videos so I'm trying to step I'm not
trying I am going to set myself on a
schedule on Sundays I'm going to do a
how-to so I'm going to rely on you to
tell me what you want me to do and it's
going to be a how-to style so for
example my next one that I have coming
up is going to be a how to style denim
shorts you let me know what you want to
see Styles a how-to and that will be my
Sunday video and Wednesday is going to
be my vlog video day and then Friday is
going to be a wild card
so it's going to be something like this
it's gonna be a haul it's gonna be um
you know a hair tutorial it's gonna be
something that is just kind of
unexpected so that's how a mix I was
going to go I just thought I would share
with you so you would know what to
expect when to expect and I want to
apologize to my snapchat followers
because I was totally putting on like
this really awkward dance party because
I was so procrastinating sitting down
and actually filming my snapchat
followers got a little concert so if you
are one of the lucky ones you have to
see it let's just get started into the
video because I think it's going to be a
long one I've got a lot of stuff here
and I don't want to cut anything out I
want to keep it all everything's I wish
I could show you right now in piles on
floor okay so I'm gonna start out with
the tops and
first got this little sweater tank top
from Urban Outfitters I love this top
it's like a sweater material but it's
not super super thick it's very summery
and it's cropped I mean I'm sure you can
tell that it's raw because it's very
short the color palette was perfect with
all of the bottoms that I have in my
wardrobe already and I love the little
friend G's on the bottoms I can't even
move my camera cuz I'm like liquid here
this off the shoulder top from Zara you
watched my latest video yeah it's my
latest video my Texas video this was
featured in the video and I loved it
it's not like a little bitty baby
bell-sleeve
I took it to Texas because um we go to
our favorite Mexican food places and
it's like very like Mexico fun color so
okay my next top is also from Zara
another awesome my god that's wrinkled
metal oh that's cuz I washed it and then
I like laid it flat to dry so it's a
little wrinkled but you get the idea
it is a another off-the-shoulder crop
just plain denim very very soft and it
goes with anything I mean I can get this
point denims like a neutral this was a
good addition it's very girly and ruffly
and I kind of like that sometimes so I
love this
next is another Zara sweater
I love black-and-white stripes um yeah I
just do I really love to have outlined
in red I'm trying to add more red to my
wardrobe because I think it's really
pretty for the summer but I can't
currently find it he's like pretty red
anywhere I can only find like orange red
I loved this and in the back has a V
when I tried it on I had it on backwards
and I was like that's not really low V
for a sweater and then I got it home and
I was like oh the tag the tags in them
back and that's the back next it's from
H&amp;amp;M if I can there's so many straps to
this one where's the front okay this is
so good this is the top okay just
pretend like my head than this no let's
not pretend that because that's
confusing you're gonna get the idea but
I just like love the colors in this I
thought it was so pretty it's not like
blue and I don't know where I'm gonna
tell you what colors on it because you
can see it I love the ruffle detail on
the front and then the cinched waist
I loved the t-strap weight T not to eat
meat
I loved the V strap in the front I
thought this was really cute and just
very summery and I thought the colors
were kind of an interesting color
combination and I just have to say
actually
so haven't worn it yet I'm gonna wear it
soon next and not I just yell I'm sorry
that was so loud next is from H&amp;amp;M also
and it's a cold shoulder top so these
straps go over your shoulder and then
your arm go through here just thought
this is really easy to wear with shorts
in the summer just throw on a pair of
cute sandals and um you kind of dress it
up or down but it's pretty casual so
I'll probably wear it casual it's very
it's like a very basic top to wear with
shorts but it's got like really fun
detailing the sleeves
then the kind of like pleading right
here it just looks like it's really well
made and it looks like it's expensive
you see how much was it it was $24 so
really easy by and I think I'll get a
lot of wear out of it
Boop my next top is from H&amp;amp;M and I am
gonna be wearing it in a video so I
didn't want to show you guys yet but I
like had to because it's on sale for so
cheap and I didn't want you to miss out
on it in case when I shoot the video
it's not available anymore it is kind of
like the same style as the other one
it's got a shoulder strap and then a
sleeve
and it's got little ties on the side the
colors so pretty I love all the colors
in it and I think this could actually
carry you into fall as well so this is a
good purchase and it was $50 when it's
now on sale for 25 so I didn't want you
to miss out so I went ahead and posted
it um to let you guys go online and get
it I hope it's still there it's so
pretty so next we have dresses and
rompers gonna start with this romper
that you've probably already seen in my
Texas video as well it is this guy and
it's from Urban Outfitters and the
colors like this got like a little bit
of pink in it like a pinky red I guess
it's got embroidery on the sleeves I
love all of this color and the
embroidery and like obsessed with it
long sleeve but it's super thin it's
like almost like a linen material so
you're not gonna get so hot and I risked
it the other day and here it is it's not
like a whole yet but I'm pretty sure
it's gonna be at some point oh I got
this at Anthropologie and oh my god this
looks like a muumuu this is I believe a
bathing suit cover but I am NOT going to
I'm gonna wear it as a dress because I
think it's so pretty I love the colors
it's not blue
and it's got embroidery stitching and
then little mirrored details I don't
know the brand is because it just says
Made in India is that the brand no I
can't be right
I'll buy it for you my next dress is
from Zara and it's just a basic black
cold shoulder dress like a very roughly
flowy cold shoulder which I love I think
it's very girly and it comes in white
and it comes in black on it I thought
the black was a little bit of a safer
option what is this oh yeah this is a
romper that I got from forever 21 and
it's got braids detailing on the pulpits
this denim is so soft it's like it's not
that really thick like hard crusty denim
guess I just frosty you know what I mean
like crispy denim this is like soft
almost like cotton so it's really
lightweight it's great for summer even
though it's long-sleeved I usually just
push the sleeves up and add a summer
sandal they're not so short they're like
not writing out my crack like a lot of
rappers do it's like a good length this
was on sale for $14 at forever 21 and I
really hope I can find this one online
I'm not going to say that again because
I have said it at least four times I'm
just gonna hope I could find everything
online so moving forward
just know that oh yes nothing this dress
that I got from Zara sale and here's the
story behind this dress I'll make it
quick long story short I accidentally
got like peanut butter on my dress I
know my coworker was looking at me like
oh my god what's wrong with you
and I had to run to Zara super quick and
find something and I found this little
guy do I look like a giant seven month
old baby in this or can I make it like
kind of cute so I decided I'm going to
keep it it was on sale for $25 and I
thought it was you know really feminine
and um pretty so I kept it and I'll
probably wear it was like a little
fedora and some sandals and make it not
so like I'm a giant walking baby that
wears chokers a lot so my last dress is
something else that I got from Zara sale
oh I can tell this is going to be a lot
of work to put back together hold on
well now I'm sweating okay we're back so
I got this dress on Zara's sale and if
you guys have know they're having
they're like huge sale right now I got
this dress to wear in the fall because
it's pretty heavy and the colors are
like very fall but I went ahead and got
it now because it was 70 and it's now on
sale verse 39 I plan on wearing this
with like a black felt hat and maybe
some like black ankle booties to make it
you know very fall but I just thought it
was very boho and flowy and I loved the
little crochet detailing in the front
we've got one jacket to show you and I
am just excited about this just like for
life I have been looking for the perfect
denim jacket for me for about a year now
and I just haven't found one that I
liked and I wasn't going to settle on
one and I finally found this one it is
by Melrose and market and I got it at
Nordstrom it was like a more like $49 so
a great price it's got some rips in it
just kind of scattered everywhere but
it's so soft the perfect color is the
perfect length it's like a little bit
oversized but not too oversized so I'm
obsessed
that I want it to be with me forever
these super wide legs pants from Zara
sale also when I say wide I mean like
why or high-waisted and one of my
favorite parts was actually the string
and I normally hate things with strings
on them I usually just tuck them in but
this is like a double rope string and
they're not super long so you could you
can probably wear them with flat sandals
that might drag a little bit but it's
not so bad where you know you need to
get them hemmed yay next we have our
accessories you're probably gonna find
this really annoying that they're almost
the same exact belt um this one I got
from Tom Urban Outfitters this one was
maybe 35 dollars I can't remember but um
it's really soft leather and the
coloring of the silver is really nice I
love this one because I've spent it
looking and it's really good with any
like vintage t-shirts that I have so be
cute with my outfit today hmm I was so
excited that I found this one at Topshop
because I love the below the belt belt
that is so popular but I don't wear
belts enough to invest that much and
about so my first bag that I want to
show you is this is my favorite one from
Zara obsessed visit look at all the
pretty colors in it I like love this
super lightweight easy to travel with
because it folds into a ball the only
problem I have with it is that the strap
is goes down to my ankle it's so long so
what I did was I got two safety pins and
I folded it over again you're probably
gonna see it in a lot of my upcoming
photos and videos so I hope you don't
get too sick of it my next bag is
Michael Kors I'm a super fan of denim as
you know I love everything denim Chanel
makes a bag almost just like this except
it's you know a billion dollars found
this guy on sale for 50% off and I was
so happy this is a
rate statement bag to carry and it's
actually really big got three
compartments and then it's got a zipper
compartment inside well it comes with a
dust bag I didn't even notice that
but again the strap on this one was too
long for me so what I did was hold the
straps together and then I tied it with
a hair tie think it's still have some of
my hair in it let's grow the ball tip
right there love you my next little bag
is another one from Zara it's a little
bucket bag it's cute it's white it's got
studs a little fun bag the only thing is
like it's very easy for someone just to
like stick their hand in here and grab
our stuff have to be careful with this
especially in New York because you know
I've already had my wallet stolen once
and I don't intend on doing it again so
come luckily we've got this little guy
from Zara he's so cute this was thirty
nine dollars and it's got little buffs
on it which doesn't sound cute at all
I'm stuck with it I don't know I love
little funky things like this so you can
pick up your bug packet sorry comm I
guess that's it for my haul I will post
like I said for the tenth time I hope
try to find a link to everything and
posted below oh and really quick
snapchat long story short um I have my
snapchat on private this whole entire
term that in half snapchat so you know

peanut butter all over my dress so I had
to go to Zara and find something
