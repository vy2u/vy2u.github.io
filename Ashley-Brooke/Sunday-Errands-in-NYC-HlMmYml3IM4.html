did not walk one time yesterday
no it's Sunday what I meant to say was
happy Sunday
this is helmet weekend is gone I didn't
even know what today is honestly didn't
vlog at all yesterday on Saturday or
Friday but I was trying to get the
lookbook out to you guys which is out
let me know how you love it
I'm playing catch-up today like on my
whole life so a life catch-up is
happening now and where are we going we
want to Starbucks we're looking for
coffee are you want to go to Blue Bottle
just thought the lookbook lasted out so
we're so excited I think I like this
lift book then I better than I did last
month because it's more layering more
fall and I also added some inspiration
photos of myself and other bloggers and
celebrities who I think kind of portray
the outfit that I was going for so right
now I'm styling over the new boots
have you guys been asking for it so
that's happening today how loud is my
stomach growling
today many decibels I know I'm so
embarrassed when I get back 9
in the midst of shooting I need the hunt
for some food
today you are this is Marlon fantastic
gentleman and that's Ashley she's okay
this is why Marlon and I get along he
speaks the truth this is why we get
along exactly anything about that
I hate both of you okay bye-bye this is
what I'm wearing I've got on a oversized
white t-shirt a plaid shirt and my
leather jacket I've got some ripped
skinny jeans from Zara and then my Steve
Madden micro boots this is pretty much
my like please don't let it rain outfit
but I'm prepared just in case got my hat
on for our way to Best Buy I have two
Sony cameras have the a 50 100 and the a
6300 then I have a wide-angle Canon lens
to have an adapter that attaches my
Canon lenses to my Sony cameras
autofocus just doesn't work with the
adapter which is an issue for me when
I'm vlogging because I obviously need
the autofocus because I'm moving around
all the time we're going to Best Buy
right now to just exchange my Canon lens
for the Sony lens even we didn't get it
in the first place because it's like
five hundred dollars more and it does
the exact same thing but I'm just gonna
have to go ahead and bite the bullet and
okay the extra $500 because it's like
what's the point of having it if it
doesn't autofocus that's what we're
doing and then I think we're gonna go to
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond because we need a new
trash can and I need an omelet skillet
so oh and I think we gotta go to Whole
Foods to Whole Foods also cuz I'm
waiting on Ryan
chameleon hooked it up with the coffee
vanilla
x'q and coffee this is delicious I've
already drank almost all of it black
organic and I know there's an espresso
somewhere I think Ryan drank at all
so far I've just tried the Mexican wine
and oh my god it's so good guy lol kick
to it like a low spice
Ryan should I wear my hat or no that's a
great answer but I need you to be honest

was like Brian look for toothpaste like

that if I want my phone I'm probably up
