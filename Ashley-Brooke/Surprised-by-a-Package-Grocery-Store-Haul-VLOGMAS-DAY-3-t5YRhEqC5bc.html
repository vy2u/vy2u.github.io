thought of you because of your love for
stars you're truly an inspiration oh my
gosh oh my gosh look how cool this is
this is so beautiful it's star texture
its sheer this is from Karen thank you
Karen that like whenever you guys send
me stuff like this you absolutely don't
have to do that but whenever you are so
touched or inspired by my videos and
they just you know make you feel a
certain way then that's kind of what
makes me love doing this and just you
thinking of me when you see this stop
just I can't like there are just no
words to express how cool that is and
how grateful I am like I just wanted I
don't even deserve this so this is
really nice thank you okay so I just
opened
the best package in the world so a few
weeks ago I bought this brand called
drunk elephant and I bought the baby
facial because I've just heard so many
people rave about it and I've read about
it so I went and bought it and I
literally just opened this package and
it is all drunk elephant and I don't
feel good right now still obviously but
I am so excited in the inside I cannot
contain myself I've kind of recreated my
skincare routine and I haven't showed
you guys yet because I don't know I feel
like you can't rave about a product
until you've used it for at least at
least like one to two months isn't it
and so is the daily defense I'm so
excited because I just hear great things
about this brand and I had no idea that
this was coming in the life by her
lookbook on we do like a skincare page
in this the December magazine I did
obviously the skincare page and I always
do like a brand that I'm loving right
now and it was actually drunk out of it
so that's really funny how this stuff is
here now you guys for sending this over
I am beyond excited because so far like
with these two items that I use and
there's another serum that I have I am
like blown away by it so thank you guys
that is really so so nice such a great
surprise box is from origins another one
of my absolute favorite skincare brands
their charcoal masks is insane I love it
so much
something in here smells amazing what is
that I had no idea that origins oh man
it's from origins oh good very strong
smells like spring yes kind of but in a
good way it's like very um spicy and
very holiday it's a very high class
sprite holidays for a holiday sprite ooh
whipped body cream your souffle I can
smell the ginger for sure gloom away
grapefruit body wash and bubble bath
I love grapefruit can you wash I think
grapefruit and mint are my two favorite
scents of body wash nothing Smith's I
can't read oh and I just say that I
liked grapefruit and mint and then I
pull out a mint one this is from Sally's
beauty and it's a brand called so
gorgeous and I mean there is so much
stuff in here but we are definitely
going to be doing another giveaway maybe
a holiday giveaway this from Holly as a
New Yorker just starting out in
California fashion designer graduate of
Parsons and mother of two I wanted to
create current chic jewelry that is
effortless and affordable for everyday
style I opened my own independent small
business in the fall of this year with
the philosophy of making the light in
every person shine that is really nice
look at this oh pretty and delicate I
love little delicate chains like this
and I love I've been wanting a bar
necklace for so long but I haven't
really found what I like but this one
with the texture on it is so cool I love
this Thank You Holly that is really cool
and I will definitely be wearing this
this is beautiful
thank you so much I just can't remember
what they are oh so cute about this I
ordered this so long ago that I really
forgot what was in here so this was
gonna be like a surprise I got this
sweater with this oversized trumpet
sleeve but then look how the sleeve is
attached with this bar one end is purl
and Wanda's gold it's so pretty um high
waist
wide leg pants and they're just really
pretty I know they look kind of burgundy
in the camera but they're more on like
the brown side really cool with like
neutral tans camel even black gray
old green sweater dress I love sweater
dresses and this is actually really
lightweight so those of you guys who
were in I always think of like my family
and Texas like my grandmother and my mom
they have two about really thin sweaters
and stuff like this so this would be
perfect
hey this one is really cool I admire the
creation and work that you're doing on
YouTube I wanted to share some of my
artwork with you and share links here
where you can view me creating my
artwork and where it's for sale thank
you for all you do and the positivity
you bring to the world and she drew this
of the Empire State Building Wow oh but
look what she sent me
I mean how talented I'm gonna put this
one on the gallery wall sure I'm so
excited
thank you so much keep happy so I'm
gonna get a framing preemies and put
them in the apartment that is really
cool
and I'll put all of her info down below
really quick observation what I love
about drunk
elephants packaging is that everything
has like the suggested use where to use
it and tips on using it because
sometimes I feel like I get a skincare
product and I'm just you know I do
research on it but it doesn't come
directly from the brand so the fact that
they put this on all of their packaging
is really cool this night time I
literally feel like I got hit by a bus I
don't know if I'm sick or if it's just
allergies or what I just can't figure it
out Ryan was so sweet he like drew me a
bath earlier and made me some hot tea
and I felt a little bit better but now
I'm like wow I haven't had an appetite
like all day but I decided that I would
make the butternut squash soup I'm gonna
do I am wearing my main sweatshirt Ryan
bought this for me when we were first
dating because she said I was his main
squeeze and then I'm wearing these pink
shorts from forever 21
and my news jealous ox that Stephanie
got me they're so comfy we've got the
doggie blanket on the couch
Stella's being crazy as usual oh I'm
gonna
I hope this soup turns out good I am
super easy like there's very little
ingredients which I love and I'll put
the recipe below let you guys know how
it is in a little bit but I forgot shell
it at the grocery store so Ryan is going
to the store right now to get shallots
for me I felt so bad because I saw him
googling before he left what a shallot
look hi I was just too lazy to get a
food processor out still have the
plastic on my phone excuse me ma'am
everybody's been asking to see your
workout videos I think they want to know
what you're doing to break spoons and
ass I barely even tapped it traded uh
dinner's ready and we are doing super
fruits kombucha and here is the soup
Ryan tasted it and you like it
awesome awesome okay so I'll put the
recipe below I tweaked the recipe quite
a bit I don't know I just thought the
way it was it was very bland so I added
like a little bit more of everything so
you know when you make the recipe just
kind of keep your ingredients handy just
in case you need to add more syrup or
more nutmeg or something but um really
great recipe overall love the combo I
topped it with pumpkin seeds and then we
just did a side of avocado toast ready
to eat
okay so dinner was so good no I told you
guys that we would do like answer
previous questions from LA yesterday's
video but honestly like my throat is
hurting so bad
don't kill me but I think I will start
doing that tomorrow I'll do like I'll
try to do an extra long one at the end
of the day because I just like I feel
better now that I ate like my throat
hurts so bad so I'm gonna make some tea
and I'm gonna edit vlogmas and then I am
going straight to bed
taking that fam
