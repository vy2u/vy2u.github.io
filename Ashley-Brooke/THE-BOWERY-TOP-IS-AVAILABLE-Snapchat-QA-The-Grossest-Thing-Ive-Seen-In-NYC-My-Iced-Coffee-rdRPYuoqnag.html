tips for breaking into the fashion
industry and what degree I think you
need to get for the fashion for breaking
into the fashion industry you can't have
you know some kind of merchandising
degree some sort of fashion degrees that
definitely looks good on your resume but
honestly it really doesn't matter
tips for breaking into the fashion
industry like pointers just to add to
your question I am making a video I just
I want it to be right it's why it's not
out yet I want it to be perfect for you
guys and like the right amount of
information the deal without breaking
into the fashion industry is I think
that that term is really intimidating
apply for a sales assistant job at a
retail store trust me coming from
someone who has worked in this industry
for a long time they are looking for
people who are hard workers who love
fashion you don't even have to have a
fashion background to be in the system
somewhere that's how I started I started
at the very bottom as like a sales
assistant at Juicy Couture I applied I
got the job and I literally just worked
my way up from there where you could get
an internship you don't need to have a
fashion background to get an internship
so these two paths will take you into
the Bashan industry you don't need any
experience all you have to do is apply
next question favorite holy grail piece
of makeup you haven't used so regularly
you couldn't live without also when are
you coming to the UK so we can meet up
and drink coffee together I would say
my mascara or my eyebrow powder no my
eyebrow powder no my mascara yeah I
could not live without my mascara once
you put mascara on you could just have a
brush base and you're placed good to go

Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader and I wanted
to be a veterinarian how is it possible
that you're able to combine a full time
job with creating such a good quality
YouTube content any tips on
productivities do not have a social life

5:30 or 6:00 so I can have a little bit
of time to check my youtube email I will
go to work from 8:00 to 5:00 come
straight home and edit until about 9:00
or 10:00 and then I go to bed and then
just kind of do it all over again

you want to be in fashion so go for it
and we're gonna hit we're gonna say this
is from ham how old are you when do you
think you found your style I'm 22 and
would look ridiculous dressing the way I
want because I'm in my fifth year of
college leggings it is you dress how you
want don't think you look ridiculous
dressing how you want I am 28 and I
probably found my style probably my
second year of college I would like you
and when I was in high school and like
my first couple of years of college I
kind of dressed like like the norm like
I just kind of dressed how everyone else
dress I knew what my style was but I
didn't want to express myself that way
I had third year of college I was like

I want and that's what I really started
feeling comfortable in my own skin
