channel today I am kicking off a brand
new series on my channel as you can tell
from the title it is called talking
trend picking one certain trend sitting
down talking about it
styling it different ways to wear it
some inspirations on but it doesn't have
to be necessarily a new trend just a
trend in general so I am actually going
to rely on you guys to put in the
comments in these videos
what type of trends you would like to
see next so it's starting off I just
want to thank adavi for partnering up
with me for the kickoff of my new series
I'm so excited you guys love when I
partnered up with them last year in the
holiday lookbook so I thought what a
perfect brand to partner up with for the
kickoff of the series because they kind
of had exactly what I was looking for
for my first video so this partnership
couldn't have come at a better time it
worked out perfectly I'm you can tell
this video is all about free shoes
pom-pom shoes I've been seeing them all
over the place a little few cold
most days right now for me to wear them
outside but I really wanted to take my
hands on them and make this video
because I know most of the other parts
of the country are warm enough to wear
these outside let's go ahead and get
started
so my first you is going to be a little
bit more on the casual side it is
basically what you could call like a
pool flipper but also wear it with jeans
or denim shorts you know they don't
scream pool flipper right when you look
at that oh so this is definitely one
option if you aren't too crazy about the
all-over fur look or you know the really
dramatic look this is a really good
subtle way for you to get into this
trend without overdoing it I love this
gray color I think this is a really cool
color and if you're like me and you wear
black a lot I think this is a good way
to tone down a black outfit way i styled
this was super super casual justed jeans
and a white tee and it's going to do
something very casual
you kind of flip these on that's kind of
what they're meant for is just like it
slip on to head out the door but you
still you know about your cute little
pom-pom flat that I have is probably my
favorite two out of the whole bundle and
it is as this guy right here I think
this is so cool I love this one so much
a little bit like the other one except I
think this is a little bit more
versatile in your day to day wear rather
than just you know going to the pool or
the beach really good to incorporate in
your day to day outfits and I think it's
a little more versatile than the last
one it gives a lot more for than the
last ones but if you're going for a more
extreme kind of more dramatic effect I
think this one is a good option I styled
it you know if I were just running out
of the house I just did basic jeans
t-shirt denim jacket would wear it with
this top because this is such a subtle
print and maybe like lashing the jeans
that I'm wearing right now so see I
think this is like a cute outfit as well
white color denim black top I'm the meat
this is your first bite of a furry shoe
and you do want to go all the way
full-on dramatic effect I would
definitely go with this one so getting
into our dressier shoes I did this
lace-up sandal and it's just a tie
around ankle sandal with minimal for
around toe so it's not as much for as
the flat but it is still quite a
dramatic for a bet I did this one and
more casual them in a little bit more
dressy actually with the top and then I
did my crop sprayed hem dead-on like the
effect of these with a crop denim
because then you can really see the
ankle tie now if you're not crazy about
the ankle time you can always do like a
flare or a longer Jean and just kind of
have to tie up in there so you just have
this right here I really like the effect
of this I think it kind of make the
whole to come together and makes it more
like a casual daytime sandal but also
versatile for night as well don't get me
wrong but this is something that I would
wear it during the day to go the second
way that I styled this is with some
printed whiter cool up camp and then
more of a casual top and that's
something that I can probably wear right
now I think
I'd be warm enough for me to wear right
now just to show that you can do a print
and a sample bottom and then these and
it's not too overwhelming because these
are a little bit more simple you know
basic black feel smaller detail fur and
then ankle wrap I think then being black
really helps as well if you have a
lighter one on it it does look a little
bit more dramatic because it is you know
what the eye automatically goes to but
with black it kind of blends in so it's
it's a little bit more hidden in
camouflage with what you're wearing and
the next shoe that I have is this beige
kind of tan beige almost like a blush
color actually heel and this is pretty
dressy this is not a date times two this
is definitely more of an evening to You
Know Who am I to say what time of day
you can wear these you can definitely
Rockies with this here I would wear it
with what I'm wearing right now you
could wear it during the day but I would
kind of stick with this more of a
nighttime sandal I actually did this
with a floral top to kind of bring out
the lighter colors in my tops it was a
black floral top with a little bit of
pink in it so I really wanted to bring
out the pink with this shoe know where
whatever color denim you wanted that you
could do grey black blue and I think we
always gravitate towards a black shoe
but I think it is important to have more
of a tan color in your wardrobe to
really lighten up your outfit and bring
out different colors that you might be
wearing in your talk all right so and
that is going to be it for my first oh I
forgot what I named the series talking
trend it's going to be my first video
for talking trends I really hope you
love it I don't really know how often
these videos are going to be you know
how to Styles have been every Sunday or
as long as I've been doing them but you
know I definitely want to try to make
this like a 1/2 month type of video you
know there are only so many trends to
talk about so you know I am going to
rely on you to send me requests also
want me know in the comments what you
guys thought of this video what you
liked what you didn't like you know I
really want to make this for you and I
want to get your feedback on it I think
this is going to be a great fear
I'm so glad I started out with you know
such a trend that is a little bit newer
you know this wasn't really around last
year as much as it already is around
this year so this was such a good topic
to start off with apple cider vinegar
hmm but yeah you guys can definitely
expect these in the like my hair look
book coming up see the new one releases
