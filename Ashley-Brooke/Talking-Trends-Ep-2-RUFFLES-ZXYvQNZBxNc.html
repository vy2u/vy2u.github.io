episode of talking time I am so excited
that you guys are loving this series I
got so much good feedback on the first
video that went live earlier those all
of the comments below you guys mostly
requested that you wanted to see ruffles
and I was so excited because you know my
style I think you guys just knew that I
was getting really excited about that
because you know I love ruffles so I was
really happy to do in this video this is
the reason that I'm doing it is because
you guys gave me amazing feedback so I
really hope you're still loving it I
love doing the series I'm so excited
about it so let's go ahead and get
started into video I think in this
videos you'll notice that rebels aren't
just a girly trend you know they there
are ways to incorporate rebels into your
wardrobe if you you know have a little
bit more like a casual cool vibe rather
than such a girly vibe you know one
thing I love about ruffle tops is that
you don't need to worry too much about
what you're wearing on the bottom
because the top is your statement piece
is to what people are going to be
focusing on you can play with your
accessories you know add some jewelry at
a fun bag or shoe but for the most part
I just think the key focus is on the top
if you have a few options to show you
guys that I actually styled so let's go
ahead and get started
very first look that I did was this
ruffle sweet top from Zara I absolutely
love this top you guys know I love
anything bread anything striped so I
like had to get this I loved it so much
I I wish I had a camera showing you guys
me trying to put this on in the dressing
room for the first time was had like a
panic attack I was so stuff I couldn't
figure it out - carrot it with some
basic white trousers just to kind of
dress it up a little bit I know you guys
like when I show work appropriate
outfits the good thing about this top is
that you can do it dress up or dress
down
it's a dressy enough top that you can
wear to work but you could also throw it
with some mules and I'm done I'm short
pair of shorts and it's you know a
casual day
for my second outfit I did this is like
a more relaxed top this is just like a
basic cotton material and then it's got
you know a really fun rough will go and
diagonally across the Sun is really
bright so it's kind of like whiting out
all of my wife and I actually paired it
with the jeans that I'm wearing now so
that wasn't that wasn't mark these are
from H&amp;amp;M they're just a basic pair of
ripped jeans and then I wanted to add a
fun color so I did do a yellow mule from
Lulu's I'm so glad that they're coming
out you know quite a bit this season
because they were so comfortable and
they're so easy to just slide on and
check out the door they come in fun
colors so I just thought this was a
really fun outfit with some denim
my next stop which is probably one of my
favorites is this gray or this black
it's kind of like a washed out black and
white striped sleeveless I just thought
it was so pretty it's so girly and it's
so fun did put it with some black skinny
jeans just because I wanted to show that
you could make this top a little bit
more edgy definitely like you know go
all the way into it with like a skirt or
something but I just wanted to do it a
little bit more casual with a pair of
black high waisted jeans
I think this top could go dressy daytime
or nighttime casual or dressy so yes I
have loved this one I think I'll
probably get the most use out of this
one because it's lightweight it's
sleeveless and I think it'll be good for
carrying me all the way
for my laptop little bit more on the
girly science I was so excited because
it has this big suite that I like so
have to get this ayah styled this with a
basic pair of blue denim because I love
blue on blue especially when they're you
know two totally different colors of
blue I think it's really pretty
then I did just a basic new color mule
because these guys pretty much go with
everything I thought black would have
been a little too harsh for this so I
went with more of a neutral color which
I thought was really nice those are the
four pieces that I pulled the rights for
the talking trends ruffle all edition I
really hope you liked it and let me know
how you're liking this series if you
want it to be a little bit longer with
more items or more outfits you guys just
let me know it seemed to really like the
last one so that made me really excited
because this is something fun and I
think really informative as well I
really just think that this goes to show
you that ruffles aren't just meant for
more of a girly sense of style you can
have more of a chill cool casual style
and still incorporate the ruffled trend
into your everyday outfit without being
so over-the-top will be more ruffles in
the light biker look look I know every
month I asked my facebook group what you
guys want to see this lookbook and a lot
of you said ruffles and embroidery and
stuff like that so you will definitely
be seeing more ruffles
so get ready I think I'm going to do a
whole page on ruffles actually I started
on it already it's going to be good I
mean if you want to know more about be
life by her community and Look Books
just go here to check it out that is all
I have for you guys until next episode
of talking trends or I guess just until
my next video I will see you and
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel today I have teamed up with csw
to show you guys some of my favorite
spring trends when it comes to shoes I
absolutely love spring and summer shoe
trends because I feel like sometimes
that makes your outfit when it comes to
style and fashion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
