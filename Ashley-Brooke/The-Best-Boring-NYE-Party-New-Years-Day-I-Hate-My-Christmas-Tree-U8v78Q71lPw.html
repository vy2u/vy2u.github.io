December 22nd whoa Wow and I am leaving
to go to Texas today for Christmas to
see my family I am so beyond excited but
I absolutely hate hate hate flying so oh
and it's raining and I'm nervous as it
is so I'm just hoping that my sleeping
girl kicks in as soon as they get on the
plane I just sleep through the whole
thing that would be ideal and it is so
gross outside that I just can't I just
blow dried my hair and I'm not even
gonna bother with putting makeup on
because you know it's just gonna be my
casual Airport look taste so you'll be
lucky if I actually put real pants on
really quickly I went to go what is
happening I went to go check the mail
earlier and look how cute my mail lady
gave gave everyone a Christmas card
so I'm just like super super comfortable
nike's just like I like sleep in these
pants sometimes I don't know they're so
comfortable I'm just kind of an
oversized sweater and my denim jacket
with the gray sleeves it is definitely
over 50 pounds
the food in the new year D'Argo's
okay let the truck on the ground no it's
gonna fall off before it that's not a
good idea that's just bad for control
skills
it's terrible just put all in the fridge
but I'll take care of it
in your mouth you know start in your
mouth perhaps we're having the best New
Year's this year we decided to stay in
tonight because we live so close to
Times Square and getting home and after
if we if we were to go out getting home
just wouldn't be an option so we decided
to stay in and we invited our friend
Kevin over so we're having a three
person party and it is off the chain
right now so yeah going out in New York
on New Year's going on in New York in
general is expensive but going out on
New Year's Eve is crazy so we are
hanging out here making tacos and
brownies it's 1142 we have 20 minutes
until the ball drops and then what
really can I go to bed or this isn't the
song
what do you mean is it a wine-opener not
like a pop wait how does it go like what
can happen I don't think you but what
you need to twist you you trusted energy
model don't
it's like wedged in there wait it's
working Oh what I said is working no I
don't think I'm afraid it's gonna
explode in my face
am i one two three the most uneventful
anticlimactic thing ever that keep doing
that keep doing that twist you're not in
charge of that anymore
you can see the Statue of Liberty oh
right where's my finger
right there is the Statue of Liberty and
that's a family you see the perplexity
I've been watching Ryan Seacrest for the
past couple of hours
what did he do to his hair I think you
had a perm what's different about his
hair it's wavy I think he's doing
actually really here no it's like
actually I hope we didn't bore you with
our New Year's Eve party
your hair is poking me in the eye good
night right Happy New Year everybody
it is January 1st and I am so tired and
I have a cheap champagne headache
but I am gonna head out get some coffee
and run just errands and hopefully try
to make this day productive so I can
hurry up and get back into my PJs and
relax at home Ryan is in bed watching
Kathie Lee and Hoda so he's quite
comfortable and he is not going out with
me today he's gonna stay in and do some
work and then go to the gym later mom
you have fun watching Kathie Lee and
Hoda I also live kind of right by this
club and usually on like Sunday Sunday
mornings and Saturday mornings there's
like hair extensions
and like how common just like the gross
stuff so I'm interested to see after New
Year's Eve what is going to be down
there just a quick thought it's so nice
when people hold the door open for you
just get off the train I'm uptown be
central park behind me and I really want
a lemon stone from Magnolia Bakery
they're so good if you ever come to the
city you have to go to Magnolia I'm get
the banana pudding because it is amazing
forget the cupcakes don't get the
cupcakes you're gonna get a cupcake go
to sprinkles or Billy's cupcakes in
Midtown they're so good magnolias are
like but they're banana pudding
so I decided to and it just sit on this
bench and eat my stone cuz it feels so
good out here I'm kind of scared though
because last time I said on the spinch
this man came up and sat next to me and
started talking to me about the New York
Stock Exchange for like 30 minutes and I
was like I don't know what you're
talking about at all not even a little
bit just waiting for him to like pop out
from around the corner yeah we're going
to the gallery just alive Ashton I had a
20 minute conversation after she went to
get a snack and that's what's going down
left the fridge open the whole time oh
it is it no sometimes when you close the
fridge it just opens back up on its own
it's it's a ghost fridge that's where I
closed I've heard that excuse used it in
like trials it's worked before what
let's just let's take a look oh wait no
okay yeah what yeah if you don't even
don't even close it yeah does that
whatever it doesn't matter and I closed
it okay we all believe you this is why
you don't wait until your tree is
dead at the door now to take the lights
off oh my gosh
Ryan is going to murder me right yeah
come here come here are you mad at me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
