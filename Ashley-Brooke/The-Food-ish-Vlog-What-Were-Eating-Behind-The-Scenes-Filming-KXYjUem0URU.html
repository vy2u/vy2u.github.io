talk about food in this look I thought
since it is breakfast time I might as
well show you what I'm having so I was
thinking of doing some oats like all out
of peanut butter fruit coconut flakes
all the good stuff and then some avocado
tones because I'm proving something
sweet and also something a little salty
stuff
so we've got our avocado toast with salt
pepper roasted tomatoes and our almond
butter oats with all the good stuff
blueberries coconut white strawberries
bananas granola and then I just made
myself a little almond latte it's a
little late in the day so I added the
toast to make it a little brunch ish so

some editing to do here is not here and
brian is on a call so it's just me I
don't like take off all the room on the
table
normal ants but you know Sarah Ryan and

like cleaning up the whole table and
another good reason it's like too much
fixer-upper when they're here they just
would look to the music and I want to
