need some new panning stuff I didn't
even get to properly show you guys my
head so here's my hair
we took the balayage all the way not all
the ways but really far up to the top
just because it's less maintenance when
it grows out so it's a little blonder
but I love the grow out process when it
starts growing out and looks a little
bit more faded but my stylist did beyond
that was my first time going to her and
she's amazing I recommend her to anyone
who's in the city she's just awesome her
Instagram is at hair throne but I'll
link all of her stuff below um she

amazing so if you're ever in the city
