I was like vlogging yesterday so I can
get a head start but then I just stopped
blocking and forgot I actually came home
- let's tell it out and take her for a
walk and then I just forgot my camera so
that's kind of what happened but it is
officially vlogmas day 1 it is December
1st and we are meeting my grandparents
downstairs we're gonna go to the Natural
History Museum of Natural History I've
been there once and it is literally the
coolest place ever
like totally geek out there there's so
much to look out so we are gonna do that
come back at some point get the lookbook
out oh my gosh I have just been kind of
like farting around not this month I
mean I haven't been farting around but
with the holidays it's just hard because
you know I was at home with my family
and then my grandparents are here so I
have just kind of been staying up till
like 3:00 a.m. and getting up at 5:00 to
work on the lookbook
so I'm so tired and I'm so happy that we
finally finished
I think Jenna's still working on her
section but she's almost done
so I'm gonna go out I'm complaining that
I'm so tired because of the lookbook and
stuff but I totally did this to myself
but since it's vlogmas then we're
vlogging everyday you guys have to hold
me accountable and make sure that I'm
working on the lookbook
every day this month I am wearing my
men's bomber jacket from Zara my hat
high-waisted jeans my chain boots and
then my patent navy bag Hey
blog with day one how do you feel
excited oh stop it up Bernie knows he's
using it you guys
Brian's allergies not a big commercial
you know what I haven't even done the
intro like the Christmas Eve

the breeze from glaciers
I'm convinced that some of these they
just went to the desert and just shipped
out some of the kind of a mound and was
like feel behold behold behold no just
kidding

here I was like wait why was sitting
here what's going on and I just really
enjoy sharing a chair with you mm-hmm
you know what I should do one day this
month instead of doing like a vlogmas
maybe I should do a recap of all my
favourite moments of last year's lovelyz
click on a day we're traveling or
something and we don't have a lot going
on okay and so your deal is processing
are you so excited about the lookbook
hey did you do that think maybe you did
oh okay the look book is that these can
you believe that this is the last
lookbook of the year we decided that we
would stop calling it a lookbook because
it's not and people are getting confused
thinking that it's like the same thing I
do on YouTube it's literally like a
magazine except you can shop from it it
is it's not like about using it it's
like a full-page on party where party
wear holiday party outfits home decor
recipes some of our favorite like vegan
youtube channels what else we do Beauty
skincare for winter yeah so there's like
it's told it's like not just fashion but
we're getting confused on like the
lookbook because they're like is this
the same thing you do on your YouTube
channel it's just subscription-based and
I'm like no not at all like it literally
has nothing to do with me and my YouTube
channel it's just a digital magazine
that we create every month so but I
think everyone's loving we've already
had a few people say that this is their
favorite edition so far so that's kind
of a big
Jenna said that this one was her
favorite pink my favorite with October
October's look look I don't know there
were a few pages that I really loved in
this I'm gonna put the link will be down
in the description box but you just go
to life by haricot slash lookbook and
you can check it out and if you sign up
like you'll get December's lookbook
immediately sent straight to your inbox
I don't know I think this was my
favorite is the tie between December's
and October's but if you want to see
October's you can whenever you go sign
up for the lookbook you can get the past
magazines just let us know or is there
an option when you're going through the
process to down to get the last month's

week came back my grandparents were here

fridge and I don't think it's ever been
so empty this is all bread down here
it's like bagels bread butter peanut
butter strawberries coffee that's pretty
much it so there needs to be computed
there needs to be a whole food grocery
store run anyone know a trick to make
sure to get the start over and speak
English can anyone get the stuff on the
bottom easier than having to do this is
there a trick I don't know about
actually make more sense if you sit in

just little food for thought boom it's
the biggest creeper I've ever met in my
life
hi creep she blends blends in with the
rug monticello roll over
I'll show you tell them about the
cinnamon people need to know I just
learned something so in the US if you're
eating cinnamon on things it can be like
one of a few different kinds forces if
you're in other countries it's labeled
at like the good stuff is labeled Ceylon
that's the good stuff the other stuff is
like cassia mineral element whatever in
it that's been known to do bad stuff to
your body for cinnamon you always want
to be eating the Ceylon kind and this
brand makes this a long time but this
isn't it because we have no idea this is
just cinnamon so it's got the cassia
stuff yeah it's got the the cassia
version they make one that says Ceylon
cinnamon
it's like bro where are you gonna make
two types why can't you just make the
good stuff now we gotta start going
after the Ceylon cinnamon just left on
amazon we can buy a pound of it for $18
I don't need a pound of cinnamon
everyone needs to count us in a minute
we're gonna know love day one

that you would like to see us do for
vlogmas tomorrow we're gonna run errands
