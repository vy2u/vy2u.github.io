we discussed a lot of business type
stuff I would say if you're interested
in learning more about business or
planning out your goals things like that
get in front of a big white board like
this and write it all out more clarity
to understand exactly what you won't
accomplish and what's going to take to
get there
there's a lot of girls that have been
asking you about that like yours doesn't
this find me to do my own thing and
follow my goals well you need to get
clear on them get on board and write it
all out and the most important thing is
to take action I don't you know that's
but I have a new card holder yes you do
pretty sure she's gonna cut everything
I'll shut up of the video what's up guys
so since Taylor hasn't gone Ryan and I
have just been playing catch-up on work
stuff and we spent all day yesterday as
shooting how to style I had to finish up
today because we ran out of daylight
yesterday what are some snow boots and

latte
yeah no so I'll do a quick demonstration
of our new espresso make purse oh yeah
use the Starbucks espresso roast I've
been using just the plain white coffee
but this is actually my first time using
the espresso rose so we will see how
that goes
the reason Ron and I decided on this one
is because it makes lattes and
cappuccinos buy this espresso maker plus
it also makes just a regular drip coffee
so it was really hard for us to actually
find one that makes both and this is not
a sponsored video so Ryan has his drip
coffee going and I'm about to make a
latte just packed my coffee into don't
know this is home
I always put a pump of my vanilla okay
fine maybe two pumps and there we go
