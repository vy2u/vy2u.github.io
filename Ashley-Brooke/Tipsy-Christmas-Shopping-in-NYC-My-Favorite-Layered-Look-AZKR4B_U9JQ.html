morning guys it is Sunday morning at
6:20 and and I woke up super early so I
could get yesterday's smugness edited so
I can go Christmas shopping and not like
a full day of Christmas shopping no
editing no work so here we go
okay it is 9 o'clock and I just got done
with vlogmas it is now uploading to
youtube I don't know if I'm gonna put
makeup on because I'm on day 3 of micro
bladed eyebrows and yesterday it was
just a little too hard to take off my
makeup around my eyebrows and even just
like on my face so I'm just gonna go
with no makeup today but I will show you
some products that I used in the winter
time when I'm not wearing makeup and
then we'll do outfit and head up gonna
do is wash my face I do this every
morning before I even put anything on I
just wake up shower and definitely wash
my face
for the products that I'm gonna put on
my face first I'm going to use the Tarte
h2o this is so moisturizing and since I
am going to be out in the cold I want to
make sure that my face is protected and
I'm going to used my belief I bomb to
protect my eyes from the wind and the
cold because I know I've told you guys
so many times that I have the biggest
issue with dryness and redness around my
eyes then since I am going to be outside
most of the day or not for mostly for a
long period of time I'm using the dr.
jart tiger grass cream and this is for
soothing redness and itching due to
dryness
it is a thick almost clay like texture
and feel and it's really really
hydrating and moisturizing and it makes
my face feel really good but my face
just gets so windblown and chapped and
red and this really really it makes a
huge difference I did just get my
eyebrows mic related I'm gonna put my my
medicine my appointment that she gave me
on this Wilma have nice and greasy
eyebrows to bear
okay so now it is time for the outfit I
haven't actually partnered up with
Express to show you guys one of my go-to
outfits for holiday shopping and being
warm and comfy and stylish at the same
time so thank you guys from Express for
partnering up with me I actually have
found my new favorite winter bomber
thanks to you guys it is so cute I'm
obsessed with it
alright so I'm a big fan of layering so
I am gonna layer two jackets and a
sweater these are my two jackets from
Express I told you guys look how cute
this is it's got two different textures
and almost two different colors this is
a little bit more on the peach peachy
peachy side more on the cream side but I
mean it is so cute and it's got balloon
sleeves my favorite it's cropped I'm
obsessed with this so I am doing this as
my very top layer underneath that I am
wearing this faux leather jacket but the
good thing about this is that it's long
so this kind of sticks out a little bit
when you put this on and I haven't
decided if I'm doing a cream top or a
black top underneath but I'll decide
when I tried this on then I'm doing my
black denim and then I'm doing these
shoes also from Express I have been
looking for a pair of lace-up kind of
edgy wintery boots and since these have
the faux fur I thought they were perfect
so I'm doing these
so here is my final look at my two
jackets on and I really love the layered
look of a long oversized leather jacket
under a cropped jacket I think it gives
you kind of a really cool layered look
this is gonna be a problem because it
keeps slipping off my shoulder so my
switch my bag out so I've got on my
cream shuttle neck black high-waisted
jeans my faux fur around the ankle boots
are so cute and there's still a little
bit of ice and they have really good
traction on the bottom and I just did a
super messy pony with my faux leather
Baker boy hat to kind of tie in the
Express jacket so yep this is what we
got going on today and I'm definitely
gonna do a scarf because it is pretty
chilly outside so I'm gonna do this
cream scarf that I've got
be part of a bumper
I am a poor boy too so we just said it
to stop it get it most of this floor is
actually like the safe zone that's less
crazy yeah this floor is good so we
decided to take just a quick break from
shopping so we are really just
downstairs so we're gonna go mimosa I
think we're doing good I have my
Christmas list of everyone I need says
tackle Christmas shopping
please number two I'm a little bit tipsy
I had one mimosa I'm a little bit tipsy
so I don't know if people are gonna get
really great gifts they're really shitty
guess what very common you gettin tipsy
after one drink I mean you guys I never
drink so after one mimosa
distance but you still catch my okay I
think we are about to wrap it up here
we're sitting in front of the Plaza
Hotel it's so beautiful I really want to
go inside but I know we have to get back
because Stella's at home but we're gonna
get an uber and I'll see you guys when
we get back hey guys it is seven o'clock
