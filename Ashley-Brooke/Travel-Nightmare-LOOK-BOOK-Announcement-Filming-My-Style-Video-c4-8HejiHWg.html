plane we sat on the plane for quite a
while we found out that we had
hydraulics the show and after about an
hour of sitting on the plane with no air
conditioning because they had to shut it
off we found out there was a leak on the
plane so then they said everybody get
off the plane will probably like depart
in about two hours
whoa Brian and I go to a little
restaurant in the airport and we sit and
eat come back they figured out that the
plane was like no good so then we had to
switch gate got to our new gate no
flight attendants bristles to get back
to New York around like I think 5:30 we
got home at 1:30 in the morning we slept
in a little bit today and we have to
film at how to style videos so we're
about to do that it's currently 5:45 but

the way to the airport to get to buy
some really comfortable clothes for the
airplane and I like were these shorts
