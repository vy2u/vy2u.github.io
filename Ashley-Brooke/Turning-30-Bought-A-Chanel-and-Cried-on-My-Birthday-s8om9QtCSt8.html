place called PS PS kitchen kind of close
to the theater I'm really excited
because I've never been there before and
we always talk about it and I know Ryan

my card said to have a suitcase packed
and ready to go for tomorrow I haven't
no clue what we're doing where we're
going I don't know if we're driving
flying you guys probably know by now I
don't know they don't know anything

appetizer the carrots or an appetizer
those seem really good everything has
two flowers on it I love it
dinner was amazing the lasagna was so
good we didn't get to show you guys our
entrees because they did the light as
soon as our food came out and it was

packed so I'm gonna go now
and it takes elves let her run around
but I'll see you guys in the morning
hi everyone so uh it is Friday April
13th and my birthday is tomorrow
Saturday April 14th and I still have no
clue where we're going what we're doing
I have a suitcase packed we're leaving
in ten minutes and all I know is that I
need to be ready to go at 11:45 I'm
assuming we're going to the airport
because I have my luggage and my
carry-on and all of that so I don't know
anything else it's almost frustrating
it's like almost a little frustrating I
was trying to pack because he was like
we're just going for the weekend to
dinners like casual during the day I'm
like what do you mean like what do I
pack is it like a fancy place casual he
was like just you'll be fine just pack
whatever so he literally gave me nothing
I don't even know what I packed I just
threw things in my suitcase
we are in the car headed to where ash is
gonna find out what we're actually doing
this weekend
what do you think about that my palms
sweaty balls no idea what we're doing
keep on thinking that we're doing
certain things what's your best guess
right now I mean I can just assume like
when did here
that should be next replying by Brian
Spain is so weird we just got dropped
off by the uber he's on the phone he
just disappeared around the corner I
have no idea what's going on
I hate surprises update Brian just is
off the phone he stopped being shady but
now he says he used to go around the
corner to get the car we're gonna have
and I'm like why did we have to come 20
miles into New Jersey to get it for him
tell me why why do we have to come all
the way to New Jersey total anxiety I
need to just stop talking and stop
thinking already yeah let's go wait
every stuff come on
ashes in Starbucks right now I'm getting
some drinks but now we have the car and

so many people in the world and I felt
like with everything that you're doing a
daily basis sometimes you've even said
to me that you feel a little lost and
why are you doing what you're doing
sometimes I thought this would be a
great way for you to see and hear from
the people that you're impacting every
single day and the people that love you
so much so you really know that
everything you're doing means something
you're creating something amazing in
this world and really impacting people's

gonna have to say my favorite memory
just getting lingering impacts for you
because we have been friends for so long
it's hard for me to really to choose one
of anything I'm excited to see what
comes for the future was liked by her
favorite memory of Ashley was actually
meeting her on Friday at the life by her
Meetup it was just so surreal to
actually get to talk to her and meet her
in person instead of watching her on my
computer
quality that Ashley has besides the fact
that she's genuine and down-to-earth is
that she names her houseplants
I don't really know that that's a
quality but I mean them too so just
being an example of someone that went
out and did what they wanted to do and
is crushing it because I want to do the
same Ashley if any complain you one more
thing I hope you're having a great
birthday to your very genuine and humble
and I just thank you for inspiring me
thanks to you I decided to push myself
and create a blog which I'm very excited
about I try to record this about every
time so we're just gonna we're gonna
roll with it Ashley it's your favorite
amateur blog your puppy in wish you a
very happy birthday I thank you so much

small in this room girl or at
Restoration Hardware shopping for
furniture we can't afford exactly going
to the outlet mall bags
everything is so grandiose and badass

midget Chanel and I just solved this one
