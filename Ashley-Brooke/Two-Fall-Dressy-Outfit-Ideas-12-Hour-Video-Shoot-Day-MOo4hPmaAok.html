wait to just take one bite each other
morning guys
so I'm going to this event for QVC and
I'm really excited about it I'll tell
you a little bit more about it in a
little bit I'm wearing this floral
long-sleeve dress that I got from H&amp;amp;M
with my hip over the knee boots and a
chrome bag sq I think it was last vlog
we were talking about this dress and
kind of H&amp;amp;M for $30.00 and I absolutely
love it I've got this really cool um
detailed shoulder and it also has these
really like nice buttons that coat down
the sleeve so I love this I don't know
if I can bring my camera in I don't know
Brian's going but if I can I will bring
the camera in and if not then I will see
you after the event
hi ma'am
we're here in front of the library you
ready to go in
no no okay
door
all right so I just did a quick outfit
change and we are headed down to Soho
now to shoot this outfit for Topshop and
I'll show you what i'm wearing chose
this midi black dress from Topshop and
it's got like the lace-up back I chose
this harness to go over it it's like a
belt harness I just thought this was
really cool and the belt is in the back
and I did these threes from Topshop and
then I added my own fishnet ankle sock
cut this would be a good dress for high
holiday time it's just like basic black
but it's got some cool detail on it so I
thought you guys might get some pins bow
out of this and then I'm gonna do it
quick show change and I'm gonna put an
over the knee boot on to shoot for how
to style over the knee boots because one
of my favorite ways to wear over the
knee boots is with a longer dress to
wear the shaft of your boot goes up into
your dress so quick shoe change and then
we're gonna come back home have a 6:00
a.m. wake-up call time not wake up I
have a 6:00 a.m. call time tomorrow I
have to be in Brooklyn at 6:00 I'm doing
a shoot like a 12 hour a day shoot with
another fellow

Facebook group today's topic was to talk
about someone who's made like a big
impact in your life and make her mother

do wildcard Wednesday where we have
random topics and I feel like we learned
so much about each other and like each
other's families and like their history
it's just like my favorite day okay so
today it was like who made the biggest
impact in your life
next week's wildcard Wednesday is go
witches today is going to be to call

nice to have a positive outlet please to

a sudden it wasn't alright so I have a
funny story for you guys when I first
visited here and I was like I want to
move to New York like this is where I'm
gonna live I was in this exact spot I
was by myself and I went to each and
every one of these retail stores and got
applications and filled them out and one
store was even like no no we're not
hiring and I was like no that's okay
I'll just fill out an application and
you can just save it keep it on file for
me
like that's how determined that's how
determined I was
Oh
I'm going to buck Mason that's one of
Brian's favorite brands then we just
realized that they have a store here on
the seventh Street
I got treats we're supposed to get one
cupcake without you got treats yeah this
is us
this weather is the best don't burn your
chin ah we are home we're back I feel
like the worst dog parent in the whole
world because I forgot to leave a light
on for Stella I don't know what I was
thinking it gets dark at 4:30 I feel
like the worst I know she's looking at
me like yeah you're pretty terrible

literally walked like two minutes
another direction and it was dead like
the most beautiful street not one person

have the best protein they cook really
quickly and they're so good but yeah it

hi guys we are headed to Stella's the
last event appointment for a while I
thought it was last time but it's not
it's this time then we're heading to our
storage unit to get our luggage because
we're leaving for Texas tomorrow for
Thanksgiving I'm so excited I miss my
family so much I didn't vlog at all
yesterday I throw it was hurting so bad
because the day before Tess and I were
at a shoot and it was like 45 degrees
and we were in tiny skirts all day long
not our choice so my throat was hurting
I was like I'm gonna get pneumonia
like 100% I'm gonna get pneumonia but
I'm feeling better today I think it was
just being on the cold and in the wind
and then actually I had to shoot
yesterday outside too so that was
probably not very smart right so I'm
gonna go get my shoes on and then we are
gonna head out whoa did someone get a
fresh haircut yesterday so pretty so
pretty
aren't you getting a haircut today
Stella loves everybody Stella not
everyone wants to be jumped on hey are
you a good girl are you a good girl
let's say Thank You NYPD for being so
fast and like being everywhere in my PD
yeah I think I'll say hi to the block
hey we are finishing up at our storage
unit it is so hot in here
I think the heater is like blasting oh
it's in my pocket so luckily I don't
think we have to pack heavy coats and I
think in Texas right now the highest
light in the 70s
maybe like at nighttime just bring one
coat but it's a good thing about going
back to tech you don't have to like pack
so many layers
I have started packing this is my pile I
know it looks like a lot but this is
like all like everything like comfy
clothes pajamas okay like a lot of
dresses and boots combination because I
feel like that's the easiest thing to
travel with because jeans get so heavy I
am gonna pack some jeans but not like
ton maybe just like a pair too
hi guys we're about to leave for the
airport and I'll show you what I'm
wearing to the airport today so I have
got on my comfy cardigan from urban then
