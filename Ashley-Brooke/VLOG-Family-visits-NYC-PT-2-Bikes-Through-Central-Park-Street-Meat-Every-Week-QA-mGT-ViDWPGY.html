out a vlog every week now that I'm gonna
set aside a min in the house and at the
end of each applause for QA I decided to
do this because I'm getting so many
questions through YouTube Instagram
messaging all of that snapshot about New
York business relationship advice
fashion so I decided that I would just
put it all into a vlog that way they all
get answer I'm gonna go ahead and wrap
up this vlog cuz I never gave it a
non-throw on a blog it's just always
like alright that's the end I hope you

mom and my dad and my brother are coming
to y'all and I'm so excited they'll be
here in probably about an hour
I do have 11 year old twin sisters they
are not coming this is a grown-up trip
so they weren't invited sorry girls
L'Oreal sent me like six boxes of their
ombre kit and I busted one of those out

mix with what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
