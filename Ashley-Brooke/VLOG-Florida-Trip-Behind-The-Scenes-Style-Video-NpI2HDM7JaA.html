perfect condition
all right so I'm about to go and shoot
my denim outfit my denim shorts outfit
and this is just kind of where I lay it
all my outfits out so I can get kind of
a lookbook to see exactly what I am
doing
I also recommend doing if you're you
know if you're planning out your outfits
for the week if you lay them out and
actually like visually see them it's so
easy and you know what I just like to
snap photos so snapping a photo and
really having something to look at
throughout the week is so helpful just a
little quick ash tip for you it is July

store and it's so weird being in a car I
don't when's the last time you drove

riding shotgun I can't get over a hub
sheet of stuff

shampoo and conditioner and our lotion

here it's for crazy
and of course eggs protein bars and then

be really gross or really good so I
don't know I was hoping this would be
cheaper here but it's not the same crush
