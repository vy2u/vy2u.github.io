that are coming to you at the end of the
month I believe is when they're being
posted so we're up super early today
because it's gonna be so hot there's a
heat advisory and like I don't know when
I sweat you can see like my face
listening so it's not cute let's see
this is my where I have everything laid
out and all the stuff I'm gonna shoot a
lot of outfits you were just gonna shoot
right behind our building so we don't
have to go far I'm usually kind of bent
route into the city and find cool places
to shoot but honestly today it's gonna
be almost 100 degrees and when you're in
the city and it's 100 I mean you feel
like the heat off the building there's
no wind because of the building so it
gets a little crazy right in my hair
down the middle but I can never do that
I kind of like it because I got a pimple
right here so I'm trying to like hide it
so you can't see it in the video Ryan
what are you doing right you've got to
stop stealing towels from the gym towel
yeah but you can't just take that like
these are towels from like our apartment
gym every tell matters I'm gonna make
you take all of the towels that you've
stolen and return them back to the gym
no you're a thief room eight really
quick I just wanted to tell you guys I
bought this shirt at the bar yesterday
for $5.99 it's just like a cute little
star t-shirt actually $5.99 it was on
sale
vlog footage bout to get into a fight
with these sure behind the scenes making
it how to style video I like always
stand on my toes just so alight again
yep always have you noticed that that I
always do that I've ever since we first
met
okay wish I were taller so I stand on my
toes
I'm getting ready are you guys sick of
seeing this off the shoulder top it's
like my favorite thing of the summer and
probably fall also it's good for
layering I'm not wearing a bra with this
because I feel like they don't meet -
agreed
no bra no bro we want to be down there a
lot of you guys were asking me how I
folds my neck scarf so I'm gonna show
you - while I'm getting ready so you're
gonna put it upside down in a square and
then you're gonna fold it over into a
triangle and then you're just gonna fold
all the way to the end and it's gonna
get messed up when you put it on so like
don't stress about it and then you put
it and then you're just gonna not tie it
so tight and do a loose double knot and
then see how it's like kind of crazy
right here just like roll it under
yourself trying to get ready for my
video and I'm looking for my bandana
everywhere and then this is what I find
like this Park what is that that's the
castle to use folder I would just I need
it honestly I need it for my outfit like
a person where yeah this is happening
this is what happens after you shoot two
full videos why can't I just ping stuff
up after I use it and then be done with
it
we live in a restaurant we don't live in
a restaurant we live in an area where
there's a bunch of restaurants so we
usually just walk around until we find
something that looks good we are gonna
head up on 11th table I always want to
go to my same restaurants about Ryan's
always playing let's try something new I
am annoying but next time you want to
move to New York we just stay at San
Antonio exhibit we did okay you're like
you think you're burning me but you're
not because no one cares anyways you can
just burn we are why are they sunglasses
look completely ridiculous so I look
ridiculous I thought that I liked that
but now I'm like why do they look like
this look okay fine
we just shot for like four five hours
and neither one of us have eaten today
we come great I think we should throw
away the chocolate syrup that I bought
yeah Brian
but and aid this like sugar-free
chocolate syrup that he put on a night
cream and it gave him lay
major stomach issues anything sugar-free
is you have stomach issues right it was
super good on that well yeah but not
today
what do you what are you wearing there
what all right you and potato sack with
stars on it you're wearing I don't know
at 12 year old girls shorts who had
really high waist you wearing a eight
year old boy shoes and you're wearing a
1950s mom sunglasses
I literally not in people you are your
ring like black olive you completely
told me what to wear today summertime
these are your choices I didn't need to
tell you something
Saul called and they want their help it
it's so funny oh the sexiest walk ever
look at that look at it I don't know you
know y'all get out of here
don't drink Bloody Mary stay after you
had sugar free toaster and it's so hot
if you like
July and August should be blackout dates
for people visiting New York just don't
do it it's too hot
since it is way too hot to be going
outside today I am just gonna show you
guys some stuff that I got out forever21
the other day I was with my mom I think
it's in the last blog that you saw where
we were shopping at that giant for a
story forever 21 which is a total
nightmare during the day but here's the
trick so the open at 8:00 a.m. it's
worth it to you is to wake up and get
there at aam there is literally not one
person there and it's so nice everything
is in order everything is even sized
like if you can imagine that so that is
my trick for shopping at this forever 21
and it works every time I find the best
stuff first I thought this top and it's
got beads on it my mom and I we both
thought we were joking we were like I
wonder how long the beads are gonna last
like how long the beads are gonna stay
on but I tried it on tucked into some
denim shorts and it was really really
cute next I got this wrap Tom it's
cropped and it just kind of drapes open
in the front and then ties on the side
and I just thought that the print and
the colors were really beautiful and I
thought it looked more expensive and it
was those 19 dollars you'll probably see
me wearing it coming up soon in a video
I left the tags on all of this so I can
actually let's scan it with my phone and
upload it to my YouTube so you can click
on it to buy it if you have their app
and you see something in store that you
like but they don't have your size you
can scan it and it takes you to that
exact item online so that's a really
good tip to know next is just this
little basic crop top it's 3/4 sleeves
it's really tight mock neck cropped and
it's kind of knotted and draped in the
front so this is good
with any kind of high-waisted gene or
skirt it's really pretty so I gots it to
the fall excited to wear it this was $14
so super affordable it is the sky it is
just an off the shoulder top it's not
like an overlay of lace and then this is
cropped at the bottom you can actually
tuck this under and make it shorter if
you want which is kind of nice but I
thought it was pretty and I love that
it's black so I can wear this into
August and September this was $17 and I
love that next are these shorts from
Urban Outfitters and I saw these like
four months ago in store and they're
legit like lounge shorts they're not
supposed to be worn like a tan outfit I
don't know you can do what you want but
that's just staring like the pajama
section and I was gonna buy them three
months four months ago but there's $60
and I was like I am not paying six
dollars for a pair of mom shorts that is
insane so I'm in urban the other day and
I have found these shorts and I'm still
full price and I went up to the guy and
I was like me working in fashion I like
know these things I was like you ain't
been happy shorts for four months and
they're so full price do you mind just
scanning them to see if they've gone on
sale so he scammed them and they were
$9.99 hello these are $9.99 hopefully
they're online because they're $10 and
they're the cutest things ever they've
got like actual embroidery it's not
printed on so to be cute with like a
bathing suit top or even I mean I guess
you you don't have to really wear these
to lounge you can put like a black tank
or a navy tape with them and where I'm
outside but
so cute just not $60 cute
definitely $9.99 cute huh either one of
us wanted to cook tonight so for some
reason we were both craving soup so we
just went and picked some up what is
this I got this organic green tea with
coconut ginger and vanilla so come back
if you want to be Chatty Cathy this is
what I got Ryan like really went like
adventurous of his drink
Oh I mean wait wait wait no here still
she's looking for the longest time in
there at all this expensive random
that's not even like you don't even know
if it's gonna be good and like hey
that's probably not gonna be good at all
she's like no but I want to the reason
why because it's weird but she just
wants it that could buy you a movie
ticket here in New York we could go and
see a film but you decided to get some
nonsense organic green with coconut
transporting green tea frustrated I like
it just try it try it you're like oh
thank you what if you love me I'll try
it
okay five minutes later and I talked to
right into trying it that's awful
