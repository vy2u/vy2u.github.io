a few questions that I'm getting on some
of my videos I've been getting asked a
lot what I do for work I am in visual
merchandising I work for intermix and
I'm sure most of you have heard of
intermix
I am the visual merchandising directive
for one of the stores here in the city
and I love doing it it's full-time job
you know I do YouTube plus I have a
full-time job 40 hours a week so I'm
always pretty busy but I love what I do
I get to be creative I get to play with
Chloe and Valentino and really cool
designers I get to go to product
knowledge seminars for Derek Lam
rag-and-bone I get to see the new
collections from those designers so that
is my work life you have any questions
just feel free to message me and
definitely open to giving advice on you
know how to get into the fashion
industry then I just say fashion I think
it did so I got a lot sorry that's
really attracted what podcast you listen
to so I have been listening to Shopify
masters listening to stuff like that is
so inspiring and honestly just makes you
feel like you can do anything anybody
can go after what they want anybody can
strive for more so if you're constantly
looking for the next step how can I
better myself
I suggest listening to some sort of
podcast just to kind of get you
motivated I mean whatever gets you going
definitely keep doing it so yeah I'm
trying to convince my wife to move to
New York from New Orleans but she's
scared how did you guys finally decide
on moving there from Texas I was also I
think anybody's scared when they're
making a big change in their life I feel
like fear and anxiety is such a common
feeling to have definitely though one
piece of advice make sure that you have
your finances lined up just know that
moving is expensive
and make sure you have you know I had a
job locked in before I moved I wasn't
about to move without a job so I flew up
here a week before we moved interviewed
got a job moved the next week make sure
you have all of your ducks lined up in a
row all of your chickens lined up what
some say just make sure you have your
stuff together before you do that what
is your favorite part about living in
NYC oh gosh so many things I love just
constantly being inspired I definitely
just love that the atmosphere and the
energy is so great I've met so many
amazing people so much positivity I
definitely miss Texas Texas school all
Texas will always be home but New York
is definitely something that I'm loving
right now at this moment I have so many
positive comments about my last vlog I
mentioned to you guys that some Shecky
left me is this nasty comment and they
would remember what it was anymore I
deleted it because it was just not
necessary I can take criticism and I'll
leave criticizing comments stuff like oh
my gosh too dark for your face or I'll
leave those up but if you're just gonna
post hate on my page no negativity no
negativity labs my channel that's got to
go I got so much love from that people
telling me don't listen to them don't
worry about it and you guys that's so
awesome
when when somebody can take the time out
of their day to just lift somebody else
up um what's that just honestly so so
much about your character and just you
overall as a person so you're amazing
thank you so much for that so I think
I've taken up a lot of time here I've
been talking for 12 minutes I'll
probably have to cut this down a little
bit if I want to put this into my blog

blogs and I will vlog more post them in

I think hi guys so before I wrap up this
vlog slash supposed to be a vlog but
then turned into mostly a Q&amp;amp;A I'm just
going to answer a few more questions and
then I'm going to get this edited and
out to you guys I've got the question of
what college did you attend and major in
and I went to school at the University
of Texas San Antonio and my degree is in
kinesiology so random I know but I'm
really interested in health and fitness
and just kind of how the human body
works so I love my major do you plan on
staying in New York for the rest of your
life and what advice do you give for
people who are planning to move to New
York I have no plans as of right now for
how long I'm going to be here right and
I are loving being here and we're just
soaking up every minute of it and there
have been no talks of staying or moving
so we're just gonna see how it goes
I seriously bow down to people who raise
families here because it's so hard when
you're seeing women in the subway with
strollers that are like carrying it up
and down the stairs I actually helped a
woman carry her stroller with her
toddler in it the other day
a-and it was a flight of 20 stairs and I
asked her I said how do you do this when
no one's here to help you and she said
you would be so surprised no one ever
helps me no one ever offers for help and
it's really really hard and I was like
oh my I wanted to give her my cell phone
number and be like anytime you go out
and public call me and I'll be your
stroller carrier so I've gotten a few
comments about when I did my style haul
the shirt that I was wearing is from
Zara and I've gotten a lot of people
wanting the link to that shirt and I got
it a few years ago but they actually
have the exact same top except - the
ties on the sleeves so I'll post the
link for that top below so you can click
on that and just buy it there and I've
gotten the question of what camera do I
use right now I'm using the sony a 5100
I love it I use it to shoot videos and
to photograph and it is amazing it is in
my opinion it's one of the best cameras
I think out there for what it cost it
gives the video quality and the picture
quality of a super expensive camera so I
will and it comes in white so of course
I have the white one but I'll post the
link down below so you guys can go check
it out and um get all of the facts and
you know what it does and see if it's
the right camera for you and last
question I think I'd love to know what
made you start doing YouTube and why you
moved from Texas to New York um I think
I answered the second part of that
question in my first part of my vlog my
first Q&amp;amp;A so I'll just leave that to
that and why I started doing YouTube I
will make a long story short by just
kind of explaining to you guys why I
actually started my youtube channel I
get asked a lot on the streets how I
curl my hair how I make my waves and I'm
usually sitting there trying to explain
to them you just wrap it I hear but I
get too far the barrel to done then you
this I was like okay I'm just gonna post
a YouTube video so anyone who asks me I
can say I made a youtube video on it go
watch it it's just much easier than me
wait
my hands around trying to explain and as
soon as everyone asked me I would just
shoot them over to my channel so I
posted this video
not wanting to intentionally start a
actually YouTube channel I just wanted
to post this one video to show people
how I curl my hair and then I get a
message from someone that I had never
met before and she was just explaining
to me how she has hair that she just
can't manage and that she just can't
maintain and she didn't know how to curl
it properly that she was just completely
lost when it came to using a wand and
that my video inspired her and just
really gave her the instructions that
she needed and now she feels more
confident and she can finally maintain
her hair and I was like what I did that
for somebody I was blown away I was so
happy in I just fell in love with that
whole situation that happened and
started making YouTube videos and
haven't stopped ever since I wanted to
make even the smallest difference in
someone's hair routine or beauty routine
and really just maybe give one person
that like aha that's how it's done kind
of feeling so then after that video was
posted and I get that comment I was
thinking oh okay I should probably take
this serious and really give good
content and really give people what they
want to see even if it just helps one
person out of thousands that's you know
that's good enough for me
you know we all want confidence and we
all want high self esteem and we all
want to feel like our best selves all
the time and our confidence no matter
who you are you go through certain times
in certain points in your life where
your confidence it's just not quite
where it should be and mine was actually
when I was in college I was in a class
with a bunch of Mean Girls I know you
guys know what I'm talking about when I
say Mean Girls they're there and they're
never going to go away and they suck so
bad but and I say one class it was
really like a whole semester of classes
I'll just say guys a quick little
background story of what happened
so I'm in this class with a bunch of
Mean Girls
and I go to class and I'm wearing you
know just jeans and a cute top and
sandals whatever and all the way these
girls are on the soccer team so they're
always in their gym clothes and their
workout gear and whatever me and it's
all of these girls and just a few guys
so I didn't have any friends I didn't
know anybody they all were you know a
pack of girls that knew each other and
they were so mean to me all semester
because I don't know I just I didn't
quite fit in with them and they were so
rude and I remember specifically at one
point at the beginning of the semester
we all had to go around the room and say
our name and what we wanted to do when
we graduate I know kill me right that's
like your heart sinks to your butt as
soon as you hear your teacher say that I
stood up and I'm I'm Ashley and you know
when I graduate I'm going to move to New
York and pursue my career in fashion I
was dead serious
obviously they all just busted out
laughing so loud it was so embarrassing
I literally wanted to just melt in my
chair and never come back I don't
remember the feeling I was like oh my
god why did I say that but I was just
being honest ever since then they would
call me New York and they would just oh
they were nasty so then I started
wearing gym clothes to class because I
was like okay maybe if I just wear gym
clothes I remember I went out and bought
gym clothes like to wear work school I
started wearing gym clothes and it
didn't help and it was just the worst so
then I just gave myself a pep talk I was
like this was mid semester by the way it
wasn't just like the next day it's like
I'm not gonna let these girls get under
my skin they're rude and I'm better than
that and I'm just gonna be myself and
I'm never gonna let anybody try to
change me and her
I completely can relate to anybody who's
not feeling confident you know we all
are there at certain points and so for
me this YouTube channel is hopefully an
inspiration to anybody out there who's
having confident issues and self-esteem
issues and I just want to remind you in
each and every one of my videos that you
are awesome and you're so special and
you can do anything you set your mind to
and I want us all to have that mentality
and I want us to all have that
confidence if I could have anything in
the whole world it would be for every
single person out there to have that
confidence and that high self-esteem to
just take you anywhere you want to go so
with all of that being said I might as
well just tell you guys I'm working on a
small little project it is called her
life and the name pretty much says it
all and basically her life is for girls
who want to go out into the world and be
confident have high self esteem be
creative create whatever you want and
basically just do anything you set your
mind to her life is going to be
comprised of clothing and accessories
there's going to be cute t-shirts
there's going to be fun accessories that
I can't leave the house about that I
absolutely just always have to have so
those are going to be coming very soon
so this is a very new project for me and
I'm still in the beginning stages I know
exactly where I want to go with it I'm
just trying to release it slowly so I am
going to post the domain name and the
Instagram page below so you guys can go
check that out put your email address in
so you can get updates on when lunges
are and when things are going to be
happening so go do that the Instagram
name is her life CO and the domain name

would like to be a part of her life mmm

guys in my next video bye and without
even realizing like how much I was
loving rose gold I bought this phone
case alright
my phone's not in it because I don't
know like when I buy a new thing I wait
to use them because then it's like
they're not new anymore oh this is
literally even like sitting in the sack
for like the week and a half now I just
I haven't used it I'm gonna use it today
though but I think it just broken these
math naked as you guys know one of my
all-time favorite um just kind of go
