Wow
who are you like besides you know a
professional writer of third-grade jokes
who are you
you're gonna bust your ass chuckle I do
I don't want to go so Ryan and I are
headed out to a meeting right now
and we are gonna do our Q&amp;amp;A on the wave
can we still stop and get me a cookie
given out something funny there's not
one thing in my purse right now not one
thing in it why am I even carrying it
you know we'll be super super cool what
it'd be super cool to use that and make
the shittiest what's in my bag video
ever hype in my bag new lens
oh my grade still good like nails are
Navy and I love it I chipped this one
today at work though won't whomp you
should do it what's in my bag you should
definitely do it and way too much cash
you have too much you cash you have cash
yeah pizza can I have a dollar
like those babies there no if I have any
tips for beginning bloggers Instagram
youtubers and I think my biggest tip is
to a stay consistent and give good
content good content is creative good
content is informative somebody can
actually take and use it's also unique
so it's not the same thing
seeing everybody else I know you
mentioned in a blog that you had a
different major than a fashion major how
did you end up working in the fashion
department I really didn't start getting
interested in fashion in a sense of life
that's the career path I wanted to take
until my second year of college and it
was already too late for me to change
majors so I graduate the kinesiology
degree and honestly if you want to work
in fashion you don't have to have a
degree in fashion beyond that fashion
degree it does make it easier to get a
fashion internship but to be in the
fashion industry you definitely do not
need a degree in fashion whatsoever next
question is what time of day do I
normally work out thanks goes to super
early in the morning because it really
just gets my day started I'm on a good
note I feel dead throughout the day I
get it over with and if we don't go
early in the morning we like to go super
late at night a lot of you guys are
asking me about my current job and what
I'm doing what my day-to-day is I do not
work for intermix anymore I have a new
job I am actually gonna make a full
video very soon talking about my new job
and like what's going on obviously it's
still in the fashion industry but that's
coming soon so stay tuned so gonna
answer it but like hey tip you guys are
asking me all at once so I feel like I
should address it now and
stay tuned Boris from Marlene she wants
to know where I get my outfit
inspiration from it's roll through
Pinterest a lot and I'd like to find
when I go to when I go shopping I like
to find the most unique disgusting
things and adding abasing to it that's
always like my number one style tip is
find something that you wouldn't
normally wear and add a basic to it and
then it's like a cool outfit you're so
pretty she wants to know what keeps me
motivated in my career and life and I
think I've answered this at some point
but keeping motivated is doing what you
love doing
because that's what motivates you if
you're waking up every day being happy
of what you're doing you're happy with
your life you're happy with yourself
that is how that's how I stay motivated
as you just have to love your life if
you're not loving any part of your life
and change it if you don't love your job
change it if you don't love the person
that you're with change it and you will
always be motivated and you will always
be successful
what do I think of Florida's the weather
I feel so bad for all my Floridians
right now a lot of Ryan's family lives
in Florida two of our best friends live
in Florida yeah they were stuck in their
house for 48 hours straight stir-crazy
go check out her channel I'm gonna link
it below she does most amazing like
vintage shopping DIYs go watch her
you'll be obsessed we could have any
superpower what would it be and why you
go first
I've never really thought about this but
on the spot I think I was best utilized
how to read mine no that's all I'm
saying
well swear taken that's the best
superpower that you can use to help
other people because the biggest things
when you're trying to negotiate or
trying to get something done for
yourself for your others it's
communication if you can understand what
I'm thinking you can really know what
they want when you can't effectively in
order to pay what everybody I think we
have so many things on our mind that we
don't say out loud so I think just
having that power of reading somebody's
mind like really under scan somebody
else would be like the best thing I feel
like if everyone communicated more the
world would be such a better place
high-five on the stage superpower
I thought Christie had a question but
she just showed me a video of her cat
Drake wants know Drake also has a
youtube channel and he wants to know how
I get engagement with my subscribers

next question is from style operator hi
ash and Ryan what would you say has been
the key to your growing audience on
YouTube really really good content
meaning unique great quality another
thing for you style operators whatever
market you're in I'm guessing it style
because good style operator genius yep
if you're doing fashion and style videos
make sure you're using the keywords of
the type of video you're using in the
title and in the description yeah
everybody oh yeah Elena West wants to
know I'd love to know if you ever deal
with homesickness being away from Texas
and what has helped you I'm from a
really really small town in Texas and I
moved away from home when I was 18 and
it was really really hard for me and
then we moved further away we moved to
New York and I wanted to move back to
Texas after after a year because I had
really young sisters and I feel like I'm
missing so much watching them grow up
and you know my mom is my best friend my
grandmother is my best friend's sisters
and I have journals my sisters are twins
we have journals that we write in and
sit back and forth and I keep them in my
nightstand like when I have them and it
makes me just feel a sense of being you
know at home every time we go home and I
leave my family and I leave my mom my
sisters and everybody I bawled my eyes
out that's right and I'm always like oh
that's the airport it's true there is no
cure for it it happens but just you know
keep in contact do little things like
the journal thing to try to stay
connected
and we'll get through it I promise a DG
of LD Ella wants to know did you ever
feel like you don't have what it takes
to make it do you ever doubt yourself
sometimes it's so how do you deal with
it coming from a small town like I
mentioned earlier it was really
intimidating moving to a bigger city and
being around people that I feel like
knew what they were doing I had no idea
what I wanted to do I was a kinesiology
major wanting to be in fashion like what
is my life doing I doubted myself every
single step of the way even still looked
out myself sometimes but I pull myself
out of it I have just trained my mind
and trained my brain to just know that
my hard work is paying off and anything
you do any career path you go down work
hard to be confident that is the key to
success as being super confident in what
you're doing and truly believing in
yourself and you will make it to do
whatever you want
honestly it is about having fat socks in
your head if Brian's not there to give
me a pep talk I have to give myself a
pep talk like you can't dodge yourself
it's got a snap out of it and just kick
ass at life and just go after what you
want and take it Missy Missy Missy hi
