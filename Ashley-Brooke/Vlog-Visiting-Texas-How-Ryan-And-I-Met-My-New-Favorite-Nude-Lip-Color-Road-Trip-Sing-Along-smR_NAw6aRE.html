a little intimidated because it's like a
bunch of guys that I didn't know so I
was being very standoffish I was like
nice to meet you what I was I feel like
I would still be nice just us girls
we're gonna tell our side of the story I
met her at a pool party and she was very
very rude extremely rude
go up and shake her hand hello she
pretty much did that I kind of just
disregarded her at that point I didn't
want anything to do with her so then my
boyfriend and I at the time broke up and
Brian out of the blue just architected
and he wouldn't leave me alone after I
found that she's been asking about me
she's just texting me non-stop
about she wanted to hang out so she was
obviously very he would text me all the
time and I was like oh my gosh guy won't
leave me alone
what is wrong with him he's hovering
over me so then my friend was having a
drag show so I was like I'm gonna invite
Ryan to his drag shows then we started
texting more and then went on dates and

could borrow my key

gym and then he asked if he could borrow
my spare key and he just never gave it
back and it slowly started moving his
stuff in until one day he was just

apartment a lot and I go to the gym
somewhat late at this point at night and
she's just like oh hey why don't you
