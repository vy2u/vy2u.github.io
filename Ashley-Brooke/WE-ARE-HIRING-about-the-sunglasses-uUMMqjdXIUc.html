long cardigan James chain what's up guys
happy blog Game one of this block need
to work on my vlog intros I just wrapped
up filming my first video for a new
series called talking trends and
basically just about one certain trend
and I'm styling outfits and talking
about the trends so it's gonna be cool
I'm excited I haven't started editing it
yet obviously I just filmed it but I
think um I think it's going to be good
that should go live next week so be on
the lookout for that I partnered up with
the Goffe to I know you guys really
liked my holiday lookbook that I
partnered up with them so I parted up
with them to show the furry shoe trend
which I was so excited about so I sued
quite a mess right here this is for the
sunglass launch we're getting prepped so
we have all of our boxes bubble wrap
stickers tissue paper you can start
packaging up and getting ready to send
you guys
experimenting with detox waters
experiment number one I really like it
it is water a tablespoon of flaxseed oil
a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar
lemon juice cayenne pepper honey that's
it you want breakfast yeah what do you
want um eggs peanut butter tau egg
raisin toast with peanut butter cheese
coffee why do you always panic when we
talk about this isn't panicking this is
keeping accurate track of food is this
linen abuddin no too close yes what we
ordered a new couch dude it's going to
be here Monday if you're on snapchat you
saw already yes Ellie's not dead so
stories now wait that's following me
which you should do that too um so yeah
we bought a new couch and we're selling
ours on Craigslist and I think someone's
going to come pick it up on Saturday we
can get the freight elevator so new
capital B here will be castles until
Monday and I have so many jackets stored
inside our couch so I just ordered a
rolling rack from Amazon should be here
today so we're gonna hang we have the
big rolling on our bedroom for a little
bit just because room no room everyone
say goodbye to the couch to show you
guys my new art here I actually got all
of these from society6 so this is all
going to be for my new gallery wall
really wanted to get pieces that like
meant something to us that motivates us
inspires us somehow it took me like two
days to pick out everything you know
that I wanted to complete my wall there
are a few of my pieces that I got and I
basically just search them by like I
would type in you know Texas or southern
or palm trees this one we wanted
something with four girls in it for my
twin sisters and then Ryan's nieces and
this just kind of made us think of them
you know they're dancing having a
time so you love this probably one of my
favorites this reminds us of like Texas
in the city kind of a reminder that
Texas is home and that we just kind of
bring a little bit of Texas to New York
you love LA so much and this kind of
made all of our New York vibes here a
little bit more west coast with the palm
trees oh and this one they do canvas
prints as well being this one in the
plastic just until we move as well as
this one I actually have a coupon code
for you guys it is Ashbrook and it will
get you 10% off plus free worldwide
shipping which is awesome because these
bigger pieces can get pretty expensive
when you're shipping them a special link
down below that you can see all of the
ones that I bought so yes go support
independent artists you know they get
paid directly so I think that's also a
really good good thing to support okay

drone is that you can't really drone
discreetly because as soon as it takes

like an actual helicopter so yeah if you
guys to think about getting your drone
just know that it's like super loud why
don't you tell the fam what you just
