okay so Jennifer on our way to beautycon
right now and we're really excited this
is my first time going Jonah's first
time going so we're so excited before we
go I will address the moving situation
I'm not gonna get super into it right
now but I will let you know that we are
moving not out of the city we're staying
in the city we're just moving
neighborhoods but I will tell you a
little bit more later on in the vlog as
to why and when and all that good stuff
the great thing about unique on being at
the Javits Center is that we're just
walking you bring a purse because I can
find one that match in my outfit so
Jenna has all my stuff in her little
purse
I know I travel light Brian carries more
stuff than I do
Ryan needs his own flight purse like
full-size purse
even hear me right now it's dying down
we learn about us
[Laughter]
we were just on fast on the Furious
and that guy needs the ticket I feel
like a magician suspect run trying whoa
all right back home and my sweatpants
but I just ate a veggie burger and some
mashed potatoes and then a bowl of
cereal
gross we are about to go take Stella for
a wal kay take it shorty I was gonna
talk to you guys about the new apartment
but about the moving situation but
Stella she knows what that means the
word wait till we get back okay we will
talk about moving when we get back from
the bye bye but see you guys in a little
bit Stella and I are laying in bed
watching
American Idol we're catching up was
working but Stella literally it just
like rolled back onto my computer and it
just closed so I guess I'm done working
for right now Oh about them move can you
guys hear me
my a/c is like blasting I feel like this
whole blog you can't hear anything I'm
saying but maybe it's like so right and
I are moving we are moving like a week
it's really soon we're going to vlog
well let me just tell you why we're
moving first of all so as we hired Jenna
Jenna works for life by her and we are
taking on two more employees for life by
her because we are launching the media
site we're gonna have a clothing line
coming out soon and we just have a lot
of things in the works and we need help
and right now we're working out of our
living room which is turning into just
like a giant office like we can't really
even have dinner on our dining table
because we just have papers everywhere
and boxes everywhere and I just feel
like I'm living in my office and that's
just especially for those of you guys
who work from home especially work with
your spouse from home you know you need
that separation of like leaving work and
having home together in it's time so we
initially were gonna look for a
two-bedroom apartment so we could have a
home office and we actually ended up
finding a three-bedroom oh it's gonna be
great we're gonna have an office we're
gonna have a guest room slash like a
filming room for me it's gonna be great
we were going to look in the building
we're in now but it's just too much for
a two-bedroom too much for what it is
and I'm not worth it so we are moving
neighborhood and we're really excited
because we've been we were wanting to
move into a new neighborhood to begin
with the new apartment you know it's
definitely not as like open windows
floor-to-ceiling like city views but you
know
and I have had great city views for
three years now so we've you know lived
in the city view apartment it's been
great and it's beautiful I'm gonna be
honest with you
in the summertime those open windows get
so hot like it gets so hot in here with
those windows I can't even explain like
during the summertime even with the AC
blasting we have to close close them
because it just gets so hot and in the
wintertime it gets so cold like this
year our heater broke because it got so
cold in here like throws the heater it's
crazy so you know we just wanted
something more homey and a little bit
more cozy and in the new apartment the
floors are like black so it's really
cool a lot different from from where
we're at right now it would show you the
apartment but people are still living
there and when we went and looked at it
they were they were living there and I
kind of felt weird like filming it well
like all of their stuff was in there
still so we'll just show you guys when
we move in in like a week we're going to
do this whole like series like an
apartment hunting series but this ended
up being the first apartment that we
wouldn't saw it's crazy we had a long
list of apartments to go look at but we
we saw this apartment and this isn't a
building where every unit is different
so we knew that this was kind of an
opportunity that we had to take right
than in there or else it wouldn't be
available actually after we heard
deposit on and stuff someone else tried
to get it literally the same day so I'm
really glad we took action and got the
apartment it was quite a process we
didn't we honestly we didn't think we
were gonna get accepted
for like a lot of reasons we were like
we're never gonna get accepted into this
apartment and we have an amazing broker
and he made it happen for us and he's
just amazing he's awesome so I cannot
wait to show you right now we're living
in boxes it's crazy and it's frustrating
and I can't find anything you guys know
I hate mess and I hate clutter and it's
just like what we're living in she got a
bath after her her walk today we totally
forgot to film or walk
we were walking across the street you
know it's like hey you want a block and
Ryan was like should I forgot the camera
look at her right now hi me comfy and
then I was into an apartment toward here
I didn't even get to do an apartment
tour but once we have everything moved
out I'll just kind of show you guys like
what it looks like empty and the layout
oh I'm sorry that's embarrassing
go now that I gave you the scoop on the
apartment I'm trying to think if there's
anything else I forgot I'll see you guys
tomorrow tomorrow I don't really have a
lot to do it's gonna be really nice
outside Oh Stella here soon as she barks
at nothing I'm like what can you see
that I can't okay I'm gonna come she's
going crazy I'm gonna go but I will see
you guys tomorrow I'm about to show you
why we love Sundays so much because it's
technically our cheat day and Ashe goes
on a cooking spray it makes something
amazing so
hey are we making huh
what did I just say Brian huh baking
tofu ricotta cheese lasagna noise and of
course you wanted red velvet cupcakes
certainly dude was very so good last
time the best time cook cakes I've ever
had yeah bar none
so you food processor it up tofu and
then you mix it with spinach yeah and
then you're boiling the flappy parts of
his lasagna those I'd in the flabby
parts so not technical I think you're
picking up I'm putting down look at my
shirt from the splatters yeah we go you
didn't make lasagna if you don't have
sauces splattered sauce
Alexa how much longer on the timer no no
who you Syria for that timer set now
she's working well could we plug in that
way you know hurry hurry you're ruining
whoa it's okay it's okay
hold up pull it out hold it
so googling lasagna knowledge anyway
down here number two this is what's
important once you've cooked your
noodles to just under al dente do not we
repeat do not dump them in a colander to
drain in the sink as you prepare the
sauce of cheese well why didn't anyone
tell me that final result
yes
oh that looks so gross looks phenomenal
whoa whoa
this is icing I'm opening in the new
apartment there's more room for well
speaking of new apartment tell everybody
what you already told her okay you've
been informing people you tell them that
we're building an island no I didn't
it's like not something floating in
water island builders there is no island
in our kitchen it's kind of built in
like this but it's smaller than this and
we were at IKEA the other day and
there's you can like build your own I
looked but yeah the new kitchen it's
built like this or it's all on a wall
