oh hi guys welcome back to my channel
today we are in la Sprinter Airbnb right
now it looks a little different three
outfits that I wore this week and we'll
go ahead and start with outfit number
one so with this outfit we were driving
from Las Vegas to LA so I wanted to be
super comfortable started with this
oversized on my blog I called it my
vintage dad shirt from 80s which is
exactly what it reminds me of but I got
this guy from Anthropologie and it is by
holding horses now that I think about it
I actually think I have another shirt by
then that's like oversized but I just
love the color placement and I know it
comes in a couple of other colors too
but I love to stripes on this I thought
it was so cool I love the colors really
lightweight super soft very oversized so
you can also do this over a bathing suit
or you could do it opened with a tank
and some jeans there's just a lot that
you can do with this kind of thing I
thought I wore these shorts that I've
been getting a lot of questions on and
they are last year Topshop and they are
called the moto girlfriend
short but they're just high-waisted
cuffed at the bottom light wash is
they're pretty much my go-to I bought
these in this color a dark wash and
white because I love them so much then I
did the sandal from Target actually my
first time wearing them they're pretty
dusty still from the like dirt because
we've softened films like in the desert
area obviously but we're comfortable um
they feel really durable they don't feel
flimsy or cheap I really like these I
needed a good pair of black lace-up
sandals so glad I found these at a good
price and they have like the toe also I
thought was kind of cool if bag is also
from Target and it is this kind of woven
circle bag it's such a good carry-all
bag it's great for a road trip great for
traveling great if you are you know
running out shopping and you need to
just throw stuff in a bag and this is
perfect so lightweight comes with a long
strap and it also comes in a tan as well
miss that means I am for my next outfit
we went to dinner started with this
inside-out hold on this top from forever
21 and I put this in a hall or styling
video of some sort but I've never
actually was worn it in an outfit so it
is that super super wide sleeves which
is what I love about it and I love the
color this blue is so pretty with Jen
like blue denim whites and I'm black
I think it's a good spring color to kind
of mix and match with all of your denim
and I paired it out pair it with these
jeans from Zara my high-waisted I can't
find these online you guys can find them
please share the link because I can't
MUP they are ripped
Tim shredded bottoms Jean and they are
so stretchy great color no risk just
kind of a super simple trendy pair of
jeans and they're very high waisted
which I also love when I wear shorter
tops of it to do a black accessories
because I just love like an all blue
outfit and black I think it really pops
my favorite so I did my caged black heel
sandals from Zara I did my vegan leather
who makes this Melly Bianco this is from
Free People I know it comes in other
colors too but I love the black take a
little bucket bag but slightly fit a
whole lot but it's really cute and I
like the detail for my last outfit we
were just kind of doing touristy things
you know we went down Rodeo and Beverly
Drive and we were just going to kind of
eat out all day so I wanted to be
comfortable but still kind of dressed
for like a nice or dinner and like lunch
as well so I went with this romper I
think it's so cute I love the print I
actually just got this at Saks office
when I was in Vegas had a great meet
pink section which I love main thing I
think they're bathing students are so
cool and their clothes are so cool
so this is maintained and I got a size
small is cut out on the waist right here
it's got a
cutout detail and then this is also the
same but it's lines so you can't see
your leg I just love the detail on the
Swedes and then on the bottom of the
short and I love the colors
I just did my black Zara booty sick as I
was kind of going for an edgier look and
it was a little cold so I didn't want to
wear sandals and thought boots were a
little bit more appropriate for my
jewelry I pretty much did my by Alana
ring here
the whole time and then my scoops are
from forever 21 and then my next
necklace and I get a lot of questions on
on like snapchat against the stories is
in this one which is also from forever
21 and this is basically what it is I
felt like a choker and then like a
really pretty delicate like dangly
apartment I'm sure my life by heart girl
has recognized this necklace because it
was in the lookbook and that's why I
ordered it because I was like okay I
keep staring on it I've gotta get it so
yeah in two lookbooks ago I did a full
page on jewelry just because I think it
is hard finding cool pieces so I
basically put together like a whole
pages all of my favorites and that's
pretty much what the lookbook is and a
lot of you guys are requesting to see
what the lookbook looks like so um I
will talk about it more in my next vlog
so stay tuned for that of what exactly
the look looks like if we like your
fashion bible for the month and it gives
you inspiration shopping links a
community where you can kind of you know
relate to other women and talk about it
and post pictures and get advice and
stuff like that so come join us if not I
will talk about in the next vlog so stay
tuned for that and I will see you guys
in my next video bye I love my room key
