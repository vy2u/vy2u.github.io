hi guys welcome back to my channel so
instead what I wore the first day was
films in LA and in the second two days
were filmed in New York as I'm sure you
saw a change of scenery so I'll go ahead
and get started with the outfit
description for outfit number one we
were in Santa Monica so it was a very
beachy vibe I just invented shopping
that day so I wanted to be comfortable
but still kind of like casual for the
beach so I did in this top from Urban
Outfitters and is by kim chi blue which
is one of my favorite brands that urban
outfitters carries and it's just this
crop like way oversized sweep top and I
absolutely love this just a good throw
on tops when you just want to wear some
basic denim it's you know interesting
it's cropped it's just like everything
that I love pepper sauce is this and I
got a size a small in them and I just
wore it with my light washed denim
shorts from Topshop these are my
girlfriend's shorts and I've been
wearing non-stop they're the only shorts
I hat in LA so you guys felt me wearing
these like all through the vlog and all
through today okay Arlie forgotten how
to lipstick today I don't have my
lipstick straight so it's not there's a
keep things super beachy I did in this
straw bag from Free People this is
probably my most recent bag purchase and
I loved it so much I love that if straw
but it's also around and structured that
way you're getting the beachy vibe
without looking like you're carrying a
beach bag I know straw box can sometimes
get a little bit too beachy looking when
they start getting flimsy and oversized
so four minutes outfit I did
this dress from Zara kind of like a
peasant embroidered dress it's navy with
embroidered flowers on the sleeve and I
got a small I left the tag on so I could
scan it because ara
finding anything on Zara's website is
like finding a needle in a haystack like
I could search Navy embroider dress and
like this will not come up I don't know
it's just so confusing so I always leave
the tag on until I'm done filming it
that way I can scan it and get the link
so that's what tags on it not that this
was such an easy I love cute easy
dresses this is just you know when you
need something easy to throw on with
sandals here you go look you don't have
to stress about jewelry because there's
already so much going on oppa stress
about shoes so I just love easy dresses
like this in the summer and spring but a
little bit chilly
um actually did this outfit today it was
a little chilly today so I did wear some
booties and it was raining kind of on
and off so I wanted to not get my feet
wet and then I did my who what where
suck it back from Zara
I mean target so choose the tanks are
next is probably one of my favorite
pieces black jumpsuit from three people
its rid of to cotton material in the
front and then the back is completely
open it snaps closed behind the neck and
then it's got an open back and then it's
like this really cool cargo of flowy
bottom with a belt flow I felt bad
because I put a jumpsuit and a dress but
when I get pieces that are just kind of
really easy to throw on and wear I like
to show you guys because I just want to
share them with you target again you
don't need to go crazy with your shoes
and then for my bra my bra let I did
this lace one from Target and I get a
lot of questions about my frog and
target has great ones that free people
has liked me best bra let Nordstrom
they'll all have really
grow less so I just happened to pick
this one up from Target for my bag where
is that thing boss rounds are not straw
it's not woven like a summary a very
summery black bag you know anything
that's not leather I usually carry my
saline and my black swimming tote
everywhere but sometimes it can look a
little harsh in spring and summertime so
I was really excited to find this who
what where woven bag that I've been
pretty much carrying instead of my
Saline leather tote because that is all
I have for you guys today and there were
only three outfits today you know we got
back from LA and it was just kind of we
were playing catch up and I was in my
prep pants all week long one of my
subscribers misty was like you should
show us what you wear like on your days
off and I was like I don't know if you
guys want to do that we are hard at work
on the July

to love to lie just like full-blown
summer I'm so excited so it's definitely
go check it out basically it's just a 30
day you get it sent to your inbox every
month outfit shopping links a cool
community just like a YouTube video with
every outfit kind of explaining
everything so it's something that we're
really proud of something that I'm
really proud of link everything below as
best I can
oh and this is from Laura my jumpsuit so
if they go slow II and my leg of it
Chloe jumpsuit I love it super
comfortable I like to just kind of
lounge a mouse in it but yes that's not
how for you I'll see you next time as we
tell him that when we go grocery
shopping you need as many of these as
possible so they can reuse that money as
possible so like four or five not not
