Oh
yeah
ah
Oh
some movie controller out let us just
attack get lower
I will the world
Oh
how's about some movie controller I'm
not happy if the time is Noah I will
stop so sow the world
no sir
guys welcome back to another episode of
what I wore this week and this week was
kind of full of press previews so I've
got a couple of showroom so the outfits
are a little bit more and not so casual
as I usually am so with that being said
I'll go ahead and get started showing
you my I see an open doing this a lot
today so that's always good I'm wearing
this dress from River Island and it is
striped with and off-the-shoulder
little bell detail and I actually just
belted it
so really comfy summery lightweight
dress that I've been loving for outfit
number one I started my outfit with
these super wide leg pants from Laura
and I guess they're more like a flare
because they are very tight at the leg
and then they flare out ginormous I saw
these in the store and it took me a
couple of weeks to buy them every time I
would go in I was see them and I was
just like wow like they're so cool but
what am I going to wear them with and
finally um I uh Brown on Pinterest got
some inspiration and I was like okay I
have to have you so I have a sign if I
can find them online an extra small
still a little bit big in the waist but
they're tight on my booty and my legs
but I do have to wear them with the
longer shirt because the crotch does
this like writing thing which is not
comfortable wear a long shirt it's fine
you can't see anything awkward and
embarrassing I put it with this top that
is inside and unbuttoned
I'll just button one button you guys get
the idea so it is a strapless stripe
button-down from Topshop with a really
big dramatic tie in the front and the
stripes on the tie or a little bit
smaller than
stripes on the top so it gives you a
really cool almost like a mixed print
effect even though they're both stripes
what's having like a slight boobie
problem during the day one of my buttons
was coming open but it flows like this
little day alright hello miss me nice to
meet you they just grabbed this really
quick I was trying out the pawza button
I could just see that happening so yeah
I just thought it was a cool outfit but
those jeans I absolutely love I love
both pieces separately I love to outfit
together but even with those jeans I
would do like a cute like a graphic
t-shirt and some like fun sandals or you
know dress up quite a bit with like a
fun top but I thought this outfit was
kind of a good meet in the middle not
too dressy not too casual I wanted to do
a black bag to kind of tie in my black
shoes so I did this guy from forever 21
and now we can believe in the showroom
substance with the forever 21 bag they
were all so surprised so I did really
good with this bag got it in red and
black because I knew it was a gem so for
outfit number two I was in Soho
taking over the Instagram for skinny dip
and so I wanted to be casual comfortable
because I was going to be moving around
a lot using my phone a lot so I did
these jeans from Topshop I got so many
compliments on them they button all the
way up only issue I had with these
because every time I squatted down some
of the they would come on snaps so I was
like okay top down so I was like
sponging over like this like slap
awkward I'm sure people were like what's
wrong with her
and I paired it with this top from
forever 21 it's just kind of a look a
one-shoulder really cute kind of tucked
in detailed cap sleeve shirt I just
thought it was kind of different from
just a basic tank one-shoulder or even
just a basic t-shirt I thought this was
really cool for my bag I did this guy
from Zara and I believe it's on the Zara
sale I'll have to double check and make
sure but I just thought it added some
sort of detail since my outfit was
pretty simple
my
the button DTL on my jeans so I wanted
to do something a little fun something
that I could easily grab in so I did
that what is happening help me with my
hair I don't know what's going on don't
know what's happening I woke up and I
brushed it just lay down plumbed and
this did this happened for Alvin number
three I did this top from River Island
and it is so cool so your sleeves have
bowed down them they're open how cool is
this a scam so double win and it's not a
closed wrist triple win every time I put
it on I like stick my hand through the
wrong hole like with ripped jeans you
always take your flip to the same yeah
just goes for people who don't like
showing their arms but don't want to
sweat their butts off oh this is a
really great song because it is
breathable in the arm and really
lightweight alone on just did my black
denim shorts for Zara they're
high-waisted so obviously this was like
a good option for me with the black on
black it did my white embossed patent um
slides from rubber island never really
get a chance to wear these so I was
really excited that this outfit looked
good with it with these because I love
use so guy little black-and-white story
going here and then I did this bag again
because I thought this was nice with the
King um it was kind of like big print
small print there's a little bit of
mixing prints but staying in the same
color story but it's all I have for you
guys today thank you so much for tuning
in and watching another what I wore I
love doing these we love filming and you
love going around different places to
the city so it's a lot of fun to make
these so the next week is going to be a
little tricky because the lights by her
lookbook comes out on the first so I'm
going to be buried in my sweat pants
again so don't be surprised if there are
a few sweatpants look books I'm just
kidding I would not do that to you guys
but uh maybe so yeah we're going to be
hard at work at that you guys sign up
right now you will still get in this
month look look and then the next month
on the first you will get the next look
book so if you sign up right now
you'll get two back-to-back so you'll
get lots of good stuff so go check it
out they'll think all as always we'll be
right here so you can see if it is for
you if anything comes on us at the
community or like a big group of sisters
I know I always say that and people
always say they email me as soon as they
sign up and they're like I hear you
talking about this all the time but you
don't really know until you're in the
community and like I know it's so hard
to even explain we'll be updating the
site soon so you can get kind of a more
understanding of what it is but station
for that I'll keep you updated and let
you guys know in a video or a blog or
something but yes until next time I will
see you guys later bye collection is
always so good especially if you are a
business professional they always have
the best work attire so recently I just
purchased these two tops again I would
probably invest over $100 in a good
print but I just happen to really love
this one from Target it's bright and I
don't know I just love it then I got
this top this little ruffle baby baby
doll top this is not something I would
invest over a hundred dollars in just
because it is very um you can find stuff
like this everywhere a print if you fall
in love with the print chances are you
will not find it anywhere else but stuff
like this you can find out where so I'm
definitely glad that I was able to find
more of a trendy item like this at
Target that I can wear you know
throughout the summer and get plenty of
use out of their store I love going to
is forever 21 this is the handbag that I
was telling you guys about earlier the
big trend right now the ring handle so
for me to be able to climb this bag at
an affordable price I was really excited
and I love red I think red immediately
elevates her outfit it's a great pop of
color especially for summer and spring
but it is seasonless so you can do run
in the fall and in the winter
next is a so so I get a lot of my basics
from ASOS they have great body suits
great little top lace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
