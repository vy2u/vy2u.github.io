guys welcome back to my channel today in
the what I wore exception was a little
split up so my first outfit we were back
in Texas and then we're back in New York
weather is starting to get so much nicer
here in the city so a lot more spring
stuff are combined me being able to wear
some of the stuff in my calls
you know you guys are commenting on my
hauls and you're like - you really wear
all the stuff and I'm like well no not
right now because it's so cold but when
spring comes yes
let's just go ahead and get started into
the outfit description and my dining
table right now I feel very like
business life right now alright so for
outfit number one I started with this
skirt from Zara and this was in my last
haul and I loved it I was good full
skirt because I feel like there's so
much you can do with it and this skirt
especially I will carry this into fall
and fall I can see this with a black
sweater or black booties but in the
spring and summer maybe lighten up with
something white how I styled it in the
video and I thought it was appropriate
for you know like a church type family
gathering it was a little bit
conservative but still kind of stylish
at the same time the way I paired it
with this white top smell is why it
buttons down with frilled please right
here and this boy's without makeup on it
because it wouldn't be a what I wore if
I didn't have makeup on something my
shoe I just did this block heel caged
sandal from Zara as well I thought that
the black in the green skirt were really
pretty together I did have a new sandal
but I don't think that my legs were tan
enough for a new sandal it almost didn't
look like I was wearing any shoes it's
blended in so for my next outfit we were
just basically kind of running errands
we had just moved because we're running
back and forth TV to Target trying to
get a few last-minute things so I want
to be super comfy and what I want to be
comfy I always drop these
stretchy pants from Zara kind of go to
these whenever I want to look you know
kind of cool casual super comfortable
and like use because you can wear them
with sneakers how I have them in the
video or you can also dress them up and
wear them with heels or more of a block
heels man well Ben my baseball player
man that's what I feel like just paired
it with this basic crop top from forever
21 and you know they sell these all over
the place you can buy some at misguided
ASIS for over 21
basically any site you are on will have
some sort of basic crop top then i pair
it with my good ol faithful longline
jacket booth Libre all right you must
throw this over anything and everything
if I need something with rancor if I
need a black for just the light layering
piece I think this is so good pastor my
next outfit we were just kind of running
some errands who were you know kind of
sticking around home so I wanted to be
comfortable and also kind of cute at the
same time because the Sun was out so I
wanted more of a springtime outfit if
you guys can hear that siren
really think it's not going anywhere
there this confirmation it has a ruffled
back and it's actually a low high top so
the longer the longer part is in the
front and in the back gets shorter I
love doing a denim on blue I think blue
on blue is so pretty especially when
it's you know kind of this two different
contrast it just fit so into these blue
button-down slightly and pairing them
with blue denim is just like what I've
been doing and I'm loving this color
contrast than I did in my little brown
bag from who what where Target
collection I love this it's really
really small I don't need this like my
wallet my phone in the keys sighs you
know sometimes that's all you need and I
love the gold handle is giving me major
Chloe buzz I love love love Chloe box
Ben's Italian at my
I did my Steve Madden little chunky
espadrille and love this are so
comfortable they're really lightweight
and they're super summery and springy I
think the color is perfect and
especially with this bag what's high in
these goals I did my five Elana jewelry
I'm telling you guys this girl is going
to blow up her jewelry is so cool
so I thought this necklace summer that I
always wear and then this ring that I
always wear and I always get so many
compliments on both of these pieces I do
own with more jewelry by her but I think
these are my two favorites for my last
outfit it was on a Saturday and it was
so nice in the Sun but then the wind was
really cold and strong so it was kind of
confusing but bright and I just
basically went to the gym and then
afterwards we went to the pier we like
to go and watch the dogs in the dog park
it's my kind of creepy I don't know
maybe it's creepy maybe it's not but we
could go over there and sit for hours
and just watch all of the dogs play are
we and miss our dog back home is
something that we like to go over there
and you know watch them play and makes
us feel better
kayat did my champion bra top I wear
this pretty much whenever I can to the
gym because it's so comfortable
basically just across bra top with
lighting detail back did my a yoga moto
inside out right now a little camp and
I'm obsessed with these I have them in
white too and I love them so much so
they've got some really cool paneling
here and then some sheer paneling here
and I just love these are so comfortable
of course I did my babe hacks I have
some major gym hair going on right in
this area
so a hat is always necessary for that
for my shoe I did my Stella McCartney
for a PETA speaker these are probably
the most comfortable sneakers I own so I
you know I knew we were going to be
walking around so of course I had to
wear these so that is it for this week's
what I wore again we're going to

post one because of moving and family
was in town and all of that with wearing
sweatpants and moving clothes pretty
much all week so back on schedule now
