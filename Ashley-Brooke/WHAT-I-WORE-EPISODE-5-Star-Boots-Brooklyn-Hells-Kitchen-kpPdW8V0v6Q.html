and I can't find my brain
and
making me know
changing here
yeah
wait
and I can't find a break
taking me away
No
complain
yeah
No
dream
and I don't know
what's up guys welcome back to another
episode of what I wore this is kind of a
series I put together of outfits that I
wore during the week where I was going
what I was doing all of that good stuff
and you'll have to excuse my watching
machine it sounds like it's about to
take off till the spin cycle so loud
sorry let's go ahead and jump right into
the outfits and I hope you loved the
lookbook outfit is something that I wore
out to meet one of my amazing
subscribers Missy who has been with me
for a very long time and this was a huge
day for me because her and I chat
frequently throughout the week and
wanted something casual cute casual you
know so I threw on this printed
lightweight and bomber that I got from
H&amp;amp;M last year this rips tee from Lulu
and then I did these stains pocket denim
from H&amp;amp;M I just got these two so they
should have these online
I love these they're high-waisted
straight-leg no rips I think it's good
to have a pair of just basic no rips
blue jeans in your wardrobe because when
you are wearing something such as a
printed bomber you know you don't want a
whole lot going on on your bottom you
want something a little bit more clean
to kind of balance out the top part and
then I grabbed this bag just because I
love this bag I just got it not that
long ago it was like nineteen dollars
from Zara and it's got rose gold on one
side and then goals on the other side so
you can kind of you know wear it a
little bit more versatile throughout
your outfit thought that the rose gold
went really nicely with the pink flowers
in the jacket it pretty much only that's
my cell phone and my debit card so do
not plan on wearing this if you need
like more than two things not even
la not a chance then I grabbed these
mules that I got from DFW and I just
think these mules are so great such a
neutral color they pretty much go with
anything that I if I ever can't find a
shoe to wear with something this is my
go-to because this will go if anything
very neutral very toned down it doesn't
draw too much attention to your shoe so
I love these for my next outfit I grabs
this dress from Zara and I know they
make a version of this dress pretty much
on rotation I've seen it in short
sleeves I've seen it in Navy I've seen
it in grey and I love the style and I
love the bit so I always try to grab one
of these whenever they do have it in
stock and this one is black with orange
and gray and I think it's really pretty
for spring it's actually not that
springing how did I think about it but I
think it's one of those dresses that can
kind of carry you throughout any season
I did this and where was I going when I
wore this
um I think Ryan and I were going to like
an early dinner so I wore this and then
to dress it down I did like a fun
ponytail but and because my hair was
dirty but up like it did my star boots
from Zara last year and lovely big got
um kind of starved to jink all over them
with gold hardware and then I did my
fishnet socks from ASOS that annoy me so
much because they slide down on my ankle
like I'll take two steps and they slide
down like what what I need to get taller
once I guess I mean they're good for is
you're wearing a sneaker but if you're
wearing an ankle boot I suggest getting
something longer and then scrunching it
down a little bit
sure i slashed so many people because I
kept having to bend over and the wind
was blowing and Ryan was like you're
dropped out flying um I was like Ryan
picks off this other guys you were
wondering although so this outfit I
actually started with these jeans from
Topshop I believe these are the Jamie
jeans I love the Jamie juice I think
they're so great
and I think if you're looking for a good
basic high-waisted mid-rise jeans the
Jamie Jean from Topshop I keep hearing
something it's a really good place to
start
so I brought these guys they are little
crops and they laced up the side and
then they have a quick little quick
short short little lace up in the back
just for these we were running errands
so I wanted to be comfortable we went to
the grocery store I need to go to the
bang
blah blah blah errands so I just did
these a basic long-sleeved white t-shirt
from gas I want to say and I'm pretty
sure it's the pajama top I got another
job in sections but and then I did this
little metallic silver bag from Zara
flannels got it tied in nicely with the
grommet and the hardware on the lace-up
so we did this little bag just to add
something something fun did this black
which is also from Zara because these
are super comfortable little slide on
they do come down every now and then you
have to pull them back up but they're
very comfortable if I'm going to be
walking for a long period of time
they're just easy slip on and go so
thank you
so my next outfit we with to Ikea to get
man taking his clothes off with me it
was Dara Ryan and myself we had to go
get a shelf did I want it to be super
comfortable because IKEA so I started
with this hmm
skirt I love this I got it a couple of
years ago but they make skirts like this
quite often and it's easy when you want
to throw on a band t-shirt a tank top if
you want to dress it up you can it's
just an easy just simple pleated skirt
just did a sweatshirt just a basic more
of a fitted sweatshirt not so much
oversized but this sweatshirt is from
H&amp;amp;M I think it was nine dollars they
make them year-round in multiple colors
so I did this and then my denim jacket
from Melrose buy and Miller's and market
from Nordstrom
rack because this is like the most
comfortable things but your flowy skirt
jean jacket low ponytail dirty hair
promise I wash my hair I think this is
like the second time I've said I had
dirty hair but I do wash my hair every
night then I did my star boot
siren siren break I had my secret on but
it just didn't quite feel right I don't
know if it was like that I don't know if
it was the oversize mass of the denim
jacket or what but something just didn't
feel right with the sneakers so I put on
these boots and you feel my comfy boots
so if I was going to be walking for a
long period of time I grabbed these they
have a super low heel and makes very
comfortable so that was it but yeah I
really hope you guys loved this look
look into what I wore I will say there
will be a holla to style next week so be
on the lookout with that I told you guys

weather is getting nicer and I can
finally start doing you know shorts and
skirts and spring date night and
weddings and stuff like that so it'll be
a lot better and more informative if you
will I will link the best I can if you
guys we're you know saying in the last
comments that I'm not linking the
correct things and that is because when
things are sold out I linked what I can
best find that represents each item so
it's not the exact thing then that means
that either I can't find it or it's sold
out so bear with me on that I apologize
