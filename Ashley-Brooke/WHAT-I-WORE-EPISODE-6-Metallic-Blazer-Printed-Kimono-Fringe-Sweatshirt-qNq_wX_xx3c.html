yeah
but I could tell you
what guys what mark you another what I
wore I don't know it's my camera
straight because I'm not using my normal
tripod so I don't know if I'm crooked or
not this week was a little crazy I know
I only showed you guys three outfits but
I just wore three outfits um it's been a
little nuts lately with hiring and
intern all the training and it's the end
of the month so the lookbook is about to
come out my life by her lookbook so I've
been super busy kind of like Herman
eating inside my apartment in you know
like comfy clothes so I only have three
outfits but next week we'll be back to
normal four outfit so with that being
said let's go ahead and get started
for outfit and number one I did this
kimono from Zara I saw this in the store
and I tested by thinking that it looks
like a bathrobe but then I just kept
picturing it with like light washed
denim and brown and I was like ah I've
been a little again wearing a bathrobe
but I honestly don't care because I
actually love bathroom is what I like to
call you know bathrobe chic if that is
such a thing it is now but I love this I
think the colors are so great for spring
and it's so light that I think you know
even beginning to maybe end of summer I
could just throw this on with some
shorts and some sandals and it would be
just like a great third piece a great
layering piece without being so hot
because it is so lightweight you are
concerned about it looking too bathrobe
--is-- you can always take the tie off
of it I like to tie it in the back
because that way it gives you more of a
slimmer silhouette because it is so
billowy and so much material that if you
tie it in the back it kind of almost
gives you like a tailored trim sort of
look so I love this place started my
outfit with
I just did my basic high-waisted denim
that I believe is from H&amp;amp;M I will link
it below just a basic white crop top
from forever 21 I think I got it a
couple of years ago but it's like that
softer the stretchy material up to the
best
I like sleep in it I like wear it out of
the house is one of those that you just
kind of like it's like a live t-shirt
like every part of your life it just
works accessories I said these studies
from I think these are from urban or
free people but they're I hadn't for a
couple of years but it's taken me a
while to wear them because I just like
wasn't into them until like recently I
think I might be colorblind I think
they're rose gold though but they're
super cute just basic little round
Sunny's I have a small face so uh so
they fit my little tiny face which I
love because most sunglasses are very
overwhelming on my face but those work
for me or my bag
I did my who what where bags that I will
never stop carrying I'm sure you guys
will see this like once one outfit a
week I just love it so much it's so cute
little and I love the hardware on it and
it just kind of goes with a lot of my
lighter springy items it's just like a
good accessory it's not an overwhelming
bag it's small if the kids need a good
length on my waist so I love this and
then for my shoes I did my lace-up
platform espadrilles from DSW and these
are so comfortable 11th you guys were
asking me I was snapchatting and insist
or iam that day and you guys are asking
me if they were comfortable and they are
because they're basically like wearing a
flat shoe and they're pretty sick in the
back so you don't have that you know
when you're walking in your foot like
rake and you're like please don't let
anyone say but so these are super comfy
but pretty nicely they're not like a
super you know match with my bag but
when they're pretty far apart they
combined really nicely together this
outfit it was a little chillier that day
so I opted for a sweatshirt and I love
this guy's very like western Texas I
don't know I saw in a dream
enemy in fact common Texas that I have
have it I mean it's basically just a
back black sweatshirt with some stone
embellished fringe on the sleeve so cute
and it's actually not a super-heavy
sweatshirt so you can get away with
wearing it you know when in some like
the low 70s mid 70s maybe with some
shorts but it's not super heavy which is
what I love about it when I did and
these jeans from Zara they are
high-waisted I love the rip placement
and I love the color they're almost an
acid wash color but not really but
almost they're more of a mom Jean
they're high-waisted straight leg a
little tailored at the ankle and they're
not that stretchy so you know sitting
down for a long time is kind of an issue
starts to like dig into my stomach you
know that feeling I think the worst when
you sit down for dinner and like you're
fine but then dinners does and you're
like okay guys I need to unbutton my
pants like you better hope you're with a
comfortable crowd because you're like
there has to be a fun blending of the
pants happen many times I'm not afraid
to even say it out loud I did it
yesterday on my shoe I did in my block
heel sandal from heartland OSS my Laura
yeah it was that was unintentional I try
not to do that I try not to have all my
clothes from one store but Zara like
Anna so I just did my block heel sandal
from Zara and I love these are so
comfortable the only complaint I have is
it will give you a flat tire every now
and this little thing just goes boo boo
poop and just slides down hold up I just
discovered another whole game-changer
right there's another hole so that might
not happen to me anymore
I will report back next time next week
yeah that outfit was just like please go
away and my last outfit was a little bit
more dressy I did my metallic pink
blazer I called in my haul I called this
rose gold and someone got really upset
in the comments that I said rose gold
but when I look at it I just think of
rode cool I blame the rose gold thing on
the iPhone because the iPhone is
technically pink but it's named rose
gold so now every time I see something
pink commit
like I'm like oh it's rose gold but I I
mean yeah pink but it also could be rose
gold I don't know Faraz my pink blazer
because I just love it it's meant to be
a blazer dress but it doesn't look that
good on me as a dress so I will just
continue to wear it is like a throw on
blazer so yeah I started my outfit with
this I wanted to add something that
wasn't just like a basic t-shirt I
wanted to add something fun something
textured so I grabbed this guy from Zara
and this was my first time wearing this
shirt and I was super excited about it
because I when I tried this on the video
my absolutely fell in love with it so
pretty and girly and you know kind of
sexy at the same time you could do a
bralette underneath it I just love this
so much so I can be loved like the
combination that it gave I love adding a
textured shirt under you know something
fun like a fun blazer or a fun bomber I
think texture and print and texture on
texture is a really cool combination
jeans words my H&amp;amp;M ones my high-waisted
straight leg jeans from H&amp;amp;M not my DIY
denims the other ones are just straight
leg I will link them below and form a
shoe I finally have to wear my Jeffrey
Campbell for free people friends with
jazz and shoes for all of you guys who
have been wanting me to style these here
you go
they actually have rose gold rose Oller
pink I'm going to get throw up to get
rose gold bees right here so they tied
in my blazer really nicely I thought it
was just like the perfect combination
first I was like too much with the
metallic blazer the texture top and then
like the princess jazz and chews and
then I was like no you got to go for it
you just kind of go for it when I went
for it and I was really happy with the
way this outfit turned out wearing today
like what's happening with my hair might
like what's going on I look like a boy
