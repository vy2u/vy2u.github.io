next recalled to shake the load from my
mouth Thor know head-ons this thing
unnoticed leave a house or a keep
bleeding like you might even work pull
up the book on goodbye little bit way to
make it easy either ahead on your first
use at the other side
the other
yeah
he was at the time
what's up guys welcome back to another
episode of what I wore this week this
leader looks super uneventful so I am
sorry for that an F for outfits picked
out on the fourth outfit I walked out
the door
and it was literally flooding like
actually flooding so I had to go back in
sup my rain boots on it was not
noteworthy it was not cute so all you
New Yorkers know exactly which day I'm
talking about it was insane so three
outfits again this week with that being
said I will go ahead and get into outfit
number what totally gave this outfit
away during the vlog when I thought it
was really cool for Dara to kind of film
the behind the scenes of what goes on
you know when we're shooting so yeah
pretty much ruined that outfit for you
guys so it wasn't a surprise but um
everything is linked below so that's
good news I guess
is brightness down like one I bought
this from forever 21 it is a dress it's
a maxi dress that buttons down and I
thought it was just so comfortable such
an easy throw one piece great color but
I decided to wear it as kind of like a
duster this day you know it was kind of
chilly so I wanted something lightweight
and for over my t-shirt and jeans so I
grabbed this similar to last week when I
disagreed kimono but kind of completely
separate pieces because this is actually
a dress so this is cute belted or just
kind of open as a duster so it's really
versatile a lot of different things that
you can do with it or you put it through
the washer so um the forever 21 you know
test is kind of like fingers crossed so
that this would come out six sizes
smaller than when you put it in so it's
pasty the washing machine tests and I
love this so when I got it
with that I did these jeans from where
are you from from Mazzara and they are
just high-waisted kind of straight leg
jeans with a bunch of rips I love all
the roots in this I think it's so fun
feel like with this outfit you can do
block you could do denim shorts on you
could pretty much do kind of whatever
you want with that duster slash maxi
dress so I feel like I just kind of
thrown jeans and a t-shirt and wanted an
extra piece so I just threw that on
where my bag I did and this little guy
from Zara and I felt like the color just
really tied in nice with me with the
dress I just really really liked this
color combination like the light brown
with the green I thought was really
pretty I did these little guys from
forever 21 and I put in the lights I
heard lookbook I put the nude ones in
the lookbook I went ahead and ordered
the block because I needed a little
black pair of kind of slip-on easy
sandals very comfortable I was in them
all day long I love these
this was my like super comfy if we were
going to the office but you know those
days when you're just like not feeling
it and if you could wear an oversized
cotton t-shirt you just would like if it
were acceptable just to walk out in
immense pain size the double XL T that
would just be great so I just wasn't
feeling it so whenever I'm not feeling
it I grab this handy dandy potatoes back
slash favorite dress in the whole world
and I just called it a day you know I'm
usually like belt this would throw a
mess over or a jacket but I was like you
know what I don't want anything touching
my body right now I'm just going to
dress this up with a fun booty and
that's going to be my outfit so that's
what I did so I did my Matisse floral
ankle bootie and
I just left I mean after I put it on I
was like all right all right all right I
like this so you know these boots just
kind of make everything if I'm having
like a dumpy fashion day just throw on
these boots and it's like all right I
feel a little bit better about myself
printed shoe can go a long way you guys
I love you and so I wasn't like a total
frumpy lady I did this necklace with a
start and worst and I did I love
obsessed that's right here it's so
delicate and I love the top chain and
then the bottom chain so beautiful and
this is actually from forever 21 I have
gotten so many compliments on this
necklace and so bad but it's been in my
jewelry closet for the longest time and
I just kind of stumbled upon it because
it's so delicate it's hard to easy to
miss hard to see I actually did find
this it's linked below
wait still on the website as of
yesterday so I will link this below it
is my new go-to little delicate chain
necklace for my last outfit it was just
kind of a casual Saturday we were
running some errands and kind of hanging
out you know we were kind of cooped up
all week because of the bad weather so
we thought we'd get out and walk around
a little bit to roam the neighborhood
and it was nice so I wanted to be
comfortable so this is just a
three-tiered actually fourth year and
Russell actually not even ruffle it's
just like a four tier flowy top this is
my go-to when I need a flowy top I love
that it's long sleeves it's by kimchi
blue from Urban Outfitters I got it a
few years ago so you might can find it
on Poshmark or Tracey or fried up or
something like that I would definitely
check but I just wore this with some
basic ripped black denim and I just did
my go-to black slaw a little swing back
my go-to black slingback sandals which
are these right here they are just like
my comfy walking shoes and I believe
there's still online at Zara but I think
that they just make any outfit look a
little bit more elevated with you know
like this really cool case detail I love
these so comfortable and I told you I
would report back on the whole situation
so I told you last time that they keep
sliding off but then I found a magic new
hole and it works now so yay for new
holes and I didn't need to carry much
because we were just doing a little
walking around so all I needed was my
wallet and my phone so of course I
grabbed my little eyeholes nothing at
all bags which I love because it's gold
and it's really cool
so double win with silver hardware
triple win actually so I love this bag I
found this shoved under a shoe table of
Zara by the way I just felt so bad for
it I was like who put you there so rude
and that is it for this one I wore again
