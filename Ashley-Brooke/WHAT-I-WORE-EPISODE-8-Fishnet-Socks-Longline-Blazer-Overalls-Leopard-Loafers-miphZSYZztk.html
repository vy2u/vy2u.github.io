here's a No
Oh
yeah
I think
I'm in sauce well no no
it's just boy
I mean
yah
Oh
Oh
what I wore today's intro is going to be
a little bit different I just thought
that it would be easier to talk about
the outfits as I'm wearing them and just
feel like it makes a little bit more
sense and you might actually have been
requesting that so we're going to try
this out let me know what you think
about it this week was a little chilly
so the outfits are a little darker a lot
of black it was super cloudy all week
let's go ahead and get started on the
outfit description so I'm start with
this outfit this was my first outfit
that I wore this week and we basically
went to the office so it's a little bit
more businesslike I've got my blazer on
from H&amp;amp;M that I wear all the time i
layer this thing over everything and I
just love it I love the pockets I love
the sleeve I love how lightweight it is
then I just threw it over this basic
long-sleeved swing dress I think this
was one of those like $12 forever 21
finds the good Lang teen it's a little
wrinkled right now sorry I said it's got
a little bit of a mock neck you know
it's nothing deep snuffing turtleneck is
like a good loss next week I just did a
toast that was the office so I did my
saline tote and the thing that's my
laptop and all of my like you know
snacks and stuff so this is always great
to carry the office they did my flat
form from Aldo with my fishnet socks
from ASOS I thought this box were a fun
little puzzle with this outfit I just
wanted to be super comfortable we're
running errands but it's a little chilly
so I throw a jacket so this is my red
jacket from Zara that I got on sale last
year and this cup is from H&amp;amp;M it's just
one of those really good for little tops
that I like sleep and lounge and we're
out of the house workout it it's just
like awesome it's like a little crop
leave lift gray be a chancer also from
H&amp;amp;M there are just some elastic waist
cool up and either also super versatile
I like to dress them up or down you can
throw on like a dress to your top or
sweatshirt and it's like
and alpha so I love the use of so
comfortable they desist some white
sneakers because we are running errands
so I just wanted to be super comfortable
we're going to be walking around and you
just can't go wrong with away or my
necklaces this one is from forever 21
it's just simple chain and with the
chainsmokers it's just a simple chain
choker and then this one is my by Ilana
long what Goes Around necklace so just
wanted a layer it up a little bit
because this is such a basic outfit that
I've got layering a couple of necklaces
would kind of complete the whole thing
for the comment I'm just wearing my last
three people overalls and I know they
make these every year in so many colors
and they are so comfortable they're
stretchy and I like that they're skinny
as well fact is they're backless overall
so it just looks like thunder coming up
and she look for bra wearing of my white
puffy sleeve top from Zara the front in
the back this is the cotton material and
then this is more of a dressy lighter a
little bit more airy material at my by
Ilana necklace and my Aldo choker my
shoes are by Jun London there my little
leopard loafers they are so comfortable
if I know I'm going to be walking around
a lot I mean like a cute printed shoe I
always grab these alright so that is Ben
