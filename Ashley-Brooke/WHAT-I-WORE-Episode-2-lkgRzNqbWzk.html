let me go Oh wish them guys welcome back
to you what's my channel it's really
bright in my apartment today so I'm
sorry about that like blinded right now
by the Sun today is what I wore was
absolutely a pain in the butt to shoot
it was snowing almost every day of the
week it was in the 20s and 30s it was so
cold but I tried to make the best of it
I know you guys are really really
wanting those spring outfits as a lie
but this week was just almost impossible
to achieve that working with what I had
and casco pretty much all I can say for
myself hopefully the weather will be
getting much nicer
fingers crossed that it doesn't blizzard
again that being said I'll go ahead and
get started into my outfit descriptions
I know I did that because nothing's
happening
so for outfit number one I was actually
in San Diego we were leaving the
conference that we were at and heading
back home so I had zero makeup on just
like the most comfortable outfit
imaginable so I will go ahead and get
started with that so I started out with
my Calvin Klein my little bra top I like
to work out in this I like to sleep in
this I like Calandra on the house in
this if you guys don't already on
something like this I seriously
recommend it it's the most comfortable
thing ever really like ah like six
cotton material super comfortable I got
a size up I got this small I feel like I
wanted a little bit bigger I didn't want
it like so tight so I gotta size small
and Cicero's something over it I just
did this bomber jacket only because this
takes up a lot of room in my suitcase so
I wanted something to wear that's going
to take some stuff out of my luggage but
also ask some like color and print and
it's really comfortable so I did this
summer from a two
and it's like an oversized bomber you
can pretty much get anywhere around your
size range because bombers are oversized
you know they're not fitted so it
doesn't really matter for my bottoms I
didn't equip pants because it was a six
hour flight so I was like I gotta have
my comfy comfy flat pants and these are
my wrists one from River Island I
believe these are still available these
are a size and I think this is yeah a UK
size six and they fit me really nice
they're super comfy issues I just did my
white sneakers because those are easy to
get on and off through airport security
so that is outfit number one super comfy
six hour flight as you can imagine I
just wanted to be like it's comfortable
as possible her outfit and number two I
was just running some errands I had to
go to the office to justin packages I
had to run by CBS it was the day after
for a couple of days after we got back
from San Diego so I just needed some
like little things needs to get my mail
back and stuff so I just did a comfy
black t-shirt long sleeve shirt and I
did my rip high-waisted straight leg
jeans from H&amp;amp;M
I swear H&amp;amp;M has the best high waisted
straight leg jeans before I get all of
them from my own like maybe four pair
that I alternate they're just really
good they're a good fit for me and I
know about you know everyone has
different body shapes but and then I
added this belt that I just got in the
mail actually left a couple weeks ago
maybe last week from Topshop I owned a
silver one from Urban Outfitters but I
wear so much gold that when I saw this
on top shop website I was like sold done
I wear my silver one all the time which
I actually cannot find at the moment but
I'm removing soon obviously so I'm going
to have to dig when we move I actually
thought that this belt kind of tied in
my shoe with the gold hardware this has
got quite a dramatic gold zipper in the
inside it's really hard to miss when
you're walking so I just thought that my
two accessories tied in really nicely
and these boots have actually
star prints all over them star imprints
they're really dirty from the snow
so I mean I wanted to add some prints I
did my good Old Faithful weather leopard
and that leather my leopard jacket but I
where I am so I love the scope I'm so
sick of seeing it because it's so cold I
just wanna be able to not have to wear a
heavy coat but I don't know this like
whole color story and the print just
kind of goes with so much and it hides
in all my accessories nicely so I always
go for this whenever I can for outfit
number three I actually had a Saturday
morning meeting at the office a lot of
you guys asked why I have an office I
have an office because the reasons like
that sometimes you know when you want to
meet have a meeting it's a good space to
go to good place to clear your head a
little bit so I had a Saturday morning
meeting I wishes at the office for a few
hours but I needed to look nice so and
it was freezing I think it was snowing
on and off Saturday so did my soul
leather skirt from Zara and Zara makes
the best all leather skirts whether
you're wanting a casual one or dressy
one this I think you could go either way
it's not quite a pencil skirt but it's
definitely more of a straighter skirt so
it does give you more of like a
professional 5 did my opening boot
because I just thought it looks nice
they kept my lifes warm I did a more
tight because it honestly wasn't like
freezing down to the point where like
every inch needed to be covered it was
just really cold and I was indoors most
of the day so it really didn't matter I
also did a belt I did oh my gosh I've
had this belt 14 years this Michael Kors
um black and gold belt just honestly to
keep my skirt up because it's a little
big on me
so I needed it to like actually serve
the purpose of a belt and not so much in
accessories so I did this I did this
black khaki knit sweater from forever 21
and I actually put the belt around my
waist but I buckled the belt in the
front of the sweater that way it gave me
a little it gave me a waist and you can
kind of see where my torso stopped and
then my life started so and I feel like
when you do that get you long gave you a
little bit and I couldn't puff the
sweater in fully because it is such a
chunky sweater so I just wanted to do a
front tuck about secure it and then good
since you add some print and some
lightness to my outfit because it was so
dark I did my big quad coat from Zara
that I got at the Czar's veils and I
love this guy reminds me of what's that
movie with isla Fisher what's that movie
confessions of a shopaholic this just
reminds me of her so I wore this to make
it a little bit more spring and for my
last outfit oh my gosh this was one of
the coldest days it was raining all day
so I really just stepped outside it goes
to the grocery store and so all day I
was basically wearing that long sweet
black shirt and my champion joggers and
to go out into the cold wow this is to
go out into the cold I wrap myself up in
this big giant blanket star I know it's
a little late for scarves for most of
you guys but Urban Outfitters makes the
best blanket scarves like this and
they're just like great colors like I
love this gray and burgundy it just goes
with so much so I brought myself up in
this and I added something super
heavy-duty because I was trudging
through up you know three feet of snow
so these really really helped me walk
through the snow my hair back because it
was snowing and the wind was blowing so
hard so I like didn't even want to mess
with it I was like my true running out
errands
grocery stores hideout that was it for
this video I really hope you guys loved
it and I apologize because the weather
was just like not working working with
me at all this week so hopefully next
week it's going to be a little bit
better in your project but yeah I can't
wait to show you guys some more spring
