because you know what how we made a pact
but I turn it up we signed our names in
blood and I'm just together you and I
don't you
Oh what now
you
we argue
hi
you
we gotta keep
when I am rather late
I do
you and I
I dream
hi
yeah
Oh
we
Oh
around here
yeah
we got
what I am I'll do things
see what I know
a dream
Oh
how many houses back to my channel today
I'm at home in Texas so the talk-through
is going to be a little short because I
don't have the first two outfits with me
those were filmed in New York obviously
but I'll go ahead and do a quick talk
through and show you guys the last two
outfits my first outfit I had on my
studded sweatshirt from Zara and I love
this thing so much it's a little crops
it's all over studs I know I showed it
in one of my hauls so you guys have
already kind of seen it there but I put
it with that blush color jacket because
I just thought the color combo was
really nice now a hard time finding
things that go well with that jacket
because it's such a specific color but I
thought that that kind of color story
was really nice since what shirt and
then the jacket and then since its
spring I would normally do black jeans
but since it was you know kind of a
sunny day I did my high-waisted straight
like denims from H&amp;amp;M and these are my
comfy denim because they're not super
tight in the way so just not super tight
overall which I love for when I'm
walking around because then I don't have
to worry about them stretching out or
just being super uncomfortable I did I'm
like looking at a picture here because I
forgot what I wore
I did some black boots just because it's
just kind of what was available to me I
feel like you could do gray um even like
a beige color I think would be nice but
I just went with black because my bag
was black so this is my sweater dress
from Zara with some sheer black type
this day was cold I'm like thinking back
to this day and how miserably cold it
was so we pretty much kind of ran to the
office our office in Bryant Park so we
decided we would just hop out and shoot
this outfit so this is something that I
would wear if I needed to just run to
the office for a few hours to take a
call or maybe to just get some alone
time to work a little bit because it's
super comfortable it's very warm and I
did my beanie because my hair was a
little dirty but I think I ended up
taking it off midday because it kept
sliding
I think the dress is from Zara the bag
of saline and the boots are Zara and
then the beanie is from like a Saussure
yeah continued pesos and then I did that
plaid coat just to add a little bit of
print because I feel like it was such a
basic plane outfit but adding a printed
coat just kind of dresses this kind of
makes it a little bit more interesting
you know something fun so I always like
to add a printed coat to more of a basic
style of outfit the third outfit was my
first outfit in Texas and we were just
kind of running around that day we just
ran some errands we went to see my
grandparents so I wanted something super
comfortable but so cute at the same time
so I did this that winged super batwing
sweatshirt from Zara with the pink faux
fur on the suite and absolutely love
this thing it is so comfortable and
obsessed with it for it with my inside
out for it with my lighter wash hmm DIY
uneven hem denim enough right I did this
by myself
could this loafer because I thought the
pink in the loafers hide in really
nicely with the sweatshirt and it just
added some sort of like print detail to
it and the gold Titan my little blimp
yoga bag so I just stuck these on not to
mention these are probably one of the
most comfortable pair of shoes that I
own like padded which is late way to go
Steve measures for my last outfit I did
this onesie jumpsuit from Zara which is
like super a wide leg I can't even show
it in the camera but it's a wide live
black jumpsuit and it has a full single
ruffle down the side and then the bottom
is lined with the same ruffle we just
had a little girls day getting our nails
done and stuff to some family time so I
wanted to be super comfortable so I went
with this this is great to travel with
because it packs up really nicely and
it's just really comfortable we're
walking around then to add a print I did
this little headband from Zara I believe
I don't know if this is the one I got on
sale but I just got it pretty recently I
hope I can find it because I love this
one I think the colors are fun and I
like the floral and the stripe pattern
on it
just did my little slip on sandals that
are also from Zara I know I showed these
in my haul but they're super comfortable
just little swing box and they pretty
much go with everything because they're
just black and white so some of these
that is all I have for you guys today
stay tuned for next week I'm going to
have kind of a split situation again
some from Texas some in New York but I
hope you guys are loving the series
still I know I am because it's allowing
me to just show more of a creative side
and like kind of what I wear on a
day-to-day basis rather than having to
plan out this out and I don't know I
love it there will be a how-to style
coming soon I just want it to be really
good so I'm kind of planning it and I'm
also waiting for it to get a little bit
warmer before I do be have style just so
it's more relevant to you guys because I
know some of you are still are already
getting into the warmer weather so
that's what I'm waiting on forget to
sign up for the life by her lookbook I
know and this is going to be in it

cropped denim
and it looked so cute and yellow such a
good color especially this like mustardy
yellow I think goes with blacks Browns
braids so it's a really good pop of
color to add oh my gosh my dishwasher it
sounds like it's about to explode
these are just really great for when you
need like a good pop of color in your
outfit I think adding like a yellow mule
something a little bit you know the
shoes not so crazy itself it's just a
basic simple mule but just adding a pop
of color can really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
