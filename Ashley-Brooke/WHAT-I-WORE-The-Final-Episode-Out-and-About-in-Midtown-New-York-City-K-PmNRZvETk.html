Oh
Oh
hi guys welcome back to my channel so I
have a little bit of news for you a
little bit of an announcement that I
think most of you will actually love so
this is going to be the last what I wore
I told you when we started this what I
wore series if you like the how to style
better will switch back over so we're
going to switch back over to doing how
to style them some days and of course
I'll do maybe like on a Friday video
just a quick rundown of what I wore this
week if there were some interesting
outfits or something that I really want
to share with you then we can turn it
into some sort of a Friday video but
after this it will be the Hana styles
and it won't be every single Sunday
because we do have a lot going on with
life by her and the how to style videos
they are very time-consuming so we're
pushing back I'm sure most of you are
like jumping up and down right now so
but I do I do still want your feedback
so this is something that you're so
excited about please let me know in the
comments below or if you hate me right
now and you can't believe I'm taking
away the what I wore then let me know
also
but with that being said I'll go ahead
and show you guys what I wore this week
for outfit number one we were downtown
this really cool place where there's
like a big shopping center and he's got
so I wanted to use super comfortable and
very like summery and it was also like
very hot how I wanted minimal clothing
so I grabbed this top from H&amp;amp;M which you
guys saw in yesterday's video I love
this top so much and I've actually seen
people in the left I heard lookbook
group wear it to where it's not cropped
I just kind of made it cropped I tied it
towards the top and blouse it over but I
have seen women wear it as a longer
shirt and it looks really nice that way
too so thought this was really cute so
then I did these white rip short and
these are like very ripped I think I
keep putting my foot through the rip
part but these are from a touch up and
they are the Moto mom's short so they're
high-waisted and they're not
hi which I love like my favorite style
of short so I did this did this bag that
I got from Free People Hartwood house
but one of my subscribers told me that
there s eShop have them on FB for
actually less money so I will link those
below instead of this one because I
think I paid 140 for this one but I
think they're like under a hundred maybe
on Etsy so I'll check for you and then
for outfit number two I did it was just
like a casual day with a little chilly
so I wore jeans but I wore this chemical
from Topshop and I've been really into
pajama inspired pieces lately
whether it be panzer top so I thought
this was kind of pj looking so I was
immediately like oh my name I think this
would be so pretty with a blazer over it
if you need to be a little bit more
conservative or if you want to be a
whole like me and just to wear it
playing and that's fine too so this I
think the waist is so gorgeous it's this
really pretty cream and then the color
itself is just like this really romantic
Smaug color so I love this and so I
wasn't showing too much skin I hate
wearing revealing tops and revealing
bottoms I almost feel like I'm naked so
I do like to balance out my nakedness so
I did see these are one of my favorite
high-waisted mom jeans from H&amp;amp;M and I'd
had them forever actually it does a lie
I've had them on and I got them earlier
this year I can never find them online
here's what the pockets look like you
guys want to go try to search for them
oh wait here's like a PIN number you
know what I'll just type it up below so
maybe you can like ask your locals hmm
for my bag I did my trusty rose gold
slash also gold on bags from Zara
because I thought this was kind of nice
you know playing on this whole color
story of romantic pinks except I was
looking through the clips will go and I
think the bag was turned around the
whole
so just know that I've meant Marini
doesn't notice stuff like this he needs
to top it off I did my Princess Jasmine
shoes my Jeffrey Campbell for free
people love these and they're so
comfortable I don't know I thought this
was kind of made it a little bit fun and
like cool like a cool Jasmine shoe for
my next outfit it was so hot so hot in
humid so I wanted a dress that was just
not touching me and very lightweight so
I did this dress by Tularosa which is
one of my favorite brands I got this one
at Saks off fit but I know they have it
um on revolve I think it's cheaper on
revolt so I'm going to post that one
below but yeah revolt has the best
selection of Tularosa so I love this and
I love all of the colors I'm a detail
everything's just really pretty in my
denim backpack I look like a total
tourist I'm poor this is my little bet I
just thought the Navy kind of looked
nice even though I did do white shoes I
wanted to do a darker bag just because
the dress is so light itself I wanted to
balance out my toes tone it down with
the bag there's my wallet looking back
then for my accessories I did my white
flight from River Island you guys know
I've been obsessed with these lately so
comfortable and I love that they're
white go with everything then to keep my
white team and then I went funny from I
can never remember keep it for people
maybe to keep my rose gold theme I did
this ear jacket that I got from last
night Network someone told me to do this
yep this your jacket from I think it's
one of the ones that I got from litotes
if you watch my vlogs I've partnered
with --let oh and I got bees and they're
by House of Harlow so I love a good year
jacket that's all I have three help us
again I hope you guys aren't too mad at
me for taking away the water wars
although I know I could promise
so I can like know right now that a lot
of you are really happy so leave
suggestions for how to style below
because they are back in full force I
don't know if there's going to be one
next Sunday there will still be a style
video every single Sunday but we're
going to keep the have styles too once
or twice a month that way I need just be
really good you know I feel it before
with the had style I was rushing through
them so I could you know get them out
every single Sunday for you but I want
to be able to give you the best advice
that I can in the best outfits that I
can so in order to do that I do need a
little bit more time to put this
together so one to two times a month
Khan style leave your comments below so
this diagram for the last by heart look
look I know I told you guys in
yesterday's video that if there is a
complete like change going on with the
lookbook it's under reconstruction and

climates and it's going to be double the
pages so it's going to be really cool
