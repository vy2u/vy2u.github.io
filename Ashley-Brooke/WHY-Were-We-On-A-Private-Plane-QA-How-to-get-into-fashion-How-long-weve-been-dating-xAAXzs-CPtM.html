little bit he's just a little excited a
teeny teeny a little bit I am absolutely
terrified of flying as you guys know so
the thought of getting on like a smaller
plane terrifies me so I'm like really
trying to push through this and like
conquer my fears and just to get over it
so we have to get an uber now we're
gonna get an uber and we're gonna head
out yeah I don't know what you wear to
fly on a private plane so this is what
I'm wearing friends does it is workout
clothes you can't wait to go when you
get the call wait do I have my keys
where are my keys I still haven't found
them I think my keys are in one of my
purses from filming yes thank you
we are at the airport it's not really
like an airport that's it go Bobby
cool so we're just waiting for my dad to
land and come in and guess that these
days that's in like 1998 lines going on

damage just been so that it wasn't place
what's this mean yeah it's like a wave
it so rowdy the running wave

just kind of what I'm interested in it
kind of wished at this point that I
could go back into and have a degree in
something like business or marketing or
something like that just a little bit
more broad Clarissa asks what is your
tanning routine step out in the Sun for
five seconds and turn into a crispy
piece of bacon I am very pale and in the
wintertime pale is crying pale in the
wintertime I do use Sancho panz so that
is my go-to tanning lotion smells like
diesel oil but it works great
yeah that's my thing I know you diesel
fuel diesel fuel but you expect me to
know na na Brian always smells me when I
come out of the bathroom and I put it on
he's like oh I always wonder if you and
Ryan are just dating or are you guys
married how did you guys meet we are not
married we're dating
we're domestic murderers we are domestic
partners instant legally we're domestic
partners that's another story about
we're not dating or domestic partners
yeah we've been together five years this
year and he's my best friend so I can't
leave a mrs. point we know too much
about each other
true so many secrets how we met two
different stories will tell you guys
next week
yeah well tell you next week of stories
yeah well tell you next week in the vlog
how we met why don't we do like you tell
and I'll be in another room and then
I'll tell me how the stories match up
and the intermix okay so this is from
Jess of Jason Alex's channel I'm trying
to major fashion merchandising to get
into the fashion industry but I'm a bit
lost on the correct path that I should
go I tend to sort of put myself down
towards my major because when I tell my
people my goals are clear they laugh and
question me those people in other words
can you help give any advice and tips on
somebody going for fashion merchandising
I told you guys the stories before but I
was in college and I had to stand up in
front of a group of people in my class
and tell them what my future plans were
when I said move to New York
everyone busted out laughing oh one
person took me seriously so I'm just
telling you right now if you want to do
something you do it and if someone
laughs at you what like whatever who
cares about them who cares what they say
so never let anyone make you feel small
like you can't do something because you
can do anything anything you set your
mind you I think she should do an entire
video about how to get a job in fashion
in New York because she knows a lot
about it I could do that let me know
what you guys think if you don't mind me
asking how old are you and Ryan Lewis
first I'm 28 oh wait wait right I can't
remember 329 I'll be 29 next year

why start watching Matlock start
watching stories during the daytime TV

getting your hair done at the salon food

I showed you him two months ago I bought
him because I felt I felt bad for him he
was broken at the store so I bought him

alive someone wants to know what Ryan
does for a living you were to ask me
what Ryan does he write on to them
business I know that is true but he does
a lot of computer things to make his
clients and you make sure that they're
at I don't know where I'm going with
this
I have a digital marketing agency and we
help other businesses make more money to
the internet that's exactly what I said
that's the simplest way to put it Brian

at home with his parents after college
and has taken it so far and I'm so proud
so proud proud and you just bring my
shirt that is it for this Q&amp;amp;A so till
next week oh okay vlog family this is

stay tuned way too hot to be going
outside today I am just gonna show you
guys some stuff that I got out forever21
the other day I was with my mom I think
it's in the last vlog that you saw her
we were shopping at that giant for a
story forever 21 which is a total
nightmare during the day but here's the
trick so the open at 8 a.m. it's worth
it to you to wake up and get there at a
a.m. there is literally not one person
there and it's so nice everything is in
order everything is even sized like if
you can
so that is my trick for shopping at this
forever 21 and it works every time I
find the best stuff first I got this top
and it's got beads on it my mom and I we
both bought it and we're joking we were
like I wonder how long that these are
gonna last like how long the beads are
gonna stay on but I tried it on tucked
into some denim shorts and it was really
really cute next I got this wrap top
it's cropped and it just kind of drapes
open in the front and then tie it on the
side and I just thought that the print
