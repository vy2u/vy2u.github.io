say have people of resolve resolve its
airily so bright and I have a quick
meeting errands to run uptown so that's

applied on my grandpa's letter from
Urban Outfitters one of my favorites and
I've got on my black high waisted Mambo
jeans my star boots and for jewelry I'm
wearing my by Alana necklace you to the
collection is my clue swatch main
reasons that I don't really wear watches
because they're so big and bulky on my
wrist every really small risk and I love
the look of this it's so delicate and
small and I love the white face I think
it just looks like vintage and really
really cool so comes with me show you
guys how cute this bag is that they sent
me get black bands with it actually it
change out the band's I'm really loving
this gold ones I'll probably keep this
one on for for a while but you know if
you want something a little bit more
chill more relaxed I think this is a
good alternative I think I'll wear my
little gold Oh gold Balenciaga to match
my clue swatch and my other jewelry so
yeah so I just threw my leopard coat on
because I've just kind of been
shamelessly wearing this thing with
pretty much everything phases
Han is a crazy-ass driver so my lip

definitely was here there were things
that I had over time parting with but I
was like I won't warn me and one which
one you real just one of you have this
plan Cheers - I'm so like sweaty
girl that's me playing on the drone the
other day and we flew it in the house
obviously you guys all that earlier but
what we didn't show you is that Ryan
actually took a giant chunk out of the
wall because he crashed our drone into
the wall so I read the instruction and
then clearly say do not fly indoors
because you can crash the bed didn't
apply to you right why does it not know
and then decided why not try it crash
yeah so in half a I don't know if you
can see this but this is like a giant
chunk out of our wall where he crashed
it here so you think after he crashed at
once he would stop doing it no this
whole wall was completely stuck he
crashed it here and then he tried to
grab it with his hand so then his hand
he cut his hand out because the blades
been so bad just got to go through some
battle to get good at stuff no all of
our clothes we cooked into Susanna's who
works downstairs and she is sending them
back to the country that sheeps from the
orphanage there so we left them all with
her he's awesome Susanna is awesome

okay well all my team about this is that
I'm never wearing a shirt ever again
hi guys happy Sunday we're getting a
late start day because we've been
filming all morning and all afternoon so
now we are walking down to a healthy to
get some containers at the Container
Store and I think it may be like Home
Depot and Whoopie my mouth is so red
because I had red lipstick on and I just
scrubbed it off and like I can't tell
you
it's like glue like the best last words
red lipstick I phone off to put in a my
next call because it's new I'm looking
at what's going on but it's a really
beautiful day we're walking to just
according from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond Brian
will not let me get another Pole it's
different of all I know what is that
tell me about it
we already have one family all right
good look at you being level-headed my
favorite so we're in Restoration
Hardware not terrific and Stillman here
so nice
check out this living room
and then I'm in the rug heaven right
here
all right we just found on the dinner
and we're heading home but the weirdest
thing has happened Ryan said he was
having this weird pain in his right foot
and I was like no way me too
on my right ankle bone and he was like
no way me too
so we pulled over and both pointed to
where our ankles were hurting and it's
the same exact spot on the same exact
look very strange
oh we are but I have a theory I already
told her my theory doesn't believe it 90
foot here's the difference
are you ready sister do you wanna know
sir so the theory is we're both right
footed which means we have a
predominance with our right foot while
we're walking with our stride and in New
York City
almost every sidewalk he walked on has a
totally like you're like a pair and I
think that because we're both favorite I
realize this you were wearing collecting
element over walk more on the right foot
the
that's scary
pretty sure it's backed by science and a
bunch of peer-reviewed articles medical
publications
okay you're right oh come on old man but
I'm gonna run it by dr. Austin Myers my
best friend okay Austin last doctor - a
stop scenario you're near right on it
mayor we've got about 14 walk so 15
minutes later and we're still having the
conversation about the ingles I don't
know what's going on figure it out
no no don't think we're walking on
sidewalk again and it'll sir what make
it work better standing we have a
problem and it's called we have too much
halos off at home that's never a problem
it is when you're trying not to eat a
halo top except very cool on sheet
dangers to do on if you're trying on to
Sheila's off you don't buy five pints of
halo song no quiet right here right you
usually actually wait this person
standing up here you ever do you decided
to go down the street to my cross edit
so Rose sick cat was - okay who else
Sue Ellen was - uh pardon will report
he's just trying it up trying to try not
shot falls apart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
