to how to styles for different outfits
good morning how are you
same ready to go got my camo joggers on
white t-shirt sneakers long cardigan
ready martinis in a sock already we
haven't even left yet
and our child is so excited Oh baby baby
cotton missed his mum and dad I don't
know if you guys know this but Ryan and
I rescued a white boxer right when we
started dating he's giant and he's deaf
dangerous combination when he's walking
over your feet yes say hi can you say hi
are you a good boy so we left cotton in
Texas with Ryan's family because a he's
deaf and it would be hard for him in the
city also because he's old and he is
authoritah
so walking a lot it's not good for him I
think cotton would hate New York and
yeah I don't think you like it if it's
snowed you just blend right in we
wouldn't know you were there cotton
doesn't like really anything but
sleeping so that's super like sleep well
hi good morning
so I just got done unpacking all of my
stuff and I was on the life by her
Facebook group and a lot of you guys
didn't know about Poshmark
said I said something on snapchat that I
bought something on Poshmark and
everybody was like wow what's that so
let me just show you guys really quick
how I like to use Poshmark and for those
of you who don't know what Poshmark is
it's basically like where you can go to
buy them sell things but it's like all
fashion related and you have your own
closet that you can sell stuff on or you
can shop other people's closets and
follow them so it's almost like a social
media thing this is basically what my
closet looks like and I think I've only
got a couple of things on mine right now
this is what you know if you were gonna
sell stuff this is what it looks like if
you are wanting to buy something then
you basically just go to your news feed
and you can search like bizarra shoes
and it already presets everything
whenever you sign up you just kind of
preset your sizes I followed this person
right here and I absolutely love her
stuff like a lot of brands that I like
and a lot of shoes that I like I was
actually scrolling through Poshmark last
night while I was laying in bed so I'm
just gonna go to my home screen and then
I'm gonna go to my likes and I found
these boots that I was obsessed with so
I liked these and now they are saved I
don't want to pay the full 99 dollars so
I'm just gonna send her an offer of $50
and see if she accepts I have a credit
of $24 because I sold something
previously so I'm gonna be charged $31
if my offer is accepted so I'm gonna go
ahead and submit the offer so if those
congratulations offers submitted and
we'll see what she comes back and says
but it's cool because you can go back
through and kind of see everything
you've liked it's almost like a wishlist
type thing and you can see if something
it's marked down even further another
cool thing about Poshmark is that if you
go here and invite your friends they use
your code and they get five dollars off
their next purchase and then you get
five dollars off after their first
purchase you type this code in you will
get five dollars off of your next
purchase so that is super cool little
feature really and download the app it's
free go play with it and you will find
some hidden treasures you know finding
new brands that I'd never even heard
about before there's just so much good
stuff so definitely go check it out
for my lips I lined them with Rimmel
London the color zero to zero rich and
then I filled it in with shocker rose
femme by Milani get to part way out in
the park a parking lot of some sort
carsick

snapchat what your remedy of carsickness
was and how to get rid of motion
sickness so thank you for all of your
suggestions and I just need to like
permanently live with like a motion sick
patch I'm air like a lifetime one that

little bit more what's going on Dan it's
hot I'm having major flashbacks right
now so that's our old building this
yellow one on the corner that's where we
lived that whole thing was our apartment
this is basically what it looks buying

flashback for you are you ready tell me
a funny flashback you have you remember

TV in his bedroom we'll give you guys a
little tour of where we used to live all
right
so skip it sure so this is the pool
that's the pool and then that right
there is the bar so basically our old
apartment complex had a hotel right in
the middle of it so it was a u-shape so
there was apartment hotel in the
apartment so we'll show you guys what
the hotel looks like and then kind of an
overview of everything the balcony of
the hotel looks like someone's got to do
a wedding or something so here is a view
off of the balcony there's Ryan
oh so you can go to the gym look at him
backpack and everything so ready to go
but here's the hotel another good thing
about our old apartment is the bar it's
right downstairs though thank Brian so
this is the little bar that we would
always come to to grab a couple of
drinks do you really get cocktails it's
kind of like an overview of the hotel
this is a really nice feel panic go so
we can go to the gym because Brian
supposed to have a heart attack
the rim in San Antonio so I did not blog
at all today but all I pretty much did
was run some errands I dropped to Ryan
off at the gym and I had to go get a
sports bra because first some reason I
only packed one I went to forever 21 and
I grabbed this sports bra it's just
plain white on the front and the back
it's really cool it's really strappy and
black and white so I can't wait to wear
that and then I just went on run I ran
two miles and then I did so many lunges
and side lunges I can barely walk up the
stairs right now I'm in pain and Brian's
