and then we're going to go over to New
Jersey so this is my go-to perfume all

my floral sweater from Urban Outfitters
teddy bear coat from forever 21 my
motton beau black high-waisted skinnies

been doing the same thing baby don't you

find some Wi-Fi though first so we can
um go get Star Wars both get to work
Oh
Oh
right now you're about to head to the
gym you just finished filming something
quick that's why I have makeup on or
else not make fun I just wanted to show
you guys a yoga sent me the nicest
package with the nicest note so I just
kind of would just show you guys really
quick what they sent me and got this
gray bra
gray sports bra but look at the back
look how cool this is
remember the white leggings that I
ordered from Amazon they sent me the
same pair and black leather effects when
you have them on lip stuff with that
then they sent me these pants that I'm
wearing right now
these are definitely my favorite look
how cool these are they're high-waisted
and they are so comfortable so stretchy
and it look like ripped jeans what's
going on with my hair oh my gosh help we
did not have hot water last night so we
both had to take cold showers and I got
in the shower and I was like sticking my
leg in like one at a time terrible it
was so bad and I had to watch I needed
to wash my hair but obviously I didn't
since freezing so it's like throwing my
head under the thing and just like I
don't think I got all the shampoo out
they sent me in this workout top and
this is so my jam I love this this is
the kind of like top that I like to work
out in where it's like a cropped kind of
brawl at top and I did have this on with
what I'm wearing now but I got a little
makeup on it while I was putting it on
so I'm going to wash it really quick I
love it you know we do my hair because
something is happening like look look at
that it is always it myesha's no money
lion's mane it is a last name my ends
are atrocious they need to be trimmed so
so badly
I'm not going to chop all my hair off
but I am definitely going to get a good
trip with all my dead ends because
they're getting out of control
so I am wearing this little cotton like
cropped t-shirt from forever 21 my wrist
Ella leggings stuffs with these and then
my white ideas in undies these are new
Ryan got me because he surprised me with
them new shoes I know we couldn't find
him anywhere we looked we looked all
over the city and they were just sold
out everywhere I didn't know they were
so hard to come by I love them you know
it just realized we don't have the wide
angle lens on sure you know all right
that's so much better
all right I'm done with my workout
friends oh really
oh I got banana spinach strawberries
whey protein chia seeds in coconut milk
but I left my keys and Ryan's bag so I
can get them and then all my smoothie is
going to be on
Oh M peanut butter did I say peanut
butter my gosh hair I forgot I had a hat
on I went to of the who what where
spring preview collection I must say I
was so nervous I'm such an introvert
when it comes to like being around other
people I don't know I just go into a
networking or like a blogger type of
event makes me so nervous because I
don't know so that was kind of stepping
out of my comfort zone doing something
like that by myself and I wasn't going
to do it I was like no I'm not going I
don't know anybody like making all these
excuses and I was like no you're going
to go if it makes you uncomfortable
that's even more of a reason to go do it
so I did it and I'm so happy I did it I
met so many cool girls it was enough it
wasn't terrible it wasn't it was so much
fun so a little bit of advice if
something makes you uncomfortable do it
step out of your comfort zone and
because I'm so glad I did and now I can
be able to like confidently go to things
like that and not get nervous and you
know so what you don't need you can be
and I know they do sell actual cookies
rookies and fudge I'll meet with that
Joe know that you no longer have this
meat from the mixing bowl for the
longest time everybody's been saying no
no no don't eat it and now finally what
liberating people are saying how hot is
enjoy gluon what what gluten-free okay
we're there communicate we're there all
right so it's been pretty much a lazy
day of working on the wolf look because

think the last vlog we ended with us
watching the news and that really
delicious looking cookie dough place
came on so guess where we're headed

shooting how to style right now and we
decided we would film the last look
downtown kind of by way to cook evil
places so we can do a few things in one

getting our stuff ready and the window
washers slowly crept on cooperate

deserve what assault on your skin

solo focus so much all right so we just
wrapped up filming how to style and it's
so cold we're in the cutest little area
