Christmas you filthy animal
now a huge shout-out to the girl we just
saw crossing the street we were all
crossing the street with like a bunch of
people and she was like Ashley Brooke
I'm a huge fan it was like hey girl
flight or a bus
yeah you were in super hurry but we just
wanted to say it more informally hello
hello and nice to meet you crossing the
street your lovely gray pants
hey my back so we've been back for a
little bit we went to go get our luggage
and run a couple of errands but I'm
about to start packing on my suitcase
blanket underneath because dirty washing
all my sheets right now because I love
when I come home from a week-long trip
and like from the airport showering and
getting in clean sheets it's like my
favorite things so I'm washing
everything right now while I pack just
looking up the weather in Texas it is so
weird today when we land it's gonna be
80 degrees and then tomorrow the high is
like 45 nothing is making sense
hey you helping you help it or not so
much
pack up and we are heading out I've got
all of my flowers and plants on the
windowsill I kind of look like a pimp
but I'm digging it at the same time I've
got on my super comfy black sweater
dress that I think I traveled with the
last time and then just this like kimono
from Zara yeah
super comfy comp no makeup and he had
I'm wondering if I should take off this
faux fur thing because I really do kind
of look like a pimp I can pimp you out
with your t-shirt in your scarf at my
big giant
then I've got my big giant bag okay I
just took the faux fur off and it
definitely looks better this whole
working lip here little airport outfit
update I missed our flight
Airport from our apartment is 15 miles
we were in the car for almost three
hours so we missed our flight by like 20
minutes my attention please
we're in the reefing line all right now
I'll keep you updated we're back home so
here's the situation we I don't even
know what I told you guys cuz I blacked
out while I was there we were waiting in
that super long rebooking line and I
finally we finally got to the first and
they were like yeah we can totally
rebook your flight it's gonna be $1300 I
was like no and it's kind of hard
because obviously it's our fault that we
missed the flight it's completely our
fault but it took three hours to go 15
miles which is insane so no excuses like
it's our fault our fault completely and
that sucks
I know so got in the car we were super
pissed about it and Ryan was like Ari I
just needed a second to like calm down
so like 10 minutes later he's like
alright you know I'm super I have you I
have Stella
he was like naming off all the things he
was like thankful for and um he called
that oh dude give yourself 10 minutes to
be pissed and furious and then realized
you're not gonna remember the six months
and then he was like yeah exactly
you're not gonna remember in six months
so and then he was like named off
everything he was single for and then he
was like so what do you hope hurt inner
about the 800-number we left the airport
with no books flight and we called the
800 number and they said they would call
us back in an hour because that was the
wait time spent some time on the phone
and was probably the like the nicest guy
the deltas ever talked to but after like
15 minutes and crossing my fingers my
boy Manny waved the change feet charters
on the ticket because of the
circumstances so Big Ups to Delta for
help around with that
thank you very much saved us some cash
I'm just gonna go ahead and say we'll
probably wake up at 2:30 and leave here
at 3:30 just to make sure that this
doesn't happen again
NYC traffic why doesn't work for me but
okay
