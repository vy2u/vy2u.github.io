afterwards we were like okay we should
make this like a tradition thing like
bachelor party whoo quantity here for
Taylor her wedding is in a couple of
months so we're gonna go back to Texas
for that but it was just such a great
time to be back for a couple of days I'm
just kind of playing catch-up and just
getting some last-minute stuff done that
I needed to do was gonna go shoot
something for Kenneth Cole outside and
then Ryan my photographer had to jump on
a call with the client and so I think
I'm gonna go try to get my workout done
really quickly slept in quite a bit
today I think I'm still kind of tired
from my trip but I slept in until like
8:30 which is so not like me I'm usually
up at like 5:30 trying to get all my
outside stuff done today because
snowstorm is coming tomorrow actually it
hits tonight so it's gonna be a little
little crazy tomorrow at the gym now and
I am I'm actually wearing a pajama top
from Target or not a pajama top but like
this is not a this is not a workout bra
I'm wearing it to the gym I'm just gonna
try to fool everybody so for my top I'm
wearing my fake gym top wearing my
gsella rose gold leggings you know when
I bought these leggings I was like oh
these will be super easy everything will
go with them no I have really like worn
them only once or twice because nothing
cute goes with them except for just a
black bra but now that I've got my fake
top all is right in the rose gold
lightning pan world so I'm wearing rose
gold pants rosy color top rose gold
headphones my lips match my top rose
gold hardware on my backpack I hate
myself right now real last week when I
loved my keys at home and then I banged
on the rock apartment tour
oh my gosh my arms trying to hold the
camera right now
so that was a pretty quick workout
usually Tuesdays I love because my
workout only takes like an hour and it's
upper body so it's not to like
exhausting it's just about my body but
I'm going to rinse off now my second
shower of the day probably take one
before bed because I'm weirdo and then
you're gonna run down and shoot for
Kenneth Cole I'll see you then
alright she's like I just turned the
camera off rinsed on my body and I can
fly
now I'm looking flies how I do like all
the that's around us like you run
that I'm gonna freeze okay here's all
inclusive we had this outfit we
wouldn't shot this outfit before I went
to Texas when it was like in the 60s and
now Stella shoot up the memory card that
the Q&amp;amp;A was on which is where there was
no Q&amp;amp;A last week and so now we're out
reshooting his outfit and that's cold to
get all that so things are going

child
Joey you ready
Oh

stuffed in dog too
I don't think I've ever seen you do
those moves before very quick I was
really good I am impressed 32 years old
still move the are about to cross the
street and go back home
I guess they could have used the
crosswalk like normal people these are
the shoes whoa these are the shoes I was
shooting by the way look how cute these
are
it's just an for Instagram but I love
Kenneth bulb go way back you can go way
back I do anyway shoes are super cute I
love them hold on tell me in a section
hey you want to know something funny I'm
wearing sticky boobs I'm there literally
down to my belly button Ryan just told
me
Ryan just thing with a low down on how
Kenneth pole got his start told you mean
can go way back and it's a really cool
story but how did you know that many
random fact why do you know so many
things like if Jenna and I ever have a
question we're always like right animal
now Brian you're very smart
thank you got a great friend named
Google's alright so making my after
workout protein shake and you guys have
been asking me um did you fart again I'm
literally gonna throw up all over my son
oh it stopped laughing oh so you guys
always ask me what protein powder I'm
using and we use the lifetime fitness
vegan protein in chocolate and we also
love the mint chocolate as well the
vanilla is not that great but the
chocolate and the mint chocolate are the
best I'm gonna sit down and do some
editing I'm gonna go through beep oh I
go through the photos that we just took
and I'm gonna edit I think I have to
pick like my top three send them over to
my agent she sends them to the brand and
they pick which one they like out of the
top three so that is how this campaign
is working every campaign is different
so you go find photos at them
while I was in Texas I stopped it target
I got a couple of things so I was just
gonna show you guys what I got first of
all I did get something that's not from
Target it's from TJ Maxx and it is this
little handbag isn't this so cute I know
I thought there was something kind of
like vintage looking to it I don't know
if it's the way that it shaped or one
who makes this Madison West and it was
only $24.99 I thought it was just so
cute and from Target I got this who what
where cropped trench coat with this
really pretty ruffle detail I cannot
wait to wear this I just thought this
was the cutest thing actually like
buttoned up with like a turtleneck
underneath and jeans love this and then
I got this dress it's like a polka dot
black and this black yeah black and
white sheer with this tear like ruffle
tear on the bottom I think it's like a
3-tier but it's kind of diagonal and it
was really cool with like edgier boots
as well so yeah that wasn't a little
target whole my little Texas haul I
think that's all I got I'm looking right
now I think that's it in the airport
parking lot and I was shoving these
things in my suitcase oh I also got
underwear of course I feel a target just
has the best like sleep shorts because I
normally sleep in like little boy shorts
and I'm matching like bralette or
something like a bad door is not a
sports bra but like those little bra
tops like I was wearing at the gym and I
always stock up on those cuz they're
like $5 and they're so comfortable I
think that's pretty much all I have in
my PJs or now is those little sets but
yeah alright just thought I want to show
you that now I don't know what to do so
I'm gonna go finish I'm watching the
sheets right now because still is
getting a bath so instead I gets bath
everybody gets bad
like clean start/finish up editing and
I'll see you guys maybe a little bit
probably for dinner Ryan's at the gym
and I just made dinner son and I are
watching news keeping an eye on the
storm that's coming in I haven't event
to go to tomorrow actually for
Charlotte's Hillsborough and she's
actually gonna be there so I really hope
that doesn't get cancelled hmm it might
anyway I'm having a doctor preggers
Berger that I already took a bite out of
and mashed potatoes and green beans and
I actually made this whole meal because
I was craving mashed potatoes I was like
what goes with my shadows everything I
just made this I didn't feel like
cooking anything so it's like the
prankers goes in the oven and then the
two things go like on the stove but I
don't have to mess with it because I'm
working on April magazine right now and
yeah so I wanted something quick and
easy that I didn't have to like maintain
so this is always good so I just ate
dinner and I've been working on a
magazine for like 15 minutes and I think

go I'll see you guys later tonight I
just showered for the third time today
I've been putting on my face lately it's
my drunk elephant I serum and around my
eyes and my eyelids then I have been
using this stuff right here it's a
licorice root bright skin and it's
really kind of helped me even out my
skin tone which is what I needed so
badly I'm gonna just got it on Amazon
it's been really great doing a mix of my
trunk elephant vitamin C serum when I
put that like all over my neck all over
my chest and then I mix of that actually
with this little sample size that I have
I really love this drunk elephant face
oil I just need to like buy the full
size one basically what I've been doing
and that's for like my skin in my hair
I'll just spray a little bit of this
hair and body mist a little bit in my
hair and then sometimes I will put my
dr. jarred Tiger grass cream I really
love this stuff but it's pretty sick so
I don't really use it
oops and it's expensive so I don't
really use it unless I absolutely need
it so that's my skincare routine like
right now kind of changes you know I
like your skin gets so accustomed to
what you're using that I think it's good
to kind of switch up like your same
products I really love my lactic acid
but again you can only use this like
once a week same with like my glycolic
acid and stuff like that I have a pimple
right here so I always do my spot
treatment on
I'm literally almost hourly how empty
that is it's bedtime
well kind of I'm going to go finish
season finale of The Bachelor tonight so
I have to watch that and then I'm going
to work on the magazine and I know the
bed but see you guys next blog which the
Q&amp;amp;A will be in Nice blog goodnight
