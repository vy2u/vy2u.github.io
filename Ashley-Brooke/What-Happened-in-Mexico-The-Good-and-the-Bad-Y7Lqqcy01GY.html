everyone welcome to the Mexico of the
log I'm already back from Mexico right
now let's turn the camera a little
brighter so I didn't even actually
really tell you guys in the vlog we kind
of like landed in Mexico and hit the
ground running I didn't even have time
to tell you why we were in Mexico so we
went because Ryan is a part of a group
called the Brotherhood and there's total
about a hundred and seventy guys all
over the world who are entrepreneurs and
business owners and each year they do
with global gathering at some random
destination like last year and they went
to Jackson Hole this year was in Mexico
in Mexico they were probably a total of
about 60 of us because a lot of the
people brought like their spouses and
girlfriends and stuff so it was a pretty
large group of us and so that's why we
were there two of the days they do
masterminds mastermind sessions which
they kind of all get together and talk
about business and like strategize and
problems like different problems that
they might be having in their business
and they just kind of consult each other
I know they had speakers coming in as
well to talk about like finances and
stuff like that so they didn't go to
those so I don't really know exactly but
that's kind of the gist of it and also
it was so cool seeing people that I'd
either heard of or talked to on the
phone and not on the phone but on skype
all the time like I'm trying to think of
some of the guys that were there that I
talked to you so like Karl my financial
adviser our financial adviser he's part
of the Brotherhood so I finally got to
meet him in person Mark Manson is part
of the Brotherhood he was there with his
wife Fernanda and she's a youtuber Mark
Manson wrote one of my favorite books of
all time that I always recommended to
you guys so I was really excited to
finally meet him in person
Todd was there Todd is actually the
owner of the fulfillment center that we
use for the karma and sunglasses and
that we will be using with more
merchandise
o our friend Ryan Moran who lives in
Austin we've known Ryan for so many
years he has the podcast freedom fast
lane that I always
I'm into you guys so he's part of the
group and he was there so it was fun
hanging out with him then a guy who I've
listened to his podcast before and I
could be wrong but I think at one point
he had the largest podcast in the world
his name's Jordan Harbinger so I
actually got to speak with him for like
a moment in passing so that was kind of
cool he's part of the Brotherhood Oh
someone else he's part of the
Brotherhood that I got to meet is um oh
my gosh I can't think of his name but he
he create he is the co-founder of the
green powder that I use that I put in my
smoothies and like with water and stuff
so he sold that on Amazon so it was
really cut it was nice to like meet him
in person I think I actually meet him
while I'm vlogging and then turned the
camera off because I forgot the cameras
on there was this other guy that was
there his name is Todd Herman and he
actually lives here in New York City and
I was really willing to meet him because
he's a performance coach for like
professional athletes Olympians so it
was really cool to like meet him and
kind of talk to him for a little bit Oh
Garry and Sarah that's a mouth Garry and
Sarah Garry is one of Brian's clients
but he and Sarah live in the city we go
to dinner with them and we hang out with
them from time to time kind of nice to
hang out to hang out with them because
they are kind of going back and forth
between New York City and Utah so it was
nice to connect with them nice meeting
everyone's girlfriends and wise and I
don't know it was just a really good
time a really good time overall but you
will notice in the book there's kind of
like one whole day that's unaccounted
for and then I kind of it disappeared
for like the rest of the vlog it's the
second to last full day that we were
there I woke up and I had this like
tickle in my throat and I was like no no
no no no though I was like drinking tea
I was like okay it's fine fine ah the
next day which was the which was the
last full day that we were there I woke
up it was so bad and I was like no I'm
gonna push through this like I can deal
with this a really sore throat like it's
fine I get down to the pool and the
fever hit and I'm just like miserable
I'm in the Sun in Mexico like shivering
so I text Ryan I was like I'm
okay I've gotta go back up to the room
so Ryan like leaves the mastermind that
he said takes me to the room like I get
in a hot bath I'm still just freezing
shivering that my fever so hard finally
go get some medicine from the pharmacy
that was there take that so I started
feeling a little bit better I felt good
enough to go to dinner but I was just
like in bed all day long with the worst
fever I felt so terrible the vacation
from hell on the last day like you have
beautiful Mexico and you're sucking but
of the fever so I'm just single that
that I got to enjoy two days before that
that kind of sucked and then the next
day I woke up fever again Cinque through
you know we go take a group photo I took
medicine so I could get my fever down
for a little bit then as soon as like
it's time to leave the airport my fever
hits I had like fever the whole flight
we went to help we flew to LA we had a
layover
so I was just like laying in the airport
like just died I was I felt so terrible
the medicine link wasn't even helping at
this point
luckily our flight from LA to New York
was overnight and we had those lay down
seats so I got to just kind of crash and
lay down and just sleep it off and then
got to New York and I've just kind of
been resting up Arizona so you'll notice
I wake up in the vlog and I'm like oh my
throat kind of hurts but it's fine and
then I like disappear because I was
literally just like a potato the whole
entire time
Brian took such good care of me so that
was really sweet of him because I know
he you know kind of like left some
things that he was doing even though I
told him to go away I'm totally fine he
stayed with me I finally like kicked him
out no I wanted to get so much like
there was just so much that I wanted to
do I wanted to go horseback riding I
wanted there was just so much I wanted
to do but I just liked it when you have
a fever I feel like I can push through
pretty much anything but a high fever
and really don't like your skin hurts
your body aches like your hair hurts
you're so cold no matter what then you
just break out into a sweat it's just
not fun
then hello so then got back home strep
throat got antibiotics and I've been on
antibiotics ever since I'm almost done
with my prescription you know what's so
funny I don't think I've had strep
throat since high school I have not had
strep throat since high school and I got
it on our third day in Mexico like how
does that even happen I don't think I've
been sick in like I mean I've had little
tiny coals here and there but I don't
think I've been like legitimately sick
in like five years and then I get it
I get the flu first week of log mess and
then I get strep throat while I'm in
Mexico how does that even happen to
somebody here thinking in my head like
someone told me before I went
plant-based like your immune systems
gonna go down and I was like that is
such a myth it really is so I'm refusing
to believe that that's the reason I've
been sick twice honestly I was a little
stressed out like before I went to
Mexico the couple of weeks before that I
wasn't taking my green powder or my
vitamins I was just kind of running all
over the place so that might have
something to do with it take your
vitamins take your greens I'm gonna stop
talking now and I'm gonna let you enjoy
what is the vlog trust me I wanted to
vlog so much more and I'm sorry that
it's not it's super great but I did my
best so enjoy and since I didn't really
get a chance to show you guys what I
wore in Mexico we're going to do a video
this coming this week on I'm just gonna
like do a sit down and show you guys
like what I bought because a lot of you
said you were going on vacation and so
you wanted to see what I bought and
maybe get some of the same things so
I'll show you what I got
look at these these driveways like all
throughout the property - like they go

doing dates him so last night we landed
went straight to the room got ready went
to this really nice beach dinner that
they had set up but it poured rain it

had to go inside that's why we didn't
really feel much because it was pouring
rain and we were outside our going to
breakfast right now and then we're gonna
go on a boat
I packed lots of Dramamine sickness
hopefully good morning it was like
almost $200 adhara
and I got it on sale for 25 I think no

long like tassels almost to the floor

for a greens product to take like a
green powder as a superfood and we were
looking on Amazon we bought one because
it had great reviews after a search for
it and then I realized the company named
after the fact and I realized the guy
was in the group and I had message I
tagged him on the posts on in serum
stories and I've been chatting back and
forth of them just ran into him on the
trip and then read him before it was
kind of cool we're heading out to dinner

morning eyes is our last full day here
and I'm so sad I woke up this morning
feeling a little under the weather I was
like coughing and my throat is killing
me and just like pressure in my head I
think it's probably either like the
dramatic change of seasons that I'm
going through or the guy on the plane
behind me coughing and hacking the whole
entire flight here so one of the two but
I started feeling a little tickle in my
throat yesterday and I was like think
good thoughts gonna go away tomorrow no
