for more what I ate today videos so that
is what we're gonna do today is about 8
o'clock in the morning I just got back
from the gym so it's time for breakfast
and my after workouts
now on to the smoothie and sometimes
after I go to the gym and I've had my
oatmeal sometimes I am too full to have
a smoothie because as we know oats can
be very filling so no matter what time
of day it is I always try to stick a
smoothie
whether it's one of my snacks or right
before dinner or even like a meal
replacement for lunch do you think it is
important to get your smoothie and at
some point of the day preferably in the
morning because that is what has all of
the good stuff in it these are the two
vitamins that I do like to pop into my
smoothie every day I am terrible at
remembering to actually take them but I
keep them by my blender on my kitchen
counter so I do remember to put them
inside of my smoothie those of you who
watch my vlogs have seen both of these
before and for those of you who watched
me last year I used to take their
collagen their collagen products but
then I went plant-based of now I am
using these you guys they are by vital
proteins who actually sponsored this
video some things thank you guys you
know I'm a big fan of your products that
have been for a very long time but first
we have the Beauty boost that I pop into
this obviously is for hair skin and
nails actually has biotin and vitamin C
in it which helps produce your body's
natural collagen fetchin also helps
support a healthy metabolism and just a
quick tip for you guys it is better to
ingest it then put it on your skin and
my next product by vital proteins is the
spirulina and I never know if it's
severely in our spirulina so either way
you want to say it but it helps me get
some greens into my smoothie and it's
loaded with vitamin A which is a really
great antioxidant it has great detox
benefits and helps you keep a good
immune system and gives you a little bit
more energy oh that's why I say it's
perfect to take your smoothie in the
morning time because this is a very
energizing smoothie so I try my best to
remember every morning but sometimes I
will have to take it lunch and then I
have a little power boost towards the
end of the day for those of you guys who
have sinus problems and this is probably
one of my favorite tips for this is it
helps reduce inflammation so if you have
sinus problems it'll help you reduce all
of the swelling and inflammation
you have going on up there I will link
both of these products in the
description box they have you know if
you aren't on a plant-based diet there
are so many great products like I said
I've used their collagen before I used
to use the collagen packets they had and
put them in my smoothie every morning so
that's also a great item for you to
happen I've actually had so many of my
subscribers last row tell me that they
bought the product and put it in their
smoothies and they loved it so that's
also a great product as well but I will
put everything
it is time for lunch now and I'm gonna
do a salad of some sort so let's see
what we can come up with I don't like to
eat super heavy for lunch because I love
eating dinner so early so I like to do a
small lunch and then to light snacks in
between
so I'm about to make dinner for dinner I
usually like to do and like a lot of
rice potatoes veggies a lot of fake meat
pay me but for dinner I like to do some
sort of like Bowl usually it'll be like
rice or quinoa or cauliflower rice and
then I like to do veggies like Brussels
sprouts broccoli green beans
I like chickpeas black beans and then
some sort of alternative meat option
whether it be chicken or like a like a
burger patty kind of like I showed you
guys for lunch either veggie black bean
or like a beyond meat replacement love a
side about apado toes so I usually do a
side of avocado toast with pretty much
anything I have no clue what I'm gonna
make for dinners well I'm gonna go look
around see what I can find and I will
show you guys when I'm done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
