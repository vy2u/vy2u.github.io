channel
event special guest with me today Mike
Oh chef Mike Oh eater co-leader yeah we
used to get there you know was so
requested ever since Ryan and I went on
a plant-based diet we've been getting a
lot of requests to do a kind of what I'm
eating today or just kind of do a quick
Q&amp;amp;A about being plant-based but before
we get started of course I just want to
let you guys know that I am NOT a
nutritionist I'm not a professional you
know when it comes to cooking and all of
that did this kind of blog style meaning
you know no fancy editing just kind of
grabbing a camera and rolling with it if
you guys watch our blog you pretty much
see what we eat all the time so um yeah
if you're more interested in recipes and
foods then definitely follow along on
the blog because we you know are pretty
much in the kitchen about 50 percent of
the time oh we want to help it
okay so with that being said let's go
and get started in the video I just woke
up so we are going to make some coffee
checks and emails and I go to the gym
so just stop back from the gym and now
I'm going to make my after workout
smoothie plus slash friends I'm going to
make a post-workout breakfast protein
smoothie plus somatic cottages all right
so for my smoothie I'm going to start by
putting I in my blender and even had my
frozen fruit I like to do a frozen
strawberries frozen bananas I freeze my
own bananas because I feel like it's
cheaper than buying frozen bananas
all right a spoonful of
black sea
to make it a little bit thicker and a
little bit more party I guess I do some
oak a scoop of almond butter or peanut
butter or cashew butter whatever butter
you prefer cue a handful of spinach top
it off with some I use almond coconut
all agree after everything is blended is
then I like to go in and add my protein
because I feel like when I add my
protein after everything it just kind of
blends a little bit better and doesn't
get clumpy or stuck to the side of the
thing so I'm using what is this my vegan
smart vanilla I hated protein powder
until I discovered this so way to go via
form I'd like to add dates to this but I
ran out any correction Ryan
ate all the day
all right so I just wrapped up some of
my email and I'm going to make lunch I
think I'm going to do some shredded
Brussels and carrots in a burger patties
I pretty much put anything over Brussels
carrots and quinoa it's like a good base
for any type of Bowl that you're wanting
to make any type of like salad you want
to make so I'm going to go do this all
right so we just filmed a little bit and
now we're going to have a tea midday
snack we're going to go get some acai
bowls from India from
time for dinner
so I decided that we're going to make a
quinoa veggie Bowl like good grained
veggie Bowl so we're going to start with
our base which is going to be quinoa and
then we're going to add just kind of
stuff but what we like to do is just
like season up some vegetables and some
chickpeas and just roast them in the
oven until they're nice and crispy and
then just throw them on top of the bowl
me writing it started rock and roll so
we are going to start by preheating the
oven to 450 that's what I like to roast
my veggies on in the bowl I have chopped
up our red pepper and our broccoli just
going to
yes olive oil going for seasoning I'm
going to do some chopped garlic lemon
pepper
some regular pepper I'm going to do the
sentence regular default but we just put
it in here because it was like I don't
know it was coming out in clumps just
going to mix all of this together
usually just poured some olive oil on
the pan and I'm just going to roll
around some geneious carrots I'm just
going to excuse them these guys let's
use salt and pepper olive oil soaked
into the still meanwhile our quinoa is
still cooking alright so I just drained
our chickpeas and I'm actually going to
put them in yeah a little mixed fairly
healthy there's large amounts of vitamin
green red yellow very healthy
didn't get my quinoa makes a little bed
keel on here so this is going to be
dinner its don't you even think that
we're done because we have dessert
Katherine it looks good to me so good
alright so for dessert I'm Tuesday at
Lennie and Larry's protein cookies I'm
doing the white chocolate macadamia and
if I feel like I haven't had enough
calories here in the day or I'm just
like creaming something sweet I always
go over one of these and they actually
have 16 grams of protein per cookie so
I'm just going to eat half because I'm
so full from dinner but I like to warm
it up in the microwave and then I like
to put a little scoop up so delicious
dairy-free almond milk ice cream and I
just got vanilla because I think the
knowledge oh good with another one of my
favorites dairy-free ice cream is not a
new so delicious I think the best
flavored snickerdoodle you okay I can't
confirm I'm pretty good ah but they were
out so I got vanilla it was clean
Quintanilla was a who looks on it ready
notice it's good eye we're back
welcome welcome most of you probably
noticed throughout this video everything
was for the most part plant-based so
when I cut out meat and dairy from our
diet completely we're trying to save
that base I'd say it's probably like 90%
plant-based
yeah look for but trying to cut out
processed foods trying to skip us plan
based but going full-on plant-based is
tough I respect well that is our fully
plant-based um I just love chips so much
Q&amp;amp;A Oh Q&amp;amp;A the most like asked questions
were if we have seen is first of all why
we decided to go plan base here I can
make this simple and quick everybody
so the reason why pretty much of this
book how not to die by Michael dr.
Michael Greger or cracker one of those
creator you're interested go read that
or listen to it like I do on audible and
that's pretty much the whole reason lots
of evidence you're interested in
learning more earth you're kind of on
the fence about going plant-based and I
definitely recommend reading this book
or listening to it on audible what
advice would you give someone looking
for a healthier diet based upon your own
eating habits like if you want dessert
instead of regular hk2 dairy-free ice
cream or instead of regular ice cream
something that I've learned is mashing
up a banana and a scoop of peanut butter
or almond butter mixing it up putting it
in the freezer it's so good and it would
just the place of ice cream and it's
just peanut butter and banana you can
add agave you cannot chocolate dark
chocolate chips you can add fruit if
it's really good I'm currently trying to
go vegan and was wondering if you could
give some advice to people transitioning
eat foods that have a lot of volume to
them like lots of vegetable and broccoli
does it'll make you feel full and that
was one of them one of our first issues
when we were transitioning is we didn't
feel full yeah Galera
quinoa she had broccoli
sweet potatoes like eat stuff that'll
fill you up we ride in I kind of quit
cold-turkey
we like went just all of a sudden one
day non plant-based toothed plant-based
so if you're having trouble I heard from
people if you just go slowly like slowly
cut up meat slowly cut out dairy just
kind of wean yourself off of it I think
that also helps to is what I hear next
question do you snack and what staples
you keep on hand I am the biggest
snacker
I still eat breakfast lunch and dinner
all sometimes combined breakfast and
lunch but we snack throughout the day I
like snap peas I like lera bars if I
want something sweet what else
I love chips and guac yeah I know that
my name Larry's Barb's just berries like
blackberries blueberries strawberries
bananas lots of fruit we run some fruit
a lot yeah we doing uh almond butter
cashew butters you get gassy from all
the vegetables and how do you avoid such
problems um Ryan does all you got to do
is just take intensive enzymes and you
can minimize that I just depends I'm
sure that you help how hard is it for
you to stay away from unhealthy food and
you have it cheap if you have a cheat
day what do you eat um I really try to
stay away from processed foods it's so
hard because I love um and just love
things all right we're back we have to
do a quick batter will remain how are
you feeling on this vegan diet compared
your old diet I feel a lot better it
just takes about a month and a half
starting noticing changes I feel like I
have more energy I sleep really good
yeah we wake up super early wake up the
leg right at 6:00
naturally almost every day definitely
sweet better I never even thought of
that
but someone asked if I've ever starved
myself to lose weight well no um no I
wouldn't know how you and Ryan are
dealing with no halo top this is a
difficult topic it was really hard until
we discovered so delicious snickerdoodle
flavored ice cream and not a moo it was
a rough it was rough but now we're doing
much better thank you for asking do you
feel there's pressure to go vegan to
appease certain YouTube followers and
avoid criticism that's a good question
um no not really I I mean I don't feel
there's pressure on myself just because
I don't get pressured easily um I did a
what I eat in a day video pre
plant-based and I made chicken and
Iberian stuff uh I can't really speak
for other people who eat meat and feel
the pressure I would never
somebody's eating meat or not eating
meat she's never been the type of person
to force anything on anyone
as far as Jesus goes with you only you
meet or yeah or I don't feel like I need
to do something to to please a certain
group of people you feel about the
endless meat shaming slash vegan shaming
when youtubers post what I eat in a day
um I think that there's always going to
be people who complain about anything
whether it's what you're eating or how
you're exercising or the way your body
looks or the way your makeup is done
you're just you're never going to please
everybody and that's okay I would be
worried if I please everybody um you
know I've definitely gotten comments
vegan shaming me and I got comments when
I ate meat so I mean you can't please
everybody that's okay I think it's just
about accepting the fact that you can't
please everybody on the other hand
constructive feedback is much more than
fish of all parties like yeah if you
want to give some fact evidence-based
reasons on why you feel a certain way
provide that to somebody but don't shame
them for the way that they live their
life like I remember when I was first
starting at YouTube someone some guy
told me that my eyebrow powder was too
dark for my eyebrows and I was like
you're right it really is good I
wouldn't bought new eyebrow powder that
is constructive criticism but when
people you know criticize you for how
you eat and what you look like I feel
like that you just be in a dick having a
hard time with weight loss and stopping
the binge eating it going vegan helped
make a significant change in your body
and the way you look and feel I don't
think it changed the way I look the way
that you're going to change your body is
calories in and calories out on what you
expend so for us vegan is for longer
term just being healthy that's the way
we view it but if it's far as binging
and weight loss it's all about just
sticking to a diet and working out so
those two things mostly diet as far as
calories in and vegan as well how are
you finding adapting and what is your
family think because I know a lot of
people don't understand
the thing about my family and Ryan's
also is they are the most supportive
people we have in our lives if our
families are very open-minded and very
accepting and supportive of anything
we've ever done
my boyfriend and I just switched to a
plant-based diet what are some food
recipes you would recommend for
transitioning right now Sluman pasta are
the hardest to give up definitely try
the bean pasta that's good so then you
could go with the ancient harvest brand
like we do where it says like Wow on it
I think yeah so that but it's got a ton
of protein and there's different
variations there's stuff made from beans
a salt my base bill it's great how many
times do you eat in a day you look so
tiny yet always eat
I've run 30 miles a week I try to eat
similar to you but still have a belly
everyone's bodies are different I mean
two people could have the same guy and
look completely different I have always
been a thin person always since I was a
little girl I've always just been so
thin so are my sister so was my brother
so was my mom genetics does play a role
and he is about feeling good on the
inside and we didn't switch to
plant-based to look a certain way it was
more sober of the inside feeling a
certain way so that was the goal we were
trying to achieve eat probably either
breakfast lunch and dinner or one big
breakfast lunch combo snacks in between
so I quite a few time today do you ever
practice intermittent fasting yes every
day Ryan sauce every day this might be a
weird question but how often do you
drink alcohol oh we don't really drink
your go up we'll have a lots of wine
every now and then our goal I get a
cocktail maybe like once a month or
something but we don't really drink a
lot if somebody had a dinner we were
going out
dinner we would probably have some
cocktails but we just don't do that time
and II know Mom attract young margarine
in New York is real if you knew that you
had understand you motivate someone else
who you spend a lot of time with to eat
healthy
aka my boyfriend I really think someone
has to want that for themselves and I
tried convincing some of my closest
friends to eat eat more healthy without
badgering them and like you know being
annoying I just think you have to want
it for yourself know the benefits some
internal thing yeah not external eating
you know the way we eat is such a habit
so easy to form a habit I think yeah you
just you're consistent just licking
anything else do you have enough energy
to exercise that's what we're doing like
I said before i definitely way more
energy then before we cut out meat and
dairy like through the roof way more
energy a particular health benefit or
beauty benefits you've noticed and you
know just the difference in my hair and
my skin um overall energy levels higher
digestion
I mean notice my skin blush dry yeah I
used to have dry patches on my skin and
now um it's like almost oily it's not
oily but it's like fuel more moisture
yeah not so weird that you and I both
that's all we have for you today in our
what we ate today hope you got some good
hygiene i unban class I thought and if
you want to know about bursary shopping
just go watch the last grocery haul
easily try to UM do a little grocery
haul when we go get groceries once a
month yeah that's all we have and we
will see you guys I want to start doing
more of these because I really love food
blogs I love sharing recipes and stuff
like that because who doesn't love a
good food blog speaking
food time to eat time to eat alright
