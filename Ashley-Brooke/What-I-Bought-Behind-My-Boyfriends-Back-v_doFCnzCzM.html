good morning guys so I just woke up it
is Monday morning 7:00 a.m. slept in a
little bit today went to Ikea as you saw
him last vlog and we got a kitchen
island that we were gonna put together
ourselves and it got here yesterday
whoever put it in the truck for it to be
delivered just forgot like most of the
hardware so we have a super unfinished
kitchen island in the kitchen right now
called and we were like well how long
will it be to deliver these items and
they were like oh like five to ten days
and we were like we're just like we're
just gonna go to the storage so we're
gonna go swing by IKEA again today I
think I have some clips of house from
yesterday really blogged like bits and
pieces here and there cuz we were so
stressed out tried that thing together
so yeah I'm about to get our delivery of
our island that we're putting here from
Ikea that trash can't open again as
usual don't go there
delivery guys are here we're just
waiting for them to come in don't mind
that so it's all in here now even the
delivery guy was like have fun
assembling all this yeah but he was
being funny nice be nice this is
something that was supposed to go to
another guy not in the city as well as
that map thing so there's just a bunch
of stuff and now they're calling me so
that I can give them that back the
fronts on the drawers update coming
along
two cabinets built she's way faster than
me and I don't know what the next step
is I think that putting the panels on to
make them the darker color in the white
yeah I've been on the phone for almost
two hours
Thank You IKEA all right so we got some
island stuff done this is pretty much as
much as we can do today without having
to go to Ikea tomorrow and get the door
for this the other door for this and the
other door for this so this is kind of
how it is now but I love it I was really
concerned about the marble top because
it's pretty much the only thing they had
they didn't have anything to really
match this brown but I mean I don't mind
it it goes with the floor so I think
it's fine but we really had no other
choice
trust me I tried I did ask you guys on
the stories what you thought about me
posting to vlogs a week for assistance
one and mostly that's it what have you
said yes that that's something that you
would love come on you said knows one
like what someone who voted no associate
she sent me a message and she was like I
voted no because I don't want you to get
too tired or burn out but as long as
they're just you know they're so easy
they're just me turning the camera on
filming what's going on I mean the
biggest pain in the butt is the editing
but I can do that just like laying in
bed so just I guess the point I'm trying
to make is you guys don't ever worry
about me getting burn out or you know
exhausted or tired of something I just
like trust me I will you know take care
of myself and make sure that stuff like
that doesn't happen but it's very very
kind of you and very thoughtful to send
me a message I'm gonna go get right and
seen a little bit her second trip to
Ikea back here and I still want this
chair
I think they raised the price on me
though that was not that expensive
wherever I want it okay we are done with
our second IKEA trip for the week and we
got everything we needed it was pretty
seamless so now we can finish the
islands and Ryan and I also got a desk
for he and I for the office still need
to get Jenna one of her own we had some
other things too just like these are the
legs little thing for the kitchen so now
we're waiting on our uber to take us
back home lots of work to do today so I
will check back in with you guys in a
little bit I'm starving
forgot to eat breakfast this morning and
it's 12:30 so really hungry
I'll make some oatmeal
it's nighttime I didn't really vlog much
more today because we got home and we
ended up just putting together the IKEA
things but I'll shot you I know it's
super dark but here's what it looks like
we have a panel that goes along the back
here that just needs to be sawed down so
we're gonna wait for Ryan's dad to get
here yeah it's nice it's super helpful
right yeah it's like I know and your
sock oh my god you guys I have the
funniest story to tell you today these
two guys came to fix our dishwasher and
of course we had to put Stella in the
bedroom and lock her in there because
she kept trying to eat their tools out
of their tool bag so we locked her up
she pooped in the bedroom floor and then
Ryan I were both cleaning it I was on
the ground cleaning and Ryan was
standing up cleaning Ryan's stepped in
it and we were like ah then Brian took
his sock off and threw it behind him
really quick and it hit me in the face
he didn't know that I was sitting like
sitting down cleaning poop sock on the
face see were laughing so hard it all
happened so fast but it was like we were
dying it was a stressful day that I was
trying to put this IKEA the I so we
needed that good laugh but whoa these oh
the office Ryan and I I you can't see
there's not a light in here because New
York apartments but oh wait I think if I
open this maybe the light will turn on
there we go so I got this long desk for
Ryan and I and then I'm gonna get Jenna
her own desk we're gonna do like some
shelving units here we our office hey
what are you eating
come on we'll work we're on the office
I'm not so concerned about the office
just because I really just need a table
and chair to work at and I'm happy but I
do want to decorate it and make it super
cute and I'll probably do that within
the next few months I'm just kind of
trying to focus on like the living room
in the bedroom right now but but yeah
I'm going to in the day I'm gonna go

this inflammation and influent flame
thing on her tummy right where her
stitches were from her surgery and it
looked like it would be okay and we sent
it to the vet called her and she said oh
it's the most common thing that happens
with stitches don't worry but then in
the middle of the night we woke up and
still had been licking at it for
probably hours and it looked like there
was a fold now but it's not a hole it's
like a raised skin around it anyway
she won't stop so we had the Amazon
Prime a comb at 8 a.m.
actually we primed it at 6 a.m. and it
got here at 8 a.m. with my sweet girl my
baby okay I think I'm ready

with Stella feeling better it's healing
nicely but I'm gonna stay here with her
over the weekend I just got the call
that my coffee table is here so they're
bringing it up now I'm really excited
about it I hope it fits it's like you
just never know when you're ordering
furniture like how it's going to look so
I'm gonna miss you
miss you stinker what your cone - she
keeps like Stella walks so close behind
us and with her cone she like hits the
back of my knees and makes my knees like
buckle and I call my friends you'll see
you in four days four days I know is any
quiz to it Matt yeah we'll see
okay the coffee tables here but I'm
really nervous because it's so big are
you ready
here it is oh it's not that big I am
going to put two black chairs here so
like do kind of a facing the couch
situation and then I'm also probably
gonna do two big lamps here and then big
drapes here and then entertainment here
so I think once everything is done that
it's gonna look nice but the good thing
is is that we can return it if it
doesn't end up working but I do want to
give it a shot
to get everything else in here and then
see what I want to do with it but I like
it and it's really nice it's got this
gold underneath so I think it ties in
with the mirror really well and then
this wood matches the table I don't know
why I just needed some sort of wood and
here I just love wood furniture so much
so I think this is really like a really
pretty piece this is what we're doing
right now with the TV it's just on a
chair so it's coming together styles
coming together I'm actually gonna go
for a while in vlog time no not a lot
time in real time and a long time I'll
see you in just a second but I'm going
to film a kind of department store come
shopping with me so I'm gonna go over to
century 21 which for those of you guys
that don't know century 21 is kind of
like a TJ Maxx type store but it has
like Balenciaga and it has other
designer things as well as lower pricing
so I'm gonna see what I can find and
make a video out of I really hope that I
can find something because I'm counting
on this to be my video that goes live
tomorrow so I don't know well thank you
we'll see what we can find
so I am wearing denim vest from Zara
t-shirts vintage Levi's bdg high-waisted
skinnies moto boots and my Chanel bag
and I'm mixing my metals here but
I always like to bring my own shopping
bags we've got this back from beautycon
and then I'll grab like a grocery bag
okay I'm back home and today was a total
fail complete fail so I went to comedy
this isn't hair stuff where did I go I
went to century 21 complete madhouse
there's no way I mean I finally found
like three or four things and I went to
go into the fitting room and I
legitimately counted out 25 people in
line I was like what so I just like put
it back I'll go to the handbags like
that's where the madhouse was there was
like shoulder-to-shoulder people I was
like okay I've got to get out of here
so then I went to Zara in anthropology
nothing I was like what is going on why
is everything so crowded I'm just still
trying to get used to this neighborhood
and like I'm like what time rush-hour is
for stores and I don't know I'm gonna
just try to go tomorrow with this video
with the total fail it's just not gonna
happen
all of my other youtuber subscribers
have you ever like sat down or filmed a
video you just ended up like not working
and you're like
now what am I gonna do so then after
that I went to Whole Foods just to get
some groceries and breathe in hot air on
me I'm like dying right now
and went the Whole Foods my basket was
an asshole and it kept all the sudden it
was just like beer and like jerk to the
right I ran over this lady I was like
I'm so sorry my basket has a mind of its
own like haha I just kind of like hid
her bag I didn't even really hit her and
she was so rude she was like you need to
watch where you're going I was like um
okay let me just tell that to my basket
really quick then after that I was like
you know what this day is done I'm done
trying to film this video so look what I
got hahaha I know right I got the effing
vacuum that I've been wanting I can't
wait to play with it but I do have a few
emails to do I need to respond to like
three emails and I need to edit edit
some photos so I'm gonna do that really
quick and then we're gonna play with the
vacuum and we're gonna do a vacuum
review just make that the video yeah
just pistil promptly stop she scares me
man she just marks it nothing especially
because I'm home alone
okay so I'm gonna get some my emails and
then we will play with the vacuum
we'll see how dirty the floor and and
then we'll make dinner I got my
groceries delivered because I only have
two hands and I carried that vacuum like
seven blocks two avenues with a tree
tree tree tree okay a little bit I'm
gonna go take my clothes off and stand
in a cold shower I know
all right I just got done with my email
and I'm gonna go play with my bike
excited oh just quick FYI so for in here
I think I'm gonna get another one of
these from Ikea and put them kind of
like you know back to back so it's like
one long conference table and I think
I'm probably gonna hang like this mirror
above it with like some I don't know I
this is like where I'm going what do you
guys think like I should just get two of
these and put them back to back I think
that will just save more space maybe
kind of put it I don't know but ask for
the desk part like I think that's what
I'm gonna do okay
vacuum up I'm ready stuff that we need
to have a top do not be getting in the
way you gotta let me figure this out
okay hey do you work
these cookies by the way from juice
browse there we made out of cashews and
they're so good all right you guys know
I normally get the Capri blue volcano
handle from Anthropologie well today I
had a wild hare
I think this because of the day that I
had I was like I'm just gonna do
different things and I had the Aloha one
mr. cub oh my gosh it's so good and like
my whole apartment smells like it and
it's crazy it's really strong but I
can't put it off
look I live other guys Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
made for me hmmm eternal I like walking
with it like this scissors okay actually
I'm just
I used my 20% coupon this is like the
deluxe version I think it comes with a
bunch of like extra stuff instructions
say goes
they totally made these look like
full-size bottles on the box to get a
full-sized bottle of the deep clean
antibacterial because in New York like
just never know what you're tracking in
but this comes with two multi-surface
pet one just regular wood floor I think
it kind of look to extract when I
already go and then a little
a little oh oh didn't know how long I've
been wanting in the bathroom and Ryan's
always liked it so much money then he
leaves then I got it Stella ouch and all
that this looks like maybe it sits on
this in the closet just good okay
another wood floor Minnie because what
the full-size look looks like and the
school wasn't the thing alright I had to
move positions won't say why cuz I don't
want to embarrass anybody
actual vacuum separately heavier than I
thought I was gonna be versus looks like
what like your dirty water probably goes
in hey stop get over the instructions
and see what those where and then we'll
figure it out the instructions are
really easy their pictures and step by
steps which I appreciate her clean water
tank into the handle if the tag not in
case like it doesn't work or saline here
click I like want to use it hmm no I've
got the cleaner though Oh display
instructions no I need to know like how
to use it water is already a little
milky because of the formula so
basically I just filled the water tanks
here and then filled the restaurants
formula and it looks like you've got
hardwood and then you've got a rug so I
know one area of the rug I should go
over test area like maybe just right
here looking really good and for those
of you guys who have really dark wood
floors they get so dirty like so quick
so you can see here's the floor I just
did and then here's the dirty floor you
can see like footprints there's a little
bit of dog hair play with the floor is
this thick it just takes so long to go
through and vacuum and sweep everything
and then go through and mop and then do
the rug so this definitely like save so
much time and my last apartment which
was smaller like I didn't mind at all
but like I have probably clean the
floors like five or six times since I've
lived here and it takes so long so
awesome update so it kind of left little
like I don't know I can still see some
vacuum streaks
it almost looks kind of like a film over
it I don't know if you can tell I think
that's from me using the antibacterial
and I think when I use the wood floor
one it will probably make it a little
bit more shiny but I haven't really like
deep cleaned the floors since I've moved
in so I really feel like I needed to do
that I also bought this from
Anthropologie they had a tester and I
was like do
I'm just gonna trust that it's really
good because uh I've seen reviews for
this stuff and it's like awesome
so but I'm like not about to use the
tester at the store disgustin
so I'm done with like the front part of
the wood floors and let me just tell you
I clean my floors yesterday yesterday
not even 24 hours has gone by and this
is what what
what how how now that we already talked
about it we're not going to judge
anybody on their dirty floors I'm gonna
do this rug now and we've had this rug
for like a year and a half so you can
judge me on the rug
are you ready for the rug reveal you lay
on this rug with Stella I like play with
her this is what we can play on this
whole time
look at it I know she's like you're
gross you finished cleaning now so
here's the thing about the vacuum I
absolutely love it
the only thing that kind of annoys me is
that you can't get like probably an inch
from the baseboards and that's the part
that gets really dirty that's kind of
where all the dust settles so I really
wish that it had some sort of functions
where you could go along the baseboards
but so my groceries were supposed to be
delivered like two hours ago but the
Whole Foods guy called and said that
there is like some sort of run and then
my street was blocked off and he was
like we'll be there around 8:00 I'm
starving and it's like a 30
you've liked checking my phone I'm
literally about to make a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich you can call it a day
wait I can't cuz my bread is in the bag
enough anything it's salsa and carrots I
feel like that's a solid meal cereals in
that bag too
I'm gonna give it like 15 minutes and
then I'm just gonna post me like bye
Khloe ears
so what found some beyond me crumbles
some chickpea spaghetti noodles some
spaghetti sauce so I'm gonna have some
spaghetti and I'm gonna have a cupcake
my gosh
speaking of pasta no do you guys watch
below deck so it came on the other night
for the first like the new season
started it was probably the worst people
that I've seen the whole entire series
and I've watched like every episode one
of my biggest pet peeves is when people
are rude to their servers like waiters
we've just this whole system gets under
my skin more than anything it's like my
biggest pet peeve ever on below deck
there they work on the boat so people
charter the boat and they you know serve
them they like make their beds and they
pretty much just like wait on them hand
and foot and they the people who charter
the boat are so rude most of the time

me so mad and I was so mad last night
