got to the hotel room and then Brian was
to go meet his client for a quick
meeting and I just kind of hung out here
unpacked and then I Ryan got back so we
went to Whole Foods I was laughing
because I was like this is ours first
night in Vegas and we're at Whole Foods
but I've noticed that it's really hard
to find some no meat no dairy like
healthy foods here yeah we went and just
got some protein bars and stuff like
that to try to pull this over we can
find somewhere to eat so yeah so that's
what's going on we are about to just
change really quick and go meet his
clients for dinner but I'm so tired it's
like 12:30 a.m. in New York right now
so is way positive it yeah I had pulled
together pull it together really quick
um what day is it I didn't think before
I turn the camera just it's Tuesday so I
just posted a video that was to go live
on Sunday but Wi-Fi and stuff so Ryan is
about the head back to his tradeshow and
I'm going to go do a little shopping
it's so hot so I'm basically just like
wearing this one dress the whole week so
yeah we're gonna go by we I mean camera
and me I'm gonna go exploring do a
little window shopping I really want to
buy something like a bag like a nice bag
no Ryan come on I've been saving my
money
I never splurge on anything but I've
been saving up my money for a nice bag
but I don't know what I want and I
should do research before I out research
is also based in research
I just feel so guilty spinning so much
money on one item sure but I got mostly
to increase in value so like a Chanel
those increase in value I kind of
leg-hold I'm not carrying the Jobi stick
today I don't know where I'm going sorry
I'm not carrying the jovi stick today
oh so yesterday we had such a good time
last night we didn't bring the camera
just because like hard to carry it
around sometimes but we're going to go
eat sushi but all the places were booked
