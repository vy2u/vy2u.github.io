from the street today I'm on the go just
got done at the gym so I don't have time
to do a sit-down intro so I'm just going
to chat with you guys while I'm walking
what's the video a few days so I'm
really excited to be doing this why is
when I'm not I'm not a great school win
person it always catches me like this
like it's never like sexy ever basically
this is a video of kind of what I eat on
a regular basis I like to eat smaller
meals throughout the day rather than
eating bigger meals because I feel like
it keeps your metabolism going it fills
you up
I just feel that smaller meals
throughout the day kind of keep you
fuller and keep you going and don't make
you feel as you know when you need a
huge Amelia you kind of feel like that
if you guys ask me a question oh yeah
how do I curb like snack cravings and
junk food cravings
I just don't keep them in my apartment
it's do not buy a lot of junk food and I
know you guys see on snapchat how I get
cupcake and a cookie every now and then
it that's totally fine I think
everything in moderation but if you
really really want to be hard on
yourself and eat a good diet just don't
keep don't keep like ship food in Europe
in your apartment what is the main
negative comments that I get on my
youtube channel is oh my god she's so
skinny she doesn't he I am the way I am
I've always been a really small person
mrs. moly
and my siblings were all really small so
I can't really I can't help that you
know you don't like it it's not my
problem don't sleep over it it's not a
big deal
but anyway it's in this video you'll see
it's more like a blog style Ryan just
kind of shot me throughout the day on
Saturday kind of what I was making for
myself might let's get into the video
all right so it is Saturday morning
about 6:30 and I'm going to first get my
coffee before we make breakfast I like
to sit down for about 15 minutes and
check my emails and drink my coffee
before I start making my breakfast so
let's do that first
this morning I'm drinking iced coffee I
like to buy this chameleon brand it is
so delicious
I got the vanilla kind but they have
mocha they have regular they have so
many different kinds so I'm gonna use
this and then I'm going to use my almond
coconut blend because it's so delicious
I love this brand because you can really
really taste the coconut so this is my
jam a little bit of this or a lot of bit
whatevs and I'm going to pour coffee and
then we're going to add some ice I like
the lot
all right so it is now about 7:45 and
I'm getting hungry so I'm going to make
breakfast and usually eat an egg white
omelet with some kind of vegetable in it
and if I know I'm going to have a super
long day and I don't know if I'm gonna
have lunch or like when the next time
I'm going to eat is so yes today we're
filming and I don't know how long that's
going to take so I'm gonna add a small
cup of oatmeal just kind of some carbs
to keep me going throughout the day so I
don't get super hungry and cranky and
you know how that business goes so I'm
going to start with the oatmeal and I'm
going to add my oats first I am using
red mils old-fashioned rolled oats
there's no flavor just plain ol basic
oats and to add a little bit of
sweetness I'm going to add organic
coconut sugar um you can do stevia you
can do sugar in the raw I just really
love this stuff I'm just going to do a
little pinch okay maybe two pinches I'm
going to add my almond coconut milk
while my omelet is cooking I'm actually
just going to put this in the
refrigerator so the oats kind of soak up
the almond milk and it's not super runny
whatever it's done cooking for the
omelet I'm going to do three egg whites
oh man well you win some you lose some
that was a big one
that's a goodie I'm going to add a
little bit of pepper add some grilled
red pepper I'm going to add a little bit
of mozzarella after my oatmeal has
soaked up a lot of the milk I'm gonna
add some walnuts and I'm going to add my
fruit today I'm using peaches and
blueberries I'm going to add some
avocado to my mom list
it's one o'clock in the afternoon I've
been working all morning
pulling some outfits for to shoot
usually how my day goes is I don't eat
one like big lunch I usually eat two
smaller snacks in between breakfasts and
dinners
so my first snack is usually an SAE Bowl
so that is what we're going to make
right now the first thing that goes into
the blender are the acai packs and I
know that there are many different
brands that you can choose from but this
is my favorite I get the original blend
I've tried the unsweetened blend and
it's just not idle I hate it so I always
get the original blend and they come in
little individual paths just like this
first thing I'm going to do is kind of
break up the mix and then dump it in
there and actually buy already frozen
bananas but they're kind of expensive so
whenever I have banana that are kind of
starting to turn brown I always just
kind of chop them up and put them in a
bag so I can have them for me I'm going
to add a little bit of frozen banana a
handful of frozen strawberries
you can add any kind of frozen berry
that you want or you can even add
spinach you can add any kind of Becky
then I'm going to take my almond coconut
milk and I'm just going to pour a little
bit don't pour too much or else it'll be
super splashing the $0.01 nice and
blended out I'm just going to add a
couple of scoops of peanut butter
because it tastes amazing with peanut
butter mixed into it it just like
completely changes the whole thing if
you like peanut butter if not you can do
almond butter you can do cashew butter
whatever butter you prefer just testing
down okay don't forget to lick the spoon
I'm not scraping so I'm just going to
make kind of a bed of granola in my bowl
we mix on top I'm just going to kind of
spread it around a little bit so now for
the toppings which is kind of where you
can get creative
so I just finished a quick cardio
session and now I'm gonna have a smaller
snack in between breakfast my first
snack and dinner I'm going to make
avocado toast that is my go-to snack if
I'm creating something a little saltier
I did was I toasted my bread and I like
to get like a really grainy bread I like
all kinds of seafood stuff in it and I
had a half of an avocado in the fridge
so take the little brown but whatever if
you get a little bit of lemon juice and
put it in the avocado I'm going to do a
little salt pepper I'm just going to
mash up the avocado
no put it on top of my toe
next I'm going to take some grilled
tomatoes and I'm just going to kind of
spread these all over
and lastly I'm going to put some feta
cheese this is like total GameChanger
this stuff is awesome
so if you guys follow me on snapchat you
will know that this is one of my
favorite snaps I make this at least
three times a week chance
so it's about 6:30 I like to eat dinner
super early that way I feel more like
The Adjustment when I go to bed and for
dinner I usually have a grain bowl which
is some sort of grains you can do like
rice or quinoa and then I like to add
different veggies and maybe like a meat
and like a protein of some sort for this
green Bowl I am doing a rice at my grain
and then I'm going to do some steeped
broccoli and red peppers I'm also going
to do a little bit of turkey sausage
that I am roasting in the oven right now
and then I'm going to do some kidney
beans and some roasted tomatoes on top
of the rice
so I'm get started with the broccoli so
to roast my vegetables I'm just going to
cut them up wash them and then pour them
in I like to get like a little bit of
water to a boil
and pour them in just going to add a
little bit of minced garlic which I'm
almost out of
I'm also going to add some salt and
pepper alright so I'm going to add my
rice first and then I'm going to add
some kidney beans and then we're going
to do our grilled veggies and I'm going
to add a little bit of turkey sausage
obviously I like it
super firmed okay so enjoy alright so
after dinner we always have to have a
little something-something so we always
get this halo top and I think the best
waiver is strawberry but it was Ryan's
turn to pick tonight so you pick
chocolate it's still really good though
so it's 240 calories per pint and then
it's got 16 grams of sugar per the whole
thing so it's you know for ice creams -
my healthy so this is always our go-to
ice cream and just a quick little tip
for you if you break up a cookie put it
in the microwave and then put the ice
cream on top of it hi guys I'm I'm was
back at my apartment I really hope you
love the video and I hope you got some
food inspiration from it and

happening it's like it just shoved

kitchen then the last place I looked was

science project of bean sprouts and I

raft out and scrub this drawer it was
