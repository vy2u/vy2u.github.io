channel so this was a highly requested
video that what I eat in a day just for
you guys who don't follow me don't
subscribe
em no meat in no dairy you may notice
that I changed like three times during
this day yesterday we were out shooting
so so just in case you're like do you
why are you changing clothes so many
times throughout the day that is like a
lot of you guys always ask me how I
track my calories and all of that and
this is not sponsored by lifestyle but I
do use my life some app to count to make
sure that I'm getting enough calories
enough protein I'm not you know going
crazy on sugar so I feel like when you
are in plant-based it is so important to
keep track of your nutrition because it
is easy to lack in certain areas on the
nutrition scale being said let's go
ahead and get started into the video and
enjoy alright so I have been out
shooting today coffee from Starbucks I
normally make my own but we were just
out shooting so I grabbed this where I
make hot coffee
I put cardamom in it because it's
delicious and it has amazing help in a
bit so I always sprinkle a little bit in
here
all right so first we'll start with the
tofu scramble bowl gonna go ahead and
start with my kale so I usually have
like two or three bags of kale always in
my refrigerator
she's filleting on me and it pretty much
goes with almost every dish if you add
steamed kale or spinach
so while my tofu finishes cooking I'm
going to start making my own
so here's what we have for my tofu
scramble we have the tofu with the salsa
salt and pepper kale with garlic
potatoes thanks so many potatoes during
the week I like sweet potatoes and
regular potatoes and Ryan and I both
pretty much put potatoes in our tofu
scrambles so I like to keep them already
made because there's such a pain to chop
up everyday so I'll just make like seven
or eight diced potatoes and keep them in
the fridge and it's just so much easier
throughout the week
me again lunch I'm going to make a
protein smoothie Bowl and for those of
you who watch my blogs are probably like
oh my god I've seen you make this a
thousand times I have one of these for
breakfast when I'm just kind of running
late or just don't want to cook anything
and I'll add oats to them and it makes
it a little thicker more like breakfast
more filling
but today I'm gonna do no ups because of
the sister we're at the first blend the
first go-around I'm going to you frozen
strawberries a whole banana and I'm also
going to do almond milk and some ice
stay tuned
I'll bet this is nice and blended up I'm
going to add a chocolate vegan protein
powder a scoop of peanut butter and some
dairy free chocolate chip reasons
forget about this place I don't want to
leave here if you're just gonna say it's
time for our topic going to do coconut
flakes granola
I think the Whole Foods granola is like
the best so crunchy it has almonds in it
just everything if you are a honey
eating vegan or not everyone is
different but honey is really great over
the granola and of course you can always
add fruit you can add seeds like there's
just endless opportunities with a bowl
but today I'm just gonna do granola and
coconut flakes then wasting all this
time just be like satellite casts be
alright that is my lunch
it is really filling because I put a lot
of fruit in it and a lot of ice which
fills it up and as person if you're
doing breakfast and you do oats the oats
makes it so filling everyone's like
that's smoothie Bowl for lunch that's it
and I'm like you have no idea it's so
filling and it's pretty nutritious
depending on you know your toppings and
what you put in it you know do your
research find out what you like what you
don't like and enjoy
while I'm making dinner this is
something wrong I like to do together I
would like to make dinner together um
and by that I mean he likes to watch and
eat my snacks so a dinner staple for us
and we're making dinner is we always
have to drink something bubbly usually
kombucha so I'm drinking strawberry
serenity it's my favorite lately and we
always have to have snacks while I make
dinner
favorites is salsa and chips but I
always happen to figure today yeah these
are the best chips ever
Garden of Eden yeah I always have to put
them in a bowl otherwise I'll eat the
whole bag so we are gonna go ahead and
get started
food Oh for my stew potatoes okay
everyone needs to get out of the kitchen
so I can cook for my sweet potatoes I
like to I usually chop my own and buy my
own but for this particular recipe I
like the Cascadian farm organic because
their fire roasted and they have a
really nice taste to them so I'm going
to use these
alright dinner's ready
nice a refrigerator open come on okay
it's ready so now I'm gonna put my food
on my plate
I guess eating and we'll see you guys
later for dessert don't choose things
this video is even close to over yet
there will be dessert later on tonight
am I right or am i right thought hmm she
says yes told you I'd be back so it is
it's 8:15 and I'm having some dessert
I'm doing I'll probably just do half of
my Lenny and Larry's cookie two scoops
of my vanilla so delicious almond milk
I'm gonna do a whole one of these
because they're so filling times I'll do
a whole one
heat it up and then I'm gonna put my
scoop on because it's literally when
these are heated up they're so gooey and
they're so lush
there we go all right so that is it for
this video I really hope you liked it
and next time I think I would have film
a what I ate this week video instead of
what I eat in a day because it really is
so hard to kind of get an idea of
somebody's diet based on just one day
remember a lot the last one I did I did
a smoothie Bowl I did an SAE Bowl and
people were like you can't eat that
every day that's so much sugar and I'm
like I don't eat this every day I
literally just made this today that way
you you kind of get a better
understanding of recipes and diets and
stuff like that so let me know if you
would rather see what I ate this week
instead of what I eat in a day I'll
definitely try to get that out to you
guys next month if that's something that
you want to see about fall cooking is
probably my favorite I love soups and I
love like hot veggies and I just love
like warm things so fall it's probably
my favorite cooking season I hit the
