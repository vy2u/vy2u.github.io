Oh
I know
then we're free teenager
I love the world you love imagine how
I'm gonna feel
so we'll be neighbors
yeah
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel I hope you really enjoy it be at
first when I wore this week right now
I'm in my hotel room and my messy hotel
room actually in San Diego so that's why
this videos going out a little later I'm
on West Coast time versus East Coast and
I just woke up from a nap because of
that reason I'm like my brain is on East
Coast time so I really hope you like the
way this with films again I just think
that this verse is the hottest all
you're going to get so much more out of
this type of video I feel like it really
gives you that extra bit of inspiration
for the week to really like and not got
your outfit so I hope you enjoyed it
outfit number one I do not have any of
that stuff here with me because it was
filmed in New York and I'm in San Diego
right now but basically it was a really
sunny day but it was still really cold
so I wanted to wear lighter colors like
Roth light wash denim and black which is
playing my my excuse favorite combos I
love adding a dark and a light then I
added a vest over it for an extra
layering piece and I thought the balloon
sleeves looks really nice
peeking out of the vest and then I did
my big coat over a hair up in a bun it
was a really casual day of furniture
shopping at West Elm so I wanted to be
comfortable you know but still kind of
look semi cute so that's why I went for
that outfit on to my San Diego outfit he
first landed and we kind of went walking
a long kind of back here by our hotel
room there's like a lot of boats and
water so I wanted to become turbo we
were walking but we're about to go to
dinner so I also wanted to look a little
bit put together for this jumpsuit from
Free People
wait this rust color I'm sure you guys
already sold this in my last haul I
wanted it to be super casual so I just
put a t-shirt with it because I feel
like San Diego is a really casual city
but I wanted to dress it up a little bit
so I did add a wooden heel which I
thought was like the perfect touch to
dress it up for like you know an ABS or
patio dinner I second outfit we were
going kind of exploring downtown so I
wanted to be super comfortable so I
actually started my outfit with my
bomber jacket this one from H&amp;amp;M I love
all the Tigers this was all for my last
haul you guys love this so I was really
happy because I brought it with me and
was able to style it for that day but
yeah again super casual I did jeans and
this bomber and then a white t-shirt
under it same t-shirt is the day before
I'm like reusing all my clothes and then
because I wanted to be super comfy I did
this flats estriol from FEMA and these
are really comfortable here up to me a
little bit back here but um I stopped it
right ada got some band-aids all set so
my last outfit we were going to a nice
table dinner with some friends so I did
I black down on my black buoys because
it still gets pretty cold at night here
so I wanted to do like a closed toe and
a full bottom denim so I did this top
from Zara then I showed you guys in my
last haul and where's my bag because I
wanted to mix my prints I did my stripes
purse with it so you know you've got the
bird print make some stripes and I
thought it was really nice it's a great
way to spice up your outfit when you're
doing like an all black and white outfit
just try to mix up some prints if you're
not going to add a color I always find
that helpful you know sometimes when I'm
doing a basic outfit I get a little
bored and I'm like oh it needs something
so I added my black and white printed
bag which has been such a lifesaver at
the past few days when it comes to
adding a print to something so yeah that
is it for this video and I really hope
you guys liked it I hope you like the
way that it was laid out obviously we
got some new gear so it looks a little
smoother a little bit easier on the eye
rather than you know bumpy all over the
place so I really hope you like that as
well but let me know how you liked it
