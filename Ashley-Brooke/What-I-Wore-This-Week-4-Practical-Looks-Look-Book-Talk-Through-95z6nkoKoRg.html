today it's gonna be a little bit
differently I know I normally do a how
to style a certain piece or how to style
a certain theme like date night or
brunch or something like that and why is
it brunch like I've literally never done
and this week I just decided to take you
guys along with me through the week and
just show you the outfits that I put
together that I personally wear
throughout the day while I'm working
here at home I try to keep my style when
I'm working from home comfortable but
still stylish at the same time you know
I do believe that when you work from
home getting ready everyday it really
helps you be more productive at least
that's the case for myself so these are
some things that I like to wear here at
home well I'm working and of course I
like to hop down and you know shoot an
Instagram photo and kind of show you
guys what I'm wearing that way as well
so if I'm wearing sweatpants that
doesn't quite work out you know there
are some days that I do want to wear my
sweatpants all day but it just comes
down to self discipline and keeping in
your routine of all week at the end of
the video stay tuned if you would like
I'm gonna kind of show you guys what I
chose where it's from what size I got
kind of a nitty gritty or if you're just
here for the info then the lookbook will
probably do it for you but if not stay
tuned for this color this like the worst
color to wear on camera it's like the
same color as my skin anyways so I'm
gonna stop talking and we're gonna get
into look now Isildur been crushing this
into town I'm searching through the lost
stem
but you don't care you're on the web
keep moving like the scores aren't even
there it's in the air like a blazing
flare
I gave you everything house you cross by
the stormy sea so you meant the world to
me
for me
my darling dear you never here with
mommy pin hide and disappear like
shadows in then I miss fear charting you
started I prayed for you and catch you
need and hopes you chase away my fears
I'm on my own you need it so No
thank you when you love let me helpful
us because I believe the home
all right now the lookbook is over I
hope you liked it
those are just kind of the four outfits
that I wore this week the fifth one I
don't know we just didn't film he was
raining that day go ahead and walk you
through what I chose and why I dropped
this leopard dress this is from Topshop
and I've been wanting to wear this I got
this a while ago I know some of you guys
called it out on Instagram I showed it
in a hall a while ago I thought it sized
us for really love this I just love
Leopard any time of year and I think
this satiny material is great for spring
and summer because Leopard can be a
little geared towards fall but I'm
bringing it out of the spring and
probably in the summer so stay tuned it
was pretty cold that day so I did layer
this shirt from Zara underneath it it's
just kind of a billowy sleeve just cream
top I mean you could do black although
black is definitely geared towards fall
I would stick with more of a white or a
cream in this top I got a size small and
this one is fairly old I think they
might have it online still so I'll do my
best to find it I know I've showed it in
tons of other videos and linked it so
maybe I can retrace my steps and try to
find it again it was too late so I just
a basic black booty this outfit doesn't
need a whole lot of shoe going on so
just something basic will do I did some
light wash denim and then this billowy
sleeve top from Zara this is old and the
denim is old too although you might be
able to find it on Nordstrom I know it
was like heavily marked down last time I
checked but this is a small and I don't
know I just wanted something really
light and simple because I did have a
shoe one right here that I really want
it to be the focal point of the outfit
it is a snake print pointy toed mule so
I thought this is nice and I really like
to have at least one item standing out I
do like in all basics out
but for this case I wanted my shoe to be
my standout piece so I tried to tone
everything else down this is the basic
white top but it has cool elements to it
like the sleeve is very different it's
not just your plain
you know white long-sleeve shirts why'd
you try to mix it up in that way as well
this outfit is pretty casual it's kind
of boho it was very hot in this day so I
knew for sure that I wanted to wear this
top and I bought this topic Zara and
it's been really difficult to style
because it is so billowy so I can't
fully tuck it in because there's just
too much material and I can't front tuck
it because the back is too short so I'm
like okay skirt is my only option with
something layered over it so you can't
see how funny-looking it is in the back
so I decided to go with this floral
skirt from H&amp;amp;M and in this skirt I got a
two and this top I got a small and this
too I mean I could have definitely gone
with the four so just keep that in mind
if you decide to go for this I thought
that the textures the different texture
with the print was really interesting
and fun kind of a fun little outfit and
then I layered my go-to vest over it I
remember when I bought this vest I was
like I'm never excuse you Stella
forever going to wear this and I was
literally I wear it like twice a week
but this is a nice color combo with like
a hint of denim to it and the denim
covered up like I said the weird short
part in the back my next outfit I wanted
to do something kind of girly but still
kind of darker colors so I went with
this top from Zara and I just love the
colors on it it's got blue and burgundy
and I actually think oh no no yellow
I mean that uh I was gonna say hello but
I just love this leaves the sleeves are
such a statement on this top and it's
one of those strapless tops that don't
slide down as you wear it which is nice
so you're not like exposed to everyone
up really nicely it's not too tight you
don't tell you what size by gardeners
hmm I got an extra small in this top
before this with my high waisted who
makes those jeans I believe they're
girlfriend
denim from a revolve and I did have on a
pair of white wash but it just didn't
look right I wanted to go for more of a
darker look but still keep up spring
element with this top so I did do more
of a muted black it's almost like a
matte black a dark charcoal keep things
light I did these shoes by Steven by
Steve Madden this is one of my newest
pair and I love them they are so
comfortable and the color is perfect
there are this like true beige ivory
colors and I know what my sisters are
gonna say they're gonna be text me as
soon as they watch this video if you
like those are old-lady shoes but know
what I love my old lady's shoes these
are actually great for outfits that you
don't really know what shoes to wear I
could have done a pair of black shoes
with this but then I just kind of feel
like my outfit would have been too dark
and a little too heavy for spring so
these are great during those times that
you're just like I need a light color
shoe but I don't white these are awesome
I'm going to wrap this video up and
again let me know if you guys like this
style video if you want to see kind of
what I'm wearing throughout the week I
know we tried this series a while ago
and it just didn't take off like you
guys weren't loving it so we went back
to the how to style series but if you
want I can definitely mix these in
sometimes it's like you know my style is
so different every day that I feel like
one gets a little piece like my edgy
girls get a little piece or girly or
kind of more of a classic look so I kind
of feel like everyone went with this
series I'm not like fully bringing this
back I'm just kind of leaving it up to
you guys if this is something you'd want
to see like once a month on a Sunday to
kind of follow my outfits around during
the week or if you would like to see
this exact style of video but like also
I can film when I'm picking this out so
you kind of get an idea of like getting
ready with me everyday and then going
out wearing the outfit so you guys let
me know what you want to see I'm always
down for new ideas don't forget the car
mags sunglasses are now available and we
are almost completely sold through I
know some of the colors or like down to
the last few so I will put the link in
the description box you can get them now
I don't know if we're gonna be
restocking so if you're thinking about
it definitely take the plunge because I
don't know if there will be a restock of
this size I do think we're gonna come
out with more because everyone's loving
the car mines so yeah I'll keep you
updated with that so stay tuned probably
in the vlogs
I'll keep you more updated with that but
I will see you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
