debating if I should go turn it off no
I'll keep this quick I'm putting my
makeup on and then I forgot that we had
to pull outfit first oh and like halfway
done with my makeup for today's outfit
I'm pretty much gonna be home for most
of the day we need to be super dressed
up I'm not really going to any meeting
so I'm going to be comfortable and
casual they pull this skirt which I
haven't worn yet I just got in a couple
of weeks ago from H&amp;amp;M but it's $49 and I
got a size two it's this really pretty
cream-colored midi skirt and it's like
double layered I don't know I just love
it I think it's just a really good basic
skirt I want to pair this with black I
really I'm just like deciding this
because I'm holding it up with this top
and I really like it
either going to do this is just kind of
like a sports bra but I'll either do
like a cropped top kind of like this
because the skirt is high-waisted Ben
thinks something like this would be cute
because it is kind of chilly outside and
it's supposed to be kind of rainy I
think a little later today play with
those two options will play with kind of
something like this and then layer this
over and see what it looks like shoes I
don't want to do booties because then
that might make it a little too fall if
I decide to do the long sleeve these are
from Anthropologie and these are by
Betty Mueller a size 7 so these front a
little bit cute they come with a little
scarf tied to them but I think this
really brings out the colors in the
skirt like right there like choking on
my own spit right now so this is what I
decided on I decided against the fishnet
oh my Maris sorry I decided against the
fishnet because I double checked the
weather and it's actually gonna be
really nice today just a little chilly
so I am wearing the same skirt this just
like basic crop layered some cold
necklaces still cut my scarf shoes on
and I'll probably take the bomber off
when I'm inside working but if I do head
outside to like coffee or whatever then
I will just leave it on but I think it's
just kind of a cool element to add to
like two basic pieces but for indoors
we've described two basics
super comfy already made herself
comfortable on my jacket
hey girl that's mine so this is the look
hi what's the thing about today
outfit-wise I just want to be pretty
comfortable I just have a few errands to
run this morning I have a really big
video shoot tomorrow so let me go get
some flowers today because we're gonna
be shooting inside and I like flowers
and I have a botany flower since I've
lived since I moved into this apartment
because I haven't gotten outfit-wise
um I don't know I have a top in mind
that I'll show you I over line my lips
today you know that rarely happens
and when it does there's really like
nothing you can do to do like a quick
fix and yeah overlined my lips so I'm
just gonna have to like walk through the
day with just like Angelina Jolie lips
on going on you see right here you see
that just like an over line and then and
then I tried to fix it and I like when I
over lined it more so I was like just
stop just stop I was thinking for the
top today Oh happen it's one from H&amp;amp;M I
just got it um about a month ago and I
haven't worn it yet but it's like this
one shoulder really flowy top and I want
to wear it before it gets super hot
outside II was just like some basic
denim um oh and the bag I wanted to
carry I definitely want to carry this
bag to make it really fun beaded bag
from Zara and this H&amp;amp;M top I got a size
too really oversized really familiy for
shoes hold please with thinking to go
with the bag either this blush color
from Kenneth Cole and
that's not gonna work when my Steven by
Steve button I think this is what we're
gonna do just kind of a good neutral you
don't want to overpower the back this is
what I decided to go with look how dirty
my mirror is I ended up going with this
bag instead of the colorful one and I
just thought it looked nicer and I
really liked the pop of black stripe
down it and then also the wooden handles
I like to just went with to longer
necklaces this one's vintage this one is
from I think Urban Outfitters yeah this
is what we're doing I'm gonna go run my
errands
Cisco hi guys sorry for the mess there's
like this isn't even close to the best
messes down here it's like the clean
clothes
bandit um I just woke up it's super
early dawn my PJs on I found what to
wear today today it's gonna be one of
the first days that is like 90 degrees
so I'm probably end up wearing just like
a dress because I do need to go out and
just run a few errands so I'm gonna be
out and I want to be not sweating my
butt off your dress today
I'm just feeling that because I kind of
she's like I want to be comfortable at
this one and I've only worn this twice
once in Mexico and once in Texas I've
got like these little shoes actually
these might be a little too yellow for
the stress dress you have these in black
as well so I might try that I used to
sing my feet and like my legs because
you know it's like Benji season and now
we're short dresses and I'm like oh hey
there you are legs so I'm gonna work our
way into the open toe sandal for summer
but I'm gonna go ahead and addressed
didn't come up with it did end up
sticking with this dress just because
it's super comfortable and I love the
colors in it
I added my leopard bag to just do kind
of like a mixing print I'm about to head
out and run some errands and I'm gonna
come back and get my work done
sandals let me see what size did
identities these are six and a half and
they fit me perfectly and I normally
wear a six just FYI if you guys are
going to grab them eat are really wide
so whenever it's like slip-on shoes like
this any type of mule I always go a half
size up with the six and a half and it
always ends up working just because I do
have a wide foot but if you have a
narrow foot then you could probably
stick to your true size so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
