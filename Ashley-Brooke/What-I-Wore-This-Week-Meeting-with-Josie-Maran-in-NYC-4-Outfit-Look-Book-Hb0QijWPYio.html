this is gonna be a little bit of a
different setup than you guys are used
to so I got some really good feedback
last week on the what I wore this week
because you guys like seeing different
outfits not just one theme though what I
did this week was same as last week but
instead of like a formal talk through I
kind of talked you through on the day
that I was taking out my outfit letting
you know what I'm wearing where I'm
going what size I got where everything's
from I just feel like it's a little bit
more organic and raw and just kind of
like taking you with me while I'm
getting ready really hope that you guys
like this style of video do let me know
in the comments if you don't also let me
know in the comments this is my last
outfit I just thought I would pop in and
say what's up and just kind of let you
know what I'm doing this week alright so
today for the most part it's pretty warm
I have a few errands to run but for the
most part I'm going to be here at home
but since I am going out and running
errands are probably going to do some
sort of denim but I don't know let's
look and see what stands out to me more
if it's a top or denim or a dress
alright so I think I'm gonna go with
this top from River Island it is a size
six I think that's a UK size it's a
little Halloween orange on camera but
it's like a true almost like a red
orange in person but I haven't worn this
top yet so I'm really excited about it
get into this and just to stay away from
any fall color stories I'm probably
gonna do a white denim so let's pull
that really quick cut a denim I'm gonna
go with my girlfriend high-rise straight
leg jeans and these desperately needs to
be iron so we're gonna do that first
hate tight white denim so you will not
ever see me in skintight white denim if
I'm gonna do white Dom it's gonna be
either shorts or a straight leg mom
style Jean no I might do a print I'm
thinking
this is really pretty although this is a
little fall I'm just trying to stay away
from anything fall with this top because
of the color and this is like a pony
hair texture so I'm probably gonna stay
away from that could work actually I
think that might be nice with a black
bag so we'll of it let's dive from Steve
Madden these taupe beige color that
might be pretty it's still in like
loving these shoes because they are you
know they go well with white they don't
try to compete for that light color so
this is the final look we've got I did
go at the top has a really long time so
I actually just double wrapped it and
did a short tired it but it still has
these creases in it I don't know then I
did my white denim like I said and I
actually went with these shoes just
because I thought it was kind of the
perfect little nude touch with the black
toe and then I did my black bag this one
was from one of my finds from TJ Maxx
last year I went with my Vanessa Mooney
and knocker earrings and I love these
haven't worn them in a while I actually
just found my jewelry in a box and then
I went with a nude lip just because I
didn't want something with too much
color to compete with this top we're
gonna go outside get some clips some
shots of this outfit before I run my
errands but yep today I'm kind of mad at
myself because I was gonna piss tanner
on last night but I thought it was gonna
be cold today and so I was like oh
whatever I'll probably wear a sweater no
it's so hot and it's humid like which is
even worse so today I want to be super
comfortable because I'm going to be for
the most part at home working I don't
really have anything to do outside so I
wanted to be like stretchy waistband we
are going to look and see what we can
find
oh my I miss pile of clothes on my
windowsill I'm trying to push it out of
the way so you guys can't see but I'm
just gonna own up to it and
it's right here so I think I'm gonna go
with these wide leg pants they're kind
of cropped from River Island
I like black beige white this will be
really nice and comfortable for just
working from home I think I'm just gonna
do this little Free People cropped top I
think this is just really comfortable
and great for just kind of working from
home so this is what we're gonna do
it's just something simple like this
these are from forever 21 and they're
just good little black slip yeah it's
bra top I got an extra small/small these
pants from River Island I got a size I
guess this is a UK six the final look I
actually decided to add a hat although I
don't know if I'm gonna keep it on I'm
trying to decide um yeah but it's just
super comfy sorry I'm washing my sheets
right now added in my little gold Chanel
because I feel like it's just small and
easy to carry around and I really like
the gold chain on this it kind of brings
out the beige color and the pants and
then I did my necklace from Topshop my
coin necklace and I did do a darker
lipstick just because it has kind of
gloomy outside so I just thought it kind
of matched mood today is official move
out of my apartment day so I'm gonna be
pretty much for the most part wearing
like comfy clothes like this but I do
have a meeting with Josie Maran not
josie maran team but Josie Maran I'm so
excited so I do need to dress
accordingly for that and then probably
just like change into this when I'm
moving out of the apartment but I'm
thinking I definitely want to do a dress
and a boot situation because it is
supposed to rain later today I don't
know how long I'm going to be out for I
kind of have in mind already a dress
I want to wear so I will show you guys
that option and then a couple of shoe
options that we're gonna do for the
dress option I was thinking this dress
from who what where Target and it comes
with a sash but I think I'm going to
belt it with an actual belt just because
I want to look a little bit and just I
need an accessory right here so we're
gonna do this my shoe option I want to
do a boot
so it's either between this one right
here or this one here and this has gold
hardware this has silver so I'm probably
gonna end up doing the gold just because
this has more gold tones in it than it
does cooler tones I'm running not
running late but I am running on time so
stay that way I'm gonna go get ready I
need to put makeup on really quickly and
then I'll show you guys what I decided
on all right I'm gonna try to film in
this mirror because there's a lot going
on in the living room mirror right now
but I think this outfit turned out nice
so I have an extra small no no that's
nice yeah so I have an extra small in
this dress and it fits really well in
the armpit obviously this is very flowy
this part is because it comes with a
sash so if you have like a bigger chest
maybe do your size depending on your
bust size everywhere else is pretty
flowy and pretty you know loose then I
did my Vanessa Mooney knocker earrings I
think I've been wearing these a lot this
week so but I don't know I'm just like
when I find something that I really like
love again I would stick with it for the
week I've got on my Michael Kors belt
gosh it had this thing for ever my Nine
West boots hey girl my black and gold
Chanel a great workout fit for you guys
who you know have like a pretty casual
office environment maybe you know swap
the shoes for a pair of heels but I
think this is a great work dress and who
what where just in general
has affordable work pieces that I think
just kind of go with most office
environments so this might be a good
option but I'm heading to my meeting now
so wish me luck all right so it is the
same day just later tonight and I'm
looking for a dress to wear to dinner
because I think I told you earlier that
Ryan's parents are here so we're gonna
go across the street and we're gonna go
to dinner and the first thing I grabbed
was this dress just because I think it's
super comfortable I'm starving so I know
I'm gonna eat a ton so I definitely be
comfortable no jeans no waistband so I
think I'm gonna go with this guy from
Zara the size I still the tag on because
I just got it this is a size a small
this was $45 and I want to do that's not
your shoe no block heel sandal I think
that the caged front will be cool with
the dress because of the different
bigger stripes show you guys after I get
dressed so I don't think I could have
gone in a more different direction with
my outfit so I decided I want to be a
little bit more casual and relaxed
because everyone else is kind of like
super casual I'm just gonna show you my
outfit here because there's peaking here
as construction going on in my living
room but I am doing this sparkly not
sparkly
just kind of like woven metallic dress
it's like pink and black and metallic
silver stripe my hair kind of slicked
back in a bun because there's like a lot
going on and it's a dress I'm doing my
faux leather jacket over my shoulders
and my booth we comfortable casual and
there's nothing too crazy we're
literally just walking right across
walking right across the street I
thought my lipstick and all my makeup on
before but I'm just gonna leave it
because we're we're in the process of
like doing furniture and like hanging
stuff so we're going to dinner coming
back putting ourself pants on and
getting back to work
I'm not worried about it yeah this is it
I mean in the comments what you guys
thought of this style of video that
really is kind of more of like a vlog
real-time type quickly get ready with me
so let me know if you're into it and
we'll keep doing it I'm gonna go to
dinner now and wrap this video up but I
will see you guys in the next vlog bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
