Paris Hilton sounds cool
Brian all right here's some leftover
taco salad I've got a bed of lettuce
avocado black beans a little chips some
salsa under there
a beast burger Chipotle mango dressing
and probably yeah
already like Wow sorry
do you want a nice yeah yeah okay
all right so we just had a quick dinner
basically leftovers from last night they
have to room for dessert because this is
probably one of the yummiest
partnerships I've ever done and I'm
really excited about it daily harvest
I'm so excited I know a lot of you guys
have heard of this its first if you
follow my channel and you're a smoothie
person like me you've heard of daily
harvest so in the harvest actually sends
smoothies vegan Sundays soups all packed
with superfoods and really good stuff
straight to your door frozen and let's
see the one I'm gonna make has spinach
banana cacao nib raw cashew water
peppermint chlorella vanilla bean so I'm
gonna open this one up really quick I
know that each cup comes ready to heat
or blend in 30 seconds so that's awesome
it's so good because you know when
you're in the mood for a smoothie but
you don't have like everything you need
and that happens to me all the time my
fridge is only so big I can't fit all my
smoothie ingredients in so it's nice to
store these in my freezer all the
ingredients are in there
so you can I can use water or almond
milk I obviously always use almond milk
because I like it a little creamier
rather than liquid so amazing for all of
their smoothies are frozen at their
freshest point which helps basically
trap all of the nutrition value which
all of us smoothies super food fans
probably already know that by now but
those of you who don't know that
so I can decide if I wanted a smoothie
bowl with like granola and fruit or if I
wanted a smoothie so I'm doing this
movie and you know what this tastes like
Ben and Jerry's mint chocolate oh my god
and that was my favorite because I know
that's your favorite
