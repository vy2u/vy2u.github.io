it's like the best thing ever but it's
350 dollars so next hi guys
so Ryan's parents left the other day but
it's fine because we're gonna be seeing
them when we go home for Thanksgiving
wanted to show you guys what I got in
Chinatown
while they were here because I know I
told you that I would I feel like a lot
of the time when people think China
talent they think of like fake watches
fake bags but they really do have some
cool jewelry kiosks and accessories and
that type of thing so I always find like
my little rings and my little bracelets
from Chinatown so you guys know that I'm
obsessed with little pom poms and puff
balls for my bags so I got this colorful
one I love it so soft so it's not real
fur but I think they're cool for like
keychains and just to kind of hang on
your bag if you need some sort of color
so I got this one it's got a black and
blue one I love this one because I love
Navy and blue together she was asking 15
dollars but I said no I'm not paying $15
okay of you six and then we ended up
agreeing on eight and then since I got
two she gave me the second one first day
so I was definitely wheeling and dealing
there this is the bag that I got it's so
cute and florally I think it's just
really pretty with like an all-black
outfit to add just a little bit of color
and a little bit of prints and who knew
it came from Chinatown I didn't have a
weird smell so that's a plus even have
little feet on the bottom the zipper
works good 20 bucks not a bad deal right
with oh it came with a little dress back
yeah lots of room it's fully lined and I
just thought it was so cute
and I got this little ring I am obsessed
with it because I always have my nails
like Navy or black and I think this ring
is actually Navy but it's just a gold I
thought it was vintage looking so I'm
usually not a big ring person but I
thought this was really cool Julie it's
like a stretchy
banned so that's kind of cool so yeah
this was $10 I talked her down to five
wheelin and dealin meet a Chinatown next
time you cook I'm gonna wrap up this
vlog and start filming for the next vlog
my grandparents are coming into town at
the end of the speaking you guys are
gonna love them they're the best I swear
if my grandmother and I weren't related
we would be best friends in real life so
you are going to be obsessed with her
