I am now you want to fly the drone off
about me I mean if you want I don't

happen we just crashed the drum oh it
hit the side of the building and then
fell all the way down it's hard rain you
see it he's not answering I see John now
keeps my answer I didn't even grab his
phone yeah I've never seen Ryan panic
like that in my whole life yeah his face
he just like mapped into the side of the
building and just fell all the way down
I don't know what just happened yeah
we're ready
poor poor friend
you know flat mo camera stayed intact
which is great news yeah I was very
impressed like everything else is fine
it was still on when I found it
30 stories below us and also I usually
take this bow off of usually a bubble
that protects the camera usually take
that off but I left it on this time and
thank goodness because you could say
fizzling bubbles gone up in fun oh you
didn't get to bubble back to potable oh
yeah now I have to submit a whole bunch
of documents and stuff to DJ DJ I to get
the warranty kicked in I mean always
picture for warranty especially on stuff
like this with a likelihood of crushing
hashtag Ryan tip I was getting some
Instagram messages people were wanting
to know about the conference you are at
in Austin I need to know what kind of
conference it was why we were there okay
this was called EECOM mess no the
conference was called econ Allstars
yeah I my friend Ezra Firestone and it
was a gathering of I think like 300
people that have e-commerce businesses
where they sell things on the Internet
skin care just from skin care to random
things you can think of one of the
speakers there was the owner of a brand
called wanderer bracelets which is a
really really cool brand she follows
next to Graham you get to see all the
cool stuff that they do and he talked
about how they he grew that brand and
built it if you guys are starting your
own business or even just thinking about
starting your own business I really
recommend going to conferences like this
because you pay a thousand dollars for a
ticket and you really get your money
back I mean if you apply the advice that
these speakers are giving you and you
really take it on you will see like oh
in your investment yes the best
investment that you can possibly make is
in yourself and in your education on how
to build something that you want to see
come to fruition yeah another friend of
mine Brian Moran if you guys don't
listen to Ryan's podcast definitely
recommend it it's called the freedom
fascinating podcast well link it below
over again and he also the owner of
capitalism comm where he does really
cool stuff there but he he teaches
people how to sell products on Amazon
and he's just he's a brilliant guys
created over a hundred millionaires for
people that have gone from 0 to a
million dollars selling things on Amazon
so it's very very smart yeah and one
firmness yeah listen his podcast has
great information
and then the guy who runs it esra he
owned the company called boom by Sidney
Joseph which is a Pro aging skin care
company where it's focused on women who
are 40 and up and it's an awesome
company they do extremely well he
teaches all about their marketing and
what they do to promote their products
and all that kind of stuff and if you
wanna know more about him his website is
smart marketers comma looked up low - so
that's the point we're trying to make is
like you know it's so hard to fork over
a thousand dollars when you're not
getting something like right now like
right away and I didn't understand it
either you know for my birthday one year
you know instead of getting me material
like a bag or something Ryan got me a
ticket to a really nice conference with
just I mean there were thousands of
people there some of the best speakers
in the world and it was honestly the
best gift that he could have given me
because it really I mean it just
inspires you and it motivate views and
the best investment is something you
know you can invest in for your future
and like I said I know it's hard when
you're not spending a thousand dollars
and getting a bag or something like that
but I mean it really is the best thing
that you could do for yourself if you're
trying to start a business just you have
to invest in yourself hands down so that
is what we spend
the majority of our money on yeah
definitely education and learning things
sorry if this was a little chatty little
chatty section of the vlog but a lot of
you were asking I'm starting to learn
that a lot of my subscribers are
bloggers and business owners which i
think is like the coolest thing ever a
big portion of the life by her Facebook
group yeah girls who are building
something you'll know I'm saying that is
cherishing one of our girls has an
amazing gym and it's her butt brands
called in their echo in her echo shout
out Tara and she does an awesome work
and other girls in the group have bought
her products and she there's raving fans
but there's even girls that aren't
running their own businesses who like
Ian yeah
Hume works for Facebook Ian risked her
Facebook and she loves reading these
self-help books and just things to
really motivate her so it's not just
about if you want to start your own
business or be an entrepreneur it's just
about being the best that you can be and
just working hard and really investing
in yourself and believing in yourself
though - am i keeping the camera still
so sorry it's also been a little bit
like this good I think we're going to
sign off it's getting um I know it
doesn't look like it outside but it's
