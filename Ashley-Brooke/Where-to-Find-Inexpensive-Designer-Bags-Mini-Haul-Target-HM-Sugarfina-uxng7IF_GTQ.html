powdery so Bryan and I are headed to
target one opens up in Tribeca and we

Horton ago zoo it is the highest like 61

just wearing this my good old faithful
bomber jacket from H&amp;amp;M and black skinny
finishing up getting ready we're going
to make some coffees to go and then head
out
thank you very much
tell me your thoughts on with Barry
bench
I mean I'd love it
where can we cut it so the window hey
that's not a bad idea actually I don't
have that ideas
I really love that though so pretty
goes on the Mentalist alright we're
moving to a real basket-weave nothing
are you having a good time
on what's a fine hey hey what did you
say what a fit biggest show ever
I want to start buying stuff first you
turn and you're just assuming we're
gonna have a dollar
all right just wrapped up at Target and
for if I accidentally threw a riot alone
sample we just stumbled upon a dislike
indoor underground
downtown and it is actually like a very
cool they're actually just looking for
Sephora and that's how we stumbled upon
this place I'm liking it and it's your
makeup store man
discography now should we go in to get
some candy
still no Sephora people where are we I
finally stopped NASA someone and we were
in the total wrong direction we are
leaving
stem down or when you look at this you
hello there what's up guys you just
filmed my morning routine actually I'm
in the process of filming my morning
routine just thought I'd stop in and say
what's up but I am making some o some
hurry up toast oh man it's a little burn
not fine and because I am in a hurry
well hurry up toast means you just eat
it from a napkin no fussing of plates
cause I got to get to the office so I
can finish up shooting editing get this
video posted today I'm all of the above
but I'm going to eat my toast and then
I'm going to show you guys what I got
yesterday I'm Ryan and I kind of went
out blogged and did a few errands so
I'll show you what we got man I like
burn it a little more than I wanted to
yeah I got yesterday from Target a new
folder for my veggies and like my fruit
and stuff and I got some new plants I
got this one and this one from Target I
already had this one then I got
sprinkles we already ate one yesterday
are we eating those other ones tonight
closet slash today then I got the
smaller version of the big one that's in
the kitchen can totally see we camera
and what else would I get oh I got these
dismiss away like unimportant but I
guess YouTube coconut waters target
because they're a dollar a target looks
like why are they so inexpensive so I
just grew up - just because then what
else did I get from Target I just have
some undies because they're always like
five for 25 and they're really
comfortable and then I got a pair in
these like little sweet shorts they're
so comfortable to sleep in I love the
different target I got a new notebook
for the new year I fill these up pretty
fast so I went ahead and got like a full
sized one
I'll of this one it is almost like a
black was kind of a sheen over it kind
of a shiny sheen over it and then it has
gold edge paper and then a cute gold
bookmark castle then I went to sugarfina
and I got the well these are Ryan's
actually a single Mott scotch top of all
mult single malt scotch and these
actually do have alcohol in them a full
shot of scotch in them so have fun and
then I got the peanut butter malt balls
I love youth and then I got the long
stems Rose dummies usually get from
sugarfina de Champagne bears and their
flavors they don't have alcohol in them
but their flavor it's a taste like
champagne but I honestly got so
pressured and I could not decide which
ones I wanted so I just walked away it
got to the point where I just needed to
step away from the champagne bears then
from H&amp;amp;M I got one sale price item in
one full price item this is equal price
item I got it is just a how the colors
were so cool black in like pretty
lavender color and olives just thought
it was an interesting color combination
oh I grabbed this just for kind of
layering and when I want to wear like
high-waisted jeans now this was cool and
then I got this blazer that was on sale
for $15 it is a brown and maybe stripes
like oversized the Blazer all they had
was a size 6
no this is an 8 but it kind of fits nice
it's like an oversized kind of look so
you can kind of see what it looks like I
mean it just looks oversized it doesn't
look like it's you know too big and then
I went to century 21 which is kind of
like a markdown department store like a
TJ Mac but it's got everything from like
Steve Madden to Balenciaga and Valentino
and Louis Vuitton so it's like a huge
department store downtown if you guys
are ever in New York definitely go to
century 21
I am sounds really cool white bag for
the summertime and spring and this is
what it looks like I don't really like
the strap I think the strap kind of
makes it look like this part looks cool
it's almost like Proenza ish but I think
the strap kind of cheapens it so I'm
going to look forward to basic silver
like one of those skinny silver chain
candles so I can attach it onto here but
I got this for eight dollars and forty
eight cents so this was quite a bargain
that's pretty excited about it it's not
in great shape but I can clean it up
make it look nice oh yeah I think that
is all I got yesterday I just got kind
of a random little oh I got a pillow
pillow for my bed gold and I asked you
guys on snapchat if I should get it and
you all set yes so I got it

attention alright I'm going to finish
