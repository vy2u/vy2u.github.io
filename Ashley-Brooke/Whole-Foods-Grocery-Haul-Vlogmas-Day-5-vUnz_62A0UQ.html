Bloodless edited and ready to go I am

so I just put some oil treatment on the
ends of my hair and it looks a little
gray sigh but that's okay
so right now I'm gonna get ready I'm
gonna go to Whole Foods get some
groceries finally and then I'm gonna
come back and work a little bit see what
happens first let's check the weather
it's the highest 49 that's pretty cold
alright ready to head out I've got my
black booties on some high-waisted jeans
from Zara that actually keep riding up
my butt crack basic mock neck shirt
leather jacket and then I layered a vest
a faux fur vest over somebody's a book
card yeah these jeans are writing up
every crack that I own let me take care
of this what are you gonna do
turn the camera look wait hold the
camera so I can show you my back Rick
can you see I mean yeah like riding up
my butt and I don't sag those things I
can't they're high-waisted like they
don't go anywhere
see if I just like jerk down real hard I
couldn't sag it no try alright yeah oh
oh oh you're ripping my skin off alright
do I told you they're not going anywhere
what brand is this they're Zara these
are the ones your mom got me well done
Zara Vera yeah Zara what all right this
is gonna have to do so anyways this is
what we're working with today you look
spiffy where are you going going
Biffy do Oh gotta take you know
for you I've been getting some requests
from you guys in the comments to post
outfit photos of each day so I'm gonna
do that I'm gonna do that I know I've
said I'm gonna do that before but I'm
really gonna do it right you're gonna do
it okay so we're gonna go take a picture
all right radio yep check the weather
what'd it say the set like in the high
40s your peace hope I didn't need a big
coat think of me right into the low 40s
true low forties or no bueno high
forties you really need to be coated
though two layers three layers I'll be
fine my butt crack though will not be
fine
all right I definitely could have thrown
on another coat we're going to take the
subways there but we're probably going
to take a cab back
his eye code so I'm going to go to Whole
Foods there's a few different ones in
the city but I'm going to Columbus
Circle because for me it's the easiest
to get there and it's a really pretty
area it's right by a central park yes
yes we need coffee
not sure if I have any money left on my
MetroCard stone
taking this away and like a few weeks so
I could have $100 I can have three
hoping that I can get the Express train
which is the a-train and it goes
straight to my stop
other than that I'll have to take the C
train which I believe is two or three
stops away so not about good down here
is like warm these jeans though
poison
so glad Ryan's not with me because no
buy so many more unnecessary items my
whole food is actually inside of a small
it was kind of weird but whatever
underground that's kind of cool
there's Central Park right there there's
the mall slash my grocery store
my boys
I just on so many groceries right is
gonna kill me hey why is there a coffin
right here this is so weird
I'm sure you're wondering where all my
groceries are there's no way that I
could ever carry them home so Whole
Foods offers a delivery service for nine
dollars so obviously that's what I have
to do the escalator is broken
look at all these stairs
I also have a rotisserie chicken in my
back that smells like a bag of plots all
right guys I'm headed home I need to
stop at CVS it's the laundry so I need
to hurry because my ice cream is melting
five seconds
and this rotisserie chicken that I have
smells like farts
I'm sure the guy beside me on the subway
was like these not hurting my chicken
wrong exit that's okay I'll take a long
way why not I always see the craziest
 that's on this street all all times
of the day it's crazy all right I turn
my camera off for five seconds then I
get right in the middle of a homeless
person altercation
all right just got home my icecream
unloaded now I'm just going to sit down
and make a blog mess
yesterday's go live then head out to
Urban Outfitters I need to exchange
something and I need to get some base
wash so Ryan uploaded vlogmas and he
thought I uploaded vlogmas neither one
of us did so communication skills not
good there so I'm gonna do that really
quick and then I'm gonna head out
vlog misses posted I'm getting the hang
of this whole vlogmas thing like
vlogging everyday feel like when I'm
vlogging and I have a little friends
with me everywhere I go
it's got a nice I'm in Outfitters here
we come maybe a couple other places
don't know gonna do all this tomorrow
but the weather is supposed to be really
crummy tomorrow so just gonna do it
today these jeans have stretched out a
little bit so I'm I'm not like as
uncomfortable as that was earlier I just
can like never wash them otherwise
they'll shrink back up to their butt
crack writing state okay let's go a
little fun fact whenever I have my
headphones and I'm hardly ever listening
to music it's mainly just for looks that
way no one says weird thanks to you when
you're walking down the side vlog trust
me you can tell the difference when you
don't wear them and then when you do
wear them people always like to say
weird or gross things to you but if they
know that they that you can't hear them
they don't even bother so I need to
hurry before Ryan gets home cuz I don't
want him putting the groceries up bless
his heart he just know got the door and
look who I ran into coming in hello hi
hi we missed you at Whole Foods except
not really because that's all nice but
yeah but formal Izzie I do not fart
around work around
okay well that's not home foods is for
farting around that's why they to me
who in there one time it was so busy
bunch of quarters around hers
it was so busy I got road rage carp road
rage
I'll reach so many times I guess I need
a good podcast to listen to text me
shopify masters has got some good
episodes lately okay thanks I'm at H&amp;amp;M
right now and Eugene from The Walking
Dead getting interviewed I can do
I'm going to stop fangirling and get
back to shopping I'm so mad at myself I
was going to get Eugene from Walking
Dead to tell you guys hi the thin I pay
for a sweater turn around and then he's
gone it was taking fan photos but I
guess he wrapped it up because I missed
him I don't even know what his real name
is I guess I should should have like
what would I have said hey Eugene I'm
lame
so yeah all of my fellow Walking Dead
fans sorry I let you down I wasn't quick
enough well I got all the way to Urban
Outfitters and forgot my receipt at home
so gonna have to go back tomorrow I'm
gonna get a bike home tired walking
not at me are you that I love my receipt
here gonna want to talk about why you
get so mad at me was an accident how
many of you have gone to return
something and you forgot the receipt
because I know I'm not alone it happens
but not when you're slowly going out to
return something I know but it just like
whatever brought you Brad you made up
for it about 36 percent with buying
breads okay Brad oh my god

chips buck them up play why don't you
map that out for about my receipt I'm
the one that walked all the way over
there I didn't have my receipt

and the girl was like remaking a return
and I was like yeah she's like please

refrigerator for when they do get here
just kind of messy and there's not a lot
in here
my hair just exploded I'm gonna put my
coconut oil treatment in my hair I
completely forgot about it so I'm gonna
put that in and let it sit for a couple
of hours and then wash it out anyway
before you do that question for me what
make me some food what what do you want

eggs and eggs and chicken yeah you know
I'm gonna be making dinner right when
our groceries get here in in like 20
minutes they're not getting here how do
you know cuz you just call even though
our delivery windows for hours and it
just hit for hours and got like frozen
stuff and like hummus and like things
that I don't want to get warm so I hope
carry up now what do you want guys this
is the coconut oil that I use for my
hair spiked Aparri and it's just regular
coconut oil I also use it when I cook
too if I run out of olive oil so just
100% coconut oil I put it in my hair
because it comes with a cute little
spoon and it looks cute in my bathroom
so and they sent it to me so I thought
that was so nice
all right so we're just gonna let this
sit for a few hours
and I wanted my hair to be all nice and
smooth because I'm doing a DIY ombre
tutorial tomorrow so and yeah completely
lost track of what I was saying perfect
and you need some coconut oil in your
hair don't you wish I wore my hair like
this every day yeah super greasy mm-hmm

looks like Kris Jenner I don't get it
though Ryan I don't know that Kris
Jenner where's her hair slicked back are
you sure about that I just don't know
about it grocery is still earned on here
yet a little concern we called customer
service to see what was going on and he
said that the delivery truck was running
late but that he would call us back and
no one's called us back yet so I'm kind
of annoyed because we've just been
sitting around wasting time waiting for
them instead of going to the gym so it
just needs and I feel like I have snot
we are just gonna go down to the sauna
and we have to talk about some YouTube
stuff some business stuff tonight so we
don't have time to do like a full-on
workout or Ryan or you did his butt you
know do some cardio and stuff so we're
just gonna go to the sauna I'm gonna
take off my makeup and then let's go I
don't exist I don't need this my coconut
is like you've been so rude to me today
no yes you have did you call me Kris
Jenner here by Chris dinner okay what oh

board you just have to like bill flimsy

I'm getting stiff because you're hurting
me

guess what our groceries just got to the
building all right dill pickle chips
like my favorite flavor of chip

it's so good for you it's like and it's
so delicious so I will do some recipes
with this guy acai packs for the most
delicious smoothie Bowl avocado hummus
more sparkling water can't wrap it
nothing up tons and tons of veggies
shuffle sprouts cucumbers red peppers I
love having carrots celery and red
pepper oh hi with hummus I think it's a
really good snack lots of kale kind of
frozen berries for my smoothie bowls and
I got this Cedar's cucumber garlic dill
um different like carrots and cucumbers
all that what I just heard some nonsense
like it oh it's a dill cucumber carrot
dip it's dead why would we have read
that i love this are you too late you've
never had that that's the point you're
supposed to try new things
what other useless things I don't like
anything useless I why don't we let me
come over and see what you got I was
even telling them let's just talk about
how we never by unnecessary change me

don't make any sense how about fake Bell

Alysha sand why would you make them in
addressing number one I don't have a
number two for that will even know these
are my favorite parmesan crisps these go
with Bo in your salad you have to try
one crispy Parmesan cheese hold on Eddie

so that nose really bad tastes like old
cheese is really spicy I'm surprised you

so much it's those parmesan crisps
letti like choked on earlier and do some
fig balsamic right I don't know why I
