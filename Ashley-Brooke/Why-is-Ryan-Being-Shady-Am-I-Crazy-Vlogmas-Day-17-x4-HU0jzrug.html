healthy hair routine video that I told
you guys about yesterday so that should
be going live soon ish and that one I
have partnered with Pantene to shoot so

chill pill so you and I are gonna go to

not cute coat you're gonna get stuck in
it again
I'm not zipping it up oh my gosh it
smells so bad in here what is that smell

as it is just slushy and slippery I love
being out in this weather I know I don't
get out a whole lot but it's honestly
again because of with the month of
December is just so busy I really just
haven't had time to even go to the

each other we're not buying for each
other
we're buying for others like who you on
the phone with him he was like customer
service and I was like for who for what
and he's like don't worry about it
I could be on the phone with another
girl eat your other girl your side chick
yeah can you tell your side chick to
start doing your laundry and you're
cooking and then I'll take care of the
rest
