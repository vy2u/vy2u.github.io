okay
so we did not blog last week because we
had the life by her lookbook go live
which is like wow a process and it was
so delicious it was wrong but she says
well no well it was the process I'm
trying to explain okay I'm trying to
explain why we didn't vlog and it's
because the life by her lookbook took up
me takes up a lot of time at the end of
the month and what's reason number two
reason number two is um we had our
sunglass launch so the sunglasses want
the Carmine sunglasses are launched and
forgive me if they're sold out by the
time this vlog goes live because they
probably will be there
85% sold out right our vegan diet is
going really well can't tell you how
happy I am for all of your comments and
your support and suggestion divot II and
his Rockies I know I think last time we
lovely made black bean burgers repeat

again and I'll show you how I make them
and if you have any suggestions or tips
on anything let me know
let me first of all hold on this I can't
even talk about like this is the
sunglass station this like that I also
can't talk about so I just discovered
these today these are delicious

bean soup or our black bean burger with
salt and pepper over it I bet that would
help Kevin whatever do that again no no

too what hey guys how's it goin so we
are about to take a load to the post
office of carmine sunglasses and as of
right now we are even more almost sold
out than we were yesterday when I was
vlogging I've kind of cleaned up a
little bit I've like unloaded all the
boxes trying to get everything organized
but before we head out I'm going to make
a protein shake with our new protein I'm
going to use the vanilla because it
smells like cake batter and yeah let you
know how it goes after I make
Wow this is probably one of the best
movies I've ever made in my entire life
I will put the full recipe below because
I think I got halfway through and
stopped filming my ingredients for some
reason I was just testing things out so
I'll put the full ingredient recipe and
blacking out the full recipe I had a
brain freeze like business thing
straight but that protein powder is damn
good all right we're heading to the post
office right now to drop off a load of
Carmine's sunglasses to you guys but we
can't vlog on the way because we don't
have hands like we're we've got a lot of
bags that's not true
dude our life
why didn't I just mean to drop out kind
of order can you saw the commercial Bay
where we drop off there is we just
learned about that yesterday because the
lady said that we had too many things to
go into the normal area so he had to
come it is way too cold to the outside
right now whether it says it's 35
degrees but feels like 20 cold front
came in and it's just absolutely
miserable also we are going to stay in
for the rest of the day and box up some
more sunglasses and get as many done as
we can it is dinner time we've been
building boxes and packing up sunglasses
all day which is fine since like I told
you it was like 20 degrees earlier so
this is what we've got going on in the
living room yep that is how this is
working I think we only have like a
little over a hundred to go so we're
we're doing well I am taking a break and
I'm gonna make dinner I'm doing like
this vegan alfredo with cauliflower
sauce so I'm going to make it and then
I'm going to let you guys know how it
was and if it was good I'll put the
recipe below so we'll see so really
quickly the pasta that I'm using is this
chickpea pasta so point you know this is
hi guys and that's still my life right
now
Oh bubble wrap normal things so there
was going to be a how-to style today but
I'll tell you guys why it's not going to
go up so this is the first Sunday since
either June or July that a style video
is not going live so you guys know I
don't do this often
like ever you guys know that Ryan and I
got a rolling rack and to put all of my
coats on it because we just didn't have
room in the apartment and I've been
something my toe walking around it just
because because I'm not used to it and i
stumped it so hard on thursday i believe
it was
and it was kind of swelling up a little
bit kind of hurting but it got to the
point where my toe right now will not
even fit into a shoe it is so swollen
and I would show you but I know some
people are weird about feet and I don't
want to like gross anybody out I woke up
at like 1:00 a.m. with the most
unbearable pain I just can't explain it
I have like shooting pains went through
my body I thought I was going to faint
it was killing me and it's still so
swollen so I can barely even walk on it
so we just couldn't film it yesterday
and I am so sorry I don't want to let
anybody down because I know you guys
always look forward to those fell videos
that go live but there was just no way I
could even tough through it because I
couldn't put any of my shoes on because
my my toe is so swollen that nothing
would fit you know next Sunday back to
normal schedule and I have this vlog
hopefully makes up for it going live
today I'm trying to push off going to
the doctor for my toe I feel like if
it's broken or sprained there's really
nothing that can be done about it about
a toe I think it's just kind of keeping
it elevated and staying off of it so
hopefully I don't think it's broken
because it's not like right now it feels
okay it's just kind of when I get still
it swells up really really bad but I
think it okay in dinner last night was
so good I didn't even tell you guys
because 8:00 and then we stayed up till
around midnight boxing up sunglasses and
then had to go to bed because my toe
started hurting
I know it's um it's done socially is
something so small as a toe but I could
I did not know that my little toe could
be in that much pain ever it's really
good so I will put the recipe below for
you guys that want to try it it was
delicious and the pasta was awesome
Ryan's at the gym right now I'm just
waiting for him to get home
so we can finish up boxing up these
sunglasses and take them all tomorrow

was good but we only have like there's a
handful left so I'm going to put the
