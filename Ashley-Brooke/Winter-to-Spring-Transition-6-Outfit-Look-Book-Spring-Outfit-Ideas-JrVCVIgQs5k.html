up with Lulu's for this video one of my
favorite sides so thank you guys to

it's really cold in the morning and then
it's warmer in the day and you're kind
of not ready to put your winter stuff up
yet but you're getting your spring stuff
out so we are going to collaborate the
two seasons and make some cool outfits
so with that being said let's go ahead
and get started

I love this look book and I would like
to know some items that you still have
for winter that you're still wearing and
kind of putting with your newer spring
item so let me know in the comments
below and as always go check out the
life by Hair Magazine at the links in
the description box and I'll put it here
