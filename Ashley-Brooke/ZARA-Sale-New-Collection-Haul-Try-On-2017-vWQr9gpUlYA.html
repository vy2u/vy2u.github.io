channel don't mind my super casual
sweatshirt we're having a snow day or
should I say romanika blizzard day
pretty much blizzard outside I decided I
would stay indoors and shoot a haul for
you guys today I have a lot of Zara sale
stuff mixed with some full price newer
items so you guys can see a little bit
of both I'll go ahead and start with my
Pugh and non Zara
random item the first one is my new
one-piece bathing suit from ASOS and I
love this so much I got this actually a
while ago but I haven't put it in a haul
yet so I just thought I would show you
guys pretty cheeky in the back still
debating on if I'm going to put a try on
for this I'm like so pale right now
because it's like obviously dead of
winter so I'm even know if I want this
be myself
I thought the print was so fun it's
called um I believe the print is called
Mexico tile on the website but if they
still have it I will link it below is my
Bonnie fans and I follow them on
Instagram and I always think that the
product looks so great solvus when I was
at Ricky's the other day which is like a
beauty supply store $24 and I used it a
couple of days ago I love it and you see
your fans will pay but sometimes I would
find that it it looked good but then in
videos I looked almost a little orange
and I was like huh the box top is I love
it so if you guys are looking for felt
panner this is awesome and it is a
coconut scented only coconut scented
when you smell it when you put it on it
smells a little bit like self-tanner but
pretty good I will start with the shoes
might as well but first I got these cute
little lace-up booties they are textured
almost like a pony hair texture but
they're so cool they have a leather
piping in the box I just think it's so
cute with like types and dresses and
skirts and stuff like that were 140
dollars and I got them for 40 so $100
off
oh my gosh I can't believe they were so
much to begin with that's crazy I next
you I don't know if you can really count
for the sale because I got these either
on like shrimpy or a posh mark or
something but they were 90 and I
actually got them for mmm puppies for 80
really it might get a good deal on them
but they're brand new taxa with us
and I love these so I'm really I'm
really glad I got these I will get so
much use out of these next are my star
boots actually this is the inside this
is the outside they are just basic black
almost like a almost patent leather not
quite but almost a star details boots
with a gold zipper and kind of a curved
heel that was pretty cool these were a
hundred and I got them for except 69 but
I got these for $20 so this was like the
steal of the century
way to go me was going to buy over its
enemy and then I got the register and
they scan for 20 and I was like moving
on to welcomes obviously I'm ready for
spring disobey full price item but I got
is this asymmetrical denim skirt I was
so cool and it actually fits me in the
way I have the hardest time finding
things that fit my waist but this fit so
it's almost like an off black it's not a
rich black it's a little bit more on the
washed black almost like charcoal II
science I really really love it it's
high up here and then asymmetrical
shredded detail on the bottom it is just
the coolest thing I love it and this was
a 49 donas next are these shredded hem
no plus shredded bottom denims and they
are a little bit of a kick Flair I don't
know if I'm gonna keep these because I
thought they were a straight leg when I
bought them but they're not they've got
a little bit of a flare and it kind of
makes my legs look short shorter but if
you are tall and have long legs these
will look great on you but I don't think
I'm going to keep these because I like
the idea it's just not
for me I got these high-waisted button
my pants after I wear them I always said
all acid-wash looking jeans that they
are a straight leg and they've got
really cold rip placement and I love the
rips on the back they are wrist all the
way up in the back so I think that's a
really cool really cool look cam more
like a mom fit their little you know
they're super high waisted skinny
weights and then a little bit baggy ER
and the leg and just kind of go straight
down to outerwear so I got this jacket I
thought the colors were so nice I love
this kind of Mavi dusty rose color
especially with this shearling I thought
this was so cool it's a little big on me
but the girl that worked there like
totally talked me into it she was like
no it's alright lessons luckily you need
it I was like you're right I do get it
this was 100 and I got it for 40 so that
was a good steal my next outerwear is
this little faux leopard color kind of
like a some pretty slowy
jackets cape state but it has sweep like
a cape with sleeves
so like the leopard color detail I also
like that it was Navy because then I can
carry this into spring like jump on you
guys because this was a really kind of a
spring item but I yeah this was a
hundred and I got it for 40 the super
100 what the very excited about this
my next outerwear was full price and it
is a denim jacket and it shredded at the
bottom and then it gets shorter in the
back so I just thought this was so cool
I'm always on the hunt for like cool
detailed denim jackets you know with
like rips or embroidery or studs or
something fun so I really thought this
was interesting and I like the cropped
nosov the back of it and it's a good
color how does this for my outerwear I
have one dress I got this dress it is
almost the effect of a you know blouse
AGGA button-down blouse underneath so
it's got these
leaves and then kind of this little the
same material print showing right there
but I thought this was really cute with
kind of over the knee boots or like
booties or heels I mean this is such an
easy dress to just cut throw on
obviously when the weather is nicer I
love this and the sleeves are a little
like the shoulder has a tuck right here
so it gives you kind of the detail with
a poofy or you think it's kind of cool
this was $50 oh and a denim jacket I
forgot to tell you how much that was a
result is the sweater and you have a few
missed in my how to style my Instagram
and at this it is a oversized
red sweater and I mean it is oversized
but not in a weird way it's like got
batwing sleeves but then it comes to
stopping point so it would still give
you that oversize effect but it's still
50 at the same time I think it comes in
gray also but I opted for the red
because I have too much great stuff
alright next is this little bodysuit
that I got for Fashion Week and I didn't
try this on because you guys know how I
feel about body suits not touching it
until I wash it I hope this looks good
because it's going straight in the
washing machine it's mine but it's got
kind of the same sleeve effect and it's
got a sheer sleeves that get smaller at
the bottom nice and fitted around the
lower arm high next base tastes kind of
dressy I plan on wearing I'm going to an
event tonight I think I'm going to wear
it with my full leather kind of zipper
detail leather pants with this and some
booties so $22 so the good price for a
bodysuit that I won't be wearing so much
just for like events here and there
maybe some videos what do you body suit
but I will not put you and I wash you
next is this little super batwing and
super cross sweater I thought this was
great for traveling with like some
joggers and high-waisted jogger a
high-waisted denim the great basic but
also have like a nice little flare
sleeve so it gives you a little bit of
detail and this was 39 I like this I
haven't tried it on but I mean how hard
can this be like picture on your body
look like that material
although that's going to get weird it's
like that you know I mean when I do this
you see it so yeah I like this anything
easy like this but still have something
fun to it count me in oh look another
black sweatshirt this is a cool black
sweatshirt yes like the beaded fringe
sleeved sweatshirt so this is the front
it's got like really fun with like Lady
Gaga back actually has like a band
around this right here but then it still
keeps going down and as you can add a
little video because you can't really
get the idea but I thought this was so
cool I love getting fun sweatshirts like
this because you know it's easy to throw
on a sweatshirt and jeans and if I can
have something fun on my foot shirt is
even better so lastly it's probably one
of my favorite items that I got from
Zara it's not a sale item so it should
be online but it is this it is this
material is almost like a dressier
button-down work type shirts material
and then this is cotton so the sleeves
are different material and it is the
poopie sleeve that I showed you like
four of already and it's got this faux
leather like best thing that goes around
it it is so cool on and this actually
snaps off so you can take it off and you
can add it to another shirt or you can
wear it by itself I'm just kidding don't
do that so you just like this shirt you
can take it off so really versatile I
absolutely love this this was $39 that
is it for my Zara new collection slash
mail call
so I told you guys I was going to do
more haul I did one I believe last week
and then one this week and hopefully I
will keep trying to do shoot a three a
month for you guys but if this stuff
