pool of broken pieces up that's the
table I'm gonna finish the burger
attempted doink but then it just looked
like I had a mini stroke I left so hard
for no reason that I spit hot coffee at
the side of his car
I accidentally elbowed her in the face
while we were cuddling gave her a black
eye
I don't really know why but for some
reason I brought up cannibalism and then
he tried to kiss me and I was like
that's a date they came first it we went
to Starbucks I offered to pay for the
drinks so I did with pennies my tongue
in her ear while I was looking her jaw
hole second date we were at a bar she
dared me to kneel down sucker toes and
liquor feet until she told me to stop so
I did and then he tried to kiss me and I
was like not to date thetan that's a
date Satan
