date is a friend fine I feel fine
because I can't tell the straight
couples are dating like a dude in a
chick what would they even do together
do you find Ellen attractive yes she is
our president Jodie Foster is the vice
president Tegan and Sara and Ellen Page
that the cabinet and I'm the secretary
of state if lesbians are attracted to
women why is it that some lesbians have
girlfriends or partners that look and
act like men because some of the things
that society has taught you or for men
are actually for anybody like short hair
or flannel shirts I am a beautiful woman
she is would you be willing to be in a
polyamorous I think I spelled that wrong
relationship with a guy oh well no
because I'm not bi and I'm not poly
just because I'm interested in women
doesn't mean I'm interested in any
scenario that includes a woman you're a
lesbian you still take birth control I
personally do not but some women do to
like control their periods or deal with
a hormone imbalance or just for fun
or you know just to have any amount of
control in this terrible male-dominated
world let us take care of our own bodies
I don't feel strong with your mother
since you're a couple and around each
other a lot do your periods sync
together yes and we also dressed exactly
like and we walk four abreast it's
exactly maybe the craft if you perceive
what aggravates you the most about
people against gay marriage the argument
that kids need to be protected from gays
there are little gay kids and there are
kids with gay parents so what kids are
you talking about can you help me
install my heater oh I can't but she can
yeah well not because of this I'm from
Ohio and my dad's an HVAC 16 years
classic dish
do you ever look at a guy and find him
attractive
yeah oh yes of course because I'm a
person I didn't see one other people are
attractive even if I want to sleep with
them or marry them like men can be cute
like Daniel Radcliffe just sweetie
why is the gay community so flamboyant
why is the straight community their
public displays of affection you big
overblown weddings keep it at home I
don't want to see
what makes you feel pretty false
eyelashes and a vest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
