we're gonna use it right on the inner
corner for eye-popping it right there
where the shadow starts and bringing it
right down to the middle of her under
eye area
you want to use a fluffy brush like this
you want to dip it into the product
and dust it off and then put it on your
face
think about it backwards three sort of
where the Sun naturally hits the higher
planes of your face forehead nose cheek
and chin think about the three starting
in the middle of the forehead and cross
the nose and the cheeks and down onto
the chin look down lift up your eyelid a
little bit and go really close to the
root of your lash for about three to
five seconds then we're just going to go
back in and just do the tips for another
three to five seconds so not going all
the way in this time just right at the
tips
every fifth time you do your lashes I
want you to take out your wands use a
tissue and wipe the whole one feet lift
up your eyelid a little bit and start at
the root of your lash going back and
forth and then pulling then using the
tip to sort of not forget about these
tiny hairs here and the tiny hairs on
the ends
so where the hair goes right into your
lash line
you're then connecting them with these
short little strokes
giving the illusion of a really full
root of your lash use your lipstick also
as your blush use this fourth finger use
that little tip right there so right
there right there and then you're using
your clean finger in your blending we're
going to think about putting the color
right at the apples we're going to blend
in the circular motion and blending back
sort of towards the top of that here and
down towards the earlobe so that's a
triangle put it right on the cheekbones
in our corner of the eye for an extra
hour of sleep and then finally right
down the bridge of the nose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
