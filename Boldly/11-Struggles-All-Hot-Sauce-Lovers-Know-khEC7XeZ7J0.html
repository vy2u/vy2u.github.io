and it's not spicy at all,
can we make it hotter?
Yeah, so I think maybe we
can split the Pad Thai,
that'd be good, do you like that?
- Oh yeah!
- [Girl] Cool, cool.
We can get that uh, the super
spicy one, that'd be good.
- [Guy] But I want mild.
- [Girl] What?
Well, everyone, you've got the spices,
you got the spice-ys,
- Overrated.
Overrated.
- How dare you, how dare you.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, these are,
so spicy, it's like my mouth is on fire.
- Jessica, what's wrong?
- Oh God, this is just really spicy.
- You're crying because it's spicy?
- You know that puts holes
in your stomach, right?
What are you doing with that hot sauce?
- You have to see this new hot sauce
I discovered, you're going to love it.
- Whoa, you mean sriracha?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so the food was good though?
- It was so good, you would have loved it,
it was so spicy.
- Wait, hold up,
was it Indian food spicy, Thai food spicy,
or Mexican food spicy?
- Indian food, 100.
- That sounds delicious.
Oh my gosh, did you know that hot sauce
gives you endorphins,
like, your body thinks
that you're under attack
but it really isn't,
so it gives you endorphins,
like science does this,
isn't that amazing?
- What?
- Science gives you...
- I heard you.
- Hey girl, what's up?
- [Jessica] Hey!
- [Lady] Oh God!
- [Jessica] Oh no,
you can't have any, do
you like spicy food?
- [Voiceover] No.
- Yeah, thought so,
so, sorry, all mine.
- Real talk, I love sriracha.
