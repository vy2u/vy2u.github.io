what I did last summer at camp
when I was 19 I made out with a 15 year
old guy at camp I was a counselor he was
a camper when I was in a summer day camp
as a child I pooped in the lake I'm a
summer camp counselor and I constantly
complain about a specific camper because
she reminds me of the girl that bullied
me for years in school I work at a
summer camp and for snack we put
chocolate frosting and sprinkles on hot
dogs last night I got to kiss an English
man that was here for summer camp his
accent was so sexy my life is complete
sometimes I cannot comprehend how some
people can't love kids I have
volunteered three summers to a summer
camp in my neighborhood why do girls
have butts on their chests kids say the
funniest things I took a in a dudes
bed at summer camp I once put a piece of
old steak under my co-workers tent at
summer camp to attract skunks summer
camp was the first time I felt like I
belonged my first love was at summer
camp working at a summer camp is the
best job on earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
