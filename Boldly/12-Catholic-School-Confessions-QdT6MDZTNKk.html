to piss off one of the nuns by asking if
Jesus can microwave a hot pocket and
make it so hot that even he can't eat it
I didn't tell a single person when I
lost my virginity because I went to
Catholic school and everyone would hate
me I support gay people and go to a
Catholic school they tell me I'm going
to hell so I told them see you there
while in Catholic school I once referred
to the Bible as historical fiction the
nuns were not released I go to an
all-girls private Catholic school that
kind of sucks half of us don't know a
single boy I know nothing about sex I
went to a strict Catholic school they
taught us that abstinence is what's
important not the actual educational sex
now I'm scared to have sex because I
know so little scared to tell everyone
I'm gay
I don't think they'll accept me because
I go to a Catholic school but I can't
keep lying to myself I got sent to
Catholic school by force as a kid got
expelled for trying to summon the devil
worked like a charm I study in a
Catholic school but I don't want to
practice the religion because it just
doesn't make sense to me
I miss Catholic school something about
not having to pick out an outfit every
day was so nice to me I'm gay I also go
to an all-girls private Catholic school
if I come out of the closet I risk
getting kicked out but if I stay in the
closet I will live miserably I go to an
all-girls Catholic school and they are
still oblivious about the fact that my
water bottle is full of vodka</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
