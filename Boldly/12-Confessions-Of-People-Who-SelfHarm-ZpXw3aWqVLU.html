myself bleed something about it makes me
feel better I'm scared I'll be judged if
people see scars from when I cut myself
I wear jeans all the time yes i
self-harm no I am NOT attention-seeking
and no I don't want to die it's the only
pain that I have control over that's why
I do it
i self-harm but I'm ashamed of it so I
come up with excuses to tell people when
they ask I get so tired of trying to
hide my self harm scars but I don't want
them to go away I'm meeting the guy of
my dreams this weekend but I'm scared my
self harm scars will scare him away
my mother couldn't stop looking at my
self harm scars today and it broke my
heart to see her looking at them when I
cry uncontrollably I cut myself and it
makes me feel good about myself because
I stopped the mental pain sometimes
I cut myself to overcome anxious and
irrational thoughts physical pain blinds
the emotional pain but at a cost for the
first time in two years
I cut myself again I didn't mean to it
just happened I just couldn't take it my
self harm scars are over a year old
today I'm so happy that I made it one
year clean from self-harm today like any
addiction the urge is still there but
I'm stronger now I'm proud of myself
