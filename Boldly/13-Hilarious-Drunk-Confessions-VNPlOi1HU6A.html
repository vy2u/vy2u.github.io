getting a part-time Anaya was drunk I
was so drunk I hugged and asked my
shower to stop crying
once I was so drunk that I cried for two
hours about tacos one time I was so
drunk that I cooked a pizza for 450
minutes at 15 degrees
I put sunscreen on my sandwich after a
few bites I realized it was sunscreen
but I continued to eat it got picked up
and bought access to five private porn
sets with my friend's credit card I once
got so drunk that I walked into the
bathroom peed in my pants and walked
back out I was so drunk last night that
I started putting on my foundation with
a paint brush I peed in a Starbucks cup
because I was too drunk to walk or crawl
to the bathroom thank God it was Efendi
I played rock-paper-scissors with myself
in front of a mirror I lasted 15 minutes
I couldn't find a lighter for my
cigarette so I went to see if I could
download one from the App Store I was so
drunk last night that I thought a tube
toothpaste was astronaut food I
accidentally emailed my nude to my mom
when I was drunk one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
