years now and it's made me mean I hate
people and I never want kids I work at
Disneyland I work for Disney and saw one
of the princesses do a line
hashtag magic ruined I work at
Disneyland and I've never seen a Disney
movie I work at Disney World and really
do not like children I work for Disney
in the sense of entitlement people have
astounds me daily humanity is not pretty
I thought working at Disney roll to make
me happy it makes me miserable instead
hashtag tragic kingdom' I work at Disney
where dreams come true it's ironic
because the company destroys mine every
chance it gets I work at Disney and it
takes all my strength not to be a bitch
I work seasonally for Disney World and
guess you're so mean sometimes I leave
work in tears I work at Disney World and
every day before my shift I drink liquor
to help make me more cheerful for the
children working for Disney has given me
self-worth they saved me I work as a
Disney character at Disneyland and I get
disgusted by the young teen girls and
moms who try to hit on me and give me
their numbers I work at Disneyland on
the intercom I announce the ride is
broken everyone hang on I got fired I
secretly feel kind of superior in life
because my job is a Disney Princess I
mean how often does your childhood
fantasy actually come true
