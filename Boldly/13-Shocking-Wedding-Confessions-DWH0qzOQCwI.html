but in the limo at the driver not my
husband I didn't have sex with my
husband on our wedding night we spend
the evening cleaning the carpets my dog
crapped all over I slept with my
husband's brother on our wedding night
and I think I might be in love with him
my wife accidentally peed herself at our
wedding due to excitement I actually
think the emotional part of that is kind
of cute my husband and I waited for our
wedding night to have sex for the first
time and the sex sucked today was
supposed to be my wedding day and the
day I've been dreaming of forever my
fiance's bachelor party went wrong and
now he and his groomsmen are sitting in
County Jail my life is like a comedy
gone wrong I danced with two people at
my wedding the one I married and the one
I wish I married on our wedding night me
and my hubby went back to the hotel got
into bed had a brew and watched Family
Guy when my beautiful bride walked down
the aisle I thought her dress was
hideous my husband got so drunk with his
friends on our wedding night I drove him
home in my dress no sex
he didn't even help me get out of my
dress I got cold feet on my wedding day
I stood him up and never came back for
him me and my husband had a threesome on
our wedding night it was amazing on our
wedding night we didn't have sex instead
we snuggled under the blankets and told
each other everything that we loved
about one another my secret I wouldn't
change it for the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
