person needs in their life the I'm
pretending to text emoji you can use
this one when you arrive somewhere early
and need to avoid making eye contact
with a stranger me I'd rather hang out
with an animal emoji but when you get to
a party and realize you're sitting in a
corner petting a cat rather than talking
to the humans in the room the sorry my
hands are clammy emoji basically this
one works whenever you meet someone new
meeting new people is hard okay the
flirting is not my forte emoji for when
your crush says something smooth and you
literally forget how to form a sentence
the please never call me on the phone
emoji for when someone has the audacity
to call you instead of text you what is
this 1995 the public speaking emoji for
when you have to give a presentation at
work and are a little nervous about it
the avoiding someone in public emoji but
when you see someone you know in public
I want to avoid small talk at all costs
me I thought you were waving at me emoji
for when someone waves to the person
behind you
ouch the walking isn't my thing emoji
for whenever you fall down for me it's
twice a day the doors are confusing
emoji for when you push a pull door for
the 20th time just put up a sign the I'm
very photogenic emoji but when your
friend uploads a horrendous picture of
you because they look good in it
assholes the I literally can't dance
emoji for any instance when you're
forced to try to move your arms and legs
to any sort of rhythm but I can't I have
planned emoji when you need an excuse to
stay and on a Friday night
and finally the I didn't peak in high
school emoji when you need a reminder of
how far you've come thank God for
contacts am i right use these emojis
wisely and if you call me I won't pick
up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
