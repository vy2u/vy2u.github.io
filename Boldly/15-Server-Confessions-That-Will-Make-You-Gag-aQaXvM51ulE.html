salad to a table I noticed a long black
hair on it I didn't say anything and
when I came back the whole salad was
gone I'm a server and when really
attractive guys leave I lick their
straws lush silverware so it's like I
kissed them I work as a server at a
restaurant that doesn't serve ginger ale
whenever a customer asks for it I just
mix sprite and coke no complaints yet
when they make me clean toilets at work
I use the same towel to clean the tables
I'm a server not a toilet scrubber I'm a
server when people ask me for low-fat
ranch I always give them regular ranch
if you were really trying to diet you
wouldn't eat ranch at all I'm a waitress
and one time at work these guys kept
calling my coworker fat so I filled
their cups of toilet water and spat in
their food I'm a server and one time I
stuck my tongue in a guy's juice to see
if it went bad in the fridge he drank
all of it afterwards I'm a server when a
customer is rude I pick my nose and dip
my fingers in their drink before giving
it to them it makes it worth it to keep
serving them I work at a pretty rowdy
bar and one night I was collecting empty
glasses and found a torn piece of ear in
a glass
someone must have grabbed the person by
the ear I got stuck to the earring I'm a
server in a restaurant and it gets so
busy sometimes and I need to pee but I
don't have time
so I pee my pants a little I'm a waiter
and I fart near my tables and walk away
at least once a shift I'm a server I hop
and I admit that I dropped pancakes on
the floor and just threw them in the
microwave I care for your health I'm
going to my job today with contagious
strep throat because no one can cover my
 I work at a restaurant every server
I know has been forced to work while
sick
sometimes when I masturbate right before
I go to work I forget to wash my hands
I'm a waiter I'm a waitress and if
you're an ass throughout your stay those
complimentary extras I send you home
with have ever been dropped on the dish
room floor or spit in have a great King
day smiley face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
