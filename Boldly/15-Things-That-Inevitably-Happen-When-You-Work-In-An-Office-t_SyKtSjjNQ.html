you will spend the majority of your
waking life and these are the things
that will inevitably happen while you're
there you will begin your time working
in an office wearing your finest
clothing only to wind up not giving us
regardless of your best intentions you
will develop an addiction to caffeine no
matter what your relationship status you
will develop some sort of crush on a
co-worker you will fall into one of two
camps the people who are always freezing
or the people who are constantly hot you
will start with one personal item in
your office drawer and then one day
you'll open it up and realize your
entire life is in there someone in your
office will creep you out
and you will bond with someone else over
mutually being creeped out you will get
exceptionally good at hiding Facebook on
your computer at some point you will
hear one of your co-workers pooping that
will be a low point you'll come
face-to-face with a co-worker in the
restroom and realize that they don't
wash their hands and that will change
everything you'll gain at least five
pounds of fat from all the birthday
cookies cakes and red velvet cupcakes
that keep floating around and just when
you try to cut down on the sweets your
co-workers will pull you back in you
will fantasize about doing unspeakably
strange things to your coworkers at some
point you will bring a personal friend
to visit and it will be unexpectedly
awkward to introduce them to anyone you
work with you will get really excited
about being good at some small task and
then hate it once everyone else starts
asking you to do it for them and you
will form a group of friends in that
office who will make every day a whole
lot better
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
