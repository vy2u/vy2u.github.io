I'm doing it via text because I don't
have the balls to do it any other way
I'm gay and I'm Christian my dad's a
preacher actually and I live in the
south it's rough sometimes but because I
came out I'm the happiest version of
myself I've ever been my mom told me I
was going through a phase when I said I
was transgender I came out of the closet
after I've been drinking I knew I
shouldn't have been drinking
two days ago I came out of the closet
today I just made out with a possible
future boyfriend how do you come out of
the closet without things getting
awkward only my boyfriend knows I'm
bisexual my dad kicked me out because I
came out and told him on the lesbian I
came out of the closet to my mom she
came out to me too I came out to my
friend she then said well duh I didn't
know it was that obvious I'm bi but I'm
scared to come out because my best
friend is against same-sex couples when
I came out as transgender my mother in
law's first question was whether I had
AIDS when I came out to my mom she told
me I can't help him attracted to then
she said she doesn't approve of that
lifestyle the I convinced myself I
was going to come out of the closet when
I went to college I'm starting my second
year and I'm still too scared to tell
anyone my whole life I felt like I
should be a girl I'm afraid I would lose
everybody in my life if I came out as
transgender my coworker and I just came
out to each other now I feel like we're
gonna be great friends when I came out
as a lesbian
my grandfather hugged me and said boobs
are great huh
you
