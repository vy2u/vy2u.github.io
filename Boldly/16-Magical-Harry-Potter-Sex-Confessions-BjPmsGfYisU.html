hair and make him dress as Ron Weasley
I hated Draco Malfoy in the books but
when I look at him I'm oddly turned on I
want to get a Harry Potter tattoo but
I'm afraid that once I meet Rupert Grint
he won't like it and we'll never be
together I've genuinely masturbated over
the thought of having sex with
Dumbledore more than once I rather watch
Harry Potter than have sex with you
sorry not sorry I wish I could find a
French lesbian the Harry Potter fan in
Montreal so I could watch all the movies
with her and have sex a lot the first
time I had sex I didn't know what to do
so I quoted Harry Potter when I'm having
sex with my boyfriend I pretend he's
Severus Snape I'm more attracted to
people who have read Harry Potter books
than people who haven't I had sex with
my bf while dressed in a Gryffindor
schoolgirl outfit from Harry Potter a
lot of girls in my school have a crush
on my boyfriend only because he looks
like Harry Potter and that makes me feel
insecure because it girls are more
prettier than me they also flirt with
him but he doesn't flirt back my fave
Harry Potter character is Draco Malfoy
mainly because he is hot and me I don't
know I just liked him
I'm watching all of the Harry Potter
again to find the exact moment when
Neville Longbottom got hot I would
totally have a threesome with Ron and
Hermione I really love Harry Potter for
I don't care how sexy you are if you
dislike Harry Potter it's over between
us
