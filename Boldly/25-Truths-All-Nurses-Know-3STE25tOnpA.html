not serious right
you often worry about whether or not
your patient is peed in the last eight
hours but then again you haven't peed in
the last 12
we have the biggest bladders in the
world if we love when you tell us what
you found out on WebMD no no we don't
know thieves you anymore don't you think
well no one died or masturbated in front
of me today so it's been a good day
you honestly deserve an award for how
much stress you handle every single day
every day is a multiple cups of coffee
kind of day in fact all nurses know that
in nursing school even when you're right
you're wrong because while it's correct
it's not the most correct nursing
friendships are a bond unlike any other
because you've literally been through
 together you truly do love our jobs
it's just that some people are assholes
before tonight nurses have to remind
people that we are not their personal
servants as a nurse you've considered
adding loads of experience dealing with
ignorant people to your resume you
develop a very weird unique sense of
humor
I have seen the strangest balls it never
fails that the minute you put gloves on
you get something in your eye you will
wash your hand so many times it will
feel like your skin is literally falling
off of your hand it's almost impressive
how many different forms of body fluid
you can get on you in one day I smell
like urine now there should be another
option when filling out relationship
statuses single married nurse Photoshop
that's how you make it look like you're
a part of weekend group hangouts can
someone please turn off that
call bell so holding my pen still
holding some people dressed up as a sexy
nurse for Halloween you think I don't
need to dress up as a sexy nurse because
I already am one it's not that we
couldn't be doctors we chose to be our
ends just so we're clear some people
like to make jokes by the fact that you
clean up poop but you also save lives on
the rag as a nurse no matter what you
deal with on a daily basis you love your
job and you wouldn't change it for the
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
