ever happen it's spooky as heck and you
can be whoever or whatever you want sexy
be sure box of crayons go for it
dirty rag suit yourself you a weirdo but
there are a couple things about
Halloween that make me want to punch a
cute little bat and I love bats
ooh
pressure unimaginable pressure to pick
the best costume a custom that says hey
world I'm creative but I definitely
didn't spend two weeks straight working
on this costume why would you say that
the perfect costume has to look good and
be be warm enough so I don't freeze my
buns off
I need my buns for all sorts of bun
related activities inevitably you just
forget until the last second and then
write book on your face and call it a
night
dude when people give you healthy stuff
for things that aren't candy I can get
raisins anywhere and feel really good
about myself Halloween is about erasing
guilt this is the stuff I wouldn't buy
normally stuff you pick up in the aisle
like I deserve this and then leave in
the basket when you get to the register
what is this spooky stickers I can't
quell my existential grief with stickers
oh hey speaking of du'a what is up with
adults not being able to trick-or-treat
dressing up in a costume and getting
candy is fun for everyone not just
children who doesn't like candy I rest
my case
yes dear people who turn your lights off
on Halloween we know you're home and we
hate you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
