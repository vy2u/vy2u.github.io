when I was in elementary school people
would stop and stare at me because
they've never seen hair as long as mine
it's me I've just had it my whole life
and to be honest a lot of people always
tell me to cut into like your hair so
long and it it's not this it does look
nice this way and I think it's kind of
become my my staple thing in my
statement and I'm like I really like it
and I think it tells a lot of my
personality because it never listens
it's so totally wild and all over the
place over the last couple years I
learned that beauty really does mean
what makes you feel good and I know this
because you know when I started in
YouTube videos my first 20 of them I
tried to be something I wasn't you know
I tried to have great posture I tried to
do my makeup which I don't really know
how to do and I tried to be something I
wasn't and I think I started to get a
lot of comments well like hey you look
really good in this video when I just
start to be myself and when I started to
smile genuinely and show all my little
quirks and have it it's not feeling good
of being confident that's what beauty is
to me to my younger demographic that is
struggling with body in which I would
say that it is completely normal
you're not weird for feeling that way I
felt that way when I was growing up I
think everyone feels that way at some
point or another I think it's important
to remember that you're one person in a
world of like 7 billion and everyone's
different and that's what makes people
awesome I mean imagine how boring it
would be if we all look the same and I
can totally relate because when I was
growing up I had really hairy arms and I
had one eyebrow all of those things I
used to feel so insecure about it but
all those little things make you you and
you should not only be yourself but be
unapologetic for yourself because dude
no one is like you like everyone else
has taken embrace who you are you're
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
