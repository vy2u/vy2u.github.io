recently blocked an app which allowed
users to see which of their friends had
unfriended them which got me to
wondering
has anyone ever unfriended me from
Facebook keep in mind I'm pretty cool
but it turns out four people have
unfriended me on Facebook and desk so I
decided to track down my ex friends and
find out what I did wrong
using my expert research skills I
tracked down my marks actually I just
logged into Facebook and typed in their
names the first my college roommate
ex-girlfriend
blocked me immediately the second said
she would rather not be in my video but
the third and fourth agreed to video
chat with me and explained what had
happened but first I decided to talk to
some co-workers and find out what their
thoughts were on this whole unfriending
phenomenon have you ever unfriended
someone on Facebook
yes I have of course I know all the time
really all the time so what's the reason
you might unfriend someone on Facebook
all right racist statement homophobic if
you're too political i unfriend you if
there's someone that I've dated and I
don't want to see their social media
talk about their problems all the time
send me like candy crush requests you're
cut for a while I hooked my twitter up
to my face oh I would unfriend the out
of you it's really bad it's usually one
of super thinks that's the only way that
I know that I'm friends with them don't
thank people on their birthday you got
late wait one day that's cold I feel
like they wouldn't notice great hey I
noticed four people in front of me on
Facebook were you like posting annoying
things never Sachs never done anything
like that I think that maybe maybe
you're over saturating them and maybe
it's not even your fault are you trying
to tell do you think I do I over
saturate you won't die you don't over
saturate me people unfriend you when
they think you're not interesting enough
to keep sometimes you just have to like
cut ties with people if you're not gonna
write happy birthday on the person's
wall when it's their birthday you should
just delete them because that's what
Facebook's for my coworker my co-workers
were helpful but if I really want to
find out why I wasn't friended there are
only two people who can help me
Jackie hey David
hello Amanda hi I appreciate you taking
some time to talk to me it's been a
while three or four years yeah I think
we stopped hanging out before we
graduated college
oh god this is awkward sorry oh it isn't
gonna get more awkward you commented on
three of my profile picture that's how I
knew you unfriended me there are some
good photos I couldn't help myself I
guess one of the pictures is me in a
c-3po costume and I'm kind of touching
myself yeah I mean the more that we're
talking about the more I'm realizing
like we were definitely friends we
weren't just like Nobby definitely where
we went to like a lot all right David
let's just dive right into this you and
I were Facebook friends you severed that
tie really we're no longer Facebook
friends why are you laughing this is not
a laughing matter this is serious I'm
sorry what did I do
why did you unfriend me I did yeah I
don't remember why exactly I did it just
like a distancing thing I don't know I
thought about it to you guys like I
really have no idea so you weren't the
only one just so you know there was many
who were just like plucked off I mean I
am friend people a lot from college like
I'm a serial I do it on their birthday
too
I'm the worst I always do the birthday
I'm right I just didn't give a I
was just like ant-man
I was thinking of the instant man I
can't be the only one who does that you
you're still friends with my other
roommates you said my old college
roommate so it was just me cuz Holly
always thought that you had like a crush
on her and we're kind of here so I think
eventually the hive mind of the door
convinced us so we were all like oh man
no good it's like every fear I
potentially had confirmed in one
terrible video chat you and I don't talk
that's just a fact would you say we're
friends right now now I don't know
anything about your life I mean we were
into similar things and then we went on
the pads of differentiating it's a sort
of different likelihoods you know we
were friends and now we're not friends
and maybe that's okay
yeah a relationship is like a shark has
to keep moving forward or else it does I
think a juror was like if I don't even
feel like wishing you happy birthday
here is not worth being my facebook
friend
that's pretty budget I wouldn't consider
it then that's that
you know you lose friends along the way
and that can be okay
so we set our goodbyes in the end it was
nice reconnecting with David and Amanda
even despite the circumstances that
brought us together we even decided to
remain Facebook friends for now we had
refriended for the sake of the video and
then on my birthday something unexpected
happened
domi on instagrams instagrams a little
more selective I think so so there we go
there we go there we go
what does it mean father someone I did
different video different video David
just called me out for my shed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
