you go to war that it's nothing like
what they show in the movies are on TV
you you become closer to to a lot of
people a bond that you'll never you'll
never find anywhere else and you'll
share some chaotic times together
the food the local food is unbelievable
had really good ongoing barbecue and his
ol had Girl Scout cookies aired route to
me in Afghanistan yeah and in Iraq I was
introduced to gif burgers not sure if it
was goat not sure if it was beef might
have been a combination of both by the
time I was deploying it was later into
the war effort and things were more
established there was one time I went in
for Christmas dinner and they literally
had an ice sculpture in the chow hall in
Iraq I know nothing about sneaking in
Grey Goose and bottles of water but I've
heard rumors of people being sent Crown
Royal and Listerine bottles I personally
didn't have to sneak in alcohol because
I was friends with the British soldiers
when I was in Iraq that most of the
movies I was addicted to or like kid
movies like bring it
stick it 13 going on 30 you know just
think things to lighten the mood we
would go through a ridiculous amount of
TV shows and movies it's like a switch
we go from discussing what happened on
the most recent episode of The OC to
executing a target and going on a
mission you have to wear reflective
belts 24 hours a day if you're not out
on a mission collective belts really
done save lives I don't know where that
idea came from I don't know if anybody
ever stopped and realized like wow we
have we are wearing a reflective belt in
a war zone there is no shame in cuddling
other dudes
well deployed there's nothing gay if
it's cold outside as long as you make
eye contact everything is usually pretty
kosher but yeah I've definitely been
involved in a four-way spoon before you
know to keep warm it was not lost on me
that I was the mayonnaise and in a man
sandwich I had I had the blessing to
hang out with not only British but
Canadian troops Estonian troops lock in
troops Japanese soldiers I would say of
the bunch the Royal Irish were the
craziest I suppose it's probably not too
much different than like living in dorms
or something like that except with guys
that are really alpha male type people
and take everything to the extreme
and both good and bad ways you know you
develop you develop a relationship with
those guys it's unmatched by anybody
else
you know you depend on each other for
survival for entertainment now there's
good times bad times there's a lot of
funny times just living your life but
you also happen to be at war at the same
time I mean like eating pizza bagels in
the middle of a firefight that stuff
really happens and in a war the war part
kind of becomes matter of fact in the
middle of your life I mean you could be
talking about the OSI you could be
talking about movies television you can
really be having a good time in in the
middle of a lot of chaos and it's the
good time you remember not so much the
chaos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
