computer for a second?
- Uh, yeah.
Buzzfeed Presents Five
Signs Your BFF is a Type A
- Hey, can I have the Greek Salad?
But no olives,
and instead of feta cheese
I'd love goat cheese,
and also instead of chicken I want salmon.
OK, tell him what you want.
- Number four.
- Also, on the salad, no dressing.
OK, so I'm thinking we
go to Brian's at 6:00,
leave at 7:00, quick salad at my place.
Then we go for a quick stop in
at Jennifer's birthday
party, 8:15 to 8:45.
With travel we can get to
the holiday party by 9:00,
and then stay for two hours, leave,
and be back home and in bed at 11:45.
- Maybe we could have fun and relax.
- I am relaxed.
Did you not hear me say 11:45?
Oh my God! Where were you?
I thought you were going
to be here at 12:30.
I was worried sick.
- Ready for the weekend?
- Yes. It's going to be so awesome.
I'm going to get so much done.
I have to go to the post
office, the supermarket,
I have to return that mop
that I bought to Bed, Bath, and Be--
- Seriously?
- Yes. Is that lame?
- No. I have so much stuff I need to do.
Can you take me with you?
- Yes! You don't know this,
but I have an Excel
spreadsheet of everything
I can fix in your life for you.
- That's so weird.
- [Girl with Short Hair] You love it.
- [Girl with Red Hair] I do love it,
but it's definitely weird.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
