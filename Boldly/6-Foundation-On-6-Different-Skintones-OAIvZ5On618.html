so there's this six dollar foundation
that everyone on YouTube is talking
about it's the LA Colors truly mad
foundation and it comes in 14 different
shades I wanted to see just how great
this foundation was so I got a bunch of
friends and co-workers to go ahead and
try them here we go it's mad so I don't
know I'm a little already off the bat
I'm not sure about this hmm sounds like
a little bit like play-doh like an aqua
not the kid is this too much it
looks like a little thick to me it feels
nice okay
shoo this may be too yellow for me so is
this the darkest shade in LA Colors
feels like pretty light I'm gonna mix it
just to see what the undertones are
giving where you at not for you not for
you this is not much actually like this
I think this just makes me look paler
which is not really what I'm going for
it
not really the beached bronzed Gatos I
like to see myself okay she's got a lot
of labor on my part this is not to get
up and go Foundation unless it matches
you exactly it's not bad but it's just
it's kind of that gray thing that goes
on when it's not really your color if
you're red on the time like me this
probably wouldn't be the best bet for
you because if you mix it's gonna turn
you gray what you see right here it
feels soft it feels smooth it does not
feel heavy it feels very light it
doesn't feel that bad like it looks
quite nice
I'm loving it more as it drives cuz it's
on to look more like skin which is great
I like the finish
I like I'm happy I'm not like happier
than I was before I put this off at the
most I think it would cost is like 12 I
think 30 is a safe bet
judging from what the average price of
foundation is and my opinion is worth
five dollars Wendy 25 oh my god
six dollars though mm-hmm Toby what do
you think of my makeup you're glowing
Conor do you think there's anything
different about my face no okay
a little cakey a little cake a little
key but like the shade is beautiful
gorgeous so it matches pretty well yeah
I would say of you Danny what do you
think about my foundation I think it
looks good but if you can still see you
like your freckles like so it still
looks natural and stuff but it looks
pretty even I'm taking the coverage in
public
more my speed of what I would - she is a
little yellow though but good I've been
wearing this for six hours and I think
it's like still on I have to say
everyone knew who I asked for this part
was very positive so I think I actually
like this foundation more than I
initially did and did my pukin
investment it's not terrible in the
sunlight you know how when you're
wearing foundation and you're all beat
when you're all inside and then suddenly
you go outside and you look like ass
well this is actually working out for me
I really like it so it's 6:30 right now
ish I think it's been around 6 hours I
think the foundation looks fine it's I
mean you can definitely see some sort of
shine but like it looks ok if it feels
ok so I guess it gets it ok for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
