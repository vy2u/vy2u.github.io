parent you're watching this video
because your child wants you to acquire
a pet dog for your family so we're here
as fellow rational adults with six
reasons you should totally get your kid
a puppy scientific research has shown
that dogs have an almost supernatural
ability to detect cancer in their owners
with the cost of health care rising
think of your new dog as a form of
alternative preventative care adorable
preventative care the American Journal
of Public Health shows that children
with dogs spend more time doing moderate
to vigorous physical activity than those
without a new dog will compel your child
to turn off all those damned screens and
go outside to laugh and play like when
you were younger and everything was
better with special training dogs can
learn to detect dangerous allergens like
peanuts they can also be trained to
sniff out bombs and drugs so by getting
a dog you can protect your child from
three of the most common threats they
face today
drugs bombs and peanuts the British
Medical Journal found that dogs help
their owners reduce stress depression
and anxiety as well as promote
interaction with others perhaps a dog is
what your child needs to finally come
out of their shell and make some friends
that aren't total weirdos the average
cost of ownership for a medium-sized dog
is only $1,100 per year roughly three
dollars per day for the price of one of
your fancy daily coffee drinks you can
reap all of the benefits mentioned here
plus earn the happiness and adoration of
your child which as we know is priceless
finally your child deserves a dog he or
she has been behaving very well lately
they received an acceptable grade on
their last test and have recently
excelled in their after-school activity
the addition of a dog to the family will
teach them the discipline and
responsibility they need to attend a
good college and become model citizens
plus we found this guy on the way home
have already named him scraps and can we
keep in please please please
you think they bought it I hope so
I don't think we can take him back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
