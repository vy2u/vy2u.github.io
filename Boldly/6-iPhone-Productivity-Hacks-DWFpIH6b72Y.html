Bluetooth keyboard to your phone by
going to settings Bluetooth and
selecting your device this is

and squinting for even faster typing use
keyboard shortcuts for your most common
phrases go to Settings General keyboard
and add a new shortcut but if you really
really really hate typing you can
dictate longer messages by pressing the
microphone button at the corner of the
keyboard hi Gary
