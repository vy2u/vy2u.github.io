I know this sounds like the dumbest
thing but the first time I put a tampon
in I actually put it up my butt am I the
only one first time I ever pulled out a
tampon I was expecting so much blood
that I used an oven mitt while taking it
out I quickly realized that was a little
unnecessary the first time I used a
tampon I don't know why but I just
assumed that if you needed more
absorbency you just use multiple ones at
a time a few days later I ran that by my
mom only to find out that I was way off
I didn't use a tampon until I was 22 my
first time disposing of one I was at my
boyfriend's house I wrapped it up and
put it in the trash about an hour later
we found his dog in the kitchen
wrestling with a ball of toilet paper
and out popped my tampon I was mortified
the first time I tried one the string
drove me crazy I don't know why but I
assumed it probably had no purpose so I
cut it off I then spent several hours
that night trying to fetch it out of my
body let the string be when I inserted a
tampon for the first time it really
turned me on and I haven't found anyone
who has had the same experience it took
my mom and two sisters to help get my
tampon in that's three additional humans
in the bathroom with me thanks family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
