- How are you?
It's so good to see you!
- So good to see you!
Hello, I missed you too.
- Dating standards change
- I really think you should
go on a date with this guy.
He's so cute and so nice.
- Ahh, I don't know.
- He has a pug.
- What's his name?
- Jake, I told you that.
- No, the pug's name.
- Oh.
- You're overly helpful
- We're suppose to head
out of town this weekend,
but I still haven't been able
to find anyone to dog sit.
Kinda, kinda gettin' worried about that.
- I can do it!
If you, if you need a
dog sitter this weekend.
- You're constantly distracted.
- I'm gonna be late, I'm gonna be late.
- Oh my God!
- Look at the little, cute little
- Every time, come on.
- Doggie, so cute.
- Hello.
- You clog social media timelines
- You're constantly falling in love
- No one understands you
- I would totally be a pug,
but like, the really soft,
really fat kind of pug
so I can just snuggle it.
- And if you can't find your own...
- You can always find someone who does
