stupid period Oh No the day one day one
the worst day yeah I'm sorry man
what kind of period is it what do you
mean well in my experience there are
eight different periods eight yeah you
have the leaky one this period really
likes to ruin your favorite pair of
underwear sure you may have misjudged
the amount of flow coming down the
pipeline but that's no excuse for this
period to be as squishy and comfortable
and just clean your room as it is oh I
know that very well then there's this
body period this one's known for its
inability to make a decision Oh like me
yeah it's a relatable period some have
called it the Millennial cried myself up
sometimes is there sometimes it's not
sure it's it's not a full-fledged lava
flow but it would be easier to predict
you need to work
hmm well that is not what this one is
okay well number three is the chunk stir
period gross brings all kind of bodily
debris out of your vagina along with it
elcome looks like a murder scene as
somehow satisfying to see that how
periods are just nasty yes yes they are
but life isn't always beautiful
sometimes it's violent sometimes it's
bloody red but you know what it helps us
we get all of our stuff out it helps us
have babies so we need it we should
celebrate yeah that's true I mean
periods are sort of incredible okay so
what's next
oh well number four is the Phantom
Imperium Oh The Phantom period the one
that never ever shows up you know you
still have all of the bloating and the
cramps and the desire to have complete
emotional breakdowns that's the word
wellness I wanna have we can move on ya
know my old friend the surprise bitch
the hog bitch takes pride in ruining
your day by showing up uninvited well
they're excellent sheer boredom where
it's just a complete sadist and
literally give zero about you
Ariel plans when it's here it's here
then there are the periods that are way
too long and the period did it way too
short
oh I once had made for 17 days strange
yeah I want to have a line for 49
minutes also strange yeah oh and then
there's one more the one you probably
have it's the kill me now in period this
period thinks your uterus is a gosh darn
jungle gym it has absolutely no respect
for your pain tolerance usually leaving
you in such agony that you cannot
believe you have to deal with this
every single
popping a few ibuprofen Candell Xterra
for a few hours but it will come in yeah
sorry girl yeah wine chocolate on it oh
no problem
I think I just got my period yep there
it is what kind of film like a chunk
stir yeah I'm just gonna sit in pretend
it's not happening this couch is
