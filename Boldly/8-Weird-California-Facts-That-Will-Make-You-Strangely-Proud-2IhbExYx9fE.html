California champion of the west coast
and home to the Kardashians but
California is so much more than that
here are some facts that'll make even
the most self-hating California stand up
and take notice did you know that in
1981 in the small town of Sunol
California a dog ran for mayor and won
that's right dog mayor not a dog person
well in 2006 a naked man in California
was arrested for carrying a concealed
weapon I'll give you two guesses where
he was hiding it California isn't just
home to make it criminals it's also home
to Death Valley Death Valley is
officially the driest place in the
United States and holds the record for
the hottest place in the world average
summer temperatures can reach over 120
degrees Fahrenheit the state motto is
Eureka which means I have found it as in
Eureka a parking space if California was
a separate nation it would have the
eighth largest economy in the world did
you know that in 2013 California
produced more than seven hundred and
twenty eight million gallons of wine
California knows how to party the state
bird is the California Valley quail and
he woke up like this
Long's still not sold on California just
look at our flag it's got a freaking
bear on so take a second and be proud
Californians be proud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
