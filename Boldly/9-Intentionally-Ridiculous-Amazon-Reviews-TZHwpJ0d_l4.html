read this Bock and now forget how spell
and use anguish plot was nice a good
story and hot chicks when I get out of
my bitchin 78 Camaro wearing these bad
boys there's no question who the boss
man is I was tired of getting hit on by
beautiful women every time I went in
public and then I bought this jacket
problem solved
be sure to also buy a tub of OxiClean
with us to get the blood and diarrhea
stains out of your underwear clothes
furniture pets loved ones ceiling fans
I bought this pen in air evidently to
write my reports of each day's tree
felling activities my job as a
lumberjack it is no good it slips from
between my calloused gnarly fingers like
a gossamer thread gently descending to
earth between two giant redwood trunks I
was going to give my wife a pair of
diamond stud earrings and my kids we're
going to get an Xbox with Kinect now aha
it's male testicular exam models for
everyone it is day 87 and the horses
have accepted me as one of their own I
have grown to understand and respect
their gentle ways I know that those who
set me will not relent they will send
others in my place but we will be ready
got this for my birthday in January and
haven't pooped sense someone recommended
another type of gummy bear that might
help with that wonder if I could get
those on here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
