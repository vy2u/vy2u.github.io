should model up no no but you're so tall
people love to talk about the negatives
of being tall and I mean honestly who
can blame them between trying to sit
comfortably at a desk cramming your
knees in the back seat of a car and
failing so hard at piggyback rides it
can be a lot but I think it's family
talk about how awesome being tall really
is first of all you can see over the
crowd at concerts you can be right front
and center you don't miss a thing and
you're great at how you you were pretty
much made for it well do your super hug
and then there's the fact that people
wear heels all the time in an effort to
look taller Earl hey really
you're still taller than me girl you
don't even need heels
you already look fabulous shotguns
riding shotgun your game it is not your
fault that back seats are tiny you
always get the front okay that's it back
there might as well control the music
while you're at it and if that's not
cool enough you can always reach the top
shelf no prob if you want something you
get something and chances are you have
long legs which means you get places
quickly you can wear long flowy dress
this without worrying about tripping and
crop tops are back in style which is
great considering that pretty much every
t-shirt is a crop top on you anyway so
there you have it being tall is pretty
awesome and next time someone tells you
that you're blocking their view just let
them know you are the view no way you
like
yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
