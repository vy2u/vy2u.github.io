teach her is how to ride horses it's
something I did as a child and I think
it's something that can teach children
discipline and self-control and
coordination and concentration and she
would just make the cutest little
cowgirl I mean come on Korean cowgirl
look at the boots
it was a big move from New York to
California one thing I want him to learn
about that is you know to adapt help
cultivate him to become a better person
become a better student become a better
player become a better citizen I
definitely want to teach them how to be
independent be strong mentally
physically you know I got to teach them
if there's something that you've
identified you want to do go for it give
it a shot you know if you fail you learn
from it you move on and the other thing
that I want to do is instill with them
like a sense of adventure and excitement
and exploration you know don't ever lose
that first thing one is for them to be
happy I really hope that they have that
fire in your belly and go out there and
own the world I want to teach you how to
play basketball
money management play piano respect work
hard definitely teach my kids to cook
I'm teaching them things as far as
trying to discover how something works
for instance if she wants to earn
something she can save up the little
pennies that we may give her but she can
get it then she quickly realizes that
that has value they're so smart and they
learn so much so fast so you have to be
very intentional with them having the
ability to have the information right
there that I think is a grand benefit in
itself because it's it's limitless I
almost understand that you know our job
in the world is to give back whatever
gifts my children have I want them to be
able to be feel comfortable with
expressing it let your child be a child
you know don't make them grow up so fast
it's the one chance you get to kind of
be a child again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
