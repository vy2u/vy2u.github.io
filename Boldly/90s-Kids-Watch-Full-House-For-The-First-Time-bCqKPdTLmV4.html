Francisco and we're all family
yeah I've never seen it I don't know
what it is the kid would be like you got
it dude and that's why I didn't watch it
so this is the middle child right
Stephanie
classic middle child trying to drive the
car am i right this will not end well
well right into the kitchen
Oh what kind of a household is this that
like the youngest child is the first one
to come in after a car is just coming
through the kitchen Jesse wants to get
laid you know what I love when a sexy
girl comes into my room a laugh track do
people get nightmares from watching this
show because I think I might tonight you
don't want your family showing up in
your sex dream no what's that the dead
Mama's backers of the prostitute you
need serious psychological evaluation oh
god no John Stamos must have woken up
every single day of his life and just
like kissed the mirror and been like
thank you so attractive I feel like he
would have been my childhood crush if it
wasn't Arnold from Hey Arnold the babies
are naked Oh weird
oh so this isn't a parody of anything
this is really in the show great
hairstyles feel like we should bring
some of that back it feels like a parody
of itself maybe that's because it was
really influential for for the time and
it was important I can respect that or
maybe it's just really really bad we may
never know if I'd known that it was this
crazy maybe I would have watched it when
you're with your friends and your family
and doing please and but where you look
and everywhere you go that's all I yeah
I know these lyrics are completely wrong
but I don't
