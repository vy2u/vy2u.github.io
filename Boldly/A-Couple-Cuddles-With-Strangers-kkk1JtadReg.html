our favorite thing to do we get super
into it
cuddling is definitely super intimate
there are a lot of factors that you have
to be okay with when you're cuddling
breathing patterns body scents or odor
hopefully not you're really up in there
I'm the big spoon but I do like to be
the little spoon sometimes we don't know
much about what's happening they all
thought kittens were gonna be involved
or puppies or puppies doesn't look like
that's gonna be a thing go ahead I'm on
safe so cuddle sanctuary is a workshop
and a social experience where human
Healthy Touch is welcome never required
people who enjoy cuddling or perhaps for
whatever reason could use a cuddle it's
a good place for them to go some people
just want there to be more community and
connection between people inches school
yeah right this is great I'm a hugger
I'm probably gonna hug everybody
you can't we practice saying no I'm
gonna ask to touch your arm I need you
to say no thank you to me may I touch
your arm no thank you
mother who here is at a cuddle event for
the very first time in their life we're
going to begin with some stretching body
responds women touch just shift your
attention if you get an erection or a
correction Elizabeth
so without further ado the kaabah
laboratory
the
the beginning I was pretty nervous not
really my space to give a lot of
physical contact to strangers when you
hear like the cuddle party you literally
only think about spooning or intense
cuddling and it's just so much more than
that I have lots of opportunities to
cuddle outside of here but there's
something about coming to this community
and feeling connected the only goal was
to support and be supported it was like
friendship yoga you know it was just
like for yourself but also for other
people and just living in the moment
yeah but I had a great time I just love
being around kind open-hearted humans
yeah maybe one day you'll attend a
cuddle workshop by yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
