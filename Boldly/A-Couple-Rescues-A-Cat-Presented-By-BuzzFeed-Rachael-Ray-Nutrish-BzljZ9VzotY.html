pizza I love cats and pizza Oh Terrance
you mentioned pizza first Meghan will be
a great cat no question and I think he's
gonna be a really good cat dad we have a
lot of stuffed animals that she treats
like living things already so actually
having a living thing will be great I do
want to teach it how to use the toilet
I'm definitely a dog person but cats
gonna be cool gonna be like hey here's
some food like survive on your own for
like few days we're not gonna leave the
cat alone for a few days what we could I
don't know it's gonna happen dad that's
the whole point of a cat
I might have to retract my cat dad
statement um I don't know now I'm be a
good cat dad man Perry's place is heaven
on earth sanctuary rescue it's always
the number one option adopt don't shop
every day is super awesome super
rewarding so we received your
questionnaire online let's meet some
cats homie

thing that's going on right now he knows
how to work it
crush you now maybe I have a friend
runner in this room
I'm gonna stay here forever
want to make sure we don't make the
decision based on cuteness but these
cats Rick I did have this kind of cat
like my head you want a kitten
yeah I think we're gonna get great fun
factional
slave
look at you love you favorite place and
he's reading his stroke he was just very
friendly from the beginning like he came
out of you know hiding and played with
us and was very sweet we picked the
perfect cat originally its name was
crush and he was like you know Phoenix
like orange like fire and I was like
your Phoenix hates me make sounds like
that sounds right I'm surprised by how
little I want to do anything other than
play with this cat the whole thing is my
favorite part it feels great to be a cat
parent I feel like I've inserted this
like secret Club I don't understand why
we didn't do it earlier like I guess I
just thought like having a cat like in
my head was just like this huge big deal
but now that we have it and we have this
cat in particular it's just like this is
great
I'm pretty sure the cat likes me better
I'm just saying that is not true look up
in my arms it did not it definitely did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
