you cool
have you guys been hypnotized before
never it's this like psychedelic at all
hypnosis is a very natural state of
being during this very higher awareness
state where you're so relaxed that you
feel wow I feel wonderful and I just
don't really care what's really
happening and that's when we flood your
mind with the suggestions so let's take
you into a little bit of a state of
hypnosis all you have to do now is close
your eyes as your eyes are closed I want
you to focus only on my boys feel your
body relaxing collapsing into that chair
as you go deeper and deeper now one two
and three eyes open hi guys hi hi cookie
I'm gonna sit over here look at me I
mean no sleep party
let it go way down you're gonna be the
hypnotist now you can tell him anything
you want him to do okay you ready you're
the hypnotist go upon awakening when I
suggest the words Charlie Chaplin you
will do a tiny seated tap dance one two
three wake up Charlie Chaplin Charlie
Chaplin stop can you do this Charlie
Chaplin only while he's awake Charlie
Chaplin one two three wake up Charlie
chocolate chip it up with you should I
enjoy this I think a little much that
was the most nuts thing I've ever
experienced
felt like I was aware wasn't sure why I
was there I was just kind of accepting
it kind of my personality to not
question what's going on that's true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
