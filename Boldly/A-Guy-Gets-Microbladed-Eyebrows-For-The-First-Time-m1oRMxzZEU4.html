that came out wrong I'm so sorry I'm
Kane and today I'm getting my eyebrows
micro bladed why am I doing this three
reasons first reason I saw a video with
Freddie doing it she looked really good
after I wanted to try it
reason number two I've taken some
Instagram photos lately I couldn't tell
what shaved my eyebrows were reason
number three there were three things
that my mom told me never to do get a
tattoo get anything pierced and do
anything to my eyebrows I already did
one of them so why not another growing
up I never ever thought about my
eyebrows recently a makeup artist really
really wanted to shape my eyebrows and I
had to say no cuz I was still imagine my
mom like pointing down at me don't do
anything with your brows I'm afraid it's
gonna be a shape that I don't light and
so I'm gonna permanently look sad bored
or excited how did I find the person
that's gonna do an Instagram on the
explore page
I saw a singer youtuber Joey diamond get
micro bladed I thought it was really
cool that a guy was doing it because
normally it's all women performing this
service now we're gonna talk to Jonathan
Paul and hopefully he'll soothe my
nerves my name is Jonathan and I am a
micro blading artist how long have you
been doing it a little over a year now
I was always obsessed with eyebrows for
some reason I am always staring in
people's brows giving them a little mini
like brow makeover in my head when I
came in he was already like trying to
figure out okay what am I gonna do to do
your brows yeah
the consultation what do we do now
I'm looking at your brows you have a
good base you have a good front so all
I'm gonna do is to enhance the shape
that you already have yeah adding more
density especially with my men's brows I
will do like minor cleaning but I
generally love to leave hairs at the end
because it gives it a more natural
finish and that's the key to like making
men's brows look very natural not so
overdone how long is the process like
what happens now you start the numbing
so I known for about 25 minutes I'm so
glad that this is all it is I thought
you were gonna stab me with the needle
no no no this is a topical anesthetic
will I feel it go no go a little bit of
something you're gonna look gorgeous
good guy and I do men's brows I make
sure that they have like a good base to
work with just long as you do have some
brow then it's easy to work with you
come in and it's super sparse if I work
on that and say that the strokes don't
heal as clean it may look a little
obvious
Oh Micro bleeding is a semi permanent
tattoo it can last anywhere from a year
and a half to two years depending on
your skin type depending on like your
lifestyle or most people will get you
know like an annual touch-up a color
boost just to keep it looking fresh I've
noticed that people would dry your skin
they have the best you know he'll result
it stays much longer people with oily or
skin it maybe stays about a year so I
just drew out the bordering shape okay
so it's gonna look a little intense I
just don't want to look scary yeah do I
look angry I think for this I have to
dress you here we go okay oh is it
that's it after getting it done it will
be dark for a few days and then it will
go through light flaking sometimes
scabbing after it flakes and it peels
it's gonna be light then it gets dark
again it's a weird healing process
wash them two times a day and then I
have a cream that I give you that you
apply right after you just want to keep
the wound clean we don't want any
buildup of dry blood leftover ink we
need it to be clean so that it heals
properly so males are now looking for
like a more natural like alternative men
do you want thicker brow sometimes but
they don't want that makeup look
you know you have the brow pencil but
like it looks obvious micro bleeding is
perfect for men because it gives it a
natural finish without it being obvious
okay feeling nervous but good yeah
I'm imagining it looking like a caveman
just to prep myself
you might freak out but you have a shape
now you're gonna love it
okay and keep in mind like already it's
starting to get dark because it's
already starting that you know strokes
are starting to swell up a little they
are tiny incisions okay so keep in mind
by the minute they're gonna get darker
and darker the lines are gonna look
thicker okay all right we're doing the
reveal my heart's beating so fast okay
okay okay whoa I look like a cartoon
character but like not in a bad way whoa
like I said it's already starting to get
dark yeah The Strokes are starting to
yeah expand a bit right yeah and as you
could see it kind of has like the
reddish tone around it it's because it's
a little bit inflamed which is all gonna
calm down yeah maybe even by tomorrow
morning they may be a little bit swollen
so you look super animated I mean it
looks good the shape looks good
I like how dark it is now it's pretty
much your shape for just more enhance my
eyebrows are in high definition
yep that was so fast this is my first
day back at work with my new eyebrows I
didn't realized how nervous I would be
the first few people that I saw they
were kind of shot but not in a nice way
I feel kind of self-conscious about it
like walking around I'm like avoiding
eye contact if I didn't know you I might
think it's normal
but says
your regular eyebrows I'm gonna keep
laugh at you it was the first thing I
noticed when you turned around and it
was like ripening we structured it fits
your face perfectly hit a lot too dark
the fact that she was so excited about
the meet me feel more comfortable about
it they are kind of thick right now I
the other people who got a microwave and
I know and I'm like oh my god don't look
at me pretty much yeah oh that's taking
care I don't go that way
they look really good I want to touch
something like it will it hurt their
very shape okay they are very shape
Freddie you were my inspiration I think
they look great I think you were worried
about them looking too bushy or do
manicure but I think they look really
good I can really tell like on camera
and it like pops what do you think well
I know I know
hey not for now my song you don't eat
mum wanted longer maybe squeeze lighter
hello I don't have any ID now I wait for
later mom would you do it right now tada
I like it yeah listen you just shaved it
it looks a lot darker lighter totally
not even I would do that you would do it
I have missing spots like all over yeah
mine didn't have the end yeah I don't
have that either I'm starting to get
just this middle patch it looks natural
yeah keep tell will have it to my
eyebrows I got it my chrome plated why
are you looking mine before wow it looks
different look it's very evening right
that's worldly seeing what
yeah I'm like sitting with my grandma
and she totally noticed my micro
bleeding even though I didn't tell her
she thought I drew it in Hawaii King huh
before way more Neto just enjoy our
eyebrows like and in the same spot money
doesn't go to Munna how far waiting man
okay uh-huh
so it's been about three weeks and I
came back home okay now maybe not to
around here I like it yeah yeah would
you do it yeah so uh maybe later don't
need to talk and look natural okay
success fix it
my eyebrows have pretty much faded to
the color that will be overall I love
them I a hundred percent would do it
again I feel like I look a little
younger it frames my face better
it looks better in photos especially
when I do like side shots ads like
intention to my face like I know what I
want it makes me more expressive to I
think the reactions were super mixed in
the beginning because it was so much
darker but right now everyone just says
it looks natural most people can't even
tell I did anything a lot of people
can't even remember what it used to look
like then people just get used to it and
assume that these have always been there
my grandma said guys look stronger with
thicker eyebrows too never thought about
my brows before what do you guys think
would you do it how do you think these
look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
