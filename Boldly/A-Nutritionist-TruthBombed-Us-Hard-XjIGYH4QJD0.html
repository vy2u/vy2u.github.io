I'd say I'm in the top 10%
I don't think about the nutritional
value of the food that I eat no in
general I don't think I eat healthy so
for a week I wrote down every single
thing that I ate and no matter how small
was like a small piece of chocolate 2
meals I think they're gonna be really
surprised I think a lot of people think
that they healthier than they do and
when they see it on the table they're
really shocked
I don't feel like I'm gonna be overly
shot hi I'm Christy I'm key this is what
you eat a lot of colleges mostly seems
coffee how does the my biggest thing
when I was looking at it was like wow
it's you know a lot of liquid but it's
not yes a lot of drinking all the
liquids it it really surprises me and
also makes me say it's like you should
be more hungry than you know yes so this
is what you ate over the course of the
week this looks about right
there's a lot of chicken and that's
that's right so this is
representation of what you mean so the
other thing that I that I think we
should mention here is that you have the
highest calories everyone and you're
actually about yeah we're actually about
over 5,000 calories more than sort of
happening okay so with this amount of
food why is it like for instance your
sugar so high so this is the amount of
sugar you ate the mood this is the
amount that you should Wow well not all
at once the extra sugar is coming from
your uncle I just would like to say for
everyone I had three birthday parties no
now this was I was really uncrashable
with the amount of fat that you had for
the week this is only like double of
that though only and then this is the
amount that you had mm-hmm switch some
of the stuff out and suddenly you've got
less calories of fat and a better
quality well what year of my life do I
need to start eating better about three
years ago here is the amount of green
leafy vegetables that you have a week I
want you to have that
that's one of the day all of this I
could have this many a week what do you
think it's very good on a scale of one
to healthy what is my scale based on
this week yeah I just I feel like I
should be doing better with my my life
right now
like I I talked a big game going in she
didn't make any direct comments on my
beer intake though she just sort of
sighed and I'll take that as a
passive-aggressive you're gonna do what
you're gonna do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
