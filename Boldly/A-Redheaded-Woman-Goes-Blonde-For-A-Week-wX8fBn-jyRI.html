horn sawed off
I'm Jordan Coburn and I'm a redhead this
week for the first time in my life I'm
going to live as a blonde I've never
dyed my hair fully ever my kind of red
is more fiery I would say yeah I don't
think I've ever had a moment where I
didn't like having it stands out I'm
pretty loud generally it definitely fit
my face and personality it's nice to
look in the mirror and see something
that matches with how I feel on the
inside my name is Gigi hair stylist
today I'm kind of nervous I thought
about just running away when I just went
to the bathroom and not coming back but
I'm gonna do it I'm ready we do the full
highlights and then we do the dominant
color at the same time I've been to a
hairstylist before and I asked for just
a blonde streak and the stylist wouldn't
do it I think redheads are unicorns when
you told me you were making this video I
was pissed did not want you encouraging
that kind of behavior I personally would
never die my hair I've never dyed my
hair when I was asked about dyeing my
hair I said no I've always been nervous
about getting back to the original color
I think when Lindsay Lohan dyed her hair
blonde my life fell apart in society
she's redhead they think of the words
white exotic sunburned freckles Irish
leprechaun when society sees the blonde
if they're gonna think anything I think
it's swans have more fun dumb which is
not cool hot popular Britney's people
identify a lot of my personality with my
hair family and friends are gonna freak
out they're probably gonna give me a lot
of crap about it both of my
grandmother's have red hair both online
long side and my dad's side
second-generation red because it skipped
a generation of my parents my parents
have blonde hair and black hair and then
I have red hair and my sister has red
hair and then after she's ladies till we
Dinks off and then check the cutter and
we do toner leans off and bro dry her
hair there's such a camaraderie between
gingers I would just Starbucks the other
day actually and there was a redhead
that was taking my order she didn't even
ask her my name she just wrote on my cup
fellow gingers and I started doing
stand-up comedy when I used my red hair
kind of a lot in my job
skooby fine I'll work it out I had a lot
of old people always coming up to me
telling me like oh my gosh I love your
hair never changeable but here I am so
sorry old ladies so we just finished and
dyeing and starting hair it's been about
six hours I'm nervous yes oh my god holy
cow
the color is super blond I did not think
it was gonna be this blonde I look like
a Barbie my parents are gonna freak out
I can't believe it I have to change my
name to Brittany this week I'm gonna
show all my friends and family and then
I'm gonna upload pictures to Instagram
Facebook I was super confident in who I
was as a redhead and now I have to
refine kind of Who I am as a blonde
I miss my hair a lot though honestly
right now and I'm kind of sad about it I
feel like my grandparents are gonna be
very upset I hope they're not offended I
just got my first compliment from a
stranger on my hair so it was like you
have great hair this is exciting for me
have been friends for 18 years thank you
we're both gathered did you ever think I
would dye my hair with my first day of
work as a blonde
the first weirdness of people totally
not even recognizing me I posted some
pictures of my blonde hair on social
media lately it's a big change people
are liking the crap out of it feels so
popular drastically for me little like
things is getting more likes than any
sort of thought-provoking status I have
ever posted but you know I guess I was
how the world works I'm kind of
frustrated right now like I was walking
into work and I got
called really aggressively I probably
get catcalls maybe five times a week as
a redhead but it's not as aggressive as
this guy's was he just wouldn't stop he
had a girl with him she like eventually
stepped in and asked him to stop but it
took really long I don't know if that
was me because she saw that as just like
a typical blonde girl maybe blondes have
it worse though in terms of societal
images and a little bit discouraged
about what it's like to be a female
period I'm at work right now the
reactions are kind of starting to die
down people that I work with from a
day-to-day basis have seen it so it's
not as much of a shock to them a lot of
people though performing at the club
that haven't seen me a little bit some
of them just like don't even recognize
me what do you feel bad for blonde hair
oh that's blowing my mind other people
are asking me when are you gonna dye
your hair back or you dyeing it back and
you're gonna leave it on for a little
bit my family is calling they're gonna
see my hair for the first time it's not
like bleach blonde or anything seeing
your red hair makes me sad it makes me I
said Jackie do you feel like you watched
something so jealous just looking at
your hair and let it grow out and cut it
all off it's just kind of a routine I
willing used to it I thought it was nice
that you and Jackie didn't do that did
you choke her I mom what did she say
yeah that's really not a big deal
stand-up comedy it hasn't felt any
different I've actually got to
incorporate the blondness now into the
act that's been fun doing fits on that
people comment on my hair for sure less
actually overall normally at any given
week I'm getting at least three to five
people that are like I love your hair
never die having a hard time
conditioning it though to the degree
that it needs it's been really good for
me to see my whole identity doesn't
change just because I changed my hair
color I was worried that my red hair was
the one thing that made me me I can't
speak for the strangers that see me as a
blonde on the street but all of my
closest friends and my co-workers and my
family their opinions of me haven't
changed at all I was worried about that
for some reason and I think I'm gonna
keep a blonde actually I'm still me I'm
still Jordan I'm still my own person and
if anyone's a redhead out there that's
never dyed their head you should do it
because it's different and why not
experience different things you know
it's just hair after all
any other things you'd like to say that
could be used in a reaction video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
