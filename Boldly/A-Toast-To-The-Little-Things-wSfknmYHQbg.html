watch on Netflix without even having to
search that bomb to finding a tampon
when you thought you were out to
plugging your phone in just when it hits
1% years to actually waking up arrested
- no one seeing you walk in one
direction because we thought the
Starbucks is one way but then realizing
you were going the wrong way and then
turning around and walking back to the
12th like on Instagram - your favorite
song coming on the radio just as you
turn on your car to the middle seat at
your favorite theater - getting
goosebumps from a beautiful song - exact
change to autosave here's to first
kisses and the wonderful uncertainty of
that moment
here's to candles that smell like
Christmas and really good bagels here's
to that feeling that bubbled up in the
pit of your stomach
yeah here's to that drunken night when
you decided you not to call your ex
here's to laughing so hard that your
stomach hurts and no matter what you
just can't stop two perfectly toasted
toast here's to all the moms who work
three jobs just so their children can
live a different way this is for my mom
who told me the world needs more artists
here's to the person who held the door
for me even though I was walking slowly
here's to my best friend who called me
just when I thought no one would here's
to you and that face you make when you
look at me at my worst and still see all
of the good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
