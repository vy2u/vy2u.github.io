really excited about this I'm really
excited about our March lineup - yeah we
oh my gosh we have some exciting and
some exciting guests March is just an
overall good month and it's also isn't
it st. Patrick's Day somewhere I mean it
is that's my favorite holiday of course
I'm Irish and an alcoholic you're not an
alcohol oh okay um can we talk about my
mergers that get oh my god please okay
guys I was wearing this shirt on the
pond last week if you're on YouTube
concept boldly you saw me wearing it it
said anxiety queen and it is my first
merge that I'm ever launching in
collaboration with an awesome activist
named Kidd Bell so you guys can now
it'll be out when you guys listen to
this you can buy anxiety queen we have
crop tops we have full shirts we have
hats they all think that yeah I'm gonna
give you all you're gonna beanie
no it's a hat oh hell we have like a dad
huh give me that yeah we're donating a
portion of the proceeds to Namie which
is a National Alliance on Mental Illness
which is a great resource for learning
just about like when you go and someone
says they have anxiety or bipolar
borderline depression they know what the
 that is you can go there and learn
about all that stuff could you say that
slower yes name me name me nay me Nami
it's Jamie org I believe so that's where
we're giving part of the proceeds and
then there's just really cool shirts I
think it would be I wear because I want
people to ask me about my anxiety I
don't want people to be like oh you're
just using mental illness to like make
sandhya yeah because this is a cause I'm
like we are super passionate about we
talk about all the time and something
near and dear to my heart 2d stigmatized
and so I think the reason why I wanted
to make it was because I wanted people
to see it and own it and kind of
this
my way of taking back the power of
having yeah being my anxiety that's an
interesting point that you brought about
like oh you're just using it as like
this trend or something which I felt
like that before I've been like oh now
everyone wants to talk about it but when
I was suffering and it's like but when I
was suffering it would have been really
nice yeah yeah and I think the more that
it comes out into the ether and we talk
about mental health and it's not
something we're just like everybody's
anxious like yeah sometimes you're
really going through something you need
to and you know what I realized in
therapy the other day mmm okay so
identifying the problem you know or
identifying the source is only one part
of it and I think if there's such a
stigma and shame to talking about this
sort of stuff then you don't really get
to be like okay you don't get to
recognize the patterns in you and your
behavior so you're only like well it's
because of my anxiety and you'll just
sort of be like okay fine but if it's
like anxiety Queen it's like I know what
this is yes I know that this immediate
fear I'm having about this thing is my
anxiety talking and now I could relook
at it and through the through a better
perspective and be like okay how do I
want to move for yes because I think
that's a lot of times like people kind
of get caught up I used to do I do it
all the time and I'm just sort of like
well it's because of this and because of
that that I don't do this thing that's
like or you acknowledge it and the more
you understand it and well we just have
about it it like you just scare me
because I've mentioned this on the last
podcast that I would get panic attacks
thinking about getting panic attacks
anyway it was like the more I dove into
the science of why your body does
something and like why your chemicals
react a certain way it helped me
understand it and not be so afraid of it
and so I feel like by wearing this and
like owning it and having people not be
afraid of knowing that I have it and
coming up and asking me or talking to me
about it or being able to like confide
in me about their stuff it helps me it
just it makes it feel like oh just
having a cup of tea with a friend
absolutely because it is so common yeah
and I think that one thing is like
people really don't want to feel like
they're not special and I think a lot of
times like shame and anxiety comes from
feeling like you're not special that
time yeah you're unworthy or all of this
sort of so I think it's really important
to to talk about it and to have it on
your yeah and people in like way I do it
too sometimes like I will say like oh
god I having
today and I'll not realise that it's
just because like I had a coffee and
I'll spiral alright you don't have
coffee yeah I don't drink coffee because
I drink a lot of tea and then like some
people feel like oh god I'm being so OCD
right now we're like oh my god she's
being crazy she's so bipolar and we just
say these words like flippantly and I
think by just bringing the word into
conversation more regularly and being
able to be like hey maybe maybe don't
use that word because this is actually
what it means and it's just a
conversation start and I hope you guys
buy it cuz it would really make me
really happy and we're gonna give a lot
of them away - yes baby make sure you
enjoy more than a third place winners
will get your shirt that's a good idea
maybe so if you win you get a shirt yeah

announcements I hope you guys are
excited as we are about them let's take
a quick minute and check in with each
other oh how you doing how are you well
answer me first oh I had a good weekend
I had a good I had a good weekend did
you believe that it sounded like you
were convincing yourself but I mean yeah
you know I I don't know should I tie it
into this thing
I just realized like this is the first
time I've been in a relationship yeah in
a long time
like for realsies and I'm just realizing
the trust issues that I have that are
I'm bringing issues John realizing Wow
 you I well I knew I was a control
freak and I knew I trusted no bitch so
like the fact that I'm look you I think
yeah I tell you everything and that's
new for me like we always talked about
like I never I've always had female
friends but it's always been like one
very like close one I've only had my one
best friend lacy who lives in New York
so it's hard to like I know female
friendships were always just a weird
nuanced thing to me and I felt like I
was missing out because I wasn't in a
sorority I didn't have this like group
chat of girls you know and like I still
I look at your friendship sometimes I
envy like the sisterhood you have with
some people anyways I got a lot of
issues and Bree I'm realizing that I'm
bringing that into a new relationship
and I don't want to and so it was
nothing that like anyone was doing I'm
just becoming more aware that it's okay
to have trust issues can other than be
like well if you if you if you're not
the cool girl if you're not cool with
everything then no one's gonna love you
okay
well I love that you brought this up and
I love your deathly hallows thank you he
got them for he actually he was he
loves that anyway okay I also love the
dynamic between me you and him because I
tried to piggyback off of any nice thing
he does streak I'm like um hello I'm her
best friend you should find these yeah
no we're trying to hey tweet at him add
cat slap and make him bring Kate to
Philly we want to go to Philly Mike he's
gotta pay for it so to meet him so we
can go have a nice vacation with each
other yeah yeah okay man if you can meet
all my friends in Philly yes and we
could maybe do a live podcast looks good
if you go to Temple maybe from Temple if
I can lift it why don't they message me
bitch I went to Temple okay is from
Philly okay I'm not guys no I finally
got to see a map of where Miriam and
where Italy go far but if I okay here's
the thing in my like I love Philly I've
been there a couple times and it has
been my favorite the great city and so I
want to
associate you with that time you know
yeah there I lived there but you don't
know where I'm actually from so no yeah
you're right
but I in my head Philly invokes bear
same place oh there's solar salon okay
but about that about the the trust
issues in being like oh I just want to
be a chill girl or whatever I thought
about this the other morning I was like
wow we could really just beat ourselves
down about being like okay this is
what's wrong with me I don't like this
that and the third about myself I have
to change it we live in our society
where there's very much like cater to
trees as part of you why because it's
impossible yeah and you will never stop
buying products that make you think that
you're on your way to changing as chaos
but the point is is that these are just
the parts of you and you could learn to
work with them yes so like when I
recently thought about this when I have
like a crippling amount of fear because
I said to my therapist I feel like I
bored my therapist the other day because
I was like talking and she was like
listen because I keep saying yep I'm so
scared about this and I have so much
fear surrounding this and she doesn't
she just lets me talk about it and now
I'm like oh right no one's ever gonna be
like okay your fear is gone now yeah so
now you could go do all these things
you're scared people go into therapy
thinking that like oh yeah have a few
sessions and then you're gonna be okay
with whatever you win in oh it's it's an
ongoing thing you could just get to talk
about but I so I came up with this
little mantra now I thought about it
yesterday and I wonder if it could help
you yes please
it's every time I feel scared and I
learn fear which I think this is what
the trust
yes rooted it's here oh absolutely is
that I will stop for a second and try to
not replace the fear because that's
impossible but try to refocus my
attention on a few things that I'm
really really grateful for so even
though feel like if I'm really scared to
like go on a date with someone or be
close to them or something like that I'm
gonna stop for a real sight like really
stop focus on yourself and be like what
are some things that I'm super grateful
for that our mine and that I'm greatly
thankful for Pete and I'm thankful for
my friendships and I'm thankful for this
podcast and my family my health these
are things that I'm like stop for a
second mmm awesome these are my head
because it
really easy when you're feeling fearful
or in my case like insecure it's easy to
go down the rabbit hole of insecurity of
like all the reasons why you know I'm
right in having trust issues rather than
like stopping and going like hey man
anyone would be lucky to be with
me man and if you up that's on
you dog that a owe me and that's what it
really stems from I mean this is a
little bit of a right turn but like I
feel like I was feeling bad even though
I feel like I've done everything right
in the relationship so far like I've
always been honest and upfront about my
feelings and I feel like I why did I
feel bad why do I have to feel insecure
when I'm the one who is liberal
and cool and honest didn't
until I just I felt it felt unfair and
so I just said hey I think we should
spend the day apart I kind of need some
time to just like not be mad at you and
like not be and it's it was me it was
stuff that like see but I say it was me
but it wasn't me you know I mean mm-hmm
okay so I think that let's just address
this real quick let's unpack it I love
they say that all the time like we write
I love it
I love it--and we love you there's no
like okay so sometimes I went into like
I went into therapy the one day I was
just okay I identified all this stuff so
now what why do I have to still feel
this earnest from that part of it but
the truth is is that there is no
guarantee so I think sometimes you try
to combat fear with being like well I
did all of these steps right so I should
should be rewarded but that's just not
how it happens sometimes you just have
to take this leap of faith and be like
okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
try I know that I did everything in my
power yeah to to attain what I want and
it doesn't happen it doesn't happen
there's I'm reading this book right now
mmm Brene brown listen I can't I first
read the gift of imperfection or the
gifts of imperfection
really good the next one in the series
is called daring greatly and it's all
about like stepping into the arena and
the
like you know you're never gonna be
perfect and you're it's there's never
gonna be an invitation the fear will
never go away and it's just about going
in there and being a part of of it and
you kind of like being on the sidelines
and it's really it's really good book so
far how are you doing we got enough
about me how are you doing we did check
in with you
oh I'm do you have a great weekend I did
I did I had a really bad last week and
last weekend quite badly yeah but I but
I realized that it was a lot of me being
like well these things are gonna happen
to me and so now I'm sad and everyone
should pity me no that's hot but that is
how I felt in that salad for a little
bit yeah and now I was like okay let's
just stop for a second and just why
don't you start taking what what would
take care of yourself what would
actually real self care instead of
hiding I do a lot of hiding behind
things so I was like okay I think that I
want to write and I want to I want to
sleep in I want to get myself a couple
nice new shirts yes and so I did yeah
one of them oh it looks good - it's a
nice color for you thank you it's very
Sabrina yeah
so I had a really good weekend and I
hung out with Pete and I slept a ton I
really need a lot of sleep yeah yeah I'm
just I'm good good yeah I'm excited for
you thanks man
you know what makes Kate happy that I
want to just touch on really quickly
Nashville the show and the city it does
when you did that dating show for
BuzzFeed you wanted to go to Nashville
so bad I started it to go to
nationally and then we were just talking
before the podcast started about how
Nashville is the what it's the it's like
the number one bachelorette party city
are you a joke get my ass that sounds
like the best say are you joking my
assets not a joke Oh
are you joking my client what are you
frightened of Lanigan if you want to be
on the podcast I saw him walking down
did you swing I did your phone
I didn't say that I didn't melt so
you're waking he's a guy from Funny or
Die yeah and he has this bit where he
says so you joking my ass and that's
where we got it's hilarious we can't
stop saying it you guys should go watch
his stuff so are you joking my ass the
National sounds like the best
equation given a I went there once I
have friends from Nashville and so I
went down there once for like this it
doesn't matter but I was down there with
my friend Mary and we went to go like
look around the town and we'd stop into
bars so we were just getting like a
little like we were to stay in tipsy all
day let me tell you it's impossible to
just stay tipsy and it is very easy to
stay hami all day because I was like oh
they're like are you guys from it I was
like oh we're from Pennsylvania all the
way from Pennsylvania and then they give
it you a shot like on the house or
someone would buy a plan and I mean
granted it was like Monday during the
day so anyone who's in a bar yeah please
get drunk but they were like those shots
were like freakin this there were half a
cup of didn't have a shot dude it was
yes it was crazy it was in the
summertime so we were slit did we need
to go down there I really want to go I
know I have friends there - you'd love
them I tried me and my best friend Lacey
we try and do this thing every year
where we meet up somewhere like because
she lives on the east cuz I'm a West
Coast so we wanted to be our thing was
to go to Nashville this year but then it
was too expensive so now we just booked
their tickets to go to Portland I'm
playing before you're gonna I had for
the dating show oh my god and that's
where that guy was from from the very
first episode remember that guy was just
gonna go and have a bunch of sex yeah
let me the dick pic in the net now we
haven't talked oh my god was that the
dick pic that we set started this whole
podcast the dick pics that started the
podcast there's a cherry girls here
sighs okay
where we cover your face you know her
from the internet she is a content
creator and worked and pushed me for
five years five years yeah a long time
you want to say the announcement that
you've gone he's down he's freaking calm
but you care right now here later and
bigger and better things I just heard
you on Grace's podcast yes and grace was
here yes and then graces your world so
you guys should go listen to Ashley's
dinner because I don't want to like
repeat ourselves of how because you did
such a good job of talking about just
like when you know it's time to flourish
and like flock and like growing and
leaving so it's a wonderful you've
done here but like talk about how is it
scary was it scary to make the decision
to leave oh my god yeah it's just like
basically opening yourself up to
rejection that's what I'm what I'm doing
leapin is always a hard thing but at
some point you start to feel like a
fifth year senior yeah literally like
I've been here five years and I didn't
recognize like half the people who were
here and you know it also just felt the
biggest thing actually that made me
realize it was time to go besides my
contracting yeah I I did that dance
video and I realized that it was that
was a thank you that was the first time
I had been scared in like two years
yeah because I had just been doing this
so long yeah and that even though things
like seemed scary to other people it's
kind of our jobs to like be making
videos of doing stuff but that dance
video I was terrified out of my mind the
dancer she's talking about will linkit
it was where you tried to learn how to
dance in 30 days but not just like dance
you sexy dance sexy it was
basically Flashdance like and I didn't
know a soul that day that I was wearing
like
low-cut halter that she did this thing
like that if their whole budget like a
pelvic pop we're getting a more
pop you pop your on I did indeed
walked her back up I feel like - in our
industry it's a really scary and
exciting time right now jasmine and I
feel like it it's confidence boosting
cuz it's like oh I feel like I could
finally leave you know the system and
kind of be my own thing but then you get
out there and you realize like there's a
million women trying to do the same
thing I yes I've been auditioning now
and it's it's like Lalo and you just sit
in the room ethnically ambiguous people
and you're like okay cool I literally as
an audition and the woman picked up the
phone like at the front and she was like
yeah it doesn't matter as long as
they're diverse yeah and I was like oh
my god Hollywood is crazy and you forget
cuz we're in this like nice little
bubble here I think something that's
interesting too is like learning when to
leave a place I remember there was a
venture capitalist who came to BuzzFeed
and she worked at Google first yeah she
was one of the first like 100 or less
than employees at Google
Wow and then she left and her parents
everyone thought she was crazy because
like why would you leave she's like well
it just grew beyond what it felt like in
the beginning and there's no more it
just at some point a company becomes
just a business and it's not the growing
part of it and then she went to Facebook
same thing one of the first hundred
employees she was and yeah now she's a
very important venture capitalist she's
fine she's fine
but she also had that moment of like I'm
gonna leave and I kind of I have that
now with like relatives and people being
like why did you leave buzz be now that
people finally know it BuzzFeed is their
yeah why would you ever be position but
you know what you don't listen to this
morning yes I whether I had listened to
it you listen to it which one did you
have a round I listen to both of the
brené Brown listen you can hear right
now I feel about brené Brown rock and
lover and she's on Oprah's podcast as a
two-parter
but listening this morning to the
Pocahontas soundtrack oh she seems just
around the Riverbend yes do I choose
smooth this course yes the beating drum
should I marry kocoum it's all my I do
we kept with us on you yeah we for sure
what's what's the forty it's like that
what do I use is so it's like a lot of
people choose the smoothest course
because they're never gonna go see
what's around the Riverbend because it
might be waterfall or jagged or scary or
something like that maybe it's a dead
end you don't know and so you're like
I'll just choose this nice which is
totally fine that's what some people
want but sometimes I think if you if you
want the adventure and what got you into
this business is like that excitement
and like that feeling of a new idea and
be like yeah I want to do some yeah and
being like just excited about it having
all this energy that comes with
excitement
then that's what you got to follow it
even though I just want to Pocahontas
dammit your local really easy to to get
comfortable like you were saying where
when you're in a job where it's a steady
paycheck you're getting paid like every
two weeks you have health insurance and
like the culture here is really fun you
know like we have a lot of parties
there's a lot of events to go to young
fun people young son talented people
yeah like your friends or I mean you had
a lot of friends you're here and it's
like and you're wonderful as we pray for
my bread no I think it's really
easy to get comfortable to a place where
you're like yeah this is what I want
yeah when you were talking about like
the whole reason why we got into this
business is because I think in a weird
way we're all like kind of Hustler's
like that never gets taken away no
matter what your paycheck looks like or
what your Instagram following looks like
is that you always feel like you could
be doing more but how do you balance
between feeling like you're not doing
enough and that you are enough wow this
is my life right now in the
months since I've left I've realized
that I am super bad at like feeling
feelings welcome to the podcast
I like all I I'm soo I have literally in
my pocket I put it over there I
constantly just carried two
lists around would say and I realized
that like every time in the car every
time I have a second all I'm thinking
about is what I need to do how I could
be improving like wow my Spanish should
be better I'm gonna take Spanish classes
I need to learn how to dance I don't
feel comfortable so I'm trying to
constantly optimize but it's exhausting
to be a human and try and optimize
yourself all the time and so I think I'm
trying to like figure out bigger life
philosophies that ground my
decision-making so that I'm not
constantly just trying to be 1% better
at everything that I am oh my god you
really need to because Ashley died we
hung out the other day then we went
shopping you're not because Chloe got
these clothes right those great update
um but we I told her about what I just
talked about earlier daring greatly
donate brown and it talks about the idea
of like we live in a never enough
Society and like we're not ready yeah I
like never this enough number that and
I've never seen it I've never pretty
enough never original never successful
and havin all of these things and we
wake up always never being enough yeah
and II that even comes down to which is
pretty crazy like she put it down in it
like it felt like it kicked me in the
chest she was like and that never enough
then turns into a criticism and advice I
know it was like because like that's one
thing that I like and I feel like you're
really good at an advice to do is like
it's sort of like oh I could I could put
this advice out there for you but that's
really just coming from a critical an
event to a point
and not in a bad way it's like a the
lemonade of the lemons that you were
given but it doesn't necessarily like
that's why we people why can't you take
your own advice
it's like cuz I'm not that nice I have
the judgemental inside my own head I'm
nice to you advice goes to you but I'm
judging ya judging myself it really is
hard to just be a human being
yangyang is the hardest part it's so
much easier to be a human doing write
that down you had a really good
feat that you showed me this morning
that was like how it's so expensive to
be alive and I'm not even having a good
time I have to find out who that was
little quote we yes
that went viral she's hilarious uh yeah
but it really is and then I think we
make ourselves well I know I do at least
I make myself feel bad when I'm not
operating at a hundred percent but what
that really does is then it creates
these weeks at a time where I'm only
functioning it like 50 percent rather
than being like okay I need to just take
this time and like or unless you get
sick and your body literacy I love
getting sick because it's proof that
you're just a person and literally your
body when you're sick there's nothing
you can do to make it cold go faster
except nothing you have to sleep you
have to do something yeah thank you
liquids and yeah and that's the
opposite of every way that I live my
life is like there must be something I
can do to get better and honestly like
sickness is a reminder that sometimes
the thing that you can do to get better
is just rest mm-hmm what's something
that you could tell us like what have
you been doing that you're really
excited about because I saw I've seen
some tweets about a podcast yeah I've
seen you working with another BuzzFeed
employee that used to work here Amanda
Holland who had what's it called she
girl ship TV girl ship TV yeah check out
that YouTube channel for sure what else
have you been doing because you seem
like you're everywhere you got
your fingers all in pots I do I have an
audition tomorrow
I've been did auditioning a lot for
stuff which is I'm sorry to your exams
probably I don't get any of the parts am
I going to meet you I the weird part
about this period of time
is that I have to just put it out there
and be uncertain and I have not had that
for five years if I wanted to make
something happen at BuzzFeed I knew who
to email what to do about it and how to
make it happen
I am now just like trusting myself
trusting my work trusting that I'm good
enough like it's bringing up all these
insane insecurities that I did not
realize I had because I just have to be
like you know what I can do this yeah
and if they don't pick me it's not about
me it's just part of this process but I
am like I'm currently I have a book
proposal out I have I'm starting to
write like Henry lover and I are writing
a movie oh my god Henry used to work
here too great incredible filmmaker yeah
just kind of everything I'm like doing a
little bit of everything but then also
nothing active lately no one is paying
me to do anything I just scary right
because you go from having like I said
paycheck to like now you if you don't do
something you're not getting paid that
yeah because we're so fast here yeah so
fast there were times when like I mean
even with unfortunately my god right
that it was a week okay yeah a week both
series yeah who seasons of actually
Syrian and it was just and then before
you know what ash is like putting
together we're putting together cast
list we're putting it's like before you
it's boom it's shadow and then shooting
all all day but I feel like you're so
used to being like you know in this
environment in the digital media
environment there's really no time for
patient patients actually will will set
you back the weirdest thing if you guys
have had any generals before do that is
so in general for people who don't know
it's just a meeting that is just to see
how you it's like a weird first
date yeah but there's no at least our
first day like are we gonna kiss or
whatever on a generally you just meet to
see if you click and then maybe in three
months they'll call you me like we like
you and you're just sitting like what
what did I say we are here for them you
don't know whether to pitch yourself did
I say that what I love about you is like
you're confident in and not only
pitching yourself at what seriously when
I first started BuzzFeed actually was
like one of the first people to be
friends with me and she had been a
veteran and I was like wow like she's
got her so together and then
getting to know you you you were like I
don't know what I'm doing I'm just kind
of doing it and see it actually man so
you make it and like you I wouldn't be
in meetings with you and just my mouth
would be jaw open I just like are you
 kidding me you would sound so
smart and eloquent and she just took
charge of the room and what you were
saying when you're talking about going
auditions where it's like kind of wild
wild west and you don't really
and I was gonna say is what I loved
about your confidence that was something
I learned and was also a good piece of
advice someone gave me once whenever and
especially if any of our viewers are
going through like job changes or
auditioning for some weird reason or
whatever the people in the room weird
reason well I don't know any of us but
like I think I just is an interview
as an audition yeah is that the person
in the room wants you to be the person
yeah like the casting director wants you
to be math person it makes their job
easier and stay with going in job
interviews I think we get really nervous
especially as women to be pitching
ourselves to go in there and go look at
all these great things I am and can do
but they what they want that they want
to be the best person for the job
yeah and I also think that it sometimes
it becomes a reflection of our word so
like who we are or something like that
but that's just not true it's just not I
don't know we've been on the other side
of casting and interviewing her honestly
sometimes it's there the an amazing
actor and a great person yeah it's just
not the part it's not the right part
it's not the right fit yeah I've also
just been trying to like I really do
believe I don't really believe like in
God per se like capital G but I believe
that like the universe and you're
talking about Paula Kyle from the
alchemist like the universe conspires in
your favor and there is some kind of
sense of I actually like that I don't
have control right now it was you have
control over how you react you think and
that sort of like the first biggest
lesson that you could do is like cuz I
also like same thing I've been with you
in meetings I've been like all
these large what are you talking yeah
that's what it's always so funny to be
done like the outside to see someone be
like you know you know you're great
right you know that you're great there's
not it's so funny because it's we always
think we have to learn more and put more
in we just have to like trust what's in
there and yet learn you're doodle you
know but in taking on yourself I
see this a lot where I'm a free taking a
 on yourself taking ID show me oh
yeah
we don't shave here I like being able to
give away parts of you to let up someone
else help like so like your manager or
your agent you just fully have to now
trust someone else to take a big role in
a big arm in your career and to me it's
like well if I'm not the one in the room
and I'm not the one sending the email
I'm not the one talking on the phone
than half it's not gonna go to I know
that they're people you have to trust
the universe that people want you to win
the other thing that I would say though
is like you have to let that control up
but you actually have to you have to be
the one to tell people who you are
including your managers ages or whatever
whoever is an important part of your
life because if you don't people will
use you and shape you to be what you
want and I have different experience yes
literally oh but you feel like honestly
this thing that Oprah's podcasts I'm
like she is so centered and knows who
she is but it's because she is like
actively practicing knowing herself so
that the world doesn't shake her they
asked her if she was I watched this
interview with Jimmy Kimmel and they're
like are you gonna respond were you
gonna ever respond to Donald trust wheat
and she's like no she literally laughed
out loud like why the hell would I do
that is so gross that doesn't mean any
but she knows who she is yeah him
calling her insecure is like clearly
someone is projecting yeah dude he
honestly I know we don't we don't talk
about him a lot on here I've never used
the word President and then said his
name's yes got into office I refused to
and I it pissed I can't talk about it
without getting like so mad spirally and
I get we do we don't talk a lot about
politics on here just because I think
it's so shoved in our face
because now it's a part of pop culture
which is like supposed to be the thing
that we kind of yeah be mindless -
there's no like safe space I mean you
talk about it I also think that there
it's like there's a weird culture now of
like you're right or wrong yes where
it's completely which is why I'll bring
it back to queer I as many chance again
but I love that they were just sort of
like this is what you think this is what
I think let's try to find our common
ground
we can understand each other that's like
really important because I mean it
doesn't make I don't want anyone to
follow other people blindly anyway
whether it's what I consider right or
wrong yeah I just think that everyone is
so incredibly capable of learning what
they you know what they believe in and
following that and whatnot but I think
with politics the thing that I've come
to it because I get that exact same
feeling it's so hungry I want to like
tweet yeah and things at him and then I
just like take a breath and then realize
that like we all each have only a finite
amount of energy and instead of using
that energy to combat and and and agree
with their agenda or or even just
acknowledge it you use that energy to
put something good in the world like
that's how I feel you know I got you
know this dumb tweets that are just like
fortunes because I realized my feed was
becoming so dark and so and I was like
you know I'm gonna put something funny
into the world and yeah it's not that
I'm not gonna be engaged I still engage
that still but I take breaks yeah also
not okay to have it on constantly
because you will lose your goddamn mind
yeah but I also think it's just like you
know what I'm just gonna actively choose
to not waste my energy on this waste
space and it makes me sad because people
I with and I'm sure you can identify
with this too it's like people also look
to us to say things yeah yeah and like I
worry that and the worst thing I don't
ever want to become like a Taylor Swift
where she's not saying anything yes I
want to kiss either side off or whatever
and she has all those problems but I
like you were saying like we still are
engaged I just don't necessarily always
make it a public thing yeah totally like
I still keep myself in the media we make
is enough of a statement against
everything they believe it I also really
think that sometimes people confuse and
we've talked about this before I think
um that book the what was it the war of
art yeah the art where you know
sometimes you you could be an activist
and an artist or even but then you don't
have to be both yeah I think that's
really important like I don't want Katy
Perry speaking for me no I want her I
want her to keep singing yeah
songs I don't necessarily want but but
then again then there's like someone
like when LeBron James was talking about
them and that one was like maybe he did
a stick to dribble a basketball so I
agree with what he said it's when you
have something that you need to say but
you don't if when you have something you
need to say fantastic where whatever
your platform is do it yeah but
if you feel like you need to say
something because you have a platform
because you have a platform give it to
someone else and I would rather have
other people who actually really know
when they're talking but I'd rather
quote them and say they're stepping and
have them speak and give them them you
know the platform then being like oh it
might be cool to be like a trend to be
an activist now it knows ah this isn't
new my thoughts on all of this they're
not really new yeah so well it reminds
me of the tattoo that you have here stay
in your lane oh yeah yeah it's it says
what does it say cheese in a while yeah
I mean your lane and it's almost like
it's not crossing over into anything
that you don't want to be a part of yeah
yeah that what is it yeah I think yeah
in your lame to me is like don't worry
about sometimes things are bandwagon and
they can be good or bad like but for
instance if you feel like you support
gun control and you support these
parkland students you do not have to
then become the activists
support them support Emma Gonzales vote
don't boot vote
dude that is yeah I find pictures at
home that are just beautiful I retweet
them just a PS voting voting is I think
it's if you can yes um if you are out
there you're like I feel very
passionately about this thing I'm not
going to tell you how to feel or which
way to feel I know how I feel I think
that's very important to get involved
specifically in the midterm election if
you don't like the way things are going
and you want things to change
that's how you could actually make your
solids
I learned that collection yes
Philadelphia right now they just finally
voted to redistricting so we can win six
seats in Philadelphia if you go and six
seats really we only need twenty four
seats we only need twenty four seats to
win back the house
Donald Trump can do none of this so it
is hyper hyper hyper important if you
were 17 and a half right now register to
vote vote wherever you are in the
presidential vote which I feel like is
something that people think okay well
there's one day you know I can get off
to do time it's your governor toriel
raise your Senate seats and Democrats
traditionally don't vote outside of the
presidential races which is why the
Republicans control all houses of
Congress they control 33 governments
yeah that's why we don't live in a
dictatorship we don't have just one guy
saying yes or no to everything we have a
whole like it's a whole system of people
that we also get a say and so if we
could maybe maybe we should like one
week have a photo campaign voter can't
be like a night like we'll go into
different I don't know we'll just have
like an educational sort of thing okay
totally going off of that we want to
involve you in helping us go over a fan
question / update about three weeks ago
on the podcast we've read a question a
cold
yeah question from the girls who wrote
in and I'll just do a quick recap
actually so you can understand who
they're talking to and then also for the
listeners she wrote in saying that her
best friend who is a female and another
male who they were like a trio of three
best friends in high school yeah they
used to her best friend and him used to
date and it wasn't anything serious her
best girlfriend and her best guy friend
you today in high school best guy friend
did shitty things right think he cheated
right oh ah yeah he cheated okay he
cheated on her best friends so they
broke off him from the friendship group
so now it's been ten years since they
were stories yeah she's still BFFs with
the girl okay so the girl in her
whenever aggression he married the girl
is happy in a relationship is gonna be
engaged
in the air she says so anytime they talk
about the guy she always kind of shuts
it down and talk to the one who dated
him yeah the one she dated you know he's
an asshole that it does a guy friend
yeah reached out to her being like let's
hang out they met up and they are
hooking up now but anytime she tries to
tell her best friend anytime she
mentions the same the best friend goes
like oh I don't want it like that guy
and she's just kind of over it yeah how
old how old were they when okay so it is
still I think that's still traumatic
when I'm yeah but it's been 10 years and
so she's afraid she's like do I tell my
best friend
not before well oh yeah but so we told
her that you have to be honest with your
best friend yeah because she did another
relationship she wants you to be happy
and I think the thing that she would be
most upset about is lying like yeah for
sure so now we she heard the podcast we
were gonna call her and she's apparently
got updates for us oh so it could
be good it could be terrible what a
lightweight how fun let's see we also
can't say her name so we're gonna have
to give her a yes sleep what is it in
Sleepless in Seattle
let's just call her caller do your
caller dear caller okay she can give
herself a name hi this is Kelsey decay
and we have our special guest
Ashley Perez hi good can you hear us
okay okay so we're not gonna say your
name
but we want to give you a fake name so
that we can talk about you so we're just
gonna call you
caller cuz this is also the first time
we've ever done this cool yeah okay so
caller yes you're calling now so we've
given Ashley a brief update in the
listeners a brief update of the last two
weeks or three weeks ago when we read
your question and we gave you some
advice
but apparently you've got some updates
for us right girl for you okay so thank
you advice who was helpful
yeah
so and we all became you know the best
friend trio and everything and um he
actually lives with my family good buddy
here because he had issues with his
family mmm though my family loved them
and so we were all just really close we
have some common interests and
everything so yeah for sure we're
friends even after you know I messaged
and so it just got too much for me and I
couldn't you know goodbye to my best
friend about I just feel horrible
no I know I didn't think about that he
mentioned if he had ever asked me and I
didn't think about that all because
that's major as well I told him and I
said yeah you know this is what's
happening I feel really guilty and so I
can't keep doing this I don't tell her
you know you know I kind of yeah so are
you guys still boning no lock twist
I don't I don't want my first boyfriend
to be in another state like he's in
another state and you know I know we
can't go on dates or anything maybe
we'll see each other me about once a
month or something like that but um he's
okay with it I explained to him I said
look you know I don't maybe it's not the
right time he said no it's okay that's
not the game it's not the right time
maybe in the future but um we're still
friends
and so everybody's kind of everybody
knows how do you feel
got that off not so much I still feel
the thigh they know I'd like to go that
long without telling her we were scared
that's okay yeah we all do that and
you knew that's why you reached out yeah
it's okay I don't think you should beat
yourself up about feeling how you feel
that happens all the time when you
least expect it literally no one's
perfect you're just a human yeah it is
really clearly you reached out to her
and we're able to be honest with all
parties cuz now I think the biggest
thing that's scary is you just don't
know until you know you know honesty
like communication is so
underrated like we have people right in
all the time with similar situations or
like you know cheating scenarios or like
emotional cheating or whatever it is and
I feel like so much of this can just
come from being honest and it's a risk I
mean you were taking a risk by telling
your friend you could have you know she
could have reacted a complete opposite
and you could have lost your best friend
but I think being honest and not letting
that we continue to build that's when
that's when does get bad is like
when you keep things in your name Brown
said when shame is like kept in the only
thing that makes shame grow is being
kept inside yeah it's a secret it just
keeps going and then feeling kids good I
think you were really brave by telling
her and I hope you're really proud of
yourself because that's like a really
big step and it's a good it's a good
step in your friendship now you know as
if you're doing everything right and
you're sort of like I haven't made any
mistakes of course that person is gonna
stand by you but I think like a really
really great moment is when you do
something or they do something that just
could make the other one really upset
and could hurt the other one or it has
that potential and then you got
like talk through it and you decide like
no our friendship is more important yeah
we're gonna see each other through all
of this it's so great yeah and also it's
a it's a good step in and you said
you've never had a boyfriend but like
that's also a good quality to have
before you get into a relationship is
the fact that you can be open and you
can be honest and you can recognize when
you make you know quote-unquote a
mistake how you can remedy it and I
think you're a badass and I hope you
 orb yeah like Kate said I hope
you're proud of yourself doesn't feel
emotions it doesn't don't line okay well
we're really happy for you and will you
keep us please update it on your love
life because we're rooting for you I'm
in Orlando all the time I'm from Tampa
so I will hit a bitch up we'll have a
good rest of your weekend and we love
you bye bye
Oh Furman how old is Grace I'm Rico that
B's yes yeah I'm sure you learn
modern-day nørrebro it's just one of
they want it like stuck with me like I
would really wondered how she was do if
you guys like that if you guys want more
caller updates let us know and we'll be
sure to again that's a good segment yeah
yeah you know what else we should do our
new segment and actually you can do take
part in this too is we decided because
you guys are always asking us what we're
reading while we're listening
I figured we're gonna do a little
segment we don't know what it's gonna be
called yet we just wrote down the adult
thing so like each week we're gonna
share one thing that we think is helping
us be better at dull don't with the
one the podcast we might have to yeah so
my what a dull star you take some like
secret drugs no but I should have an
adderall it's Monday okay I have one
thing that I love so much and I've
talked about the guys we podcast
oh yeah which is my favorite podcast
Christina and Korean they came out with
a book called how to be sexually
open in a world that's a shame and all
this stuff and I keep trying to get Kate
to write it or read it and I keep doing
it I keep my dog hearing pages that I'm
like oh I need to come bring this on
podcast but what I've been doing with
this book is me and the DJ my boyfriend
we decided to read a chapter together so
either I pick one out and read it with
him or you picked out alone yeah read
out loud to each other because each
chapter it covers a really like taboo
topic everything from like but stuff not
just girl but stuff but God less stuff I
just wait what I agree and I think it's
beautiful and I don't mean to shame or
judge or anything but it's so on Brad
we're gonna be like my boyfriend I read
each other but stuff but yeah it's just
I couldn't have written it better be
like we are very sexually open I have
zero problems talking about any of this
book has caused us to have conversations
going away and your relationship there
yeah and then we talk about it and it's
been I mean collab boyfriend boyfriend
book club and I want even girlfriend
because they're very inclusive they they
they don't just like gender they're just
really just panes and jeans yeah it's
not just beans and jeans honestly I
think especially if you are in a
relationship and we get a lot of these
emails where
they'll be like I want to have a
threesome with my boyfriend but I don't
know how to like bring up the subject
yeah this book covers everything
heli unintended and it's just a really
good one is helping me become more
communicative and more adult like if you
will those were our quotes that's my
adult thing for the week Kate what's
yours
I'm that I have so many books right now
that I'm like working on finishing a new
book or TV show thinking like but I am
right now I know I brought her up so
many times yeah anyone wants to
tweet brené Brown and see if she will be
on this forget it okay just read
three to end but Rene Browns daring
greatly that's what I'm yes
hell yeah Kate it was like go get it and
then yeah I got it and people that keep
writing in being like I'm sure glad you
talked about her name Brown because
she's like kind of a in our age group I
feel like a more unknown leader yeah
she's great and I also think that there
was like another thing that I've been
trying to remember it kind of goes in
line with her book is that I do these
things sometimes where I look up to
people a little bit too much and I'll
like sort of give them this power I like
I'll put so many other people like
literally everyone on a pedestal so it's
not even like a pedestal is just a level
and I'm like in a ditch you're in a
pedestal you know
and so sometimes I would really get in
the way of like my writing or my like
other things I'll just sort of be like
yeah but it's not what would this person
dig it's funny would that person think
it's funny and then finally I was just
like you know what it's where we'd be
colleagues they don't know I don't need
your approval you know what I mean so
yeah in your lane they do in your lane
actually I guess you what's your adult
recommendation Gabby's recommendation
station temptation station alright hey
Kate and I have a great will tell you
later what our idea baby show is my
biggest recommendation is a podcast
called how I built this oh yeah man it
is about it's basically shark tank but a
podcast for entrepreneurs who have
already made it but the best thing is
that and it's entrepreneurs of every
level the other thing I love
that he interviews men and women equally
so it's not just a dude fast which I
feel like so many of these high dude
fest but um it's amazing because they
talk to like Sara Blakely from Spanx
about how did you get this idea when did
you and the thing that I love the most
is he asked them when did you want to
quit and when were you sure you were
gonna fail oh because they're all
billionaires now and literally they're
all so rich and successful but he asked
like the nitty-gritty questions of like
when were you really not sure that this
was gonna work and why did you why did
you keep going or for a lot of them
they've all had multiple companies and
why did your first company fail why was
it time to let that go and I feel like
that's not always good to just push on
forever sometimes you do have to let
things go but if you're feeling
entrepreneurial and you want to feel
inspired I would definitely recommend
how I'm doing is back when you said the
thing about well most podcasts are dudes
I saw the funniest tweet that was like
was that a party and saw one guy named
Seth with glasses introduce himself to
another guy named Seth with classes and
I got to witness the birth of a bunny oh
that's amazing we wish we could we tell
them what is a revolutionary program
okay it's a reality TV at its finest
reality TV they just die off and turn
its that up straighter like they're
pitching would I go okay here's the idea
of temptation which ties all humans
together relationships and trees in
temptation trees and temptation yes Oh
temptation station is can you get from
one point to your destination with the
resisting temptation yeah you and your
parties are like cocaine no oh you and
your partners start on a train together
and then on your dirty different in all
different car oh and you and every stop
you are faced with a new tenant a
slighter tiny baby mine enemy sac
semicolon
and then what on the end is that you
want to in this game you decide if you
want to still be together if you give
into temptation you don't get up you
don't get to get weight okay you don't
get it get to get off the train
what's your question what if you decide
to do this with your partner isn't that
kind of being like I don't really want
to be with you guys maybe something no
maybe you want what we haven't figured
out quite what the prize is really it's
a different dream vacation oh yeah dream
vacation isn't a specific and if you've
been here yesterday should you get a
vacation okay you're on the same it's
John here Seuss meets Flay bachelor
needed investors ooh temptation station
station can they get to their
destination to take the dream vacation
or will they succumb to temptation this
is temptation stations I am actually
sure to hop on board my name is Kate
it'll all be whispered like okay there
waited all the Boxcar heroin okay okay
now we know else these temptations are
big and you have to break up at the end
it just means that like can you guys get
through all of these temptations to make
it to your destination I feel like the
other couples who actually think they
can do it that's yeah it's like I feel
like I would just be like whatever you
do don't the stripper but it
doesn't have to just be a stripper it
could also be like oh we have a real
like I can't see my heading boyfriend
like one of them could be I can't get it
