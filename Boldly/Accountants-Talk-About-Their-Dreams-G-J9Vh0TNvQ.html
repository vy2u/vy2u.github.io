everybody has a lot of questions for
accountants but I had one question I
don't think they were being asked very
much I'm David I'm PK I'm Jordan my name
is Karen and I'm an accountant
accountant accountant accountant growing
up I wanted to be in the NFL I wanted to
be a teacher I wanted to build robot I
wanted to be a coffee taster I don't
think any account actually chooses to be
an accountant it's kind of destiny most
people assume that accountants are dull
and boring but um we live pretty sweet
and exciting lives outside the office
and in the office I do pay rate
I do time cards all right I do algebra
numbers I don't think you realize how
dope accountants are Oh problem solved
Oh hard math boom what's the best part
about being an accountant
everything every business and
organization needs an accountant you
really actually think when an accountant
does they pay for people's lives I
dominate the numbers all day tax season
is when I realize that us as accountants
we're on the inside and everyone else
they're on the outside tech season is
chaotic it is a time where I get to kind
of flex my numerical muscles and kind of
show people that I'm not all talk tax
season is basically my Superbowl it's
what I was born for it's what I take
every breath of every day for it's the
championship tax season is the
Thunderdome and that's where I belong
I'm proud to be an accountant I mean
it's like this upper echelon of number
crunchers you know it's this elite
Brotherhood and sisterhood you know let
me guess you want to move to Los Angeles
to become an accountant okay well guess
what don't because yeah I'm one of the
very lucky few that have managed to make
it but guess what a lot of people end up
on a slow train back to like city town
accounting is my dream I'm sorry I have
to go
you
you
