my memory I had it for like a week
before my sister or my older sister
threw it in the bushes I'm so glad this
isn't a cake this was my favorite toy
forever I'll tell you all about this
see these that's for if like the penguin
or the Joker is like alongside them he
can kick these out and like sorry I'm
still so excited when I was like seven I
asked for Frankenstein and all of my
aunts and uncles and my parents were
like you should get a doll you should
get a you know and I wanted Frankenstein
so badly and they did the old switcheroo
and put Frankenstein in American Girl
doll and so when I was opening the
present I was like oh and I opened it it
was break it's died cry there was some
weird stuff going on my family and I
woke up one day and my parents had
thrown away all my toys well a lot of
like my Disney toys and stuff it's
always been like a really weird thing
like it seems really stupid but like to
wake up and like something that was like
important to you as a kid just like
isn't there any more back in the day

a boombox this is my little like
recorder I could do everything with the
same I would make my own little like
radio shows with my dad and my mom and I
would do little interviews amazing
thank you it was probably the best
Christmas present I've ever gotten
awesome time of life that I like to look
back on and I just have so many good
memories associated with and it's just
kind of cool to like I don't know like
have that back in my hands right now
