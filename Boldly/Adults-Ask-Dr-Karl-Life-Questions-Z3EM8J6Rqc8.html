Carl what do I do when people keep
asking me when I'm going to get married
what is marriage is marriage just an
outdated relic of the past or is it in
fact a true commitment and if I can you
have a true commitment only through
marriage with a bit of luck you'll
manage to divert them into spinning
their wheels fruitlessly all that well
you can go around your true joy of
having fun the idea of commitment scares
me is that a young person thing or am I
going to die alone it scared me until I
finally got married at the age of 40 so
asked at all time how do you make
friends as an adult when you move to
another city be active do activities
where people are there anyway a sport
poetry reading swimming so you're not
specifically trying to move people to
new city but just meeting people in
their sect this activity and they always
accept new people coming into their
group they love their group their what
they grew to you bigger so if you join
the group too early they will love you
and then you can find happiness I hit
the snooze button about 10 times every
morning so how do I become a morning
person
sleep is better than sex the eight hours
is kind of what you need okay I'm sorry
people try to do with less is so much me
and then you'll suffer forward you get
all sorts of other things happening so I
would like to know the best way to deal
with a hangover as you're drinking to
make sure that you're drinking water in
between to try to remain hydrated you
get dehydrated the trouble with drinking
beer for every 200 mils in 320 goes out
the dumb to say don't drink so much in
the first place wouldn't it how do you
have enough compassion for everything
equally without getting burnt out it's
difficult to have compassion for
everything try to create a small island
of happiness around you try to do what
you can in your local area as I said
you'll have influence and a little bit
of power thank you very much dr. Karl's
been very helpful I have one last bit of
advice never have sex with anybody has
more problems than you do
