girls of the world let your work speak
for yourself to not live someone else's
life and someone's someone else's idea
of what womanhood is womanhood is you
womanhood is everything that's inside of
you be absolutely who you are and be
stick to your instinct and your guts and
don't try and be like other people and
don't take you know the the Nike
campaigns and the Victoria's Secret
campaign to think you need bigger boobs
or a better butt or you need a tighter
you know AB or whatever else like be
happy with who you are and love your
insecurities because when you grow up I
think that's what's gonna make you you
it's gonna differentiate you from the
group so that's what my mom's always
told me I followed it's so easy to
spread the message of being yourself but
actually sort of implementing it in your
life is incredibly difficult I think it
takes a long time to find what makes you
happy and what your goals are to not
think in color don't think in color you
can feel in color because obviously it's
beautiful and it's the best but nothing
yet that shouldn't be the first thing
you think about when you wake up and the
first thing you think about when you
walk out your door I think about
yourself
I think we have to do things to keep a
balance in our life
and not let any institution shih tzus
hollywood define who we are
gotta know who you are and present that
all women anyone don't ask for
permission what are you waiting for what
are you asking for yes it's gonna be a
struggle and yes you're gonna hear a lot
of noise before you marry us but learn
to enjoy the process and embrace it and
have fun with it you know work hard be
so good they can't ignore you you know
keep to your morals see to your
integrity and don't stop fighting
because ultimately for any dream for any
goal it takes a lifetime and why
wouldn't you want to give it that it's
not a race it's a journey and enjoy the
journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
