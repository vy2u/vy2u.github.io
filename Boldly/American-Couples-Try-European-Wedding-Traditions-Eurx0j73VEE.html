we've been married for long we're
getting married in eight days that's
money um we got married last June in
Germany newlywed couples exchanged rings
vows and showcase their wood cutting
skills I don't have that right after
time and not the couple is challenged to
saw a log together in front of their
wedding guests sawing the log together
represents the energy cooperation and
commitment they're putting into their
marriage I've never heard of this I got
some wood cutting skills
I grew up auroral good fun we're not
doing it right oh my god we are I want
record time okay that's not the point
that's a good question with our plan
he's gonna be very bossy no not just a
centered Oh not gonna give us in a
wedding to it it's kind of easier than I
thought
cake cutting as much easier there we go
you go do not our marriage is gonna work
oh we did it oh yeah what do we get I
want to wait for means like cuz we
didn't cut it straight sighs that bad
luck if you just cut her not straight in
Scotland engaged couples take part in
the blackening a ritual performed by
friends and family before the ceremony
traditionally the couple is covered in
treacle flour sips and feathers among
other things in order to ward off evil
spirits both of you now have the
opportunity to perform this ritual on
each other with a treacle and make
molasses cookie that thing stinks
oh I feel so gross I'm sorry and I love
you
here we go here we go let's do this
let's be organized with this and don't
be afraid and a little bit of this
Muppet feathers
I think like it really makes our
traditions in America look very boring
because the all these traditions have
such deep like meaning behind them would
we incorporate either of these in our
wedding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
