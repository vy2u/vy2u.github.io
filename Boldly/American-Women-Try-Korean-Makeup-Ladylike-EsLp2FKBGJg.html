the deal with Korean beauty products
they're everywhere some people swear by
them so we're trying to figure out what
all the hype is about we decided to get
some and try them out it's ladylike and
today we're testing Korean makeup so
I've seen a lot of Korean beauty
products like in Sephora there was a
birch box with a lot of Korean beauty
stuff in it Korean makeup / skincare is
kind of everywhere right now
I guess I didn't even realize it was
different than American makeup I've
heard a few things about Korean beauty
products but I don't know if I've heard
about products that people actually use
or the products that just become
internet famous there's a whole shelf at
Urban Outfitters with like Korean beauty
products if urban has it you know it's
trendy ooh I have chic purple yeah I
like that mine says oops like you're
already hot up so apparently you
apply it to your lips wait for it to dry
and then you peel it off like Elmer's
glue I don't like the smells out yeah I
was also one of those people who like
puffed out almost lip don't Huff glue
friends cuz yours burn a little bit
doesn't it feel good like what was the
thinking behind the creation of this
product too easy to put on normal
product so you gotta do the most my lips
feel like shriveled prunes which makes
me think it's time to peel kind of
difficult to grasp has a strong hold on
my lip Oh gross oh my god they're both
coming at the same time whoa oh my god I
kind of it up and I had it like
surrounding my lips so I still look like
a four year old you fell tea it is so
salty and I don't know why in terms of
like color like what's left on my mouth
doesn't look that bad I don't hate it
but it doesn't look like I have anything
on dude I mean it also kind of looks
like ombre it looks like a color that's
worn off but maybe I have been kissing a
lot of people
dear girls cute eyes maker so this is an
eye fat enhancer it's just like
contouring but like for your bags Oh
what it's like a brown little like stick
thingy so there's two steps to this
thing so I'm literally just making my
bags worse
step two is like this weird clear shiny
thing
step two is like LM on the up-and-up
actually my eye does look puffier and
bigger
Oh oh my god blend it a little bit yours
like a lot bigger actually yeah it
sounds weird but I guess it works yeah
yeah yeah that's fine yeah it's a look
it's a thing nude glow makeup face not
makeup but makeup it's called eye gloss
but I don't know what that means
it was cold I'm like nervous about
putting a lot on and so it's twitching
so much you can't really mess up doing
this oh your eyes twitching - actually
it's twitching quite a bit what are you
drying giant Forney oh my god you want
me to blow in your eyes yet does it
tickle
oh I did too much I went too far oh
okay wait just that with the disgust
that I didn't realize how pigmented it
was this shows up quickly and a little
bit stronger than normal I shadow does
on me you know actually I thought it
would be more severe than it was you can
blend this a little bit with your finger
which is good
okay this is definitely the cutest
packaging of makeup that I've seen in a
while this is just adorable
oh you squeeze it it's wet it's like a
little heart alright not a color I would
choose but it shows up so that's a plus
it's just moist this is a essentially a
clown color for my face maybe that's too
wet no this is just the way it is it
looks like I just like pinched my cheeks
like a Victorian woman style I feel
fresh face I feel like yours blended
pretty well so it just looks like it
looks like you might not even have blush
on necessarily it definitely is not a
high-impact blush as the little
illustration is just like a little like
yeah like I'm not mad at it I'm more mad
at myself that I added this I think it's
super interesting and enlightening just
to see like what trends are trending
over there as opposed to like the makeup
trends ohne over here it's all very like
soft and dewy and shimmery in America
it's like really contoured shop liner
sharp lip henna shows you how the
standards of beauty really do change a
ton a couple of the items popped on my
skin a little bit more than I thought it
would so that was cool
so Korean makeup craze up some yeah down
comes up just as hard as American makeup
lady tested lady approved and that's why
they call it ladylike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
