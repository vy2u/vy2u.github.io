today hi I'm Monica Patel and I'll be
practicing henna art work on a few of
BuzzFeed employees here
henna use originates from Pakistan India
Middle East and Egypt it actually is
used for weddings special religious
occasions birthdays and things of that
sort
although henna is used in the Indian
culture it can be used by anyone and I'm
excited to share this with everyone here
I didn't know going into this what this
is gonna be the only hand I've seen is
just like on the boardwalk it's like
little designs of like fun traditional
henna is more detailed and intricate
westernized henna is more simple is
there anything specific that you have in
mind I think it'd be cool to just have
you do whatever you feel like doing you
just make it up we're just going for it
yep if I get it like on my back it
sounds really good how do you like it so
far
this is nice it's really relaxing just
like somebody's decorating me like a
like a cake but I kind of feel like I
should have shaved my arms it would be
cool if this became more widespread
though is westernized henna like almost
like like disrespectful no henna is
these for a traditional way in Indian
culture but it can be used by anybody
how long does it last depending on how
often you wash your hands it can last up
to two weeks I won't wash my hands then
for your mixing water sugar and lemon
and what this does is it intensifies the
color of the stain it's like when you
have like a cut across over but I know
that it'll be worth the wait just the
fact that I watched her do this it makes
me want it to last as long as it and
this is like the coolest thing that's
ever happened to me maybe it's so
awesome it's so beautiful I don't even
know what to say right now even though
this design is just on my arm I think
there's something about taking the time
to do all of this for yourself that will
make you feel just intrinsically more
beautiful in your entirety I'm really
happy with how it looks I used to think
that this was for only a particular
religion but I'm really glad to know
that it's for everybody I was able to
kind of start new dialogues with people
I learned that it's something that's
like really inclusive I think it's
really fun to learn about other cultures
and experience them and find out about
new things that you had no idea existed
and had no idea that like millions of
people did all the time and for me it's
this fun like new thing that I got to
experience it was really special to be
able to try that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
