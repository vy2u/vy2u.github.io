nothing like a baby hmm
Wow if you were hallucinating what it'd
be like to eat chalk what is that like
really gooey on the inside no no no no
these are so good
well they look delicious weird and
marshmallowy I could see this as being a
really nice complement to tea orange in
there is great it's a fun surprise they
thought chocolate and cookies needed to
taste more like oranges actually it
makes me angry you know I've heard a
spotted dick and I honestly kind of
assumed it was more discussing than that
this is a bad it tastes like something
that you would have on Thanksgiving this
dick tastes like banana bread with
raisins but this is microwavable in case
you need to have some spotted dick at a
hurry I am the official candy of George
Michael nope ah it's like there are some
other things in here but you can't
really taste them that's pretty good Oh
flan guns even have names of the wine on
them it's like Burgundy in port I like
candy and I like wine but they should be
two different things I don't know why
they're called wine they don't taste
like wine start the kidney on receives
an English accent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
