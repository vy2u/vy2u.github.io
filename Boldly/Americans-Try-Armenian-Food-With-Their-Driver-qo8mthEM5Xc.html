here the beautiful Shane and today we're
calling cabs ubers and lyft's helping to
find someone who isn't native to the
u.s. to tell us about their life and
take us to the restaurant and Los
Angeles that reminds them the most
appalling first off we call a lift our
driver is sauce SOS so so so I'm gonna
get SOSE tell me what you think of AB
Shan looks like a guy you'd see like at
a business park very hateful what no no
it's like a park where you business
people just hang out I've never heard of
that is now that's a thing I looked it
up on Wikipedia it's a real thing Henry
wanders into the street and then we
cross safer there's nothing wrong with
being aggressive how are you from sews
Armenia my Armenian that's cool you come
here with your family
yeah yeah family I have a truth well at
this point Henry has a terrible camera
angle for some reason I was trying to
convince him to do the thing so he pitch
him our idea and normally takes like
three to four cars but sauce is just
immediately interested so we get to just
go we pull over and we put a microphone
on toast
all right so where do you think we
should go Glanville Coastal Glendale
carousel but then we remember that Keith
forgot the releases back in the office
do we bring releases no okay we have to
go back and get ready okay let's go yeah
it should be known that this is 100%
Keith's fault I feel like it's Shane's
fault mostly that's fair it's not fair
right in I run all the way to my desk I
grabbed the papers triumphant return
yeah we got the papers as we drove to
the restaurant we asked so some
questions about why he came to America
in the first place and then what that
experience was like so what one of your
kids was born here and one was born and
I mean yeah the first time I took her to
the school was your daughter she's like
seven or eight even one worse she can't
speak in English she no English you know
English zero English like one or two
months later that's it she's thick
perfect but the junior one she's perfect
she's American she's American born here
natural born so we talked a little bit
more about Sosa's life but then he had a
confession for us and I'm smoker
are you side on a pull or a smoke is
that okay you ever smoked a cigarette
yeah so we pulled over and we let him
have a cigarette break
we hang out for a while Henry finds a
weird-looking tree pretty cool give it
like a b-minus high-fives all around
great standing around really nice break
yeah Jack we have quite hungry angry
hungry angry
yeah hungry hungry I'm done
automatically angry this point sauce is
convinced that he coined the term angry
and we're not about to correct him I
felt like all right man 300 go Oh way to
go 220 classic Henry Goldman attracted
to weird trees doesn't know where we
parked so we walk into the restaurant
with our equipment and we give them our
pitch about what we want to do they're
all highly skeptic and the too many
cameras what's going on there
yeah they see this and Henry takes a
moment to flirt with the server what's
your name
Jack Jack hey I'm Henry that's right you
thank you I was just being friendly we
proceeded to order way too much food
peruse first up Kebbell Orfalea Armenian
steak tartare made with finely minced
fresh filet mignon onion and parsley
Cheers
that's amazing yeah I can't just all day
all day long
probably sudden next up we tried you lob
a drink made from grape molasses
rosewater and topped with pine nuts all
right no it's really good it tastes like
very floral
it tastes like drinking Delicious
perfume I just want to say that perfume
should never be described as delicious
because it's not meant to be consumed
but some perfume does taste better than
others so the sujet flambe arrives and
then our table has fire on it
and it tastes like if like an artisan
slim-jim
then came cheese boreg pan-fried
turnover stuffed with white cheese it's
like what a hot pocket should be go home
no it's just so good this is so good
next up was kebbeh which are spheres of
beef and cracked wheat I thought it was
a hush puppy it's not a hush puppy
this looks like a teardrop I thought oh
I'm in mono vinegar yeah he's like
breaking my heart in the best way
someone shouldn't be making a fast-food
version of this like crazy
wait is this intestine what this is
intestine oh it's an intestines then we
had some kebabs they call it beef Lula
it's like what every kebab is but it was
still delicious like every kebab is they
cook on the open wood Jovana William
it's like beef and lamb with a bunch of
spices feels like I'm just at a picnic
right now yeah I'm about to cry after
everything I eat I guess somehow
Armenian food makes me very emotional
probably the teardrop-shaped meat so
here begins the saga of explaining the
Shane Y grains don't belong in a
sandwich
can I put these in here oh no no no I'm
not suppose yeah but that my head if
I'll get these Adi you kiddy the the
peel up on the side Shane I know we give
you a lot of and we like most of us
just joking I am like very weirded out
by the fact that you put rice into a
pita wrap
what's wrong with grains and a PITA do
you put toast in a burrito SOSE has had
enough
just kidding he's going to go smoke
another cigarette also all of these
foods are apparently benefited by lemon
so we just have lemon all the time
excellent dollar oh my gosh
you guys just like a touch of tomato I
love it like what can make but mother
your mom it's she's the best does your
wife know you feel that way about her
don't ya solo Lebanon it don't put it in
a sandwich you're gonna love it you're
gonna freak out it how good it is to
activating parts of my tongue
than kind of dormant so we were metaphor
you know what I mean though yeah the
dormant thing just made me think of like
like you've been celibate for a couple
years and I found that as well you use a
lot of olive oil yeah love a good extra
virgin
thanks for the celibate in you yeah you
know I sure as hell don't know how to
make a PITA Shane gets it so then one of
the dudes who works there comes over and
tells us how we should have come out
Friday night and we could have seen
belly dancers but worry not we can watch
them while we pee and there's TV screens
on the urinals in the bathroom with
video of the belly dancing so we have to
go survive this is so weird it's just
like pictures of the food it should be
like friends reruns more often than not
I think that's probably cause of dudes
to get like just a little bit few other
pants on that note we decide it's time
to leave we say goodbye to everybody we
meet the chef for a second we also meet
his mustache and then we thank them all
for the meal and head out on our way
back our bellies are stuffed with feta
to the point of bliss so much so that
Keith and Henry fall asleep like
adorable little Armenian cherubs we
arrived back to the office and say
goodbye to sews he felt he was gonna
pick up a rider and said he picked up
three new friends every driver has a
story and today we got to experience one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
