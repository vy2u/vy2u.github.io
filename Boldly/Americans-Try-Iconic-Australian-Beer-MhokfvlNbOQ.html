you like the actual hair on your chest
is it's supposed to be likes try out
beer so Cooper's okay yes it has quite a
bit of head though like classy yeah this
is like classy cheap beer hints of
Stella of kind of what it's remember
yeah I feel like this has like a little
bit of sunshine in it you could even get
away with things like brewed in a
Belgian style I can see myself drinking
this for some reason when I smell this I
also think of smoking weed yeah it's
really taste like anything
yeah this is like the beer you buy when
you've run out of money I feel like this
would be good beer pong beer cuz any it
seems like a really cool place I don't
know if this beer is really cool nice
golden color
the little water yet say see that tastes
like Budweiser that's been left on the
bar for a few hours this is like a
sitting around the circle with mates
inside somewhere it has sort of a gym
sock aftertaste pretty bottle I get it
cuz Queensland is sunny right I like
this I don't it's smooth yeah it went
right down like the discount version of
PBR it tastes American but more
laid-back so I'm excited about TVs
because it's fun to say say it to e2 e1
creamy this isn't bad like this is the
quintessential beer mmm I don't know if
I'd be able to drink more than one of
these
it's like natty light in America if
there was a pizza involved I would drink
it for sure
it's VB very better very better it goes
down easy yeah it does it looks like
malt liquor like this is a colt 45 I can
go with pretty much anything barbecues
parties dancing little funky high no I
don't think so okay this is what the
bartender automatically knows to serve
you at the local bar like something
funky about it like it's brewed a
bathtub or something I don't know I like
it a lot better than I expected
thought you guys just would have
Foster's for us you've got your good
ones too bad ones like a lot of things
Australian Australian beer is similar to
American stuff just like cooler I want
to go to college again but in Australia
with these beers what it lacks foreign
taste it makes a 45 regardless you don't
avoid say huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
