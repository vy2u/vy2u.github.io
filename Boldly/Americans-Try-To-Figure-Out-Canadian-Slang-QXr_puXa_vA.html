slang thought they were too nice for
slang the only thing I can think of is
maple leaf that's not slang Canadian
slang is just our slang but like a
soccer baseball this must be a Canadian
curse word they don't have curse words
over there Canadians use this because
they have no idea what sports Americans
actually play so they're like are you
gonna go play that American sport soccer
baseball and I think you're forgetting a
word basketball slang for things we
never do you don't soccer baseball know
me yeah like you don't know me
that soccer is at baseball funny hug I
want whatever that is
whoa hot dog just came to mind this is
sex having sex esta mean sex because
bunnies reproduce a lot so a bunny hug
that's two people I don't want
to laugh I want to be serious when I say
homo no homo milk so rude this can't be
Canadian slang I hope that stands for
homogenized milk even still this is not
the word you need to a breve pass me the
homo milk so I can feed the baby she's
crying over here housecoat is slang for
a condom housecoat that's a bathrobe
next
this applied teacher does sound Canadian
I don't know why this is the guy that
hands out the hockey sticks at the
hockey games I'm gonna guess it's a
derogatory term for somebody this is
obviously your teacher gives you
supplies just like I would you know what
I'm gonna assume this is a substitute
teacher Mickey Mickey could really be
anything I'm gonna guess that it means
penis though dork for like a knockout
drink
I think Mickey means beer right who
listens like a drug a hot dude
I didn't have my housecoat cinched up
and I think someone spotted my Mickey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
