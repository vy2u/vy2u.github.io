stole a bird it looks like there's this
kid who gets attacked by this dog are we
in a cemetery right now
dog I guess sufficiently like mauled
with kids now he's sick in bed and he
has to eat some poison off of a cooking
spoon while his dog gets to wear a bib
all of his strudel here's a young girl
and who has two pet cats the girl is
approaching a nondescript cylinder and
the cats are like no that's not for you
little girl
matches are an adult thing no she's on
fire and of course what happens she
catches on fire these cats like I know
it oh yeah she's dead she's very dead
they cry a river of tears over her
smoking ashes the girl's ribbons that
were in her hair now on the cat's tail I
guess that's like the cat version of a
black armband I guess the world those
guys don't trust cats hmm I think a man
who goes hunting but a rabbit takes him
notice he falls asleep under the Sun
like no I God okay the rabbit kind of
outsmarting the hunter Bugs Bunny style
stealing not only his gun but also his
glasses because surely a rabbit can't
shoot a gun without his glasses so he
shoots it in the back like a coward even
if by chance their prescriptions matched
I don't think rabbits can wear human
glasses then he throws the corpse down a
well the well will just be a giant
cauldron of person stew I feel like all
of these mortals are like don't trust
animals
this is the got Irish guess you stay MIT
