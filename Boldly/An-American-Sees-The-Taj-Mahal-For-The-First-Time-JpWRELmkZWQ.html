I know that this is just going to be
absolutely mind-blowing it's totally a
bucket list thing for me to see the
world wonders will get a lot of fun
pictures and learn a lot about the
history of India so let's do it oh my
god it's huge we're on the bus to the
Taj Mahal oh my god it was a long
several hours in the back of the van to
get to Agra where the Taj Mahal is but
it was so worth it in addition to this
being the Taj Mahal there's a mosque
over here that is huge and to add to it
just for balance
they put an exact replica over here
which is a guest house
that apparently wasn't even ever used my
camera can't even begin to capture the
amount of beauty that the Taj Mahal
emits 22,000 people over 20 years yes
cray-cray in my opinion I don't have
enough many friends if you have the
chance to go see it at some point in
your life I highly recommend it was the
most beautiful thing I have ever seen in
my life also these scaffolding is to
clean it not to restore it okay now look
at this honeycomb marble that they did
by hand no idea how they did that
without breaking it and then over here
each of these colors and pieces is a
unique piece of stone that was hand cut
this was the first time in my life that
I've been to some historical site where
when the guide said it was time to go
I was upset that we had to leave I don't
want to leave
well I need to get a new set of
adjutants because I feel like I'm using
the same ones over and over again one
here in India but that was amazing
can't believe we saw the Taj Mahal he's
all world wonder we also visited a
company that employs descendents of the
craftsmen who worked on the Taj Mahal
they hand-carved each piece of marble
perfectly I can barely draw a straight
line and here these people were like
creating flowers out of marble this was
all done by hand
yes today I'm just being reaffirmed
about how much beauty and work ethic
there is in this country and how much I
admire that I think this is also the
first time that I've been somewhere in
the world where I said I have to come
back and see this again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
