narcissist

everyone a month of dating it takes four
months to get over someone for every two
weeks you dated oh my god we should do a
girls night

you're just too picky you just need a
date older guys we just need to get
hammered my sponsor single my landlord

before I met Steve I've never been
single so I can't really relate at least
you didn't get married marriage isn't
for everything you know not everyone
