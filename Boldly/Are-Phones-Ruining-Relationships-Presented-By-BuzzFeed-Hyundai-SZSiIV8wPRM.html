it can you see all this around me it's
all of that my name is Linda and this is
Ernie I'm Evelyn and this is my dad
chance I'm ray and this is my girlfriend
patty I need my phone
yeah Linda's a techie I'll have like a
full-blown conversation and I'm thinking
she's this thing I think I checked my
phone maybe 30 times a day once every 15
for me at first it was a little awkward
just being alone in the car with my dad
and not having my phone so what'd you do
yesterday guys at this age or just it's
all funny business did you ever hear
that like Netflix and chill nope we're
not gonna have this conversation as the
car ride went on we had good
conversation he was a late supper old
people I was quite the raver before
what's up welcome to the Magic Castle
thank you yeah they let you in with your
phones they did come we play game with
your phone why was like before we do the
magic show let's play a game take your
phone take an envelope all right place
your phone in the envelope I don't know
where your phone is you don't know where
the phone is and then stack them up so
they're just kind of in a in a in a
random order I'm gonna have you number
them one through six
hey I'm gonna have you roll the die
whatever number comes up we'll remove
that envelope two envelope two and
here's how we eliminate it how's the
dancing on the beach I mean I've always
wanted Ernie to take salsa classes with
me but something always got in the way I
know which way to go I just need you to
take me there I used to ChaCha yeah if
you want to be a fantastic salsa dancer
concentrate on your steps and your
partner
the biggest lesson for me is being
present and I have to admit that I'm not
present all the time when I'm dealing
with my phone and Ernie's talking I'm
feeling a little nervous I would say
about the fact that I'm going up in a
helicopter with no door that's pretty
darn scary I'm not gonna die right
that's a bad question cut that I'm
afraid of heights I'm so glad my dad's
here I don't think I would be able to do
this alone
I didn't really miss the phone at all
until I realized how I should probably
be taking some pictures but everyone
cheated by the way I wanted to share the
beauty with everybody else are you
getting a phone call in the middle of a
night a chef
I'll reach in reach in is it your phone
she surprised me how much I was about to
have a heart attack yeah in some ways it
takes you away from the person who's
standing right next to you
the beach was beautiful and it's kind of
rekindled summer days woman and I used
to go dancing when we first got together
oh okay
no he didn't I still didn't do it right
I mean social media is interesting and
you know the world wide web is useful
but at the same time you know one has to
have their priorities straight I have a
ring on very similar but yeah
they're different yeah yeah I have
reiha's pattern and then she has saddle
array it's like a promise ring and it's
just to say that I'm not going in the
round pen I'm right here with you
you think you gonna live forever when
you're young but as you get older you
start understanding importance of just
just being together and enjoying each
other the times that I didn't have my
phone it was kind of nice to have that
moment for myself and for my dad push
you back we're gonna do this turn right
this time I got it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
