don't hi I'm Sarah and I'm okay makeup
but I'm a pretty good artist and I'm
Nina and I'm pretty good at makeup but
I'm a really really bad artist I do my
makeup like day to day but I don't
usually do a lot
unless I'm going out and then I just
kind of like make it up not how I think
says they were doing a challenge to see
who can come up with the best creative
look based off of a theme it has to
cover 40% of your face at least and it
can't just be like a going out normal
look it has to be a little bit something
more a little bit more creative we're
gonna be judged by a jury of our peers
aka people we find around the office
what is fall what does that mean am I
gonna just like do like an orange e red
look all over my face or am I gonna like
draw turkey leg on my cheek the idea
behind my look today is the transition
from fall to winter so I'm gonna use a
lot about tundle shades but also a lot
of nice wintry shades as well I'm not a
hundred percent sure what I want to do
for my look but I know I want to use
fall colors I know I want leaves and I
know I want some sparkly gold in there
there's already happening over
there I haven't even started I like
don't even know where to start what is a
leaf look like you know I'm feeling
extremely confident that's good I don't
this is very fun I'm glad you're having
fun my contacts they're getting dry
this might have gone off the rails
that's what I like to hear
yeah I think I'm ready too
where to fall babes and we're about to
go get the final judgement from our
coworkers
I really have to each my face so I I
really like the how you wake up leaves
but just this little accent is cool and
also that how can you have like almost
like tree trees coming out of the side I
think you look amazing - I think it's so
nice
we're done here yours with more leaves
okay it has more fall colors better I
love you
Mina's gives me more the fall vibe
Dinah's yours is like a really beautiful
and I love the gold with your skin but I
just keep looking at Sara's leaf
forehead and I love it I like Nina's
gold but look it just feels all and
festive we're gonna grow a Sarah I'm
gonna go with Nina winning towards the
Oh
near they've got snow bit more Sparkle
Mena's it like perfectly frames like my
favorite part of her face and she like
uses her like crease eye I see it cuz
she's done it before
oh my gosh you know I like Venus yours I
like kind of like deer slash smallpox
yeah like it's cool yours looks more
like flowers and I feel like leaves yeah
Sarah yours is way it's like top-notch I
have to say I like the sort of gold she
wins
they are tied so we need to visit one
more person to be the deciding vote we
need one more vote and if they don't
pick me I will murder them the battery
on the phone is about to run out so we
have to find somebody to it sweet can
you guys come out with the tie right now
and just be like no this looks great
eyes on Sarah match her hair we're just
doing a laugh of me she's gonna get
assisted in Sarah's has a concept I feel
like that
I won I think that it was really
interesting to see that like even though
we both had like different advantages
and different experiences I feel like we
kind of came out equal I mean I won but
I think what we should really do is what
the people of the world decide the
youtubes designs should truly one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
