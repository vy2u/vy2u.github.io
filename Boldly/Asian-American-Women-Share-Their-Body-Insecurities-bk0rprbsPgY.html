somebody working there he told me don't
bring snacks to work because you're
gonna get chubbier than you already are
I grew really fast faster than most of
my asian-american friends I swam all my
life so I have big shoulders it was
normal for my family and family friends
to just tell me that I'm big they're
like oh Diane like you got a little
chubby or like they just say those small
things when they first see me my thighs
are bigger my arms are bigger my boobs
are bigger in the later part of my
childhood I was told that I was chubby
and that it's a shame because I used to
be so skinny when I was a kid I don't
feel part of my body every time I look
into the mirror I see something
different in every mirror size wise and
culturally I was just like just
different from everyone else for Asian
women in my experience is that we need
to be thin and that means not muscular
you need like like a tiny waist but you
still have to have curves going to Japan
especially I get looks that I'm not
quite Japanese because I don't have the
nice fair skin I don't have a tiny like
petite body there's always something to
fix usually when my mom makes comments
it's in the middle of dinner and I just
think that I was almost out of here
without her saying one comment about my
weight or how much I'm eating it's funny
because my mom will be like here's all
this food don't go hungry mmm but don't
over eat but finish all the rice on your
plate it's like I just like everything
came with a butt and it was really
confusing for me when I was living in
Korea the pressures to look a certain
way came from every aspect of my life
from my friends to the my family to my
relatives um even from like random
strangers who commented on my appearance
so many so many rules rules and rules
and rules so you could be like this
cookie cutter like shape and figure and
things that they find perfect just like
a submission cycle I'm like trying to
get to a point where I'm happy with my
body
I will work on my body however I please
when you are different that means that
you are challenging the norm you don't
have to be thin to be happy like you do
things for yourself and you'd be healthy
for yourself and you could be thick and
that is ok being different isn't bad
being different is being you and being
you you're liberated and you are
empowered and I am NOT skinny I can
enjoy my life without looking perfect
for all you Asian girls who have big
boobs they're really great in the future
ok that's all of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
