yes I'm so exhausted you know how hard
is to plan an orgy and orgies are not
that common I've been to one and most of
the time I spent there was in the corner
eating Oreos
why isn't one person enough by that
logic you should only have to have one
friend I have friends who I'm just
Facebook friends with and friends who I
would pick up from jail it's not that
one person isn't enough it's that lots
of people fascinate me what's the
difference between poly and cheating the
difference between poly in cheating is
that cheating is a violation of the
relationship polyamory is all about
consensual discussion being on the same
page make out with somebody else that's
part of the deal it's not about the
trial
it couldn't be any different is it due
to your religion you're thinking of
polygamy does it bother you that some
people don't know the difference between
polyamory and polygamy most definitely
that bothers made look at me for the
most part one is more of a legal term -
it's more linked to religion it's more
about the man and some subservient women
polyamory is a gala terian everyone has
a voice what's the biggest tool to help
polyamory work communication being
honest you have to talk about what you
think how you feel love and compassion
comes first
it's non-monogamy normal I think maybe
the question really is is monogamy
normal we can choose to be monogamous um
just like we can choose to be vegetarian
but as dr. Ryan says that doesn't mean
the bacon won't still smell good it's
okay to be non-monogamous as long as you
do it in an ethical way that doesn't
betray anyone oh how do you deal with
jealousy in seriousness jealousy is
something we all deal with you know
we're jealous of people in our industry
sometimes are jealous of people in our
family but for some reason we consider
sexual jealousy to be this
insurmountable problem and it's not
another thing that can help with
jealousy is meeting any of your
partner's potential partners we blow up
in our mind what they're like we think
that they're a supermodel or their
sundae that's out to get us
I want great experiences for my partner
and if that includes a different lover
that I'm okay with that does it bother
you that people just don't understand
I am a bisexual plus-sized nightclub
entertainer who grew up with two moms in
Texas
I find it's best not to worry what other
people think do you have any advice for
young polyamorous people my advice is to
be honest no matter what don't pretend
to be chill with things you're not chill
with just because you want to be cool
Polly reach out to different resources
and just educate yourself take your
instincts past just what you think is
right and really listen to people who
have done this for a long time figure
out who you are and stay true to it
don't try to change and don't try to
change other people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
