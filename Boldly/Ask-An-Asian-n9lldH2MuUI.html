you know about two out of three human
beings on this planet let's get started
don't you dare put a gong in there
our people always asking are you good at
math not always two-thirds of the time
like 45% or like one out of three people
actually I'm not that good at math
what's up with Asians wearing doctors
masks because you're all dirty dirty
people
why do Asians mainly stick to themselves
it seems like the enclaves you guys make
are impenetrable socially everyone has
enclaves white people have enclaves to
Wall Street the entertainment industry
Utah they're not impenetrable just
harder are all Asian houses foam suede
no not all Asians use Fong shui I have a
lot of Asian friends whose apartments
are so messy it looks like an episode of
Porter's do people make kung fu noises
they make a chop hand motion at you only
on Tuesdays at kickboxing I have a
Groupon how do you tell other Asians
apart I don't know let's bring in
another Asian hi Korean I am Korean hi
Chinese hello so up Eugene how would you
tell other Asians apart you can often
tell from their last name for example
mine is gang yeah and - yay do you get
offended when someone of the same race
as you makes a racist joke everyone
should be offended by racist jokes
because you know racism do you ever get
sick of hearing the same Asian
stereotypes yes you know what I do
why are Asian drivers so bad first of
all have you seen how Asians drive in
Asia it's lawless
they don't give a and number two
Americans we don't drive that well
either
have you been to Boston how do you keep
from punching idiots in the face when
they ask stupid offensive stereotypical
questions sadly most of the people who
ask questions for this video did it
online and I couldn't reach their faces
honestly I think y'all need to get out
more like meet some Asians we're out
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
