the media and social media in particular
that we have to look and appear a
certain way in order to be feminine
I've always been an athlete I started
playing soccer I played in college I
played in the del V league in Atlanta
for three years I've always been
extremely athletic and extremely
competitive even in gym class I always
wanted to beat the boys I ran track at a
Division one college before I got into
CrossFit and weightlifting I battled
weight gain and weight loss and
fluctuated for pretty much my entire
teen and young adult life I hated every
part of my body I hated absolutely every
part and when I started lifting weights
I was able to let that go I didn't think
I could ever let it go but I was able to
but I definitely did think that it could
have been skinny or think that maybe my
body composition could have been better
when I was younger
my athletic body my muscles have been a
part of me for as long as I can remember
so I don't know how I'm gonna feel with
them being taken away I've had countless
female friends and that have been
concerned about building muscle mass and
what that would look like on their body
because they're worried about being too
big or too bulky or too muscular we are
used to other people telling us what
we're supposed to look like for every 10
positive comments there's some guy out
there telling a girl she looks like a
man's really this this complex that
people have created in women that tells
us that we're not without muscles I'm
doing this experiment because I want to
be able to look at myself in a different
body form and still love the way that I
look now
now I'm nervous yeah I'm looking at my
original picture and it looks like me
and I look like a badass so now let's
look at the Photoshop version oh wow
okay oh okay what bothers me the most
about this is the arms like I don't have
any like art at all it's crazy
whoa oh I hate that it's f Lee doesn't
look like me there's no muscle tone
there's no muscle it's literally just
skin and bone Oh weird
honestly just looking at it it just it
just doesn't feel like me I've always
had big legs have had big lakes since I
was a kid so I've never seen small
thighs on myself before I've put in a
lot of hard work to my body
years and years of training blood sweat
tears just to see it being stripped off
is like devastating a little bit this is
still a picture of thin that at one
point in my life I was striving to be
almost every day I wake up every morning
hoping that I looked like this I don't
feel that way anymore
women have been held back for so long
and we're starting to see that gap
closed as women start to be like I don't
really care what you think I'm taking
this heavy thing up and I'm throwing it
around through weightlifting and through
CrossFit I definitely found freedom with
my body having muscle is healthy and it
definitely should be celebrated instead
of women being afraid to put on a little
muscle
I think they should definitely welcome
it I am proud of my original picture
because as that girl can clean 185
pounds
