marry anyone you like like if they're
the same gender as you hey you can marry
whoever you want to marry so you can
marry the same gender or different
gender I know that in Australia you
can't marry your same gender sad I would
feel quite sorry for them bad could I
kind of get married it would make me sad
it's not really fair I think you should
be able to marry whoever you love well I
think that's a good thing
I think that's good and that pretty much
every country should do that
if you like them then I think you should
be able to marry them I said America did
a good thing
I have TruGreen ones that can't get
married to each other I don't know why
it's like an Australia isn't really very
fair because there are lots of people
who think that's very important to get
married I think it should be allowed
under don't really see why it shouldn't
not fair I think it's a bit of a problem
oh it's like it doesn't matter if you're
a boy or girl and get married I don't
really see why you're preventing people
from marrying whoever they like make
everybody in the study so they can get
married so everybody's happy I don't
think it's very fair for some people to
be able to get married and not other
people and I don't know why you're so
against it people being able to marry
whoever they want is important for lots
of people I think it's pretty simple and
I wish that you would understand that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
