season and we've noticed that there are
a lot of Native American inspired makeup
tutorials making the rounds of the
internet so Jenny and I we thought would
make our own I mean who better to teach
you guys about real authentic Native
American makeup than to real authentic
Native Americans
let's get to work kara what it's like
I'm blending cultural sensitivity right
into my skin I know Jenny uses bronzer
but we got different skin tones from
different tribes ancient tool for
beautification passed down from Sephora
this is an art that my people have been
perfecting for centuries and by my
people
I mean the entire makeup wearing
populace blend like your life depends on
it
and for many Native Americans it
actually has there you go guys Native
American inspired makeup and the best
part about this native look is that if
you wear it on Halloween you won't
offend anybody and it's so easy like
anyone's aware it's amazing how simple
it is we're gonna get serious just for a
minute and tell you guys why we make
this video there are a lot of these
videos out there and hey some of you
guys are super talented makeup artists
yeah we actually love some of the looks
that you come up with but we just want
to be clear it's not your designs that
we have a problem with its labeling them
as native american-inspired that we have
a problem with it's a little tricky
because they're not inspired by any
actual Native Americans they're inspired
by characters from Disney cartoons and
John Wayne movies they're inspired by
stereotypes and when you label them as
Native American you're helping to
perpetuate those stereotypes whether you
intend to or not you're helping to
perpetuate the myth that Native
Americans are savage or exotic believe
it or not a lot of people believe that
and we fight those perceptions every
single day words matter
words matter we hope this is giving you
guys a few ideas to work with just
remember this is authentic happy
Halloween guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
