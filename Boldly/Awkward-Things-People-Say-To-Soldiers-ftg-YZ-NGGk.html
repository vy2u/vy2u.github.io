limited sweets so I'm thinking Netflix
of pizza or Netflix in Chinese or stay
with me
Netflix pizza and Chinese talk about
your lots they want to meet you you're
here man it's so different we cut it not
a company or anything but okay really
how do you really think it's going over
there yes I called you yeah yeah it was
a PDR let's ratio how come I haven't
seen you around
been overseas for eight months you're
that guy it's usually like two to one
yeah I'm not great that's your real life
you never seem like an army guy idea
that I mean used to buy weed for you oh
my god I can't believe I wore these oh
this is insensitive I'm not mocking you
or that didn't even make that guy I'm
also not trying to blend in with the
environment obviously it's not under
fire oh hey it's not a front the way you
would see in Braddock stop yeah like
door on rain cutter
I'm sure okay I'm gonna okay cuz I'll
kick his ass I know you yeah really I'm
doing all right okay
Hey okay see you like it's like a
sergeant right of course okay so if he
found out that you weren't a Republican
like I couldn't do that stuff let's do a
shot bro if you were fired - Brett fifty
Cal with a thermal scope you they even
want us in their country how long has it
been since you know oh so you were there
like eight months right I mean you had
to kill at least somebody right
something's wrong with the goddamn yes
without this you should go for it it's
your own art don't let me hold you back
this thing over you you're so cheesy
rematch rematch to walk around for hours
with trash bags and gloves on cuz I mean
stuff gets everywhere everywhere you
know and just when you think you got it
all there's no way there's anymore you
sit down eat a pop-tart and there is a
scrotum by your foot
hey now you got to put your pop-tart
down you got to get the gloves back on
when that's taken care of
you notice this dog the platoon feeds we
call him DMX now DMX is gnawing on a
piece of this dude now locals who are
super superstitious are telling your
interpreter Oh once a dog is a taste of
human flesh Eagles crazy and violent and
we like this dog so we don't do anything
about it then it bites this out of
Batista's arm and the next thing you
know it's decided the MX's got to go but
now we don't want to shoot him inside
the compound because of the risk of
ricochet from a high-velocity rifle
bullet yeah wait that really makes sense
like how did it even get a bomb inside a
compound in the first place but don't
make anybody else wants to see you next
oh yeah alright oh I feel why they call
the dog DMX cuz you just got busted for
the dog fighting stuff
I'm sorry no never was being stupid and
I just thought that's not your fault
drunk I was drunk I just want to tell
story to let them know that you just
want to eat a pop-tart happens and
it's crazy in it that story kills em
base I'm serious okay yes it's
interesting it's weird it's
really weird this is a really weird
choice I just wanted to be one weekend
you know I'm back in two days
I'm not though to them I'm just some
weird soldier guy who shows up and they
get to tell a weird story about me and
then forget about it
no one's gonna forget that story
just threw this party cuz I didn't want
to touch your face just didn't want you
to feel like oh I wanted this weekend
you touch my face all you want oh I just
like and I can see you yeah you here I
know no one's gonna pull you up
and a pizza
