your penis yes that's that's not true
we've been friends for six years nine
years nine a year at ember the times
that I do tell lies it's usually to like
protect people from the ultimate truth
or should I try to lie or should I try
to just be honest right away so the
machine doesn't pick up anything just
like to see how far you it get away with
someone believing something and they'd
be like I'm just kidding but then once
you get too far it's like Oh see that's
what I do
okay so but I could fill a glass with
your sweat right that's how scared you
know really I'm fine
we once lived together in Boston was I
your favorite of your five roommates no
that was the truth do you think I should
have cut all of my hair off and died a
blonde no oh you got bad you agree with
that cool it was just the most thinking
about have you ever been attracted to a
girlfriend of mine yes that is the chair
that is that true sir are you gonna do
stand-up with me this week
no that's an honest answer do you
believe that your dick is bigger than
mine yes that's a true statement do you
think I should be in a relationship no
not right now she's being an honest
do you believe I have good music taste
yes that's that's indicating a lie I
just you also know a lot of 90s sing
holes than I can do you think I should
be in a relationship right now no that's
not entirely truthful
do you dislike when I have success no
this is a lie what is there anything
you're not telling me about your
personal dating life no that's gonna be
all do you think your penis is bigger
than mine no Tuesday we've no idea what
we're basing that I it's just like it's
just it's just literally the way it
carries themselves
I think the lie-detector tests has
strengthened our friendship I feel
closer I feel both closer and weird yeah
is it because I want to see your dick
that's not even the biggest one no
honest with each other which is nice
except for cakes whole secret dating
life but besides it I want to be hooked
up to a lie detector all the time
weirdly relaxed vindicated when I'm
telling the truth and then when it turns
out that I'm like lying to myself it's
amazing it's like what I need like teeth
would you pay me $50 to see my penis yes
