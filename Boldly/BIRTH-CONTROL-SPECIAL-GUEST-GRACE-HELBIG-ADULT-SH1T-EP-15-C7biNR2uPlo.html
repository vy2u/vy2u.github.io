I do feels like you go oh my god let's
do it but wow you're gonna leave me
thinkin hanging you how it feels to be
left hanging I was looking at my nose I
would never intentionally hi if you had
my period Oh terrible but I supposed to
get mine today we'll talk more about
that later but I will raise your baby uh
what I'm cutting back is your beat I'm
not pregnant
Wow might be a really good fucking
mother hey no you would that's not the
issue guys this is a dull chick with the
one the podcast where we fuck up so you
don't have to I'm Kelsey I'm Kate and
this is our father what's happening guys
we have a really cool guest today I'm
really excited about she was one of the
most requested and tagged people when we
asked who you wanted to see on the
podcast so make sure you stick around
for that that was a teaser there's a
little teaser that's what that was I'll
be here in a little while so Kelsey last
time we talked to your sister had some
oh yeah yeah health issues critic update
we don't have all the answers yet but
the good news is it's not a mess and
it's not AIDS or HIV awesome which are
two big things we could cross off the
list hell yeah I think it might be some
sort of b12 deficiency I don't even know
what the fuck that means I heard
something like that it could also be
still some sort of autoimmune like I
said we don't have all the answers but
she's getting she's doing shocks daily
to kind of help whatever the fuck is
going on in her spine and we're really
happy so thanks everybody who sent
positive vibes made me feel really good
segue hi oh okay last podcast I talked
about how I was yet again rejected Wow
yet again really Christmas this guy Wow
I have no nothing but rejection okay
anyway last week I talked about I was
hinting about possibly not going to the
holiday party because I was gonna go on
a friend hangout
with someone who didn't want to date me
and then they should wipe that smug look
right off your dad dick I'm just happy
you came I like hanging out with you you
guys didn't talk ever since he said okay
we'll hang out sometime
no okay fine and then I didn't want to
because I was like okay he's just be
nicer back about so I went to the
holiday party instead and that shit was
I really see you I felt like I was
chasing you like a girl chasing a boy
she likes in high school like hang out
with me and you don't wanna hang out
that's not true yeah why would you wait
till right now to confront right you're
like I was hanging out with stove Arpaio
Stephen Cantor all you guys know him
from buzzy and we kept being like is it
just us or skate avoiding guys it's like
every time we would come up no you guys
you believe you were taking so long to
go to all the things I wanted to do I
had a listen I have learned over my
years of holiday parties that if you
don't do what you want to right now it's
not gonna happen it did talk about these
back of cheeseballs is that our no
lesson from not getting those macaroni
and cheese balls when I could have and
then I spent the whole party chasing
them so I needed to go I needed to get
my palm read I needed to talk to that me
I was gonna call him a musician magician
who Oh little sexist yeah okay here's
the thing is he's a magician at the
Magic Castle which is a really hard
restaurant Club to get into Neil Patrick
Harris owns it and lossy he always it
yeah or against the president he's a
president of the magic committee or
whatever yeah and it's really hard and
you can't get in unless you know a
magician and so this guy was a magician
who was like very open to the idea of
inviting us to the club as his guests
and then he started performing his
tricks and was like hell I sexist and I
was like I don't want to go but I still
want to go to the magic cabin but not in
there guess I don't know if he was
sexist as much as he was happy like oh
just hacky and the stuff he was saying
with his miracle magicians are usually
like making jokes about like women and
shit be like a typical woman can't make
up her mind
like I mean like just little things
little micro no it's crazy what's crazy
whenever something like that happens I
always like my immediate thought is oh
here I mean it like oh yeah you believe
in the good in people yeah but there's
anyway um the difference between guilt
and shame and like a lot of people who
experience a lot of shame it means I am
bad is that it was so like say you do
something you mess up in some way like I
just spilled my coffee I shame is I I'm
an idiot I'm a fucking idiot because I
spilled my coffee and then guilt is all
that was a silly thing for me to have
done why I look oh well I'm still a
person yeah I made a mistake and I think
a lot of times when you do that to
yourself when you're like I'm an idiot
I'm bad and then you see someone else
make a mistake you give them kind of
like the leeway that you don't even give
yourself so when I see or hear someone
do something like kind of shitty I think
that's why a lot of women get into like
not-so-great relationships or whatever
is that there's already that sense of
shame and then when it comes to like you
know acknowledging someone else for
being there yeah but then then you sort
of talk yourself out of your own
necessary boundaries and certain people
so like yeah yeah that you let shit fly
like in my head I'm like oh we should
maybe cut like this is what I'm really
thinking like oh we should maybe cut the
magician stuff because what if we you
know what if it gets back to himself and
like isn't that bananas that's fucking
crazy is that and even on the last
podcast we said like if there was a way
that you can help someone become a
better person or more aware of behavior
like why wouldn't you know that about
not even conscious I'm just sort of like
yeah I try and it's like oh but your
action stuff you know it was a in a
weird way stick with me it was a power
dynamic he was the center of the
attention he was performing it yeah
we're trying to respect his like yeah
job and boundaries but I think we do
that too with like men in power where we
say we let things slide and we we laugh
at jokes we wouldn't normally do because
we're trying to me
or we don't want them to feel bad god
forbid
yeah how they feel bad I thought about
this for a while is that like we've
laughed at how many dick jokes you know
what I mean like that guys it's it but
like from a guy's perspective and then
there was a time when I was even doing
stand-up when a woman would like to talk
about her vagina or whatever and I
wouldn't be like hell yeah turn the
tables I'd be like oh they're not gonna
like yeah oh he's gonna get mad it's cuz
it's not you traditionally you're not
supposed to talk about but it's just so
interesting we could I don't know it's
just annoying cuz it's like how many
times can I hear about you slap on a
girl in the face with your dick first of
all what I've heard many of stand-up
talk about I think I open job that's
kind of hot but like not if you're just
I don't understand the physics behind
that well it depends on where you are
and it's kind of like a little bit like
a power thing where they hit you in the
face that their dick a little bit to be
like yeah suck this it's it some people
are into it okay I won't pass judgment
yeah if anyone tries to hit me in the
face at their dick yeah biting the tip
if you're not not a blowjob
yeah then do you definitely bite the tip
off for sure that is so rude if someone
just hit you with their fucking dick I
wouldn't be someone just smashing up
with my pussy yeah pussies mad they're
just sitting there watching TV in a
bagel and I just walk over hey see
you're like that too is like guy I feel
like guys use their dicks as humor
because they are so insecure about their
dick and sexuality like they'll be like
oh my dude my ball is so goofy looking
because I don't I'm not really
comfortable with it so let me make it
kind of a joke I don't know I haven't
know either I don't know if that's a lie
I don't know I think that it's just like
a I don't know it's like a thing that
everyone talks about yeah we need to
make it more normal for us to just talk
about our genes
speaking of talking about our regimes
look at that segue that was good it was
good a fence I want to talk about my
vagine for a second yeah
I know I never do this but I've got some
issues uh issues man I got fucking
issues yeah I feel like I take care of
my vagina really well and I'm very close
friends with it it has been through a
lot you get it a lot yeah but I like
there is something always fucking wrong
with my vagina if it's not a UTI or a
yeast infection or fucking my underwear
is too tight on it causing razor burn or
I've got cysts I had cysts for a long
time or fucking some shit is always
wrong with my vagina and then here's my
anger is that fucking they give you
antibiotics for your vagina for anything
and then those antibiotics always give
me a fucking yeast infection so that I
have to take medication for that and
it's a cycle that never fucking ends
it's UTI yeast infection antibiotics UTI
using an around and I feel like who's
making these meds why why am I so cursed
with a overactive machine when some
girls I know I've never even had a UTI
before mmm
have you never had one no I had one and
a yeast infection with him yeah it's
just when I was a swimmer oh yeah I used
to Oh God when I would go to like that
was deep it was a little yeah um and I
would go to the gym and then I'd come
home and that I wouldn't necessarily
just sit in your bathing suit cuz yeah
your kid yeah well I mean also I've
gotten them when I was an adult for
being like I'm too tired to shower I was
gonna eat lunch now the chicken nap in
Michael it's disgusting sounds
disgusting
I just it's I find it really annoying
that I could do everything I can and
like this second I have sex something
happens to my vagine whether it be
spotting or like it hurts or I don't
know it just it's always something going
on I wonder if there's something for
that so that's not like a medicine or
something like that like practice of
some sort live for example every time I
have a cut and then I go in the ocean it
helps the cut I just need to like sit in
a tin of water I think you need to sit
in the ocean bare vag and ice let those
waves
I did put my laser on it my laser from
the chronic pain episode we did I just
straight up chef meles are up in there
cuz I was like who knows maybe this will
help cure a yeast infection but now I'm
like are you may be allergic to the
condoms that you don't use it bitch
okay let's fucking go there then I guess
that ties into the baby drug that you
made in the beginning okay I'm so sorry
it was just such a good trip
you such a bitch okay what I got off
birth control about six months ago it
was the best decision for me I've ever
made I know for a lot of women it helps
with their hormones it helps balance
their mood
it helps with acne it helps prevent
cysts yeah there are a lot of Lisa's tip
over here yeah yes a lot of women need
it and I I was that person for 12 years
I was on it and then eventually when I
started seeing my acupuncturist he was
like I'm not gonna treat you unless you
get off all your meds everything
including birth controls like this
mother fucka is crazy but I was so
desperate I was in pain all the time I
said mother I'm gonna try anything so I
got off everything in the second I got
off birth control oh my god my mood I am
so happy now
I my sex drive is through the goddamn
roof ting my like the only thing that
has happened that sucks is now I've
gotten adult acne like on the bottom of
my face but I just went to a
dermatologist and got a bunch of meds
and hey adult acne happens to all of us
no matter how hard we try to avoid it
yeah and I didn't realize that for 12
years I could have had like pretty
severe acne if I haven't been taking the
birth control so like I said I see the
upsides but I also I am just so much
happier without it wrapping all of that
up I'm not using any protection right
now with the person I'm seeing
okay whatever we all know who it is my
fuzz buddy because I'm an idiot I don't
know I just then you just probably said
oh yeah shit you're right you might be
being careless but it doesn't make you a
careless person Wow Kate fuck that was
too truthful that was burn a brain
coming to you through through your old
pal it's one of those things we're like
condoms really irritate my vag
like to a point where I would rather not
have sex than use um shopping um I
haven't looked into other options yet
because again like I just gotten off of
it and was kind of giving my body time
to be hormone free there are I know like
the shot you can get there are the
copper IUD which is what I'm looking
into because it's hormone free I believe
it's called pair guard and I actually
asked us on Twitter last night like what
do you guys think about Paragard because
I know there are other are you just so
confused I'm not so confused I am I just
yet wonder so much I know if you're
going through so much just go through so
much just that they don't have a baby I
don't want kids I have said that like
and I have also assured my partner that
if anything were ever to happen I would
take the child
no I it's not I'm also using like a
tracker on my app to like see when I am
like when it's safe to be doing things
yes and I just I can't I can't deal with
going back on something that has
hormones for me mm-hmm
I think maybe even a lot of people ask
us questions they write in about methods
of birth control and I'm always hesitant
to say what people should try and what
they shouldn't because it's been all
over the map for me with moods at least
and I don't want to fuck with that have
you ever taken birth control no because
of like the the hormones and stuff like
that cancer runs pretty heavy in my
family and I didn't want to fuck with
the hormones and all that sort of stuff
and I just don't have sex so there was
really no well we know that that's not
the reason why main reason why people
use it is it I don't know I've just
stated straight away from a lot of stuff
that has to do with my vagina so I just
yeah
I never belt my vagina looks people
talking about you oh my favorite subject
wait I was just about okay what I don't
understand I know people have said this
before I know it's not really helpful
but I just want to point out the fact
that if you were to you might have
forgot this okay I just don't understand
like you would take the bullets out of a
gun before you would give
someone's shields right yeah so why not
why don't we have male male birth
control why don't we have male birth
control and better gun control Hey the
what's that one sign that everyone was
using for the women's marches and shit
that was like if my pussy was a gun or
why is my pussy more regulated than guns
oh yeah yeah I mean it is easy that like
I said our generation is gonna be the
people that change the way the move is
in the Shakers it's fuckin Laura
our guest from the chronic pain episode
of has endometriosis says this all the
time if endometriosis happened to men
this shit would have been solved years
ago there would have been money and
research and fuckin fundraisers out the
wazoo
yeah make this not a problem and I think
worth just trying to find a way to make
women shut up and not make us feel
comfortable necessarily whereas men are
automatically made to feel comfortable
and safe imagine imagine if we were if
there was such a thing as male birth
control fuckin with their hormones and
testosterone and their mood and their
faces and their weight and shit do you
know how hard it would be to convince
someone after how many years it's been
the woman's job sorry yeah I mean if
they're fools it'd be so big and strong
and smart figure this shit out why don't
you take care of this yeah I just feel
like I'm I'm B I'm doing something
really dumb right now and I kind of know
it is but I'm also like I don't know not
not too concerned about it it's terrible
it's a bad thing
like this is not a good message for our
listeners to be having sex unprotected
without any is a form of birth control
studies fuck you oh god saying it out
loud makes it so much worse okay but
you're with someone that you trust yeah
to what degree yeah there are wait there
but I think that's what's sort of hard
is that it's a really weird to sit like
there's a lot of their sacrifice either
way yeah there's just no way that a
woman can have sex without there being
some sort of stuff yeah I also would
like want him to know that I'm all
now like putting my body again back in
the hands of like a doctor and do like
the procedure to put Paragard and
apparently fucking hurts like shit and
then have for weeks you have really bad
cramps and then for six cycles it's
heavier than usual but then it goes back
to normal and people have said it's been
in God sent and some people said it's
the worst thing in their lives it got
trapped in their uterine walls or like
it fell out and like oh I just heard
horror stories about birth control
across the board and I think men need to
know that like when a decision like this
is made it's not something that's done
lightly or easily I mean are there
better condoms you videos like are there
ones that like I know I've seen so many
commercials for like who pleasure and uh
stuff like that I don't know I don't
know I think also - it's something with
Lou like I'm not allergic to the Lube or
anything I know there's like lambskin
condoms or whatever but any kind that
I've used have irritated or given some
sort of like after effect listeners if
you're out there and you have if you
have answers for us let us know yeah
dude I feel like a fucking idiot don't
feel like I know I mean feel how you
feel
yeah I don't want to minimize your
feelings but I need to figure it out but
hey this is the podcast where I fuck up
so you guys don't have to I'm gonna
figure it out so that if you guys get
the situation like that it won't be just
your grass to bear uh yeah you met you
hung out with us this weekend me and the
DJ oh okay whatever fucking cats out of
the bag that's out of the bag he's a DJ
okay fun fact I didn't know what a DJ
did I thought they just put together a
bunch of like other like a playlist he's
like he's an engineer of music producer
he like makes all the second he makes
original songs and stuff like that so
it's kind of cool to watch it's the same
way like we watch a video being made
from start to finish I think is really
cool and like it's cool to watch him
whatever he's a fucking DJ so we call
him the DJ cuz it's a bunny and I didn't
actually know his name for a while I
know I know it yeah but you hung out
where you can't really how are you know
what you think
how'd it go that's good you guys you
fuckin rightfully so felt a certain type
of way about him yeah while there yeah I
mean I think he's I
this too I think he's cool I get totally
what you see that like seeing him I
think you guys get along really well I'm
allowed to not trust him off hundred
percent I hope you fucking we all when
we met well cuz we've met before but
what I was like after everything that's
happened this is the first time we hung
out and I just put my hand out to shake
it okay yeah I just went hello and I
like real likes naughty like a cloaca
church lady like I didn't see that yeah
and then he's like we're doing we're
doing the hug and I was like whatever
oh that he bought me beer and so I
loosened up yeah I think well I hate
saying this because I'm one of those
people where I believe if your friends
don't like a significant other nine
times out of ten your friends are always
going to be right yeah and usually
you're being blinded by something you
know and so I want you to know lined did
a big dick blindness I do I do here and
like I think you guys are all right in
feeling the way you feel cuz I felt that
way too I mean I still kind of do
there's always gonna be that see that's
that's interesting to me why because of
course I didn't like him at first but I
think that's what's weird is that like
okay if I meet someone and I'm I will if
I even have a crush on someone I'm
committed to the person yeah like I'm
like oh no I can't like anybody else I'm
committed to this person so my standards
are very different than yours but I
think that when you start a relationship
with anybody it's like like he did
full-blown shitty things yeah yeah yeah
kind of what you you know we all know we
all we all fucking know uh-huh but I
don't know I
everyone's different everyone has their
own story in their own way of coming
together and I feel like if you have a
chance for here comes get ready to be
cheesy I don't know if you have an
opportunity to let love into your life
you know take it as someone who and I'm
sorry cries at absolutely everything I'm
going off the deep brain you back okay
come out
by only your period here have a bite of
this Sam I am not eating meat and what
sense amaze but I told you this a
thousand times
okay I'm eating my I wanna buy
vegetarian and kelsey has openly you
know i am not allowing this I duck I
like I said I'm your friend and a
friend's job is to be honest I'm
bringing you back down and fucking earth
sometimes I think this weird decision of
you trying to go vegetarian you're just
limiting yourself and you're gonna put
all these restrictions on yourself and
it's gonna be a whole thing if you eat
meat no no no it has nothing to do with
like with calories or anything like that
it's more I feel bad for the animals
oh I truly feel bad for the animals and
I think about that a lot that's
different I'm like how people are like
slaughter and stuff like that like I
it's not about me being like like
health-conscious is really fuckin not
it's just I feel bad for that little pig
oh man I put this on my Twitter this
weekend but I went to a seafood
restaurant and there were two crabs
holding each other
hugging and I was just like oh no I had
a couple beers ago we'll see you're well
know on the side of my ID and they're
just like oh fuck it's a fucking crab
why right Oh God
give me a separation in Chile leave
come in fancy breeze above the punny
people raise their hands
yeah okay guys our guest just got here
you know her as the queen of the
youtubes host of not too deep with grace
Helbig shit that just gave it away guys
thanks for joining us in our little
janky
I like everything that's happening
compared to your fancy podcast how jank
is there no it's great I also have to
admit that I was so hungover yesterday
that I went on a deep BuzzFeed dive I
was watching you guys from like 2015 oh
man it was really weird stuff yeah I
feel like we've been hanging out for
last 24 hours
why are we all so hungover oh you know
just Sunday wait what's your hangover
cure literally that like laying on a
couch like admitting to myself that I've
defeated myself I'm gonna fight it yeah
just saying it's okay that today is a
wash yeah the worst is when you try and
go out and do shit and then you feel bad
cuz you can't do anything to the full
capacity yeah if I want to there might
be a time at some point during the day
that I go I need to like actually be a
human and maybe go walk on a treadmill
maybe go just be outside yeah that
doesn't happen that's okay today I don't
have a dog right good I love watching
your histogram stories of wind coos goes
and gets ticks uh yeah she's but I I
feel like dogs force you to be respond
responsible absolutely dogs I have she's
not only showing me like how selfish I
am but like how unprepared I am to ever
have a child there's so much dude I do
you want kids is that something you've
ever times mom it's something that I
used to be like very no on but lonely
now I've been like maybe don't say no
but just you know right now isn't it
yeah yeah wait your ass I have two cats
and Sam like it yeah this is the amount
of responsibility that he's like I don't
know I don't think so I've openly said
pretty often that I don't kids and I
think it would have something major in
my life would have to change right same
I'd have to convert to like Mormonism
I believe everything yeah and if a man
went through the pregnancy that I think
would be a real game-changer just that
nine months of growing an alien inside
your body
oh yes Emily how is he have growing
something what was the quote that was
like the idea oh no it was Michelle wolf
her HBO special that was like she has a
friend who only had one arm and she was
so furious that she came in with two
arms that then walked out of her it like
lived its life girl something that you
don't have and I guess that's the whole
thing right it's like I don't ever want
my kid to be better than I want kids
real bad you do I do I did a lot of kids
um now a lot I want to make sure you
have enough bandwidth to give it a very
mature I have a mature thought be early
enough like emotional bandwidth to talk
to all of my friends and keep them all
updated some just have so many friends
but I thought about that the other day I
was just laying on the couch I was like
wait a minute
at one point me with the brain I have
was inside my mind I was like like in a
fucking womb we all flopped it flush
they were cut out of a whoo we were just
in a body trough thinking your bags are
we crazy we probably were so I think I
would forgot it if I got pregnant
I think I would freak out and like I
don't know I feel like I would be on the
news as one of those women that like cut
her own baby outside have you ever heard
that I think every judge there you go I
would freak out what I did started by
accident a hotel watch I didn't know I
was pregnant I was hoping you were gonna
send me that show was insane dude that
doesn't happen to me because I want to
be able to milk that name you can't
fucking I wanted pregnant shit in front
of the ones I went with my friend who is
British and she's right
like just so pretty and British as she
was pregnant if she walks into a cold
sensuous do you won't accept this type
of card and literally everyone a cold
stone it's wet oh my god they gave it to
her for a freaking free Jesus and they
saying without tip they jacilla
they loved it because you just get to
eat just kitchen yeah I'm gonna be
British and pregnant oh that's not a
thing I can do what speaking of
pregnancy oh let's segue into our fan Q
we saved this one cuz we thought you
would be yay really uh inside oh no they
can't we have a lot of insight you react
to us yeah asking you this quick okay so
they want to remain anonymous this is
our Mike's first anonymous it could be
submitted through like email through
email through Instagram quits and
hopefully we help this poor yep she says
hey I fucking love your podcast it's
amazing I have a bit of a story question
so I suck at my boyfriend's dick
recently and this is the first time I
ever gave a blowjob and it didn't go so
great I ended up gagging and throwing up
and he was a super nice about it saying
it was okay but I feel really bad do you
have any advice on how to get through it
I mean though that you got through it
and it also like can't get worse I guess
oh that's a good point is to try and be
optimistic that gas is bad hopefully as
it gets
yeah there's a lot involved yeah you
didn't fight it yeah no he seems okay
with it and it was I mean she's probably
PTSD but I mean you did the best you
could it's all about intention right
yeah and I think like when you're
getting into sex I don't I'm more
worried about her I don't want this to
scar her like she's now I never able to
do it again right and then you associate
like puking with that so your body's
like conditioned to like anything yeah
and to like step in with sex there's
gonna be fluids
yeah there's gonna be fluids of all
types you never know what's gonna cut
like usually not puke but yeah there
will be
but it's also like hey it happened it's
hilarious
yeah I'm saying you get away from the
story the more hilarious funny and as an
adult that's kind of like a party pocket
story oh wow that's a like yeah there's
something of a lo job I puked on my
boyfriend like yeah really funny as an
adult female and like it could like you
said it could be worse you could have
had a guy that fucking shamed you it was
so gross and like I ever encounter
something like that leave them
immediately ya deserve to have their
dick thrown up on I think you should
just know that everyone has a story like
this okay feel bad you're allowed to
feel bad about it it's happened just now
you're allowed to be like ah nuts but it
doesn't mean that you'll know you'll
never suck a dick again I know that's
how you bought it since it is oh when I
left my first day no way no one tells
you no one get what to expect all I knew
from Cosmo is that they just like for
you to swallow I remember long story
short I was just like I can handle it
I've taken medicine I can do this I can
deal with this you made someone come to
your first I gave you a blowjob oh I
have so much more to this story filthy I
accidentally put gold bun on his dick oh
this story and then you it really hurt
because he thought I said or I thought
he said lotion because I thought it was
time to go to bed now cuz I tried and I
put him to good handibook
oh my god lube and I gave him lotion it
was in the dark because I was
embarrassed about my body so I was like
no no I just feel it and so if you put
that on he's just like what happened to
me and I was like oh where'd you put it
you old silly goose we clean them all up
good and then I was like well now I have
to finish oh yeah
a true testament to Kate's care thank
you god I just was like okay Cosmo says
swallow swallow but not like not that is
just like just on let's call it it was
College everyone blooms at their own
time yeah you're fucking lucky okay but
then he goes he's like I'm good it was
he cries I know I'm I'm Craig he's like
we're sure I was like I'm gonna get him
with this tell you I I did this as a
story before but what they do not tell
you in Cosmo was how much they produce
Roper then and then it panic started
coming out like oh I gotta go I got ya
and I just immediately I spit it all
about cut his dick off and then I didn't
just end there puking would have been a
compliment it would have been a step up
what I did was spirit uh back on his
dick go oh wait let me do OH
see there you go it could be way worse
honey yeah and everyone's got horror
stories like that everyone it's not a
singular issue you know um I think the
more you talk to your girlfriend's about
it to it like no more people will be
like right I have a story that I also
have to tell ya talk to a friend
this is for real talk to a friend who
thinks they're really good at blow-dryer
I think I'm really good for jobs I had I
had a I was drunk and I was like I'm not
good at them I don't like do much see
that's what I don't happen to her so but
here's the thing it's just very easy to
her tricks why are you whispering
because I'm troll okay that just
happened sorry it's all going to be
honest all right and I remember my
friend my friend showed me full we had
to do they just used a brush and they
were like in here here's what you do
with the balls and this is I mean that
also the Internet is your resource now I
feel like there's so much more
information available that if I was in
college now like ten years ago
it would have been so much more okay I
wouldn't be here no I would never have
lied the bus gonna should be sucking
dick all the time
no buts here's a tumblr parade yeah have
you guys ever watched porn on tumblr I
saw there was I looked up some tag and I
forget what tag it I wish I remembered
what it was now but literally just all
gay porn came up and I was like I didn't
even know that this was a thing on
tumblr I didn't know that I'd like terms
and conditions that like
forbid any of that or flag any that's
what I'm saying I hope to god I don't
know how Tom allure works I literally
just use it to watch porn but I hooked
up god no one could see my search
history on that shit like it felt like
really I mean the government can see
every oh yeah that guy knows what's up
hey there's all my issues that's the
deepest part of me not a the government
could see what you're doing but the fact
that you don't care because there's so
much worse happening what else is happy
any thing happen where you just like
looked up something randomly online and
then you go check your Instagram and all
of a sudden that's just embedded in your
feed from a different device yes yeah
it's like that we all probably a
microchip our brains yeah you're just
being hard about something very terrible
and Illuminati with a guy who'd congrats
[Laughter]
you to have regular sex
sorry sorry sorry
how was your day sorry one he wore a
scarf and 200-person
when someone shows you who they are you
fucking believe and ran for the hills it
wasn't even cold it did
Angeles yeah one of the one dates I went
on last year was okay but he wouldn't he
came up with some of that software that
bone intact like how long you were on
what site I feel like you're a bad
person if you do that like you're like a
parking attendant like you don't mean to
but you're just a yeah dick name like
yeah I could really excel people's
thought process advertising they're all
in black mirror this is all a simulation
we're all gonna die one day yeah he's
gonna kill us all are you do you watch
black mirror I do does it give you
anxiety it does I can only watch like
Max 2 episode it's like anyone saying
yeah it's like - I just watched the
Sanjana Parra
episode Oh which is really great but my
boyfriend talked it up it was like this
you know award-winning over and over and
over and over again so I was like so my
expectations were so high and it was
really great but it's a little right
yeah and then we watched the space oh
the first episode of the yeah and that
one was so good that I was like yeah
this one I like more than the other one
I liked the hang the DJ the love story I
haven't seen that yet okay see I'm the
same with us and repair I think being a
little overhyped we're really fun shot
really cool yeah every black mirror yeah
fair yeah
so I saw a funny tweet once I was like
black mirrors just a British guy sitting
alone in a room writing saying what if
your mom was computer wait so your
boyfriend
okay I'm going around my ballet it's fun
me I get drunk with the person now it's
really fun it makes you feel better
about your choices even though they're
probably bad choices
yeah it's great how long because I feel
like you're pretty proud like you I
respect you youtuber because a you're
able to get along with everyone and like
you're still able to do comedy which I
feel like it's hard to navigate with
like how much shit there is to make fun
of yeah and that you're very private
with your life but you're still very
vulnerable and open in public so how did
you navigate having a relationship being
a famous person well no it's and it's
still like a constant like how much do I
talk about and I'm more open in this
relationship I think because I'm more
comfortable in this relationship also
he's like a performer - I need stand-up
comics or like it's not a weird like I'm
exploiting him in any way which is
something I'm really protective of right
and I you just also watching the culture
of things you guys have seen like the
youtubers that break up and then have to
explain to an audience like he has that
to me it's like a nightmare
it's like stress on you it's habit yeah
that you oh this yeah and my friends and
I've always kind of had this silent sort
of a code that our channels are comedy
first and then whatever in our personal
lives second that we want to reveal and
so that's kind of just how I've
navigated and yeah just naturally
private so I feel like I will once if I
am like actually fully exploiting like a
reality show the grace Helbig reality
show day I will admit that I've run out
of comedy ideas that's kind of sad but I
think there's like a healthy balance I
mean let's do it - here at BuzzFeed oh
you guys feel so much of your personal
life yeah I hell I like hit a
relationship from BuzzFeed hers for like
a year dating someone and then just now
I that with this relationship I'm in now
or portal I should hook up I don't want
to call it that whatever I'm in now it's
the first time that I'm kind of bringing
people along the journey with because I
mean this podcast is all about revealing
our fuck-ups and honesty and so I feel
like I've been I didn't share some of it
yeah that's the thing to once you feel
good about the situation you're in or
like hell I have a healthy like
relationship with your relationship then
it feels almost like you're lying to
your friends may not telling them about
what's going on and you should be able
to share with you know I think
circulated yeah talking about sensitive
things because those are things that I
was like cravings so much exactly like I
remember oh man just so much of like
what's happening I was like body
positivity and like you know the
SlutWalk and all of this yeah I would
love to have heard that sort of stuff
when I was younger so I would have been
like I'm a fucking freak I would have
been like Oh what all fuckin freak I
listen to our own podcast back okay god
damn it works fucking smart and shit we
should be having me as a kid but we're
just a great older sister yeah okay so
what did your boyfriend if he has a name
think of your job like when you guys
know it was great because we had we
known of each other for years and years
that never met each other like a Venn
diagram of friends basically she's like
a circle overlap yeah and so when we met
it was really nice because I started
doing like improv comedy in that world
and he's a stand-up so he knew nothing
about YouTube and it was so refreshing
to be like you don't know what a meme is
you don't know oh my god like I
literally on a plane explain to him who
scumbag Steve was Oh a beautiful moment
of being able to relive stuff so the big
gift you gave me I know I'm also like
just watching him do stand-up he's
really great at something I've never
done stand-up I'm terrified of it so
it's a really nice balance
in ink and just having someone that
doesn't understand the space but doesn't
disrespect it and it's still like
understand yeah slowly getting a hang on
it but also from that traditional world
that doesn't like shit on ya yeah I feel
like a lot of people shit on YouTube I
think mainly because of not people like
sitting at this table but people like I
don't know we could cut this book at all
as I fucking ate well you don't have to
talk about that cuz you're the first
like baking super we've had on like
politics like a fall just like what
I watched that video you and mamrie did
that was so funny where you guys Oh
reality yeah reacted to that and then
also where you talked about like
different youtubers like the ants yes it
ants but a fun filter like that's really
is so smart as Miranda cuz she basically
gets to say everything she wants to say
but Mildred through a character and it's
like you can't be offended yeah cuz this
character so unlikable and so the ants
have become kind of that for me yeah
which is really nice because right now
no one knows what the fuck is going on
it's hard to comment yeah you were part
of the original like og youtubers come
up and yet to watch how it's changed
like does it make you sad happy proud it
disgusted a little bit of everything
right cuz it's one of those things where
we there was just weird like magic I
think era where everyone just sort of
like happen to find themselves making
content as a job and it was like pure
and everyone's intentions were such from
a place of gratitude and being able to
do this thing and then like you know
traditional media when people realize
that acting is a job and then they
realized I'm gonna do that because I
want money fame etc there became like a
playbook becoming a youtuber and so all
that like genuine pure joy kind of
dissolved into now a business model yeah
and so it gets a little bit yucky but it
also you know you have to be pragmatic
about it that that's just what's gonna
happen in an industry yeah especially
one that was became so influential like
overnight seemingly and so I'm just
thankful that like I went to college I
have skill sets that exist outside of
you have and I think a lot of young
people that want to be youtubers think
I'll just do that and then I'm set but
that's not the reality not at all
yeah I'm have to be able to like
function in a world that's the creative
world not just as a youtuber yeah and it
what YouTube has we come to young people
it's so much bigger than it was to us
like it's their news you know Twitter is
there right Fox CNN like Thursday nights
on NBC we watch friends yeah and now we
don't have that
watch music at night y'all really fucked
up day night we had all that but then we
have like there are these beautiful
moments on YouTube right I remember like
when I was in college and I saw like Bo
Burnham's videos oh yeah you've got to
be kidding me you did it right he left
YouTube before it got gross it went to
the dance I'm like it's making really
profound stuff but like how do you feel
about that right because I think a thing
to a reason why people stay and believe
and BuzzFeed is because we know that you
could certainly go do the traditional I
mean like you had a TV show like you've
done that kind of vertical but there is
sort of we're also trying to figure out
how to make traditional more digital
right so we're because the advertising
dollars are still in traditional media
how do we find that balance you know how
do we make it the next Netflix or Hulu
or whatever we're people I think in this
walk I mean it does come down to like
YouTube is a brand there are people that
work in an office for YouTube and that
are handling things in ways that people
don't necessarily agree with right now
and so it does come down to like the
company itself taking ownership and
consideration of like the environment
that they're called jacketing and we're
essentially all employees to YouTube
like YouTube is my you know company that
I work for and so as my boss they have
to like work in a way with my co-workers
and yeah makes the whole environment
thrive and so when there is like an
issue like a logan polish it's like any
office space where someone fucks up in
your office and your boss you have to go
boss that's you have to handle that like
i like HR right exactly and so that's
the weird things that people think
you've youtube is this like amorphous
like cloud that we all know when it's a
real company that has to like handle
their employees the way that the other
corporation should yeah it's it's really
bizarre I think the cool thing is and
this is my hope because I think 2017 was
like a year that in talking to a lot of
my friends that are content creators we
all were just like what the fuck are we
doing and there's a lot of like burnout
yeah I'm sure we do a couple like
retreats with YouTube throughout the
year and there was a lot of focus on
like mental health like taking the time
off of the internet which I think speaks
like the larger issue of like
I've been doing this for a decade and
there is gonna be a burnout and that's
emotionally and you know physically
what's happening to a lot of people and
it's important to step away and think
where am I in the world right now but
with that I think people are starting to
step away to get clarity and come up
with ideas like the beginning stages of
YouTube that are new and like nuances
like that you would say yeah that's I
think we're amazing now is like what was
remember that like foreign feeling of
being excited about loading a video
rather than feeling like you have to
yeah it's a job yeah now we're all I
think kind of dialing back and figuring
out at least for myself I know I'm
trying to like figure out what is the
new cool exciting thing that still
exists in a world that kind of crosses
traditional and new media at the same
time and what does that look like and
it's all question marks but yeah it
could be cool it's the Wild West people
call it like what does make you excited
like what are you watching what do you
think something listening to are you
reading anything neat well which
wrinkles your fans cold case true-crime
hog heaven yeah I just listen to dirt
done a couple months ago it's great I
also just arted this into someone know
something
oh I heard about this wine it's good
there's not closure oh that's the only
thing cuz dirty John is such a full
story yeah it's insane that's why
unsolved does so well on BuzzFeed
because I mean at the end of the day
yeah one knows it's gonna be unsolved
but there is something you get where you
we can make it your own you you everyone
thinks it their genius
so you play along that you're like I'm
gonna figure out this murder mystery
yeah yeah to the point that I heard a
podcast recently that had ads for you
know the subscription yes it's like
naturebox this I don't want to do that
to and all you guys haven't got this
body and open dinner you know I have it
but I'm saying how you guys have it
seems like a real easy thing we're just
now getting into the ad space like we
just started recording our first ads in
our space we ask questions I've got like
third love blue a brand blue
and I use it do you we get our first box
next week this is not mad but they
sponsor my podcast and I genuinely love
them that's really great to be in the
kitchen yeah they make you feel like
you're really good at cooking said no
woman ever what I meant was I can't like
to eaten fuck yeah
sorry um okay how do you guys my
question to you guys cuz you're you're
in the digital space but you're under
the umbrella buzz yeah I mean you guys
see something like Logan Paul happen in
the space and how does it affect like
you guys on a personal level and as a
company like blood did you guys like
have any like meetings about that we had
sort of internal like no one called a
meeting yeah but we it was something so
naturally that we all just kind of
talked over our company chat or like in
person about it because I think people
do look at us to have some sort of
response especially because Kate and I
have talked so much about like mental
health and that being a big vertical
that BuzzFeed does try and cover a lot
um I don't think we gave any like
official company statement and that's
always weird when you do work for a
corporation where you have to monitor
how you speak about it you would agree
cuz like also what's made us successful
as being unapologetically our own brands
right
I would never want to get the company in
trouble but I also don't think it's ever
come to that where people so strongly
think IRAs feed so hard that I I can't
separate myself versus we're like our
news vertical they have to be really
careful about like with a tweet yeah
yeah yeah I don't I think that I don't
know how you do videos every week smells
of love it's like I I'm not I'm very
much away from YouTube like I've
understanding all of this so I don't I
don't really know like the the politics
I don't understand a lot of it this look
even working here at BuzzFeed I was
really excited because I got health care
and I got a paycheck
yeah great cuz stand-up is really really
hard and I think I'm dying and so I
tried really hard just cannot censor
myself when I do think things about
people but it's hard to
like oh I do work for a company you know
like I tweeted at Logan Paul because I
think he's a piece of shit and I think
that he that errand boy did within three
weeks like and this is just my opinion
just Kate's opinion I'm not speaking for
anyone else yeah I think he exploited a
very sensitive topic for more money
yeah oh for sure yeah I literally had to
I shot a video of myself saying
everything I honestly felt about Logan
Paul and then I put that footage in the
garbage because I needed to get it out
yeah but it's true and my biggest like
concerned about his like come back to
YouTube is that it's not just him right
there's a did the editor go through the
training because he shot this video 22
days after shooting his first video and
that shoot that he did with you know the
head of the suicide prevention hotline
and the guy that wanted to kill himself
on the Golden Gate Bridge
like that's a multiple - ooh yeah so the
22 days weren't spent in solace thinking
through what he did that was a Bedford
he are fucking just packaged and it's
like did when did your editor that
originally said it was okay to upload
that video go through this whole
conversation with all these people with
you did your assistant that was in the
woods with you that your other friends
over in the woods with you did your
producer did your agent yeah and you did
all of these other people things yes yes
my heart about this whole thing is that
I've watched people like you and Hannah
and Beau and stuff go through youtube
and use it in such a positive way to
like channel their creativity and be
like this is what I want to make and
yeah and this is how and and people feel
connected and like helped and like a
little bit more loved and then I feel
like you guys were in that moment where
you did it because you loved this thing
right and now there's this whole culture
of people doing it just to be famous and
they're putting all of their morals
aside just to get a certain amount of
the views and I understand that that
makes money but I just feel like that's
the evil yeah it's disingenuous
inauthentic and it's affecting people
that are actually influenced by this
thing yeah this is real man it's crazy
how fucking crazy
their fans are yeah that's the saddest
part that gets me like actually sad just
like thinking about how these people and
I watched Phil DeFranco Halle on YouTube
cause I think he does a really great job
of presenting news as unbiased as he can
while still kind of you know flirting
with his opinion here and there and
his major point about the Logan Paul
situation was it's not about him it's
about like the ecosystem and how before
the video even got taken down 500,000
kids liked and it was still monetized -
and his apology was monetized it was so
mishandled by so many things but the
bigger issue is that he has an audience
of just rabid young young impressionable
shit right that think that he's their
savior he's this God he's this like
deity that does everything well and when
he fucks up he apologizes and look how
better he is and then else and it's like
there's a core issue that's wrong with
what's happening yeah I just it feels so
weird to me it feels like the same thing
he feels like a cigarette and you're
just handing him out to get ya cuz
you're like they'll be hooked they'll
buy the merge to look as good and
they'll be because you wouldn't your kid
you are desensitized to stuff you say
shitty things you're in addition to
things but you're also 11 right and you
remember that was like cool older guy
everything as a child you want to be in
or you think you want to be in Casey
nice that tweeted about his video that I
thought was great that he's like I
understand what people would have
reservations it's gonna be like a
journey and watch it yeah what he does
from here the intentions behind
everything are gonna be a more important
thing to watch than just now he
apologizes rape now fuckin with Japan
country thing he did I don't want this
whole episode to be about him cuz I hate
him so we could like move on to anyway
cuz people have been asking us but I you
talk about it I do think it's like this
is how I don't look this is why I don't
believe his actual like the video about
being like oh I wasn't aware about like
I'm aware of suicide it's like that was
the main thing wrong with your video the
rest of you going around Japan
everything else is yeah my missions as
though you were able to just gloss right
yeah yeah that I saw the video cuz I
stopped watching this videos a while ago
and I saw that came out it was like yeah
he showed a dead body but also this is
what he had been doing leading up in
Japan the whole time that you're like
smashed that Gameboy and then went back
to the store and the guys like it's just
total disrespect of the country they is
not where you live
and yeah if when you're there when
you're going to other countries you
represent your country I mean Americans
like what that's gonna be our
representation for like young people to
to look at and to think that that's okay
and learn from it just a little sad
right that someone that is likely so
uninteresting that they have to do
things like that to think they're
interesting like that you can't enjoy a
country they'll find it interesting
because you're a whole formed human yeah
smash game boys and like the fuck with
like people that don't speak your leg
yeah because everything else you doing
is not entertaining and I I don't know
why I keep thinking about like the
Kardashians when we talk about this
because it's not the same but I keep
thinking about when that first came out
and how people were like oh what is this
trash reality to you and now I've been
watching for whatever 15:46 like a
couple weeks ago yeah I I knew
everything about it but I was like on a
plane I had nothing else so watching
yeah I'm fascinated right and like
they're problematic as fuck like just
between besides all the cultural
appropriation and shit like that's
happened but they also have done a lot
of good and I feel like it's it feels
very manicured and catered when we do
see them doing you know stuff for
charity or whatever right um who they
are as actually people bought you know
cameras off we don't know but I feel
like that was our version sort of Logan
Paul where it's like we're giving these
people this platform and we're still
giving them our money and I feel like
they have changed a little bit like they
do now include in their episodes stuff
like where they go and they talk to like
Planned Parenthood or they go yeah I
talked to in Konaseema 30 move a lot I
do feel the differences they're really
self-aware about the fact that they're
manufacture yeah and I think Logan
thinks he's just a normal dude that
started from the bottom and now he's
here and it's like but you everything
you've done is completely manufactured
when you I have a my big issue with the
Internet and a lot of people will
probably think differently is I'd never
say I love you to fans or to an audience
and a lot of people would be like we
look like there's a very disingenuous I
think level of like I just tell my
audience I love them and then they'll
keep watching really like an act
well I have such appreciation and
gratitude for anyone that spends a
second watching anything I put online
asking them to watch yeah but there's a
weird like culture of having to tell an
audience you love them that's the point
and it's so bizarre to me and maybe I'm
just like a repressed English girl like
I just I've always thought that that's
so disingenuous and I have a lot of
content creator friends that really love
what they do they really respect their
audience base and like have genuine like
love for as a great representation that
and but I watched so many young
youtubers it's literally like they're
checking off boxes like say goodbye have
an outro say I love you to the audience
and there are real emotion that people
like thrown at me I think the motive is
what it could write like what we love
they love what they give you my heavenly
love saying I love you to the people who
listen to this yeah cuz I only get the
messages I read the messages on
Instagram and I'm like first of all I
just freakin love women for being so
open I'm like all sharing and whatnot
and it's like a very vulnerable thing to
do and I think it's really cool that
people have like that platform or
whatever but I I guess yeah I guess you
could just get I mean maybe okay I think
it just depends on where it's coming
from
I love you guys now tell your friends
about right do you find my March cuz I
love you yeah I guess there's a weird
sense of intention behind it yeah like I
believe that you truly read all of your
messages and like get a sense of
inspiration and like empowerment from
having a dialogue with an audience but I
think there's a lot of young youtubers
and yeah well that want to be content
for your so just see it as like a wig
what you have the same way you say
goodbye to someone is you know tell them
that you love them and I'm like does it
I don't know there's a different thing
like you can be a bad person and still
like podcasts a lot of asshole messages
too on top of the gospel someone asked
me the other day have like not not
someone I don't know like someone I know
from back home how to become an
influencer
how do you feel about that word um I
don't know how I feel about any words
subscribe I've never known every I've
done a ton of interviews with they're
like what do you call yourself and
queries yeah exactly uh a barrel and I
don't know I never know what like the
right and I'm sure you guys get this too
because you guys are one people
production teams you guys knew
everything you didn't think what is your
title it's like like digital creators
like editor fucking free witch hat what
day is it what project yes I do I think
influence that I mean there's such a
like a cringe to the idea like youtuber
in that but I'm trying as an adult to
take that away and let myself realize
that that's just what it is and you do
have influence oh yeah an audience yeah
respect so that is what it is yeah
it just hasn't been that guess like a
mmm cooler title and like it insinuates
that you do things for money
and I think is a big difference between
what we do and what someone who you know
like the Logan poll or whatever does
write money yeah I think that there's
like a shallowness implied when there
are just like a very like yeah Hollywood
as sort of like I don't know we got
loyalty big loyalties that matters that
matters to me that matters in my heart
yeah I think I know I do think that that
like eventually like going back to I
think this is a moment where hopefully
like the disingenuous or the side of
YouTube starts to get who knows but my
hope is that it starts to get filtered
out a little bit and an audience's start
to become more like cognizant of the
people that they're watching and laugh I
hate myself though because well I just
hate myself because I know that India
puts out another video I'm gonna watch
because I want to see how he's handling
it right what a bad publicity right and
it's also but I have Dirk because I'm
with you I watched half of the one that
he most recently put out and then I just
couldn't ya heart hurt but it's also
part of your job to be aware yeah
happening in pop culture Indian culture
so I try to tell myself that's why I'm
watching it yeah so like you were
watching a train wreck happen to you
away and you can't look away the thing
is to me it like Logan to me I've always
said even
like his younger brother Jake was
getting and all that's like hot water
about things that Logan Tamizh the
smarter brother yes way like he actually
just caught it nose like I've met him
before and been around him before and
he's very business minded he's really
savvy that way and so it is fascinating
to me to watch someone that is I don't I
don't think he's like dumb I think he
makes dumb mistakes but I think he's
smart and so I'm watching someone that I
forgot he's only 22 Wow I kept think he
was like 27 yeah hey my 1e fuckin - yeah
and like watch it kid you hope like
Casey had tweeted like we'll see what
happens
yeah I don't want to write them off
completely cuz I do think he's smart and
we'll see what happens there's so much
time I've made a difference it makes me
anxious cuz I can't imagine being 22
with that sense of like control and
power and responsibility and like I
wonder how many people are telling him
now right that he surrounded himself by
a bunch of yes man yeah it's like at
some point
who's your voice of reason like his dad
was posting videos after that I mean
like you never know gang down and all
this like it's a lot of layers is it is
there like ever a point where it's like
we've kind of lost him he's too far gone
I think that happens with a lot of
celebrities like there's too many yeses
around you that knows like that you
don't know any Spears shave your head
Lindsay Lohan lost her mind
yeah if people are kept in these weird
bubbles of their own like
self-righteousness I'm gonna react
eventually and then the not being able
to trust anybody
yeah that's gotta be it so in a way I
feel kind of bad friends yeah it was
like at least I know I have good
relationships in my life and at this
point he's got to be questioning every
relationship yes everyone yeah I mean I
think keeping friends like a good
support group and like grounded on young
people yeah absolutely and I mean we
talk about this all the time like we
have no problem telling each other when
we like fuck up or say something like a
dick move or like back to each other
yeah one of you got it yeah if you ever
get too big to like disregard people's
beliefs or me down my mouth and like I
would say anyway
throw me into Mormonism and maybe I will
have a baby like that book you example
um you're very insightful but I mean I
know your podcast is called not too deep
like I usually bastion to say girl it's
using my brain what are I think that's
what this whole conversation started as
Bentley what are some things that you
would recommend to people to watch them
maybe I don't know it doesn't get a lot
of attention that should get more or
that makes you happy that one weird
thing no one knows to watch I mean one
like I told you guys I've been watching
BuzzFeed videos and getting just like
really inspired by just like it's just I
don't know these people they're
listening I already know all of this but
I just are watching lady like yes I got
really big on a try guys kick and then I
started watching ladylike and it's been
really great and I just had this kid
named Steven septic on my podcast who
does sugar pine seven which is the fuck
is that it's awesome you know it makes
me I have to watch it on a treadmill
because I get so angry because I wish
that I had thought of it today I love
that he's doing basically with a group
of his friends this like daily vlogging
but it's like scripted it's very like
Wonder Years where he voices over things
as they happen and you can it blurs the
line between like what's real and what's
scripted not in a david dobrik way but
like in an actual like narrative of
friends and it's so fucking funny yeah
and they're all like 2022 that I'm like
or 24 maybe he came from SourceFed he
was like a sourcefed hosts for a second
before that kind of closed and then
started this group and now he's under
the roosterteeth umbrella oh okay and
they're just really fucking funny
they're they just seem like good kids
yeah you that you're like I hope you get
popular cuz I think you'll do okay with
it yeah he won't look and Paul
yourselves my guys are grounded and
smart and like kind of nerds but they're
really really funny yeah yeah I felt
like we work in entertainment at the end
of the day it was hard to like blur yeah
a wine he's doing a really great job
it's like this new form of vlogging that
I'm like god this is so smart and I hope
it's like what is the new kind of
revelation on YouTube is that it's just
a really great way to combine scripted
and
like daily vlogging so what's next for
you what are you excited about yeah what
do you like want to do I feel like you
have accomplished you fucking shit man
holy fuck
TV shows fucking emerge y'all in love
what the fuck else you weird done that
you've done every day man like you
you're so accomplished well I'll jealous
I want to get back to doing scripted
stuff I think I'm trying to take time
now to like write more and to like
collaborate more with people and sort of
like YouTube is a fun thing to do but I
want to now figure out like what's a
scripted series that I can think more
braid into my YouTube and like mamrie
and I are working on a show together
which should be really fun I love that
yeah which is really exciting and I
don't know why we haven't done it sooner
but it's in the work so that all come
out soon excited a yeah I want to do
more scripted stuff I've been it's been
a second since I've done any of that and
it's been like playing myself on my
youtube channel role for a while is how
your bachelor thank you oh my god I'm
obsessed with the bachelor did you guys
watch this I just got into it like two
or three seasons ago so I mean I watch
unreal I love unreal it's so good it
almost ruins watching about it that like
this is not there's a producer Ross
camera settings on this line yeah but
it's fascinating to watch in that regard
too because you're still like how do
these girls still do this and go through
this way I wanted to ask you what the
weird obsession will not weird what the
obsession with wrestling is with you oh
yeah I always see ya watching it or
doing something at it last night it was
great what it where did that start oh
that's such a big part of your life so
when I was younger my older brother nice
to watch wrestling but then randomly
like two years ago a year ago
WWE reached out to my manager and was
like would grace want tickets to wrestle
me or to a Monday Night Raw at the
Staples Center and I asked mamrie's like
of course we're going oh so we went with
our friend Jerry and then literally it
was like it's the best theater I've ever
been to it's fun and it's also so
because there's like this whole culture
around it that's sweet even really even
people are booing and saying you suck
and like throwing middle fingers up to
all the wrestlers this is weird like I'm
like this is where they get to do this
yeah like this really sweet supportive
system it's really cool so we've just
gone down the rabbit hole and gotten
obsessed so I love when people love it
so much it's like when you go to
Renaissance Faire oh oh wait not
Renaissance we went to medieval time
yeah but that's my also I'm a big
advocate of medieval - oh - girl I threw
my birthday there this year like thirty
drunk thirty year olds I went through
awesome night yeah in New York we took a
friend that turned 30 and a bunch of our
friends and like at the end we were like
yeah let's get two kilo shots and I
realize that like patron shots are like
30s like $15 each we're like no no no no
no but it's so much fun it's so funny

ask the waitress I was just like when
