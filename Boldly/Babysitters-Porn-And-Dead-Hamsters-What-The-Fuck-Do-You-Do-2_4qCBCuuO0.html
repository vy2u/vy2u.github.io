you don't actually know how to parent
until after you've parented this is a
series where we show real live everyday
parents different scenarios and ask them
how they'd respond if it happened in
their life because when it comes to
parenting we're all kind of asking what
the heck would you do I am a mother of
an adorable - you're a little boy I'm
the father of a seven-year-old the
parents - two-year-old Eli and four
month old little I have been a parent
for five years already since I was 16
I've been planning for 14 years we have
two kids uh almost four-year-old and an
almost one year old
daddy lies our hands for not moving
what's a few oh the hamster died we
don't trust our kid with pets our oldest
daughter right now cry when the pumpkin
died at Holloway I thought I wouldn't
ride it yet daddy sleeping sleeping
hamster sleeping until when you have to
be ready to answer those kind of
questions
and when they're that age it's hard for
them to understand it the concept of
death the hamster went to another place
the little hamster is not going to be
with us anymore they won't see the
hamster again
yes you probably wouldn't take it well
but we wouldn't hide it we definitely
don't like to replace it and try to do
that whole thing but we can probably
find another one for you or maybe you've
been good and let's get a dog there's a
lot of death and Disney movies so she
understands it alright guys that was
interesting let's see scenario number
two we're at home early hey so how did
everything go huh hmm no that is not
what it looks like how was dinner
that was no porn no that was not porn
it um two people having sex on camera
do you do I'm so disturbed by this
that's just ripped out but yeah I
probably smack them first of all our
nanny is like it or mid-60s so if this
happened that would be really odd I
don't know what I would do in that
situation I mean I guess we want to want
them in a house anymore to watch our ki
one of the kids were awake but I mean if
the kid is asleep I guess it can't be
that bad you have to know the people
they who you living your child with you
I don't understand I don't believe it I
don't believe this would ever happen I'm
telling you he or she probably teenagers
are going to that phase we've all been
through it so just pretend to enjoy a
good happy yeah pretendin hub yes I
would still pay the listen say please
leave and I'll never call you again I
will talk to her and tell her that's not
something you do at somebody else's
house if she was some teenage babysitter
from the neighborhood and we caught them
doing that I think we would have to talk
to her parents well that was their
thoughts let us know in the comments
what you would do about those scenarios
and if you've got any parenting
conundrums that you want us to weigh in
on we're here for you on what the would
you do
parenting is hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
