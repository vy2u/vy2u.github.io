night because the snakes will come after
you I grew up with very superstitious
people my mom is like the superstition
Queen oh yes my parents are very
superstitious my mom used to tell me
that if you took pictures in groups of
three the person in the middle would die
first my mom told me that all rock music
was the music of the devil and if I
listened to it that the devil would eat
my soul when I was younger my mom used
to tell me that if I didn't finish all
the food on my plate that my wife would
be ugly and the joke's on you mom cuz
I'm never getting married my mom told me
that if I stain anything with period
blood I have to wash it immediately
because if a snake smells it you can't
have kids anymore growing up my mom told
me that if we slept in the fetal
position
we wouldn't grow properly and so she
would come in at night and if we were in
the fetal position she would straighten
us out like Dracula style it would
always be hot and we never were allowed
to use the AC at home but then our
parents would never let us go to sleep
with a fan on so we would always have to
sleep with a fan off because they would
say that we were dying in our sleep my
parents told me from a very young age
that if I cut my nails at night then I
would not be able to be there for them
when they were about to pass away my mom
told me growing up that if you stuck
your chopsticks in your bowl of rice and
it stood there and you left it there
that someone would die so I'd never even
to this day I don't even do that my mom
said never to go thrift shopping because
someone dead could have worn the clothes
before and so you would kind of absorb
their bad luck
I didn't want to believe the
superstitions growing up but my mom was
so convincing that I ended up leaving
all of them I felt like they were all
true I was skeptical when I was a kid
but I also didn't want to risk it what
if they were real I don't know you don't
know the superstitions that are
inconvenient I don't believe in I think
that now they've just become habits for
me now I've developed maybe my own set
of superstitions I don't think I'm a
superstitious person until something
weird happens and then I'm superstitious
I get that there's great prices at
thrift stores but to this day I will
avoid thrift stores because someone
might have died wearing those old
clothes or there could be diseases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
