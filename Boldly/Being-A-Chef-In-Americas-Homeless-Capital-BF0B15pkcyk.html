Skid Row and coming out here is
something I never really do because it's
so surreal and it's heartbreaking
hopefully when they come in to eat baby
happy and we forget about where they are
this that's my main goal is president
forget and think they're at a five-star
restaurant
my name is Delilah Kanin I'm 23 I'm the
senior chef at the URM the Union rescue
mission and this is my kitchen
so today Tuesday
you have big tacos right his things and
a salad just break down on my day I come
through all the coolers just to get a
vigil because I'm a visual learner on
how my day is gonna go and I also say
here because it's cold and it feels good
right now
now these look like a thousand tortillas
right now for cooking for 600 people and
everyone more than once I go so we have
me about three or four or five shells
today and these are grown grown men who
are very very hungry so right here
behind me these are volunteers will come
here and this particular group is
staying on the roof and there's been
here for a week and they're helping me
with dinner because of course I can't
cook for five minutes alone ourselves so
everything for dinner is almost together
and we're gonna have ice cream for
dessert and everything's gonna come
along as I'm ready at five o'clock I got
kind of bored working on Universal
catering it was just a point in my my
work I think I needed a deeper meaning
and I was kind of just like I'm supposed
to do all these great things but none of
these great things are happening for me
and then I got a call asking me to come
down to stay Roma I live in California
I've never been asked a row so when I
first came down here it was a little bit
of shocking if it really wasn't for my
mother I probably wouldn't even be here
she's an inspiration she's the reason
why I'm cooking she's something to stay
with cooking what kept me staying here
is definitely the children they're like
family they're like my niece's my
nephew's my sister's my brothers and I
don't want them to ever think that
they're living on Skid Row I want them
to know that school was important
the outcome is important I love working
here I love my job I wake up and not one
day I actually feel that are mad or
tired to come to work I look for it
every day coming to work I have the
coolest job in the world there's no
other job better than my job are
rewarding for that matter
I love this place and taught me a lot
and probably years from now in the
future I'll probably be building another
place like this or something like this
but this is on the way home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
