we're from Norway and he made a joke
he's like damn you couldn't even have
gone for like an Italian or somewhere
south you went for the most northern
like so the whitest of the white and
when I've been dating for going on two
years now we have been together for five
years married or just coming up on three
we've been together I want to say five
months when I met amber she identified
the street and had a history of dating
men so we were just gonna be buds let's
go skating together but through this
game together and we went skating and I
remember this moment where she was off
the ice lacing up her boot and she
looked up at me and smiled and I was
like I have to make her love me we met
in class in college a little bit foreign
opinions about who kind of was flirting
with you
I was randomly talking about movies one
day and this strange girl from across
the room started screaming about that
she had seen this movie and wanted to
get into the conversation I was doing
improv and you were doing stand-up you
did a set with your backpack on and had
braces at the time and in my mind I
noticed braces first and I thought he's
cute but it's unfortunate he has braces
because that's been deal-breaker I
remember I think a few months after we
became official I asked you if like the
first time we started talking we're like
and you said no not really it didn't
know like I wasn't thinking of race
really until sort of our family met I
think that was the first time you know
my mom was like where's Sheridan from
and it was like no no she's from New
Jersey's like no no where's she from
from and I was like that's not let's not
do this not a good topic at all I was
very cognizant
via race when we first started talking
because I have long been off accused is
the right word but people have strongly
suggested that I lean a certain way with
the people that I date which way and I
was just like no she's latina you're a
really tenuous brown but I think that
you're always aware when you start
dating somebody new of what you have in
common and we don't have in common
it is interesting like nothing that
popped up when we when she came to
Norway to visit my friends and family
like all the conversations went from
like how's it going over there how's the
u.s. how is you know how's work how's
school I'm doing this I'm doing that too
like all right let's talk about racism
let's talk about segregation everything
turned to like a catalyst to bring up
the discussions and that was my function
it was not something I thought about
before I started dating you I thought
because I have David different races and
I feel like it had never been a topic of
discussion really when we started dating
I guess I did feel a little bit of the
heat you feel sometimes yeah we live in
LA and I don't think that people feel
like it's something they've never seen
before obviously but I do feel from
sometimes from men I get the vibe like
she's got this white woman when she
could be with me it's further
complicated by the gender and sexuality
of it because it is been really that's
like the first set of reactions that we
claw I think amber summed it up pretty
great last week when she said that we'll
often walk into a space and I can see it
happening now that she's mentioned it
that people will look and go like wow oh
okay
people don't notice it and then
sometimes when they do notice it they
come on a little too
strong like hell like that one time when
we were at the train stop last weekend
and that guy was on his bicycle he saw
me he saw you he kept biking he looked
back while he was biking forward kept
biking looked back again yeah and then
went and then like - I have heard horror
stories about interracial couples and
like you know families not being ok with
it not getting along I am fine with a
few jokes here and there about how white
he is I'm fine with you know I had
twists a couple months ago and I went to
Norway and they were fascinated and all
up in my hair that is fine to me because
I know it could be so much worse
some people don't like it and some
people spend a lot of time staring and I
mean seeing amber first and seeing that
Amber's beautiful and like wanting to
say something to her or you know look at
her
and then seeing me and then registering
the disappointment and you can say that
that's wrapped up in its true wrapped up
in both sexual identity race identity
and gender identity
educating especially my family is a
little tricky because it's a weird
subjects because they don't necessarily
understand that it's sensitive the first
time shared I met my grandfather he used
an old-fashioned version of the n-word
not about her but about someone else and
it was in Norwegian so I don't even know
if she understood it here's the but it
was I the Norwegian word for Negro was a
term people use I feel very
uncomfortable when white people use the
term Negro but whatever
what is the Norwegian word for a Negro
Peter I don't want to say it I can say
it
it's Nika which sounds like a bad word
of English so while he wasn't saying the
bad Edward he was kind of saved a bad
word for sure I think you are good at
code-switching and do inhabit a lot of
white spaces very comfortably I think
that is maybe more difficult than your
giving credit for when did you realise
when the reverse happened when I went to
the cookout was a barbecue where I'm a
Georgia the people there were black I
guess you probably saw me anymore
relaxed kind of colloquial it was fine
but I was more out of my element
I have learned that although like we
could be in a restaurant or in a
customer service situation or something
like that and where I'm very aggressive
and don't really get what I want when
I'm paying for a meal I've learned that
it's not always a situation that she
would like me draw attention to bad
service or something like that even when
bad service does have casual tones of
racism to it that it's not always
important to her to necessarily cause a
scene because it feels sometimes that
you're playing in two stereotypes
sometimes when that we've gone out and I
feel like we've got that service I felt
like I want to tip well because I feel
like if I don't you know sometimes
they're like oh that's black people
never tip you know what I mean and I
hate that stereotype and it makes me
furious and we'll be sitting down and
she'll be like but this was truly
terrible like nothing came out that we
heard it was an awful experience and I
still feel like I want to leave a nice
day the only time I feel like I truly
got upset with Peter we're very lucky we
don't fight a lot we're like very in
sync in a lot of ways we didn't have our
car registered in California when we
should have had it registered it was
still with New Jersey it's registered
now so don't come after me yeah I know
they can't but it just in case still I'm
a black woman I worry about these things
we drove around for like six months with
our car not being registered in
California what it should have when I
was driving it I I wouldn't even drive
it there leaks I was so afraid of
getting pulled over and at the time my
dad was on the deed and I was thinking
oh my god they're not gonna see that my
name is on here they're gonna think blah
Kherson stole this car driving around
Peter drove around no problems
at all fell great he was like if I get
pulled over and get pulled over and so
you start to think like wow you know
getting pulled over by the cops is it
the scariest thing in the world to Peter
to me and to so many black people back I
mean could die and like it's a very
obviously dramatic example but it
happens and have data people of color
but it was in this very protected space
in terms of college like you know to me
like it's like it's not a gas station
it's not like you know a place outside
like it's very protected in that space
so you don't really get to see a lot of
it but there were a couple of times in
public where a certain situation would
happen and you would kind of interpret
it very differently than how I interpret
it or anything about the trailers
weren't even on yet like the movie
hadn't even started and I was like just
texting like right before and this guy
like was like you gonna turn your phone
off right he was a middle-aged white man
yes everyone's on their phones but he
specifically singled me out and talked
down to me and you faded away you feel a
complete so I very obediently put away
my father but I should have well I don't
know I don't need that from you but I
feel like that's what you did want from
that moment you know what just came to
mind for me is when we were in Kansas
together right and we went to that
bowling alley right and I feel like
we've gotten so used to how we are in LA
yes and how people react to us in LA but
I feel like when we were in that
environment that reaction was different
it was very much like what is that
mm-hmm I felt less safe there I felt
like I had experienced that kind of
aggression being thrown before and was
perfectly capable of handling it but I
was worried about her cuz I was like I
don't know if she's ever experienced
this before and then at the same time we
were driving around and passed by a
house with a confederate flag hanging
from it and that was a like is that real
can people like is everybody okay in
this like we drove around the
neighborhood for a minute and I think
just like picking up children getting it
I feel like I never fully expressed my
thought on this because we kind of
brought it up but when certain people
have called you out or only dating white
women to me that is really deeply
unsettling it's saying you can't date
these people only white people can date
these people do you think a lot about
with my kids like if they do and looking
more but my American is so good that no
one thinks I'm even an immigrant so I'm
like very much treated exactly like a
white man is in the US and I have no
real experience of what it is like to be
black in the u.s. my child will have
that experience and I've know I can
educate myself and he'll I have sympathy
and I can listen but I have like no real
life experience and that's weird to
think that they won't be going through
life like constantly reminded something
that I do worry about is that if my
child has fair-skinned didn't mean there
will be a suspicion of walking around I
think you're really amazing and I just
hope that we soon live in a world where
we don't ever feel any sort of shape
coming our way you know ever always look
for a person as a person I mean I fell
in love with Peter yeah as a human being
when I fell in love with Sheridan I just
got to know Sheridan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
