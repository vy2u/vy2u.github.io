a bangin body and I think the white
people of America need to see this
embracing we're gonna put each other on
magazine covers I think what makes Cate
special is her zest for life I can't
wait to put her on the cover of a
magazine she's the most beautiful person
in the world CeCe's one of those people
who's like no I'm not good at this and
then she'll like slay the game and kill
everyone in the process I can imagine
Alex on a million different magazine
covers he's got it going on my god I
think this is gonna be a really
interesting experience for us because
we're both queer women of color which is
something you don't really see typically
gonna be interesting on this magazine
cover
I want della to see how everybody else
sees her which is this colorful bright
positive ball of energy this is so fun
so I wanted to make della a total hippie
on this magazine cover as if it were
maybe some sort of ad for Woodstock a
cover shoot that I chose for Alex is
like it girl traveling the world I tell
her all the time that she's basically
like the mini celebrity from Oklahoma
this person who's come so far and gotten
to do so much and it's not because of me
and it's not because of anyone except
for herself
I could see Quinta on the cover of a
magazine that is dedicated to showcase
people's career success now that she's
not beautiful and could totally be on
like a billion other beauty magazines I
just don't think that that is where her
attention is I saw the style for Kate's
magazine covers something is alternative
and poppy and celebrating women I think
that Kate is the actual definition of
unique I don't know anybody else like
her I think people emulate her character
on movies like they make characters who
are supposed to be Kate but they won't
actually get Kate one word to describe
Cece
I would definitely use the word
powerhouse I feel like CeCe's gonna be
on the cover of like a news and culture
magazine that's like the blank number of
most influential and awesome people of
this year and should be the cover of it
I wish Nicky would see the impact that
she has on people she certainly had a
huge impact on my life and probably
people around us and I wish she would
see that I feel like I can see her like
on like a queer magazine because she's
done so much for the community
I hope this magazine cover will like
show her that that she she changes so
many people's lives and she just doesn't
even really know it but she will
alright we're about to review on each
other's magazine covers so excited what
do you think it's gonna be like I don't
know my god you look so good
I'd be like Oprah you love your quick
people try to be here oh this is perfect
this is exactly what I saw in my head
you lead by example with her amazing
work for BuzzFeed this lady isn't afraid
to speak out it's like I'm looking at
the words I'm just taking away how
beautiful this is I like it first of all
I feel like I looks bigger than the
snicker oh I've been trying to obtain
for years this is cool because it's a
little bit of like sexiness which you're
not supposed to like really have with
these kind of magazines but I think it
really fits the realm of this pretty
well thank you Kate there's a bonding
experience between us as best friends I
think so too I think that putting each
other on the front of magazine covers is
a way for us to kind of make each other
feel the way that we feel like when we
see each other like there are phrases
that you always know to be true like oh
it's all about how you carry yourself or
it's all in confidence and whatnot and
to actually have to play that out it's a
good lesson the way you see me and have
any pictured here is the way that I want
to be and I don't really look at myself
that way so it makes me feel really
happy and like empowered and like I can
be that person and you see that me and
they can have you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
