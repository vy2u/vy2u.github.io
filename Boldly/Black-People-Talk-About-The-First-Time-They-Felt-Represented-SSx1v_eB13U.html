represented in media there was a made to
video or like a TV movie called a little
princess I was maybe six the lead
character was obviously a cute little
white girl she lost her fortune and she
had to go live in the Attic and the
servant who lived in the Attic or name
was Becky they would pretend to have tea
parties she was a full person I've never
seen that before the brand-new
production of Cinderella it's so often
told and it's so often told very Whitely
seeing her at the center of the story
I'm driving it all and like wanting
things and getting those things I really
had like a visceral gut reaction to her
into it this show know was art
essentially it was just about like these
four black gay men who were friends they
talk about their trials and tribulations
with like love and sex and relationships
obviously those are like universal
things but it helps so much when you can
see someone who looks exactly like you
talking about those things and how they
navigate the author Ellen Harris my read
one of his books when I was in eighth
grade and it changed my life
he spoke about being a african-american
gay man living in America there was one
character in his book called invisible
life who was basically in college it was
trying to figure out how to deal with
his sexuality me in high school I was
going through the same thing here
marry on Sister Sister she necessarily
looked like me just loved seeing a black
girl who was smart and type-a just
really into her schoolwork and took
college applications and all that just
way too seriously like I did Missy
Elliott from like middle school days she
had the isn't worth it remember she's a
black woman in this male-dominated
industry she just had this dynamic that
I can just relate to her style was so
colorful and she really a
created the art of music and dance and
she incorporated it all into her videos
I loved it and I wanted to be an artist
Arrested Development people every day
it's back in 1992 I was 10 years old I
didn't have any concept of what you know
being black was about just everybody in
the video was celebrating dancing we are
represented in the world as human beings
I think one thing that we really need to
work on is getting more people of color
behind the scenes I think it would be
great to continue to have misrepresented
characters represented you just see
yourself reflected in the media that you
consume it reaffirms that you're a part
of society more more MORE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
