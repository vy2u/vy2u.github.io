feels
except your girlfriend is the one making
a little noise how long did it take for
her to do or make it five hours two
episodes of friends if I running out of
the house don't put makeup on people
think I'm sick and tired I think you're
under a ting how hard hair is in the
morning for guys I'm just saying fastest
I'm sure you do and make a van it's
probably ten minutes I mean I'm sure is
harder than it looks but I mean at the
end of the day it's coloring
there's no way you use all of this
depends on my date is I feel like I can
eliminate like half of this stuff right
now and still end up with the same face
just start obviously we have the
foundation obviously you have the
foundation oh I learned this trick at
Sephora well so next you want to do is
hit them with the powder no wrong so
next what you want to do is hit with the
contour no can you look at that wall for
me please thank you conceal I don't know
a concealer is what does conceal mean
it's on too thick yo relax I know what
I'm doing all right so you want to make
sure it's not you know you'll get out of
there I think the next step is the is
the contouring step you got your eyebrow
brush I left your eyelashes your
eyelashes don't you contour your
forehead
I swear on a BuzzFeed post I saw him do
it like right here we got to do the
blush now this is exhausting how long
have I been doing this I don't know how
to get this little winged thing going on
and dry oh my own oh my god yeah what
any too big I mean it looks kind of cool
all right look me oh this is Evan look
for know yeah we get your eyebrows I
need to hit that eye shadow you only use
like water I feel like you should dip
these in water like it's like watercolor
paint I'm gonna try to begin jobs off
this black magic ooh
now let's get onto the lips now you got
to go like this oh yeah I don't think
that that's that bad can you look oh
yeah
okay a little bit but yeah I'm done I
give myself a 5 out of 10 the kid did it
think you're gonna like it
ohh oh my god it's not right
oh my god are you tearing up my lips oh
you put my concealer just like in a wipe
across my forehead that you put brown on
the middle of my forehead the smoky
Havas throwing me off but it's not that
are you the same are you killed it it's
great just like to go it doesn't look
that different your weight takes 45
minutes my weight took like 15 yeah it's
crazy hard I understand why there's like
beauty schools and why there's a lot of
training that goes into this I have a
newfound appreciation for Sophia's
ability to wear makeup you know there's
a lot more that goes into makeup then we
understand I will say though when you
don't have makeup on - I still think
you're just as beautiful put that on
your face tell me it's not relaxing
oh my gosh yeah yeah oh there's like a
little lion cub is just like braising me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
