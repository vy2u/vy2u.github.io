hard but it is worth it I've never had a
perm ever always wanted one but my mom

thankful she did mama knows simplicity
is something I learned in my hair
journey and I also discovered to love my
natural curl pattern with me and my hair

know nothing I wouldn't say I'm super
versed sometimes if you pretend to know
