them get dressed right this has a
beautiful body and I have a feeling that
he will probably make the costume look
better and I did I think he is gonna
look awesome
I've seen him dressed up as a woman
before so I know he can pull it off I
think he's gonna look hot as all hell in
this costume I mean I think it's a
little more leg than he usually shows if
I had to get okay so we've got some
unfamiliar looking things on this chair
here got this thing did he's big enough
what I said Johnny Depp pirates the
Carribean Jack Sparrow I don't think
gonna get there no but it takes everyone
so long to get ready when you're a woman
I'm sweaty I have really no idea how
female garments work right now I look
like a ballerina from your nightmares
yes my boxers over here so actually you
know what
keep these on all right
hi oh you're gorgeous oh my god little
look my ears oh god your turn
Oh me it's hard to fit in this it's hard
to get dressed you know man if you put
on five pounds and you feel Scott all of
a sudden I do feel fat all of a sudden I
don't mind this it's a little like
pirate meets lady marmolada I love this
costume I think that this is what
Halloween is supposed to be about do
something that you would never normally
do and it's okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
