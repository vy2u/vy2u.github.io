do the way I feel about women's
underwear is kind of how I feel about my
own underwear I wish it didn't really
exist
if I was a girl I never had like I guess
to be the cheeky ones this is I hear
those are the most comfortable um Missa
Tom I'd prefer a thong I prefer my
girlfriend to be happy Bryce prefers
thongs but I definitely feel like they
can be uncomfortable I just think it's
funny that he feels that he would be
best in cheeky underwear but would
prefer me and a thong
he'd have to wear a thong if you like
songs I hope he can learn or at least
see how uncomfortable women's underwear
can be my hope is that Steve will wear
and have a newfound appreciation for the
constant cloth of my asshole
this is what's gonna go right behind
your butt
I never thought my life would come to
this I feel like I'm betraying my
masculinity you may hear like a snap cuz
I telling you I feel like I'm gonna
break this thing
he's right side oh yeah these are these
are just so comfy I don't like it I
don't like it
it forms around the hips which is nice
feels like the patriarchy is giving me a
wedgie
it's like guy you're at the grocery
store and you know you're picking out
fruits and you grab two apples but the
bag that the little plastic bag that you
grabbed is 20 times smaller for those of
you who didn't pick up on my metaphor
balls I'm talking about balls
your blood first er wait give me frontal
frontal have a peach oh I feel like I
need to wash my eyes out it doesn't even
cover your yoga doesn't cover anything
yeah it doesn't there's no like yeah
genitalia hanging out you know just
hairs cracked it sucked I mean he
definitely looks sexy I love the lace on
it
it's perfect color there's a half of a
ball Hey oh look a little closer okay
some skin hanging out the side okay they
don't need to know that I learned a new
appreciation for women I see my body in
a different way I guess when I'm
dressing myself I was like oh I have to
see that now usually like a box for
brief would cover that I think I take
wearing boxers every day for granted I
definitely don't feel comfortable right
now
this experience has been incredibly
painful what I've learned is that I
would never ever ever do this again
especially not with your underwear I
feel like a lot of guys would be like oh
I'm absolutely not gonna try it because
it's gonna threaten my manhood so the
fact that you this is currently
threatening my manhood right now it's
also threatening like my father
I commend Steve for being like you know
I'm gonna just do it I feel like all
couples should go through it if you're
comfortable with each other I feel like
why not
a boner in a thong I feel like you
wouldn't know where to put it I think it
was just pitch a tent like it would be
picture crap yeah so like your penis
would be a stick in the tent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
