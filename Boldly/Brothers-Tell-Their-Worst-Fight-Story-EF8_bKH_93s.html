almost broke like ah cheese for the
Collins brothers hey one two three where
the Berkowitz brothers Dean was a night
terror
I was yeah you were the worst I was
horrible but mostly for him
no so my insecurities probably stemming
from his abuse I thought we had a good
good relationship growing up though I
mean he seems that a lot of bad memories
glad that we're talking about this now
then Mexico mm classic vacation you were
on a balcony and you saw me down below
he wanted to make it seem like a bird
had pooped on me so you shot a little
suntan lotion over the balcony to try
and hit me and I like saw you up there
and I knew how clever it was I was that
made me more upset somehow it was either
that are you calling me a shrimp or
making fun of my nasal problems
how are your nasal problems now still
just as bad probably I remember the
balcony you were up on and you were like
laughing up there I needed to like cut
you down to size
roll in the ground in front of our
friends and family though and you didn't
realize the implications humiliation man
cried I don't remember but I ran away
after that he ran away in Mexico I just
was so angry my whole family I don't
know why but I wanted to make everyone
pay for the embarrassment so I just let
it go on for hours and they called the
cops and you never got blamed I never
got blamed for it even now no it's
totally on you and this is bringing up a
lot of old you got this like shakiness
in your voice like this is my lair Bay I
needed it
it made me tougher there's definitely a
fight that sticks out in both of our
minds when I was in eighth grade I was
super into collecting basketball cards
so obsessor that had a three-ring binder
and every cart had a section to go in so
you would get fingerprints on it or
anything Dean when it's my room without
me know
went through my my binder I didn't know
anything about basketball really but all
my friends at school we're talking about
this one player Kobe Bryant Kobe Bryant
goes for one player sure and I just took
the Kobe Bryant Rookie signed basketball
card out of all the cars he takes the
sign to rookie yeah right
anyway brought it to school my
quote/unquote friend at the time asked
to borrow it for the night
god knows what he was doing with it he
took it home and I never saw that card
again
neither did I I came home and because I
was so obsessed with it I was always you
know making sure everything was in
pristine order and there's a big gap
right in the middle of my Kobe
collection I like storm out of my room I
run down to the kitchen I confronted him
it turned into a game of cat and mouse
and we were just running around I'm
trying to grab at him he jumps up and as
quickly as he jumped up he hit the
ground because he hit the back of his
head on the corner of an overhead
kitchen cabinet so he was laughing and I
blacked out and I was kind of on the
ground like you know laughing with him
and then I opened my eyes I was covered
in red like I looked like Carey this is
dripping blood and I was like oh my god
you could imagine like I looked crazy
finally ended up calling my mom that we
took him to the hospital stitches
staples I mean I'm glad they put staples
in your head actually because I was
gonna be the one to do that they would
probably have a better relationship than
most brothers we've been cool ever since
real even yeah we share a lot of friends
now and like I'm not embarrassed to
bring you around anymore are you still
mad at me for it no you sure it's what
brothers do so write a passage yo my
brothers Kobe card I had open I don't
know if that's necessarily the passage
just a very good brother</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
