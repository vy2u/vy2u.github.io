Donuts just open here there is a line
all the way down the street I've never
had Dunkin Donuts before I don't I
honestly don't know what the big deal is
I've never had Dunkin Donuts before I've
only heard about Dunkin Donuts I've
lived in California my whole life that's
my first time having Dunkin donut I'm on
a diet but I decided today to break that
diet it looks very much like a cartoon I
got some tonnage my life I mean this is
definitely all like up there on the list
I'm very very surprised by like the
overwhelming pace of strawberry
I'm guessing it's like what East
Coasters feel when they have in-n-out
burger like you don't want to admit that
it's not good but you're like damning
it's really good definitely top two
definitely top two I have one complaint
and that there's not enough cream I want
to bite my first bite should just be
filled with cream
so they prep your coffee for you which i
think is super ballsy because it's like
you got to be a person of certain
interest when you like coffee like
certain amount of mugs are now sugar
East Coast people must be really lazy
like they can't put cream and sugar in
their own coffee all my East Coast
friends are like the coffee is okay but
you haven't had Dunkin Donuts coffee in
a morally good so here you go
I feel the sugar I feel of sugar for
sure it's really creamy the nice mild
roasts that you can actually taste the
flavor of the beans it's not it's not
terrible this is like top top tier of
the low tier so this is the sausage egg
and cheese on a croissant I think that
it'll probably be a pretty good
breakfast sandwich but I don't think
it's gonna like explode my mind or
anything look how big that is that's
crazy
I like it you can actually see the yolk
in there like right there that's that's
a yolk that's real yolk there's a lot of
butter which is fun in LA it's like
we're all trying to watch what we eat
and stuff but this is worth north
breaking a few rules it's great the
croissant is a pretty good upgrade over
all the other breakfast breads it's good
you know what I didn't get that I just
wanna be like it's okay it's mediocre
but it's good it's really good these
coasters you're right this is delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
