naturally I like money
so when BuzzFeed asked me to come in for
one week to do a video about the 1% I
said what if I can do a video about
becoming the 1% first I discovered you
need over four hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year to be in the 1%
in the state of California then I
discovered there are 52 weeks in a year
making it nine thousand dollars a week
necessary to be in the 1% I decided I
needed some help so I searched the
internet for the only financial advisor
I could find who had TV credits then I
invited him to my office but BuzzFeed
wouldn't allow me to have an office so I
needed to create one when he arrived I
cut to the chase what percentage of the
population would you say is one
percenters the good news is it's
probably it's probably right about 1% I
want enough money to be in the 1% okay
in one week this is where this whole
thing is going with you're trying to
start a business and make 9000 this week
yeah
do you want in no I'm not thinking that
get-rich-quick kappa god they could
actually make money type of guy
long-term she actually built well he
wasn't useful to me at all
then I had an idea what if I went on
Craigslist and typed in make money I
found a lot of opportunities that went
nowhere but then I found something
incredible 200 designer sunglasses for
250 dollars hey yeah this is Barry I'm
totally interested in in doing this
sunglasses deal where are you located in
the LA area okay yeah we're on the way
there now I met this guy at his place of
business turned out it was a very
unusual looking video store in a
terrible area I was about to become the
only member of the 1% who got there with
a trash bag full of sunglasses
I tried selling first to major retailers
in bulk but that's apparently not how it
works although there was a great moment
where a sunglass hut employee told me
how professional I was which was lost
because an intern forgot to record audio
then I figured I should sell to the
people who have the most disposable
income and fashion sense employees of
BuzzFeed
sunny you feel like it's really bright
in here no good are your eyes okay you
want to try on a pair of sunglasses I
look great in those glasses yeah you let
you listen to rap yeah I sold these to
Tone Loc Phish Phish brand you want me
just leave that there you take a look at
it you sure it's designer all right ten
in the tent you got it
I mean I'm ten bucks I know I don't have
any cash on me right now
well where's the where's the nearest ATM
yeah I don't feel comfortable I'll do
barter man how much does that Mouse have
found probably you take this about
somebody I'm trying to work okay I'll
give you ten cents cuz that might be
with it in my suit you're so funny
seemed like I was missing something I
couldn't make a cent and I was in the
hole for $250 I needed a quick way to
make my money back
I took a tour of a sperm bank before I
got right to the jerking so each one of
these large tanks can hold up to 20,000
vials of sperm it's violet before one
insemination so it hits the air and just
starts instantly turning it won't hurt
you it just isn't that sperm
that's not sperm that's just liquid
nitrogen vapor so it's not like the
movies where you walk in the door and go
into the room and you get a check out
the door we're gonna look at your
educational background three generations
of family medical history STD testing I
don't have that stuff anywhere totally
please so if I wanted to do this right
now and fill out the application right
now and do it is it am I unable to do it
now if I have done the deed in the last
48 hours
yeah we asked we were asking you to
abstain from ejaculated for 48 hours do
you want to get a full specimen want to
really know what you got you don't sell
yourself short yeah you know but
apparently my man juice just wasn't good
enough this was starting to become
hopeless but then I remembered I'm an
artist art is my passion I need to
exploit that so I decided to make an art
piece that I could sell for $9,000 I
used what I had available to me and what
I could find laying around in the
BuzzFeed office PVC pipe tape chicken
wire and of course 200 pairs of
sunglasses my vision was set so I
employed a bunch of BuzzFeed interns to
do the rest for me and then voila I had
it my masterpiece growing shade
all I needed now was an official artist
to give it the seal of approval well
thank you so you're gonna certify it you
just look into the catch just say I'm
Sarah Ruben professional artist and I
certify that this piece entitled
throwing shade is art and worth $9,000
if you do without your hand but as the
end of the week approached sales were
low I started to think maybe I'm wrong
maybe I'm not a chosen one maybe the 1%
is an exclusive club of geniuses that
I'll never be allowed into then a
BuzzFeed employee whose name I don't
remember approached me and told me that
the world is so insanely poor that just
being an American who makes $48,000 a
year puts me in the 1% worldwide I did
it in only one week I became the 1%
because I figured out that the world was
so poor Thank You America and Thank You
BuzzFeed
