this one's large and in charge gapping
back-fat and boob overflow as Tim Gunn
once said a proper fitting bra is
important yes but how do you know if
your bras the right size it's ladylike
and today we're trying third love a boob
measuring app my relationship with bras
is pretty anti-climatic there aren't any
crazy stories there's no highs or big
lows bras don't like me I don't like
them I like how it makes my clothes fit
but they are so uncomfortable I call
shenanigans on this app I don't think
it's gonna work at all if we have a car
that can drive itself I feel like we
have an app that can tell me what size
my boobs are I have faith that it will
figure it out or at least it'll figure
it out better than I have it's a pretty
looking app the first thing on the
screen is like would you like to buy
some bras so basically it just asked for
my band size now it's asking for my cup
size I think it's a 40 double D we want
to try to trick it and see if it knows
that I'm not an a-cup it will go with D
for right now it's my hair in a bun no
it is not alright size me up first photo
position
it is it's tilted so drag and pinch the
photo to place the blue line over the
widest part of your best y dislike from
mahtim now I feel like I could have
bought a bra and then hated it and it
bought like a better fitting bra by the
time I finished this app I never look at
my boobs this might now let's take this
side photo drag and pinch the photo to
place the blue line over the widest part
of your bust this is like playing
connect the dots with yourself and
losing oh it's calculating my
measurement it says that I should be
wearing the size what I'm currently
wearing it recommended a 34b this app is
a load of crap it says that I'm a 34 eh
and so now we know that it just tells
you that your size is whatever you put
into it I don't know if it's cheating or
not we'll see how it measures against
the actual tape you'd be coming in at
like about a 32 33 yeah I was I would
say that's about a D Club cuz I can tell
about the fullness at the bus it's
measuring out of 32 32 v 32 V okay
yeah I'm measuring a 40 TT if you didn't
free enter your measurements into the
app I would be a lot more impressed
because even though it gets a 34b which
was still wrong at least it would have
guessed close this can't beat that human
touch if the app can spit out a number
but if you measure at a 32 and that's
exactly what you measure at you could be
feel more comfortable at a 34 it's all
about your comfort and what you want so
it's always good to just try on
different sizes don't follow precise
numbers follow what makes your body feel
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
