to be completely honest well it's day
one and I'm struggling already
having alcohol is always a really good
social lubricant and having that taken
away from you I think sometimes can make
you or me actually feel a little bit
more anxious about those environments
it's gonna be tough if anyone knows me
they know that I like the occasional Bev
wah I don't drink a lot but I do drink
socially so I think that's more what's
going to kind of trip me up I think one
of the things is when you're working you
really look forward to having a relaxing
drink at end of the day often times the
first week was both easier and harder
than I thought it would be obviously was
the days when I went to socialize that
it kind of bothered me more I woke up
this morning feeling like I had a
hangover that was really good I found
that the very first week was really
quite difficult it's more of a habit
thing it's more that I'm used to
finishing up a really long day at work
going home and having a couple of beers
to chill it's kind of my go-to it's kind
of like you feel a little bit like a
party pooper in a way I think it was
just one of those shocks to the system
everything was drying out in my body
yeah it was hard my mum and my dad have
both commented that I look better that I
sound better that I'm in way better mood
and it's almost like you know oh my god
actually it's true you don't drink and
you feel better that first week was
difficult but you know it's becoming
easier to be honest I actually feel like
it's getting harder day by day rather
than drink alcohol I now go to Bunnings
at night so last night I went to a
hardware store to kind of entertain
myself and bought some plants so that's
my life now tired of it I'm really
looking forward to drink
I think Australian culture in general is
like really heavily geared towards
drinking people who like aren't regular
drinkers or who don't drink for
religious or personal reasons like they
would know like if you do not a drinker
and people kind of look at you strangely
and like whole what's wrong with you it
just gets harder and harder every day
I'm actually finding it way harder than
I first thought
miss over it it's actually easier than I
thought I've snuck in
um a drink when I was down in velvet I'm
really excited to go to a party on
Friday and have some fun with my friends
and colleagues who have also been doing
drive away I think it would be really
exciting to kind of get past that
experience all together so soon now so
soon we've been moving office it's super
stressful I'm really looking forward to
having a drink I don't need or stricking
and except that look a little bit is
alcohol really the most important thing
our lives I don't think is so it's been
a good kind of test of will the biggest
thing that I've taken home from this
experience is just how privileged I am
firstly to be in a position where I have
access to alcohol whenever I want and I
use it as a crutch I really admire
people that don't need that you're not
drinking for 31 days shouldn't be a
massive deal because there are people
although not as well-off and if you
can't not drink alcohol for 31 days I
think it's a little slight on your
character and I think that really it has
been a slide on mine I haven't managed
to fundraise that much at least it's
something
so that's bloody awesome I'm really glad
that I've learned this about myself
because it's something that I probably
did realize was as crucial as I do now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
