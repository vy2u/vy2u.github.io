stun yeah I'm gonna I'm late - laughs
one more time because of this one will
mean you're at the Muir's doctor
cornfields will kill me you oh I
just got this eyeliner and it's already
dried out it was like $200 at Sephora
 my butthole with a rusty knife
okay why would you spend $200 on an
eyeliner because it's my money and I
work for tips and I want good eyeliner
okay how's that any different than you
buying 15 Doctor Who teeth don't hate on
the who I know it is really hers
when you tell me what I can and can't
buy just say no I wasn't I was just
saying that I wouldn't buy that but
you're obviously a different woman than
I am you're doing a thing we're
pretending like you're talking about you
but really you're making fun of me I
didn't like it when you get it with mom
and dad's money but if you want to pick
up extra shifts at the new town caboose
to buy tools of patriarchy it's not my
problem
stop yelling what do you do break a $600
brush no stressed out so now I'm
breaking oh no big deal just squeeze
them I popped my pimples all the time
and nobody ever cares cuz I took care of
those women into God's tap again
do we have to then I let it scab over
naturally that is so gross
mmm it's so much makeup Shaw is just you
keep going stop Oh rich I just got a lot
of practice I've done this a lot okay
yeah but why
what do you mean why so I look okay you
look okay without it do you ever not do
your makeup I did it when we were kids
no let's say since middle school oh my
god
what do you know how much you could have
been doing with all that time you could
have probably written a whole book or
learned an entirely new language you
could have cured cancer I bet if we did
the math you've been doing eyeliner as
long as it took me to finish my entire
dissertation but I like doing makeup I
like hang out new brushes and new colors
I enjoy it it's art okay
van Gogh made art you like makeup
because Society told you to like makeup
okay
can you imagine how many more female
scientists and mathematicians we would
have if women would just start studying
and stop painting their faces to please
men that's what job I don't put makeup
on for men I put it on for me because I
like it
and I never think of that did you it's
not very feminist if you disrespect what
I genuinely enjoy simply because it's
traditionally feminine interest uh no
yes it's not being such a bitch about it
I'm sorry and if you think I haven't
been listening to your rants all these
years I have you're smart no no I'm an
idiot you are an idea this is gonna
take me like at least an hour to fix
damn it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
