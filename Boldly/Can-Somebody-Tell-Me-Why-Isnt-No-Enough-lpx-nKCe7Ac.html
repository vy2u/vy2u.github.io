asked me out and I'm not interested for
whatever the reason may be can somebody
tell me why I can't just say no
oh what's that I can already hear some
of you troll typing why is this even a
video or this is stupid
just say no if you don't like them well
here's why I can't just say no so I'm at
the bus stop one day and this guy comes
up to me and yeah he was putting on a
show he's smooth-talking me and I'm
talking cocoa butter on some ashy ankles
smooth and he's busting out all of his
great lines and at the end of it all he
asked me for my number okay so it wasn't
the worst pick-up situation I've ever
been in but I also just wasn't
interested I just didn't want to date
anyone at the moment and instead of
coming up with some batshit tired ass
excuse as I usually do you know what I
have a boyfriend I don't believe in
cellphones I'm a lesbian
so this isn't gonna work Wow I've never
been with a lesbian before yeah cuz
lesbians like yeah yeah me too
I'm a lesbian I just decided to cut
through all the I said to
myself
Dasia we're not about to do this today
it is too cold this song on Spotify is
your jam right now
and biggest reason of all you don't want
to date anyone so what I just said
no yeah I'm just not interested in
dating anyone right now
now this was a part of the story where I
was hoping I really had high hopes that
he'd say something along the lines of
hey I really appreciate you not letting
me waste my time have a great day and he
flitter off into the sunset
how magical would that have been
unfortunately that's not what happened
next
yeah I'm just not interested in dating
right now okay let me just get your
number and we just be friends hey I
don't know about that okay fine I'll
give you my number then no I just I
don't think no just stop thinking about
it and I'll put mine
after a few minutes of painfully going
back and forth like this I finally
decided to take his number I ended the
exchange with a mix of relief and defeat
relief because at least my saying no
didn't turn into something like this
yeah I'm just not interested in dating
right whatever bitch what I don't need
to hear anything right I you think
you're cute and defeat because I just
couldn't understand how I ended up in
this situation again why can't I just
say no and have it be respected why does
it take invisible boyfriends and making
a mockery of someone's sexual
orientation for which I heavily
apologize because it usually gets me
into a lot more trouble than what I
wanted in the first place you have to
have a to be a list well I don't
go when I'm going those got me a big boy
alright okay can somebody tell me why
maybe you just haven't had the right
thing in you area uh you know this was
not great but I'm gonna go it's like a
forearm okay that's definitely not what
I want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
