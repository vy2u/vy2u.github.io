more expensive however I think I'm also
wrong I have never been a big nail
painter so I'm thinking I won't be able
to guess because it has been a minute
since I did my nails myself I am always
up on the latest nail trends I want to
try it when the new crackle polish came
out I tried it I find that it comes off
when I shampoo my hair for some reason
you are using cheap at Leon College I
think it's just about looking for easy
application pigmentation am i a male
expert I would see the factors that
separate sheep inexpensive or how long
it lasts most nail polishes are
basically the same price for what's
inside it's that you're mostly paying
for the packaging's honestly if there's
no packaging involved it'll be really
hard for you to tell alright let's check
them out
so apparently one of these holes circles
is expensive and one is cheap I think I
already know the answer
I was really overconfident coming in and
realizing it first I'm gonna do the
smell test oh can you smell anything
smells like nail polish this most toxic
is bug so it's probably expensive this
one seems more see-through and that one
seems more solid seems like it has a
more even coat across all of the nails
versus this one is there just one coat
on here or did you put on two or three
coats one coat of nail polish oh
now North confused one coat is asking a
lot of a nail polish but you would think
a bougie nail polish would be like one
coat and you're good tricks man
tricks maybe I've just never got my
nails painted with something that nice
ru looks really really good
without a Tomko which makes me think
this is drugstore holds up the one that
you think is most expensive the one that
alex is holding is the most expensive I
did it my god was it great that one is
the most expensive yeah Alex the one
that you're holding is $50 $50 for nail
polish why is this $50 to God Louie
Vuitton and we've got LA Colors
I changed my mind is worth 50 there's
the gradient on this box is absolutely
gorgeous there's literally more product
in here than there is in there and look
how much bigger this thing is
it's all a trick this is just a whole
different ball game when you look at the
difference between these two fingers I
can tell that this one is nice it's good
ship regardless so just like economize
where you can guys treat yourself to a
nice dinner tip your nails high - and
put that extra money by for someone that
loves Christian Louboutin for any
fashion person but anyone outside of
like the Fashion Issue probably also
would you be able to tell that my thumb
is a bargain-basement thumb and that my
other four fingers
a Paris Fashion Week no can't tell true
literally you literally can't tell also
I did a terrible job painting so under
and touch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
