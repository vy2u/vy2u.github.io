summit Brewing Company in st. Paul
Minnesota we're here today trying a
selection of wines potent aroma of black
currant a little bit of black very very
very sweet aroma almost sickly sweet
really and jarring I would give this one
one out of five so we got here ooh a wee
fruity number very pale nice floral
notes maybe some stone fruit the fruit
notes are reasonably Pleasant shall we
say give that a two and a half take the
color out in this one really rich dark
Ruby not smells kind of like a Christmas
pudding back home in the old country
my five-year-old son would like it I'd
give that one and a half out of five
Rome was very neutral somebody's cook
grass a little bit of a herbal north
some fresh fruit in there to maybe a
little bit of QE not all together or
home Pleasant but that's too bad
actually you probably drink a little bit
of that 3 out of 5 on them
Oh Lord in heaven no way oh my God look
at this this is incredible look at that
color it's amazing neon blue it's like
the ocean off the coast of Hawaii or
something Wow
aroma is truly incredible absolutely
ghastly pretty noticeable Gatorade sea
power it is more power in theory this
has got to be some kind of energy drink
there's no way this is a wine
I'll give it a half we had a lot of fun
some really interesting Gotti's and by
interesting I mean unique and by unique
I mean truly awful wines relief comes in
the form of a pint of the black stuff
