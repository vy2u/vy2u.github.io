the first people I think up and I want
you guys to have the world
my parents have made a lot of sacrifices
for me and my brothers my parents
emigrated from Mexico to San Francisco
in the late 1970s they worked very labor
intensive jobs my parents came here with
parents who didn't speak English so they
had to learn the language on their own
they had to struggle get through school
without any help I think it has to do a
lot with like experiences like they
never got to travel the world the only
places they've ever visited was El
Salvador they just save up money so they
can go back and visit their friends and
their family my dad at one point talks
about how he was eating for Thea's with
salt and that's kind of like what their
family did for a minute they didn't have
many friends basically for them it was
just work work work my dad was in
construction and my mom worked at a
restaurant making burritos she just felt
like her whole world and her only
friends were me and my sisters even
though we were children my mom
especially took time off constantly just
so that she can bring me a costume or
support me at a competition she would
drive me everywhere my mom had to
sacrifice getting paid in order to take
a day off and go with me on a weekend
competition or watch a play my mother
had me when she was only like 18 years
old and everyone said you know just
don't go through with it you got a lot
going for you my grandma did not want
anything to do with me at all actually
didn't see my grandmother till like I
was like 2 as a kid I would look at my
grandma who had like more money and she
would take me on these trips and fly me
out where my mom couldn't do it and I
would just have this disdain I would
like tell my I'll tell my mom I want my
grandma to adopt me I didn't really
realize how hard she worked to just you
know keep a roof over my head we bounced
around from my couch to couch and based
in the basement and I didn't ever really
appreciate her for that I can't help to
think now how much that hurt her it's
remarkable to me that through all those
years my parents never slept at the same
time my dad would work all night the
only time we really all had together
during the week was at
dinner and my dad always made sure there
was a delicious meal on the table and
then we all sat together as a family I
really appreciate it and miss it so much
okay okay here we go mom and dad mom and
dad mami and papi and my sisters too I'm
not sure that I'll ever be able to fully
understand what you guys went through or
myself and my sister thank you guys for
allowing me to be myself for letting me
tear the house down on weekend it's just
I can shoot
Oh silly parody I feel terrible ever
saying anything about how I wanted to
live with my grandmother because I knew
you're trying your best I'm sorry for
anything I've ever could have done to
make you feel bad as I get it closer to
my wedding day
I look at your marriage as an example of
two people who have kept their word to
each other about sticking together and
the good times and the bad for better or
for worse in sickness and in health
and it inspires me even though the past
couple of years have been very tough
because I moved so far away from you but
I promise that everything I'm doing is
for you guys I work as hard as I do to
make you proud and I'll never stop
because you gave me that drive I want
you guys to have a house and go on
vacation and just be able to relax every
day when I wake up you guys are the
first people I think of and I want you
guys to have the world doesn't matter
how old your kids get you still worry
and you still provide and you still give
advice and support and love
unconditionally I can't I guess I can't
thank you enough I love you very much
yeah I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
