ready to go that's a blue falcon like
time to hide Blue Falcon I feel like
that's all military term you're about to
fall in the ocean a Blue Falcon is a
rare form of birds that's a danger blue
Falcons better known as the buddy
dance till your chow your porno mags
while you're away doesn't doesn't cover
your six also known as Bravo Foxtrot
Barney style is probably when they
decide to all dress in purple for the
day right just be very loving toward
your friends probably give people hugs
when you dress up all fancy kind of like
Barney's of New York like being an idiot
you're being stupid that it we don't
have too many smart people in the Marine
Corps so you got to break it down to
them bunny style
how do I tie their boots oh can you just
learn to be a little bit simpler I am
guessing Parker factor is when you're a
soldier and you go to the bar and you're
pucker factor is how likely you are to
pick up whoever you want to pick up
how fast can that car go how quickly a
little pucker up the amount a new
uniform puckers because of its
starchiness maybe it's like how bad you
miss your significant other on the other
side of the world
I think pucker factor would have
something to do with how scared you are
of something that's a big deal like
you're puckering the pucker factor is
when you're in like a very intense
high-pressure situation that makes your
sphincter like tighten up or no can
anyone can anyone say that better when
people think about joining the military
they forget about the back I
think this is literal I think it
actually means they're gonna punch you
at the face they don't want to go
through actually beating you up so they
just tell you to like you're not that
important just do it yourself
it's probably like a masturbation joke
beat it like get out of here with your
face so don't look over here
like slamming your face into the ground
like when they're curling under barbed
wire or something oh what are push-ups
you know that position you lay when you
when you go to sleep face down sleep so
so imagine
put your arms like next year at Lake
shoulders like this and then press the
way your balls are Morris the most
important part of yourself as a guy so I
assume it's the most important part of
the battalion so it's a tank maintenance
you got me something gendered right like
look out maybe it's like a special
timepiece that you keep new your school
area
I think balls wash sounds like something
that like a cadet has to do oh I'm on
balls watch and then the older guy goes
I've been there earn your keep that's a
watch balls $1.00 box midnight 12:00
a.m. to 4:00 like you're sleeping your
head down with ninja nuts
[Laughter]
Jody boy is a guy who refuses to get rid
of his ponytail when enlisting a Jody
boy is like someone who's always calling
Jody at home he's like never eye on the
prize never focused on battle get on up
to the Jody boy it's a sleeping cabin
where they rest maybe it's like a
nickname for a person who has a certain
kind of chore maybe it's like the
Colonel's favorite like Jesse's girl but
Jody's boy Jody boy is the guy that's
back taking care of your girlfriend
while you're deployed what do you call
the girlfriend who's doing your
boyfriend while you're away I'm Irene
wife I mean it's either a drink or a
dance this is what every soldier says in
every single war movie sounds like a
dance move I can only assume it's the
literal interpretation of let's get
drunk let's dance with partners and then
let's dance more complicatedly with
partners sounds Ferb what the huh
whiskey Tango Foxtrot what
/ we go through so much together bad
times that our humor because vulgar but
it's just a way to cope don't cry
go scratch okay oh you were scratchy
because we got our series of the Ukraine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
