know someone but when you're put in this
position you don't know what could you
know sort of slip through the cracks

embarrassing that you've ever been on I

friend because I didn't want to you

didn't want to go on a date with the
stranger have you had a stalking moment
recently that you're really embarrassed
to admit I guess faced a little while
ago had changed its platform or it's way
that it looked and I was a little
confused and I was trying to look up a
few of my exes in the search thing and I
kept pressing enter and it wasn't doing
anything again so I kept going I kept
going I kept going and then like five
minutes later my roommate texts me and
says I'm going to make up a name sure
like why is John Smith on your facebook

at the office oh okay my spread to me is
Mike she is fine it's intimate I do feel
I feel I feel closer we're gonna do this
every day at lunch

their co-workers yes it's good bonding
