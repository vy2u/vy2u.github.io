wish I asked my neighbor to be my
girlfriend or something and then you
look over at me and you're like hey you
want to be my girlfriend and I was like
really I think he knows how I feel about
him I'm not good at hiding how I feel so
I'm a little bit more open and Janey's
about my feelings
I don't express them and he expresses
all of them I know he knows how I feel
about him because I'm constantly telling
him we talked about our feelings towards
each other probably not very often
I said when we first technically like
started talking together or to each
other I was online and I guess Chris
weird me by all these trig names yeah
yeah my favorite was the skiing one it
was just you know that that mochi this
this is just going down the slopes
yeah I'm pretty warm natured as a person
and as we're going into this this day my
hands are ice-cold I have to start
making up excuses that I'm sick that day
a lot of embarrassing ways cuz I gotta
go to the bathroom and coordinate with
all the people healthy anyway and I was
like are you constipated in front of all
these little kids right and the tribe
you have honestly I don't know where you
get the motivation you're the type of
person to start something and always
finish it like plate of food yeah but
like a small example yeah when we went
to I know you can eat sushi are and I
don't know why I'm getting emotional
over this but we I ordered you a lot of
sushi that I liked and all the rice they
charge you extra if you don't eat it all
and you ended up eating all my rice and
in the parking lot you threw up yeah I
ate all the good parts and you let me
have all the good parts and you
surprised me with really pretty flowers
and I was going through a really
difficult time
but that turned it around and I really
appreciated that well I was going to use
that and I would find this memory of us
is when you took me on a really great a
steep the flower and that was the first
time you cried in front of me and I just
kind of laid out on gchat like this is
what I need from you and you basically
said I don't know what to say and I like
crushed me and I was like well does what
I need and you're like I have to go
brush my teeth for bed after an hour or
so there was like a bunch of noise at my
window and I live on the second story
you were throwing pebbles at my window
and I ran downstairs and he said I came
to get you he hold it together enjoy
when you decided to pack up all your
bags and move from Nashville all the way
to Los Angeles and we drove our fat
u-haul all the way up a hill with no
lights and we just put the u-haul there
and climbed on top of it and watch stars
for an hour you know we went like 14
months dating long distance and I just
knew that if I didn't give things a real
shot and put us in the same city you
were going to be the girl that when I
was 80 years old I was going to wonder
what if
we gush love at one another constantly
but it's a lot more simple than this
usually like typically we just say babe
so cute it makes me appreciate you more
it's a reminder to always tell each
other how much we love each other
and why we love each other and I think
there are bajillion reasons and you can
only get through so many a day so really
we have to do this over a period of time
I feel like I understand you a bit
better you already knew everything yeah
but it's nice to hear it once in a while
agreed we had so many adventures and
your death experiences with each other
that I can't wait to have the last death
experience remember magic magic magic oh
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
