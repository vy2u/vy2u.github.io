really honest with my ADHD struggles
because that was something that any guy
dating me would have to understand
because they would often mistake
ADHD struggles for actually like just
not caring or not wanting to call back
or stuff like that and I did I have
depression anxiety and body dysmorphic
disorder
I've actually been dealing with
depression since I was 12 I dealt with
depression as well I deal with like a
pretty high level of ADHD and a strange
type of anxiety disorder that happens to
me at night I deal with anxiety that
really just kind of came up within the
past few years I had a large weight gain
my senior year of college once the
weight started packing on my depression
started definitely you know had waves of
depression I don't ever think there's a
right or wrong time to bring up
something that you're dealing with such
as depression I think that first you
need to establish that connection with
yourself I think my turning point came
when I realized that I wasn't letting
myself be vulnerable and I was allowing
it in every other area of my life
besides relationship with Kevin going
through his own separate issues he was a
little bit more harsh he was a little
bit angry and then I going through my
issues were very sensitive and so we
kind of came together upset at the same
time to help each other work through it
I was like I'm a little crazy I think
that looks like that much and I just
mentioned that I do therapy so I had
write pretty much out the gate it's good
to be understanding and just like listen
with open ears because a lot of the time
when I feel like there's an issue going
on I let them know and after we talk
about it it's not as big and bad as what
I was thinking in my head the times
where you know you will bring what
you're struggling with to me the
pressure on me is just to react in the
right way and often the right reaction I
find is just to listen you're not
feeling happy it's so easy to like put
it on the other person in a way they're
gonna help you out but you should come
as far as possible
I feel really empowered managing my
mental health because it I really hit my
in therapy and in writing and have other
outlets and then I come back and I feel
like a stronger version of myself which
makes me better in my relationship our
communication is better like we can
realize what's going on without saying
it so much now I see that he's angry I
see that he's upset I kind of know what
to do or what to say I mean he had he
was basically with me when I was crying
for like several days straight having a
completely illogical panic attack I just
tell her that she is safe she is loved
and she is doing big big things it's
huge
the fact that we have these very open
just channels makes me feel like there's
nothing I can't bring to the table that
I might be going through any time the
few times in our relationship that have
been the most impactful and most
intimate and have made us grow the most
they have come of some of the most
awkward and weird moments absolutely
talking about something as you know
severe as the oppression can can build
you guys stronger and build your bond I
think it's important to remember that
nobody's perfect like you can be in a
really happy healthy relationship and
have your stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
