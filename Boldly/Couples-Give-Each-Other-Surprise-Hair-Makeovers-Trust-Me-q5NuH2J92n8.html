having couples style each other's hair
so David's gonna consult each of them in
secret but the catch is they're going to
be doing the consultation for their
partner's hair so this makeover is
completely based on blind trust they're
gonna bleach your eyebrows off you still
have to date me after this so be careful
what you wish for they're not gonna have
any idea what is happening until they
see it in the mirror blind trust are you
ready to get a haircut absolutely yes
Tyler is pre self-conscious about his
hair she knows my biggest fear with hair
Tyler has a bulbous head yeah I have a
really bulbous head so much so that like
a barber one time commented on it your
your head is really weird
Tyler's kept his hair long for as long
as I've known him I think he's a good
looking guy but I think we could shorten
it up my hair is crazy it looks like it
eight Harry Styles his hair right now
like it's all over the place as tons of
colleagues maybe keep some length on the
top but I think like maybe like a
high-end type and not too crazy what
might might be good I think as long as
soft does not go for the true high and
tight I'll be okay with anything I
definitely feel that he could be a
little bit more refined I also think
that it would be good for him because
he's done his hair the same way for so
long and it might be fun just for
something a little bit different I'm the
kind of person that gets one haircut
every year and then I just let it grow
out until I can't stand it anymore and I
get kind of the same haircut again her
favorite thing about her hair is just
how thick it is a shorter haircut
actually might even highlight how strong
her hair is I think Tyler's gonna do a
great job they know he likes my hair a
lot so I don't think he's gonna do
anything crazy to it I think it'd look
really great if she kind of was shorter
and it shaped her face I think it has a
very strong professional tone to it it's
great that you're doing this because
it's almost like kick 19 is bravery and
hair and yeah it's like going like who
cares about here let's just do it
I think she's gonna pull it off and I
can't wait to see the transformation
worst-case scenario
I'm gonna go full buzz but we don't need
to Oh Luci I trust the fear I just don't
want this to be a prank
high five we're not getting it oh there
you are
when I was a kid I looked like my mom's
hairdresser and she cut my hair like
your lobe lengths like a bowl cut and I
was completely silent dry eyes the whole
time and then as soon as I got in the
car to go home I started sobbing and I
didn't stop for like eight hours see
he's dying my hair right now and he's
just getting me to talk about other
things that's fine this the end this is
how I died
this is how you become a Stepford wife I
hope that you put that thing on my head
it ends up just being JT late 90s oh my
god it's so much hair in my head right
now
in college Tyler had like a mop
hairstyle I don't think I thought his
hairstyle was cute but I don't use cute
when I got down to LA like everyone in
LA is so stylish I you know I would like
go online and watch YouTube videos about
how I could like do my hair finally I'm
getting like a real stylist so I'm like
really excited are you talking about me
no no it's not always about users
it feels cool one two three you look
beautiful
oh my god I got a reaction I'm gonna
look it look like really edgy
are you nervous your head with told us
no no I don't think I'll expose we look
so good like it's so nice oh my god it's
so soft
oh I do look cooler than that don't you
look cool
I look Wow my head is not that bulbous
oh I love mine I feel cool right now I
feel sleeker than usual I feel like an
adult and I feel like I should go buy
some new clothes with my new hair that's
real
I'm so happy with it and I'm kind of
like in shock we have a great ability to
like help each other and help each other
grow and I think that it's one of those
things where I totally trust her I mean
