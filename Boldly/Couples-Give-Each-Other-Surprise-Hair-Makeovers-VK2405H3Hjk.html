this today we're having couples style
each other's hair so David's going to
consult each of them in secret but the
catch is they're going to be doing the
consultation for their partner's hair
it's kind of like a free-falling
exercise where couples really test their
relationship you're freaking out over
like a couple snips this is like 15
minutes of straight snipping they're not
going to have any idea what is happening
until they see it in the mirror or we're
relying on hairspray sure we're bringing
the hair spiration
yeah you guys excited super excited I
just had this hair forever
and I'm really bored with it Jason's
super creative and boring is the last
word you'd used to describe him so I
know he's gonna do something crazy and
I'm feeling adventurous so I'm down
she's like a badass chick like she boxes
she does Krav Maga she always said she
could beat me up
uh-uh that's not that's not she's had
the same haircut for a long time for a
couple years let's give some color a
shorter cut with some pink just to give
it some flavor and they're just kind of
making it ruffled I like that like you
really went from 0 to 100 we challenge
each other and we always want to change
it up for each other
I want to go freaking crazy out there I
trust that it's gonna be exciting and
it's gonna be fun I think she can pull
it off people don't necessarily go color
first you should try different things
but sometimes you just need to push her
off that cliff what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna ball your hair first the shape for
her kitchen level and I'm gonna add a
splash of color with some college
officials money's gonna be great she's
gonna love it I want to play nice but a
little muddy I know he's freaking out
right now I love my hair my hair is like
it's it's me it's it's like it's Jason
people call me the hair I've grown this
hair off for about three years and
before that I've had short hair it just
makes me feel free like just don't give
a
his hairs just stick straight and it
just looks like
like a mop it's just sloppy he thinks it
looks amazing but three years man I'm
ready for something now there's one
thing I've learned about Cathy it's you
can never trust Gabby that's why I'm
scared right now a little classic but
modern classic a lot of a wave and
texture don't shave it too short on the
sides if David brings a buzzer near my
head and I hear that sound I'm going to
slap it off it and run out of here you
think like if we kind of like cut his
hair his powers gonna be gone or
strength is but I'm okay with that
that's my one shot in life no so let's
do it
what we're gonna do is we're definitely
gonna take some length off of him except
- I'm probably gonna start with a little
bit of a treatment on him third give him
the Braille out of a lifetime I trust
that we're going to do something
completely unexpected and fun and make
it exciting make it an adventure she's
brave are you ready I'm ready okay let's
do this one last look I go to boxing
classes I can't keep it in those walls
like I always want to take it home with
me like I get all this pent-up
aggression I want to go home and fight
him she attacked me yeah boring
I'm just stronger and faster I've got a
mean hook I'm a brown belt in Taekwondo
Oh you should tell them about that when
did you get your brown belt I was like
10 years old
Kathy gets all the attention she's a
superstar she's gonna be on stage I
totally disagree
I'm super uncomfortable like in social
situations Kathy's the cool and for sure
go slow here we go
I trust her but my hair is very special
to me I've had a very bad experience
freshmen your middle school oh my god
just give me a light trip and I sit
there and I always close my eyes when I
get a haircut cuz I'm just terrified and
the first thing they do buzz right down
the middle I feel scared
oh I opened my eyes and just like what
the my mom's literally screamed Cathy
you know I have a small face
I was like what can we do and they're
like the only way you just we just at
the buzzer you know I look like a really
bad naked mole-rat already so one holds
its cost
you look amazing
oh yeah yeah you look great looks cool
it looks like fresh and funky he lets
you amazing yeah Alex no good you're
gonna be kind of mad but it looks really
good
we had a different taste though open
your eyes in three two one oh my gosh
oh my gosh I like shots I feel like it's
something that I would never be brave
enough to do on my own
yeah oh yes big lazy Cathy she knows
what's best for me and what I would
eventually like before I do yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
