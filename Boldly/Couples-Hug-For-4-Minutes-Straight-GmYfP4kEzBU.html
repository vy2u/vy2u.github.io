before and it was really good
I definitely do think I have fears I'm a
warrior words let's just say I used to
be very secure as a person we definitely
have the standard fears and worries one
of my exes he and I telling me that he
actually cheated on me
after I broke up with him how do I know
this time is different
because that's what I think every single
time Chris was my first serious
relationship you know my first boyfriend
I haven't dated other people why how do
I know this is what there's part of me
that worries that we'll put in all these
years and it came to nothing that's
scary because when do you know exactly
what you need to know to get married
well Jeff has diabetes that's manageable
um but it destroys organs and I worry
that he might go go I mean everybody
goes but but I want to go first we had
kind of constantly can we hug a lot yeah
once everyday I think she wrote down
somewhere that when Jeff's upset I'm
just gonna hug him I wrote her down but
when he makes me angry that's the last
thing I want to do is hug him
four minutes we're gonna hug for four
minutes you go with the hippies down
here I'm staring right at you we have to
be serious
I'm looking at that right you designed
for me
don't you to be able to trust people who
won't spin about you thank you a lot of
changes in just a few years huh mm-hmm
you know I'm really grateful for you
right grateful for you
my neck is all getting stiff like ha
that an old okay you've aged beautifully
now it's four minutes Wow
oh so fast really good I feel like I'm
gonna hug again I'm thinking about some
of the things you said I think the
physical touch and made it better I
think I felt very comfortable because it
was him you'd always feel you know what
to say but you're always willing to hug
me or hold me well I actually felt very
relaxing and almost therapeutic the
return and someone just you know lets
you know it's gonna be okay
you don't have to use words to tell
someone it's gonna be okay this is like
a new experience for me like being same
space and talk about things I think to
the gift of a hug it's free it's it's a
beautiful thing and you should do that
more often
not when I read it you know faces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
