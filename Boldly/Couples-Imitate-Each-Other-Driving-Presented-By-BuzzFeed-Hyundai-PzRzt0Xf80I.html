of sits low in the seat looks up I'm
looking at the road more than him

careful going down there - patience is a
virtue blah blah blah I started

lip-syncing and I always give him the
microphone nobody's supposed to know

love just because you're stuck in this
little hub together it's a little
private moment that you only you two
share
