with the setting it is very important to
me that he gets this right um because
it's something that I had to wear for
the rest of my life he's really
confident about like everything so he's
gonna be like I nailed it go big or go
home right a yellow gold 18 now I assume
that's 18 carats probably things I'm
gonna choose like a five carat crazy
diamond thing engagement rings are like
five-year salary right something that
feels like it is a little bit vintage
looking would be awesome I have to be
confident in my choice I told her I was
gonna rock her world add your diamond to
a ring choose a setting obviously we're
doing yellow gold choose a diamond
what is all this that looks like an
algebraic equation alright I'm just
gonna look at this one close up one more
time oh you can see what it looks like
on someone's hand it's my final design
round 0.76 carats cushion outline pave

Wow yours is way more expensive no one I
chose she helped I'm looking at the
price in the diamond look at the price

joke

predict it is nice you I mean you
definitely worth it if she likes it if
she wants it then she gets it she knows
that she's the queen that's the way it's
always been you know what this makes me
think of what the proposal Oh people I
