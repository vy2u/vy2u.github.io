couples it creates a space to be a
little bit more intimate to laugh and
it's a very different experience
connecting with someone else versus
connecting just yourself when you're
practicing on your own I had never seen
couples yoga done before but I'm
imagining like watered-down acrobatics
feel sexual already yeah can't wait to
get into I'm assuming there's gonna be
points from like supporting her and
stuff like that and I'm just she's
probably gonna fall least once and call
me fat look at your thumb and index
remember push it down pull your stomach
in lift your kneecaps so just think play
give one line of energy good the men do
a push-up the person that's on the
bottom it's good and on the top already
good and switch partners then the
partner take your hands to their ankles
and now do push-ups you don't start from
there ready one two
take your palms up getting ready grab
their shoulders and then grab their
shoulders and once you have the
rollerblade sort of straighten out your
legs now this is like
good now grab her and push her forward
there you go now switch partners
that's good
the person who is going to support them
take your legs over and get really close
to them oh but your butt is still on the
floor I love I was like beyond me this
person that's lowering go as far down as
you can go at the top give one another a
kiss wow I feel that I shouldn't be here
XO one person go back keep the chest
lifted on last French kiss
the partner just step outside of them
and see your butt on there but then time
to take a child's pose on top of your
partner good from there bring your butt
to your heels and then walk your hands
forward you're good I'm tickling your
butt your tits we're good slowly climb
off your partner the partner sit on your
butt on top of their butt knees wide but
you're Hugh this sounds cool it was nice
how they do it I enjoy a thoroughly yes
yeah it's nice me she's got me wrapped
around her right now so I think yeah
yeah we feel closer getting close in
contact is a whole nother level and
having to trust someone shall I carry
you and flip you over I know do you
breathe so much slower than I do
I think it's like a good way to kind of
take a step back and take a moment and
like I appreciate each other and like
enjoy just like being with each other
it's very sexual I was like I'm gonna go
right now maybe set some time aside
after what get it there I never got it
get it yeah you get it it's here Quinta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
