with you all my swag you when you link
on my swag you bring all my swag on my
swag swag video live and direct from
Hollywood it's ladylike I've decided to
take my ladylike crew on a cupcake
telephone adventure which we will go to
one cupcake place and eat the best
cupcake there and then we're gonna ask
them where the most delicious cupcake is
and go on and on and on until we find
the best cupcake in LA I'm not really a
fan of cupcakes I think they are
overrated they're always too sweet for
me I think it's kind of weird that going
to get cupcakes is like a lady thing so
I'm gonna see how many guys are in these
cupcake shops and put them on blast
cupcakes are great can't wait to eat
them we're gonna have so much fun yeah
cupcake down some cupcakes get them in
us get them all around our faces we are
pumped so how are we judging these
cupcakes guess how cute they are
yes cuteness is key moisture moisture
the ratio icing to cake up so we're very
important it can make or break a cupcake
what would you say makes the perfect
cupcake the combination of the icing the
batter here we make small batches of all
our batters so it's fresher and then the
way you whip up the buttercream how
fluffy it is how sweet it is what is you
guys it's like signature cupcake they
call it the Carey cupcake which is the
vanilla cupcake with the pink frosting
and a little Daisy because they came out
on Sex in the City
that sounds well everyone comes asking
for that or the red velvet let me go get
that for you
thank you so at every place we're gonna
try a basic cupcake like a vanilla cake
and a chocolate frosting like these guys
and we're gonna try a couple specialty
cakes these look beautiful
oh the frosting tastes like what would
be on chocolate I don't so you can taste
the dairy and I'll make me 40 but it's
all about it's a rich cupcake but the
chocolate isn't Oklahoma the ratio it's
like not too much it's light its fluffy
I think it's voices icing five moist
early - - I know for me they're cute one
two three
I'm keeping this like they're fine
they're like you would wink at it across
the hallway cute but you wouldn't like /
I would say no on a date but they asked
me yeah
the Kari is like hit you with a truck
sweet it is overweight so sweet during
the time we've been here three women
have come in and two men have come in
and it's a middle of the day on the
Thursday so maybe I'm wrong cuz that's a
pretty good ratio okay so if you were
gonna eat cupcakes anywhere else in LA
that's not here where would you go Susie
cakes and they're right up the street we
want one Cindy cakes to be good and we
think about big dreams small cakes do it
I have big cakes does I mean but yeah
so we couldn't film at susiecakes so
we're going to the park we go into the
park and you go into the but so how you
do that
we're gonna eat the susiecakes which I'm
excited for apparently you never
refrigerate them so that's fancy they
have a dollop of icing in the middle
which is a cool twist also fancy keeps
them moist you love that word now I hate
the word Morrison now it's my most used
word so they didn't have the vanilla
cake chocolate frosting so we went for
the inverse oh I can already tell how
boys yeah yeah whoa this is a cupcake
its moist I'm I'm like kind of at a loss
of words the frosting is about sweet
cuteness gets a I give it a three three
angry yeah the moisture is out of the
charts yeah quality that chocolate cake
is like on par um I mean there's more
icing than necessarily you would want
yeah but it's not too much I mean you
know four out of five there go up a few
more of those cupcakes signature vanilla
is not as moist as the chocolate the
strawberry flavoring is the case like
regular frosting to me alright let's do
it alright so we're going to the
sprinkles ATM in Beverly Hills which is
been fun well I mean sprinkles is pretty
good again we're not sure what it means
for there to be an idea what an ATM in
that a vending machine because people
are oh that's yeah the cuz people are
bougie what is this thing I feel like an
alien these are definitely the most
expensive but we do get the experience
of not having to interact with any
people
oh they're like Pokemon these sprinkles
from sprinkles are very cute they're
much more trendy the other was called a
little thing in these cupcakes I like
elegant yeah yeah these are like
Charlize Theron dense I'm gonna have to
go with a two on horses mine is really
moist if you love moist everything noise
honestly this vegan cupcake from
sprinkles is so amazing cuz it's coconut
oil is used you can even see the
difference
yeah how this one looks on my birthday
yeah I get the whole cupcake like 20 of
them he would give it a 5 from which I
was giving all 5 ratio 3 girl yeah
frosting little hyper force for cuteness
for me I think susiecakes was the winner
but this cupcake unbeatable the vegan
red velvet unbeatable Susy cupcakes
definitely kills everything I really
loved the whole vibe and environment at
Magnolia Bakery the confections were so
elegant
it was just like sparkly and beautiful
and everything was happy my biggest
takeaway is just that if you eat too
much cupcakes you will feel terrible
lady tented lay bruised we like them I
feel so sick though ha ha ha ha but in
Chicago circa 2009 caking meant like
flirting hard people would like go off
into like sort of extended metaphor is
like damn y'all building a bakery over
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
