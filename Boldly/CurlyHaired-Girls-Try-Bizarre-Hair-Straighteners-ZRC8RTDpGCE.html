frowning upon me right now oh jesus take
the wheel my hair and I have had some
major drama I grew up really not liking
my hair I used to hate my hair a lot and
now I'm really attached to my hair I
used to not like them but I've come to
embrace them I've straightened my hair
twice in my life last time I was 17 and
now I'm 24 so it's been a long-ass high
the brush that straight is hair simply
strange so it's a bruh
oh it's a brush Russian curly hair
doesn't end well I feel like this is
just gonna make my hair huge this is
like the stuff of nightmares for me ah
hello
nemesis I'm sorry for what I'm about to
do to you I love you so much there's
nothing I'm just gonna do this oh this
feels bad Wow my hair isn't as straight
as it would be with a straightener but I
mean it's it's straighter it is like
definitely taking more effort to get
straight than a normal flat iron I feel
like I'm in a terrible 80s movie and
mistakes were made before the prom but I
feel like it's not grabbing on to my
hair and straightening it like a
straightener would this is like giving
it a nice little like hug like a fake
hug that's like okay nice to meet you oh
I don't
okay bye yes so next product is I don't
know what it is
the InStyler rotating IR straighten curl
adds body and shine this seems like
really extra it says it's straightening
it and curling it adding body adding
shine it's it's too many things this
straightener needs to make a joy oh
there's just oh my gosh
all right here we go oh jesus take the
wheel huh what is happening whoa okay
this one's winning thus far I mean
that's treating it feel like one of
those old women that just doesn't have
their together and you falter oh hell
yeah baby the first one with the brush
did not do as well as I thought the
design sort of makes it look like you
can just brush through your hair and
it'll be straight but that's not really
how curly hair works the InStyler max
changed the game it definitely will save
me time with straightening everywhere
you go there's all these solutions for
straightening your hair but it's like
you don't have to do that growing up I
used to get teased for my curly hair
because it was so big hence why I
started straightening it I got to a
certain point where I'm like you know
what I need to appreciate the hair that
I was given in all its huge frizzy glory
nests your curls are beautiful and don't
forget that you don't just spend all
your time straightening your hair spend
some more time embracing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
