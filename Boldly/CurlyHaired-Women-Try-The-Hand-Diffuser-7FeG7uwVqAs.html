been wanting to try this dryer for
months now which I hear is like four you
know to get inside of the curls and to
make it dryer and it gives it like a
360-degree radiant it's like a science
project normally I would maybe diffuse
blow-dry it a little bit but that always
causes the ends to open up and get kind
of frizzy and then my roots are still
really wet and it creates a
weird-looking situation honestly I just
use a microfiber towel scrunch scrunch
scrunch and keep it moving Maundy but
girl show me what you bet we got cold
air different settings and we begin it's
interesting because I feel like it's
heap and I don't feel like it's like the
regular heat that I would get from a
normal blow-dryer so far it is Chris
it's hard to like fully have control of
it because it's just so huge field is
drying fast which is so great
well what the diva curl promises is that
it will help eliminate frizz and also
give you more volume in a short amount
of time and honestly I do feel like
there's a lot of volume in my hair there
are some pieces that are kind of more
open and sort of frizzy than I would
like but that could 100% just be user
error
normal diffusers do not give my hair
this lift up here that the diva diffuser
has but it looks so moisturized and it
looks so shiny and the diffuser has
never given me that it ain't no
advertisement you know saying they not
sponsoring me these are like some salon
curls for real I hear it's a hundred and
seventy five dollars I honestly don't
feel like that I buy it if there was a
sale I'm like really happy to be leaving
the house for work with my hair like
this yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
