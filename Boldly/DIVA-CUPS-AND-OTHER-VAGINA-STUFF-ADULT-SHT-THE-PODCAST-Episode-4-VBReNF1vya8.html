adults it with the one I mean you are
you are killing it on this podcast I
gotta say every time that edit these I'm
so proud of how smart we sound because
in reality we I'm smart
wow we should just start off this
episode by saying Kate's on her fucking
period so she's being a real I mean a
real bitch today
here being a little bit of a bitch but
it's nothing I can't handle haven't
handled before haven't been before
yeah when'd you start that's friendship
yesterday have you used the Deaver Cup
yet but I got Jess so Kelsey bought me a
Diva Cup cuz my true friend and I just
put it in before this Oh what you didn't
tell me that you just you have it in I
have it in right now oh my god that's
why I left we're setting up I didn't you
didn't even say anything it works
otherwise I'm gonna bleed all over this
okay let me tell you something we're
gonna start this podcast off with some
fucking truth tampons and pads are
fucking bullshit
unless you wanna sponsor us unless
Tampax you want sponsors no but truly
leave a copy you should sponsors because
I will go to fucking war to defend the
Diva Cup on why it is so much better
than the tampons pads of the world I
mean as of right now I like it was a
little uncomfortable at first base I
can't believe you put it in yeah well
yeah I thought it would be good putting
it in the first time is the hardest part
yeah I just bared down we should all say
what a Diva Cup is it is also known as a
menstrual cup it is literally a tiny
little point it looks like if you were
to put something on like the edge of a
like banana what look if you were to put
a hat on a banana
it is dick like shaped if the head of a
dick was a little bit about dicks is
correct and trust me that's time it
would give a couple it's exactly like a
dick even the little tip if the penis
was a banana Wow here you think it's a
little cock so you take this it's made
out of silicone
and you just oh thank you
and just casually bends you bend it into
like a C like shape because it looks
like a little cup you got into a C and
then you just you got to be real
comfortable and close with your own
vagina you have to pull it a little bit
you don't really feel it like did you
feel like oh I didn't feel like Opel I
actually just stick my finger up yeah
rub it around and make sure that it was
open
well that's the thing is once it creates
that suction there's no blood game out I
have not leaked through a Diva Cup and
I've been using it for about a year now
I haven't used a tampon sense though how
do you clean it I I do it when I'm in
the shower I just pop it out when I'm in
the shower dump it out clean that with
hot hot water suck it back in there and
then after each cycle I just boil it and
put it in the dishwasher and it's it's
the greatest invention and put it in the
dishwasher
well I either boil it or I throw it like
if my roommates not home I'll throw it
in the dishwasher Brian like you know I
fuckin utensils in there that I eat with
sex toys in there too sometimes
oh my god Brian you poor thing I'm out
of shame Brian my roommate owes me a
fucking lot he's almost set our house on
fire multiple times and well he didn't
okay here's the two stories quickly you
almost burned a house down three times
because he gets drunk and he puts frozen
pizzas in the oven and then forgets
about them he falls asleep so I have
come home twice to the entire apartment
complexes fire alarm going on I've been
having sex with someone and the fire
alarm started going off and I opened the
door naked I mean the dude are like
trying to get our clothes back on and
the fucking fire smoke is coming out of
our fucking oven that's Brian and Brian
passed out drunk forgetting about a
pizza so there's that and then the other
thing is one time I count ran away when
he was supposed to be baby singing it I
don't blame him though the window was
open he jumped out of a window
yeah Brian didn't like let him out
anyways I love my roommate Brian
anyways I'm so proud of you for using
the Deena car yeah can you feel it can
you tell the listeners what it feels
like I felt a little uncomfortable at
first it was like what is this thing and
then for
second I was like ooh I have this
plastic cup in my vagina then I was like
ooh I just have freaking cotton balls in
my vagina and then I was like oh this is
forever you know what Alice about the
give a cup it's just like look sleeker
it looks like the iPhone got upgraded
like for me a ton of money on Tampa
poppin is I get like really really bad
cramps and this is gonna be pretty gross
- I think everyone listening but can't
we I also feel like you know like when
you have cramps you're not sure if you
have to poop or yeah nope yeah so I feel
like I'm wondering which one's gonna be
more uncomfortable I got a tampon or the
Diva Cup or blow you gotta let it
breathe sometimes you can shit with a
Diva Cup end and I feel like with a
tampon you always get like pee on the
string or you're worried that like maybe
you might touch the water they just pop
it out yeah well you can poop straight
up poop with it and let me tell you oh
wow we are going to lose a lot of male
subscribers here before that we have
yeah thanks for being here
yeah but also men should listen to this
because you're gonna get an insight and
look into a woman's life that you don't
get in fucking Cosmo am i right another
great feel I don't know how to caress a
shaft they tell you to do in Cosmo all
the time it's always correct shaft or
I'm a fun surprise and reach there on
the back end tickling shaft balls why
did you try reticular a shaft ball I'm
Irish this is fine yeah I'm Irish uh
also they always saw you put ice cubes
in your mouth when you give them a
blowjob I just remember reading that
about 50 stuff in your mouth yeah
there's not that much stuff in my mouth
unless I'm freaking eat chowing down
yeah maybe it also the best feeling in
the world is when you do have the period
shits because that is a real thing when
you're on your period the uterus is
contracting your walls are shutting so
it's pushing on your bowels harder and
the best feeling in the world is when
you take your Diva Cup out and then poop
cause it's like it was pushing on your
butt wall yeah you know I'm talking
about your right now in between you're
biting here that's what you do all the
time cuz I think my butt my butt wall is
my butt bag is closed so the poop is
just pushing on my bladder and I'm on
Prozac now so that constipate you I can
I say I love that you're on Prozac
because you I I've seen a change I gotta
be honest
yes you are a lot more full of wisdom
than usual
yeah for those of you who don't know
which is probably everyone I was
struggling there for a while with some
stuff so I went to therapy and now I've
been going to therapy and I decided that
I wanted more help how did you feel
going on pills because I know there's a
big stigma around a just giving help in
general but me then meeting feeling like
you need to have pills to feel normal
and there's such a fucking bullshit
stigma well you know I for a really long
time I thought that it was always like
it was like a cop out you know to use
medicine but I had tried everything else
I had tried like everything truly
everything yeah just absolutely
everything I have an eating disorder so
like everyone else
Wow okay you were just but I saw viewing
I'm so proud of you I mean I think it's
implied to have heard I remember when I
was like younger and struggling with and
not a lot of people were talking about
like anything like that people were just
commending like small bodies I remember
like dying to hear that other people I
remember the one girl from American Idol
Katharine McPhee's she had it she talked
about an eating disorder and I was like
oh my god she got better she there's
life after and some that was like 10
years ago and I'm only just starting to
it I kind of be okay with it but I had
tried truly everything else and then I
just not to get into like the whole
thing but I do like but we should do an
episode of yeah sure you guys want to
hear about that what heroes no yellow
snow but there is like an eating
disorder self in your real self and that
self you're so used to hearing all the
time so I like I would say like when I
was about to get on medicine in my head
I was just like you're lazy and you're
not trying hard enough and you're stupid
for this and blah blah blah but like all
these terrible mean things and then I
would just I had to just keep talking to
other people about it so that I could
stop being so mean to myself but it took
a year with my therapist before I even
trusted her enough to ask yeah that's so
dope that you're talking about it too
because I feel like that voice that
you're speaking of mm-hmm everybody has
that fuck for sure that's the other
thing you feel so alone you feel like
you and you feel dumb that's go baby you
feel so fucking dope cuz you
you know you're not alone like you know
like in moments of non depression or
like non anxiety I'm like oh wow I'm a
voice for mental health I might know so
many other people that struggle with
this but in those throes of like the bad
days or the bad depression or those
moments where like you're struggling
with like confronting your eating
disorder or confronting your panic like
it's so isolating and it's so it's
isolating and it makes you for that
reason it kind of makes you super
selfish even though all of your
decisions maybe it's not you but all of
my decisions were very much based off of
me be like I don't have anything to wear
I'm not gonna go out I look fat I don't
want to do this I don't want to do that
or whatever I don't want to try to talk
to this person because I'm not there
like size type and like all of these
things that I'm gonna you know tell
myself and still tell myself but try to
like work through it but because you
think like that you think you think that
the world is against you but really how
it truly translates to other people is
you being withholding and you being
super selfish and like elite in a way
and you're like you have no idea how
much I'm beating about me or the way you
have to be you have to be selfish to
also get help like it's a very actually
be self it's selfless to you know what I
mean to to admit like okay I can't do
this on my own that's a very like
selfish slash she's human yeah that's
just you know one could do it on their
own um so there's help out there I guess
that's the point of this little tangent
period and then I talked about how I'm
constipated because of Prozac no I'm
glad you brought it up because we were
just about to talk about November
occasion sober member and how that ties
into like this Thanksgiving and like oh
yeah family and all that shit we should
give an update so by the time this comes
out all have been sober for 14 days
which is the longest I've not drank in
shit time and I'm the first thing
everyone says when I tell them that I'm
doing sober member is oh my god you're
gonna lose so much weight and I'm like
that's not why I'm doing it while yes I
cannot fucking wait to lose five pounds
that's not why I'm doing it how sober
vember going for you so far um you know
what I thought it was really fun this
weekend I
don't have as much stake in it as you do
I was just like oh yeah I could I could
just see if I can do it yeah I mean I
know I could do it I don't know if I
necessarily want to do it but I think I
also just want to save money yeah I've
been spending like over like the past
few well it October all of October I
would just go out and be like spending
money that I could be using to buy a
calming shirt we didn't do anything this
weekend we well I should get we didn't
do anything this weekend for HOH member
but I think that was necessary to kind
of like realize that you don't have to
go out to have fun we laid in my bed all
weekend eating and watching movies and
we did not give a single fuck about dick
or puss now between so I feel like if
you're not actually out there hoeing
another good way to give a little
self-love get a little masturbation time
oh yeah watch some sexy sexy TV your
boring story
Oh means egg way this way but I was so
fucking glad I have been waiting to tell
Kate this story all fucking weekend and
I was like I have to see him for the box
a day okay so we're talking about
self-love we're talking about
masturbation yeah I woke up early one
morning and was like ah just needed to
rub one out was having sexy dreams I
just want to also point out that well
Kelsey is building all of this out there
art there's a whole group of people
outside filming some sort of like
commercial thing I did I didn't want to
I did rub one out and hear that buzz I
so I had actually gone on a date with a
girl the night before about that yeah so
I did go out on it I I did hoe vembur a
little bit but I did an actual date
where I had intention of not just
sleeping with her but I wanted to
actually get to know her
but the here's the problem is we were
fucking twins not only did we look alike
she was my height my haircut she was a
producer so she had like the same work
schedule as me like we were both there
we were just too fucking similar like we
didn't hook up but like still it was
like I am sorry I love yourself I know
my dream is to fuck myself and I I
almost did and it was just diesel doctor
no I
I kind of ruined it I didn't ruin it no
first of all fuck you look like the Tex
game just wasn't strong like after we
met up we just kind of got busy and like
she's like me she's a producer so I
respect that and I had her up maybe but
we were just too similar it was like
dating myself it was crazy okay
so after that day I was like feeling
like a little masturbation was the
masturbation station was necessary so I
go on my computer I opened up the
pornhub and I look up my favorite
category which is female squirting so on
the top video get fucking this it's a
compilation so I click it in the video
is almost email squirting compilation
like cut quick scene cut and edited to
that song Hailee Steinfeld's I love me
how possibly what genius not to put that
song aim at all the squirting anyways it
was incredible that's fantast I didn't
jerk off to it I couldn't finish to that
I was just so excited about the idea
that is a whole wait could I ask you a
question yes what is the weirdest thing
you've ever dirt off to I don't want to
admit it because I'm afraid the FBI
might flag me and I'm scared I was like
you haven't looked at some weird shit I
was about to tell you what the weirdest
thing I ever met or like turned me on
the weirdest thought there's a
difference between like be about a
person fucking a horse and actually
journey off to it well yeah for sure a
that's a good point that's a good point
because the weirdest thing that ever
turned me on was when I was in college
and I was at my friend's house
I was super duper high on the couch so
we were high and then we watched planet
Earth no and you did not get horny to
Planet Earth I got horny to the mating
rituals of that toad
because it tells just do what they want
oh my god did I just literally say it
with their whole body like no just melts
up and I was like if only I can just be
like once you cross the line of actually
coming to something like that then it's
like bestiality
yeah jerking it to it if you don't
finish I don't think it's that weird I
masturbate your travel shows sometimes
though beautiful places that's yeah
that's not that weird I feel like
sometimes you'll just get warning off
the most random things yeah like a like
a car commercial you know who loves
squirting more than I do
hmm I wonder I wonder who could it be if
I had to guess if I had to put a finger
on it no pun intended
if we had to put two fingers on it and
we bring in our next guest you're here
thanks so much for coming on and coming
on I love coming what you do here yeah
sure my name is tan hi miss trillion
yeah tell by the accent
thanks everyone can't actually some
people think I'm English do I have to
point that out
notify for a lot of Americans um I used
to work in the Sydney BuzzFeed office
and now I work here in LA how video yeah
what kind of content do you make here um
I make good content hey Kelsey yeah I
don't know why you said it so
aggressively like I die my life
everything from bring me like I travel
content
I would like to clarify that I don't
masturbate to bring me others our travel
vertical where you get you get to go to
a lot of cool places and try a lot of
cool things what's like the coolest
thing you what's the coolest bring me
video you've made we got to go to
Toronto and shoot in the newcomer
kitchen which is run exclusively by
Syrian female refugees oh my god that
was a really cool best food ever best
quality law so when when they what like
the prophets and stuff like that does it
get you like the actual family or does
it go to like help the other Syrian
refugees all profits go to all the women
that work there so then they're actually
paid a wage so it's like fifty women and
their families Wow it was really cool
nega has their shit so much more can i
also say the people in canada
kind of are Oh mate talk about coming
tell you what what are they beautiful
yeah
yeah every way in every way it's true
what they say WeHo in Canada I would
love to go in Canada I've only been once
and I went to a place where it was so
cold that our doors got frozen shut
that's another thing I think when
there's rough weather outside people
there's just we talked about this like a
shared misery yeah are you certain you
want to go inside and get fucking drunk
yeah Thanksgiving is coming up today
this is a dumb question do they
celebrate Thanksgiving no they don't you
know you all were thinking of it for
half a second Thanksgiving is not
celebrated in Australia or you know they
do have like other countries do have
similar holidays yeah but it's usually
where like white people did some shitty
shit oh no it's like we have to take
back the real meaning of what those
holidays represent what's Australia's
version of Thanksgiving well the people
who celebrate it and they call it
Australia Day the indigenous people of a
show traditional owners of the land
they'll call it survival or invasion day
wow it's kind of crazy how much
Americans don't know about Australia
finally when we have like so many
similarities and so much in common
have you ever celebrated Thanksgiving no
you had your first pumpkin pie recently
how did you know I saw it on Andrew
Gautier Instagram yeah what was it like
for using it was so good are you gonna
be in LA yeah I stay with Quinta every
year we like watch movies and just get
drunk we talk more about coming yeah
that's what the young people wanting
yeah yeah okay you ever fucked in your
parents bed when you're home why did you
shave me like you talked to your parents
I'm not my freakin opinion shouldn't
shame you I think that is gross to fuck
in your parents bed listen it happened
one Thanksgiving when everyone was out
did you change the sheets no I was a
teen I didn't give a fuck oh that's
different - and you're gonna parents
favorite pairs are pretty tight we talk
about sex stuff a lot my mom was the one
well I did want to bring this up this is
a great way to tie coming back into
Thanksgiving finally I was thinking
about the idea about how when I had the
sex talk I was taught about female
ejaculation and I feel like your mom by
my mom
like school we are only talked to and
taught about male ejaculation and so I
feel like there is a big shame and
stigma female ejaculation and some
people still think it's a myth or not
real and there's been I think we're not
thinking to those yeah oh you have
people have misconceptions around it
I know BuzzFeed wrote an article once
saying that female ejaculation was the
same chemical makeup of pee there was a
question about that
and so it's like news and people think
that squirting is pee that's what I
heard yeah no you didn't know I didn't
know I don't squirt I don't think maybe
I do a lot everyone squirt no so they're
not everyone can but also some people
it's like some really long time to work
out that they yeah like anything you
know I think is complicated
who knows I'll figure it out what if she
doesn't do tonight it's one of those
things like if it were to happen to you
and you didn't know what it was and you
were never taught about it you could
freak out and it could be a really
embarrassing thing especially if it
happens with another person yeah who
shames you or goes what the fuck is this
you just pee on me yeah and it could be
a really scary moment for women who
don't fucking know what it is or for
dude you don't know what it is a lot of
people really like it yeah are you one
of those people yeah okay what do you
what do you like about it
I think what's not to like about someone
having an orgasm and enjoying the fuck
out of themselves I think there's
something also really amazing about the
fact that it's really messy it's just
this moment of unfiltered raw it's so
raw and people would squirt to different
degrees as well like there can be a
little bit there can be a lot quite
you're laughing so much that's a great
those are all over the Internet Oh
Reggie oh yeah no original ideas I'll
tell you what there is also another
misconception is that squirting means
that you're coming as well you might
actually not necessarily be having an
orgasm when you're squirting you could
just yeah so it's not pee no yeah and it
all comes out of the same hole yeah
because I'm different part of part of
you in the ID so I actually spoke to a
sex boat
there's a couple of them back in Sydney
and I did a video about and they showed
me diagrams and it's it's very much a
separate area hmm
that it comes from yeah so it's my
gynecologist if you have that area well
everyone has the area oh yes happen to
it so what it relieves happening now
well so that's the that's the
misconception it's like can you if you
can stimulate this area suck so because
I feel for women that can't or haven't
yet it also brings about shame like
they're failing at something it's just
like hard either way like in either
squirting and you hate yourself for it
or you doing in greener genetic I mean
there's probably no way of finding that
out it's like and squirting isn't that
greater what ease already makes it sound
like very pornographic like very
cartoonish to me like it's a joke or
it's almost childish yeah have you ever
experienced it before yes they want to
talk about it sure what do you want to
know well a was it someone you were
doing it to and how to maybe teach
people that want to try it or even know
how where it comes from what are the
areas okay the first time it happened
was because it happened to me and it was
just through them can I swear yes okay
what they were fucking me and yeah that
happened and I was like damn I didn't
you didn't know I had no idea
Wow and this was like quite a few years
ago nor that ever spoken about it with
me I feel different than just regular
coming yeah it's a completely different
thing yeah but I do remember like I'm
learning a lot I've had a couple of like
partners where I get shy about it and
then I worry about it happening because
I'm like I don't know this person well
enough and if I just like come all over
them they might they might not know what
it is tell them is it like something you
could talk about before no it's just
something that I like
time work out whether they're so you can
control us like if we were to have a
one-night stand and it happens I
probably wouldn't have won during a
one-night stand because I don't ever
completely relax oh wow
interesting I feel like it's only when
I'm like super turned on and with
someone I really trust and but but still
I'm like there have been times are Mike
holy shit I have got to stop this yeah
about two and I don't know what so yeah
definitely the more people talk about it
yes have you ever had anyone negatively
react to it no I'm pretty lucky in that
everyone has been like dude that's the
other thing is like it becomes like a
mission for them to try to do it and
then that puts pressure on no pun
intended both parties to like try and
accomplish this like unicorn orgasm that
may or may not exist and it's a weird
secret talent to like reveal I feel like
sometimes together and then sometimes
people like make you square and then
they like act like heroes do it and
you're like to myself within like 15
seconds yeah well there's also the
actual anatomy of where it comes from
above the g-spot right so like if you
were to be inside of your vagina and you
come to like the front wall that's where
your g-spot is and then supposedly
there's like this fleshy sort of like oh
fleshies a weird word a sort of spongy
area that you're supposed to like push
put pressure against and you can
actually kind of feel the body filling
up I guess you could say it fills with
fluid yeah a combination of difference
yeah and then when the release happens
you can actually like feel it it it can
feel like peeing I think yeah it's kind
of like for me a lot of the time when
it's happening you can't control No yeah
exactly yeah yeah and it's like it's
pretty amazing in that way I don't think
I'd ever be I mean I truly don't think
I've ever even been that relaxed as a
human being constantly the other day I
heard someone caught outside my window
and I was like I can't have kids like
what if they got sick and died one day
look I can't hide that's what I thought
and I think about like oh fuck what my
dad's getting old this person's getting
all I'm scared of everything and so I
don't think that I will ever relax
enough to let go enough to just
well I think that's a big thing with
orgasms in general like a lot of women
who haven't ever had any kind of orgasm
or don't think that they can a lot of
the time it is purely psychological I
actually don't know if I've had one yeah
I mean I was a late bloomer too it took
me a really long time before I ever did
and I for so long I thought there was
something wrong with me like I'm pretty
complicated what made you start like
what made you not have one for me well
when I'm like masturbating or something
I'll just be like I'll get to a point
where it feels really really good and
then I'll be like okay that was nice but
the way I hear people talk about it Wow
you know oh I feel really good and then
okay that's that's done now I'm not for
sure it sounds like you've never had a
yeah I started having orgasms no joke I
think when I was like four or five I
started masturbating very very early I
mean I did too but I wasn't having
orgasms
I was definitely orgasming so I knew
what it felt like I said hump everything
I did it I'd hump the side of the tub oh
yeah I can tell oh yeah like the bus
coming home and be like I can't fucking
way to eat salt and vinegar chips and
then hump my hair no no no I just oh wow
I did beautiful things I just wanted I
wanted to eat chips and then I never put
my hands like down my pants it was
always like you can't hurt and stay away
with that someone vinegar played no part
got it okay got it no no no but like so
for me when I started when I started
having sex I knew I wasn't orgasming and
so it took me a long time to get to that
comfortability in that trusting place
for someone to actually orgasm because I
knew so vividly and so strongly what an
orgasm felt like and then when I had sex
for the first I don't know I want to say
no joke like 50 times I was like what
the fuck is the hype with all this
because you're not coming I'm not orgasm
I think mine still ties back to Catholic
guilt because you could identify the
problem but then you just like you see
the problem in so many different areas
of your life and you just sort of like
oh here you are again you piece of shit
and then not not Catholicism just this
the the way that I look at no no no no
not for me not my words
were you know so do you feel like he's
guilt then the way that I responded to
it you just said they're just like
frayed
yeah I don't know what my problem was I
had many problems as a kid but I think
what changed it for me was actually
buying a really good vibrator for the
first time three yeah hey you gotta like
set aside some time to lay the lights
down low I would say as well sex toys if
you can they were just one of those
things that are worth really investing
in I don't let myself come well then you
got it guys okay we gotta set some time
aside on your calendar Kate okay so
you're gonna make me cum Kelsey I'm
gonna make you mentally cough yeah how
are you coach you through it one of the
things that this expert talked about yes
how important our thoughts are during
this time which doesn't make it any
easier for someone who's stressed or
anxious like so I'm fuckin up my own
orgasm so then you're like extra stress
oh yeah yeah you watched it really a
good way to get your mind off yeah
I don't believe them though they're such
bad actors sometimes yeah you need to
believe
I love amateur porn amateur were like
real couples it takes away that like
cinematic approach or it feels very fake
and plasticky mm-hmm and it's really
like intimate yeah I hate when they just
like get touched once and then sort of I
watch lesbian porn
that's what I'm saying is that so
effortless or what you're doing it and
then I'm like you guys need to search
amateur I do mean since we talked about
what's the weirdest thing that's turned
you on I say jerk duck you're not saying
anything
good answer aha a lot of weird things I
think about a lot can I also say though
it makes sense it's like a lot of people
battle with this when their mind goes
into a really weird subdue slash dark
place it actually makes sense because we
trigger like adrenaline basically yeah
it's normal to get turned on over really
weird things yeah but it's something
that you know can block things that
people or feel like they're doing
something wrong well
that ties into exactly what you're
talking about with your Catholic guilt
Kate is like some people I know that
I've talked to friends of mine who have
said that in the middle of like
orgasming they will think about their
parents and not in like one of their
ties yeah and it's one of those things
where it's like it's wrong so it almost
perpetually like it comes back to your
body not being yours yeah and it has
stimulates the idea of like again like
you're doing something you shouldn't be
doing and then all of a sudden you feel
turned on and shamed at the same time
and there's nothing like sitting with a
group of people talking openly about
things like this yes Lee like things
that just aren't talked about well like
different ways to pleasure yourself
masturbation in general it's so like
most people do it or think about doing
it at some point why not just discuss it
and what I feel like growing up we would
also if girls were to talk about it and
just be like yeah I masturbate oh yeah I
do this or something it was everyone was
so quick to be like she's doing it for
attention she's doing it for her she's
only saying that for guys and so in my
head I was like don't fuckin talk about
it because people won't believe you
that's not your truth you know what I
mean yeah I went to like a super
Catholic high school but my family and
not really just as I said but I was that
kid that would walk around asking
everyone whether they masturbated pass
around notes in science be like hey
Chris do you jerk off how often they did
like I was so intrigued about people's
patterns and well I feel like I was a
Honda well no like dudes were so free
and open to talk about jerking off and
jokes were always made about dick so
early on but like there was never any
talk or jokes within like female circles
about female masturbation there was a
period of my life where I said I would
never go down on a girl oh yeah yeah oh
that I do I I think I was about 13
though so I was still like I identified
as bi at the time but like not like
totally how do you identify now I forgot
to ask you up top I'm just like queer
yeah I don't really want to pigeonhole
anything I do want to get sound bites
from you I know you have to go back to
work no I'm gonna go home and masturbate
Yeah right there you go
we see turd from the Thanksgiving theme
of this episode and I think people will
be glad to have done it in the name of
squirting I think people will be really
thankful anyone that gets to learn how
to squirt or like try it so my advice is
to masturbate as as much as you can to
learn about yourself in general but if
you were to use your fingers and just
push against the walls that are it's
kind of like going about ha
what fingers use these two I use these
two right if you kind of like what you
do coat I really don't know Kate what
yes yes okay I don't know I don't know
so go inside yourself kind of a judgment
okay I'm the vagina wall yes I'm the
front of the vagina walls go up okay
you're very cool okay for people who are
watching this or who are only listening
to this I'm holding my hand up like I'm
waving yeah and my fingers are at
heuristic going into her palm I would
stop about halfway you can feel that
it's like very spongy there and some
common kind of almost ribbed for
something yeah well and if you like push
there repeatedly while kind of
contracting your muscles you're gonna be
pushing out yeah then you're more than
likely to squirt I'm doing a key ball
right now I don't want to push out my
guys ten where can people follow you
because you're so fucking bad-ass
we didn't even get to touch on all the
amazing stuff we're gonna have to have
you back on ever and didn't talk about
where can people go follow you because
everyone really should go follow Dan
she's incredible and it was incredibly
smart whip-smart like I look the fuck up
to you because I think you're because
I'm so tall ya know we're all the same
height lying down am i right
Tania Safi is uh is my name you can find
me on every
actually ta NIH not wire get that right
and we love you thank you can you back
Wow I learned a lot I like I filled I
feel bad that I kept going Kate yeah
also I didn't know that you you know so
much about you either okay like I feel
like I know so much about you because we
talk every single fucking day
right like I learned a lot about you
today I learned that I'm not
masturbating right there's no wrong way
to masturbate maybe you're not coming I
would go ahead and say that that one
wrong one laughter how are you 27 we
don't need to talk about it I think
though I mean 28
there's never there's it's never too
late to learn how to make yourself calm
but I don't think it's too late for you
to try and there's still so much ahead
of you that you don't know unless we
don't die soon well that could very well
happen with the state of the world
that's okay so that's what that's what
my goal is that's what my personal goal
whole Gambler to yourself a little bit
I'm gonna yeah well I just also just
want to get some good lays in there
before the world burned but you know
what I don't know okay and if i frickin
die before having good sex
I don't know God and I might get reamed
for saying this but I don't know if
you're gonna be able to fully come with
someone else like I we I should do it
myself or just like get a little more
comfortable with that because then at
least when you're fucking someone else
you can there is a weird way of not
giving a fuck if the other person comes
when you're having sex like I think we
spend so much time trying to make other
people come and getting worried about
the other person finishing that we're
not looking out for ourselves and 9
times out of 10
mm-hm and so I think it a personal goal
to like make sure I get mine when I'm
having sex especially if it's someone I
know I'm not gonna see again but there
is a lot of pleasure out of making
someone else come so I fully get that
but I think I want you to come on your
own okay I have a lot of one-speed just
because you're one of my best friends
