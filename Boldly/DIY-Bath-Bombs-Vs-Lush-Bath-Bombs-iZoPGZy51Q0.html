happening I think the bowl is going to
explode in my face hey there my name's
Ashley and I do a lot of DIY projects
like a lot of DIY projects so I ask you
guys what are some Pinterest hacks and
DIYs that you think are totally focused
way too good to be true
definitely going to end up as a
Pinterest fail today we're going to look
at bath bombs
so the original vog lush bath bomb vs.
this little DIY bath bomb recipe that I
found on the internet I peruse the
internet pretty thoroughly there are
about a million into bath bomb recipes
but I think I found one that pretty much
looks just like this according to the
picture but we all know that doesn't
mean much let the investigation be
tell me how much um it said just eyeball
it it doesn't tell me exactly how many
drops of it in and they're like assuming
that I have good judgment fractions say
that it's supposed to like kind of come
together like a snowball which is not
quite there yet and it said if that is
the case to spritz it with water until
it gets to that consistency okay so it's
clumping just about right
and now the next step is start putting
it in the mold okay but it's not hard at
all
I might added too much water like how
does this harden and then they are
supposed to just sit on the plate like
that no way there's no way this is cool
oh no it is hardening oh this is not
working oh my the first one was pretty
easy I did it like twice I don't this
one work okay so we only got one and
that's all we're gonna get so now we're
going to drop them in a big tub and see
what happens
yay alright folks so we're we start with
the D iwata bath bomb I'm kind of sad
about dropping into the water I'm not
gonna lie I've grown attached this
little guy little pastel nugget but if
you love something you must let it go so
go three two one Oh kind of just looks
like it's making the water dirty Oh is
really soapy oh yeah oh I think I'll
little is I coming to the top alright so
maybe our DIY guy wasn't the fantastic
rainbow we all hoped it would be but I
mean I still think it could have been
worse
however I don't think it will even hold
a candle to the lush bath bond that I
have right here so without further ado
let's give it up for the lush backbone
boom oh my god Wow yeah ours didn't do
that
I love it I love it I love it I love it
all right so just based on this alone I
think it's clear that this D I try
should really be a di bi because this is
freaking awesome yeah I wouldn't do this
every day I don't have money to flush
down the drain like that but for a
little treat yourself kind of day this
is pretty awesome I do think that the
DIY backbone might be good you won't
have a party and you guys all make bath
bombs where or for like batch
gift-giving I think that might be cool
like if you want to make a lot of your
co-workers or a lot of your friends a
gift and you want to make it one big
batch and then just make individual bath
bombs give people I think it could work
or something like that yeah it's pretty
awesome definitely just buy it build DIY
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
