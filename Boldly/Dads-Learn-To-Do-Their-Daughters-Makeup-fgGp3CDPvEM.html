today we're at Flushing tynin West
Hollywood and my dad is going to learn
how to do my makeup fear I would say
we've always had a pretty strong
relationship my dad and I disagree on a
lot but I think the fact that we're able
to talk about what we disagree on makes
our relationship stronger what's your
relationship for a while for me it was
strained my parents got divorced when I
was three you kind of missed all the
milestones getting to wear makeup and
you know I think I just showed up one
Christmas and had a full face of makeup
see her one time when she actually had
makeup on and realized my little girl
had grown up you know without me being
able to be part of that I just want to
spend time with my dad and maybe get a
little bit of that from the past that we
missed my dad and I spent a lot of time
talking to each other but not actually
doing activities together this seemed
like a fun activity for us to bond over
first step here that I'll be doing is
putting foundation on her the way
foundations apply is very minimal and
then you get the beauty blender the
beauty blender is already soft blend it
into the skin like this just like that
dad you got it it looks pretty easy so I
put a little bit there right so let's go
ahead and switch the brush yeah you got
this good much now blend this part here
oh no wonder we're using the concealer
so now we're gonna get to how to add a
shadow on my eyes get the brush from the
tip and then just blend it in here and
exam all over her eyelid that's right
there you go I don't even know if
there's any makeup being applied it
looks good
so now you're gonna get another brush
and you're gonna get a little bit of
darker shape and then you're gonna start
off right in the corner oh not bad right
it seems well blended that's like this
better than I do it now we're gonna get
to the eyeliner part
so now I'm gonna go ahead and pull her
eyelid upwards close to the eyelash I'm
gonna create a very thin week I think
this is the hardest part of makeup
itself even me that I'll make up artist
I feel confident if I should pull my
classes I did a pretty good job actually
yeah yeah you've got this little guy
right there but if you're looking from
far away I think it looks okay we're
gonna go ahead and add some mascara just
sideways and upwards I am a professional
okay look at that he's even rolling the
wand I'm sweating through my shirt
now we're gonna be doing eyebrows a
little dark me I'll fix it I'll fix it
this is a color correcting palette so
what it does it's gonna get rid of the
darkness that you have underneath it's
just gonna give you an even under eye
and bring it down a little to the nose
where she has a redness knows you just
might get a good amount of this very
lightly okay nice and even your side it
on the t-zone area
patitos go on the cheekbones back and
forth then you're gonna come up here to
the forehead go down to the chin I have
absolutely no idea why why I'm doing
this part of it go upwards to the
forehead line yeah you want to keep it
close to the floor and there you go yeah
it looks good do you see what it did oh
yeah I honestly can't tell the
difference between before and after
putting the bronzer on this area right
yeah and go upwards cuz I like a
checkmark going upwards that was the
easiest step so far and I can actually
see the difference so I'm just going
back and forth here and I'm just keeping
it here by the eye on top of the brow a
little bit on the tip of the nose and
then my little bit she already did the
tip of the nose don't get a little bit
more can never have too much eye like so
we're gonna add more in here go ahead
and make that keeping it it's it's
subtle very good thank you
now we're gonna do some lip here I'll
just do a little bit of one nip that way
you could do the rest just keep it down
inside her lips this is a lot of work I
don't know how you ladies do this very
like a giant glob I think it looks
pretty good
so I I just spray this on her face yeah
but you're gonna keep it from a good
good distance so is this good
yes I think I'm getting close and there
we go that's the final look oh wow I
think it looks pretty good I'm happy
with it I thought this was super fun
in terms of bonding with my dad and
maybe I'll try something more in his
turf next time like biking it's easy to
correct mistakes and I think that that's
probably why I succeeded I expected you
to be worse I think when done right I
think it looks beautiful and you have a
beautiful daughter I love the way she
looks this was really important for me
that's just something I've missed out on
my whole life gonna ruin this makeup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
