for them because this was my first word
really it's not yeah the word that you
use all the time since every hidden
secret that she has has come to me not
her mom
we lived across from each other freshman
year of college we were theater majors
together I've known her for a lot longer
than this except arrow and there are no
secrets between us to up the stakes of
this game here whoever wins gets to go
on a romantic date with me there's no
question I'm gonna whip your butt
I did go to Russia oh but you were sick
the old huh every time I would try and
drink or eat I would just vomit on
myself which is why is definitely my
maybe Lisa chicken she also got out of
her comfort zone and I got thirty points
for that yeah yeah on the playground
wouldn't Bennett was just playing with
like a few like toys and he looked up
your eyes met right when you arrived at
the bottom of the slide he tripped and
you guys kissed
I've definitely did nothing like that
but uh yeah bet it was my kindergarten
crush and he had a fake wife he was Kate
MacFarlane I was the girl cries but you
were a mistress in kindergarten Michael
is a kid he went to my high school who I
set up with somebody else
I'm gonna prom and then she was really
pissed off about it
I have wanted to go to Iceland for a
while and see the Northern Lights I
almost don't know if my mom deserves the
point because she doesn't walk me to go
guys I never drank too much I don't know
if that's specific enough mom
I just remember being at a party they're
all like very excited to go to LMFAO and
then didn't remember anything besides
waking up some very nice guy saw us us
walking around belligerent land got us
back safely to my dorm room where I
proceeded to vomit everywhere I was just
so sick the next day that I called my
mom who came to Chapman and helped clean
my room
well she berated me about how if my dad
ever found out about this he would
disown me and be really I was just
grateful you survived because it's very
dangerous hey it's pretty close the
moment someone tells me that I'm gonna
fail at something it's like fuel to the
tank and then it makes me want to do
something more she doesn't give up
I mean Jennifer's gone in for jobs and
and has been told no you're not right
for it and then she'll turn around and
say I'm gonna show them that I am right
I could have prepared a little more in
Ostra some more questions for example
that what hospital were you born
question didn't come up like I was
hoping it wouldn't where what hospital
was she born in Saint Joseph said isn't
it or Saint Joseph st. Joe wrong you
wanted a better Sinai it's a win for me
just having you as my daughter so I'm
with my mom we're having our little
friend day
and what did we decide to do mom we're
gonna go cupcake these cupcakes are just
round one we're obviously gonna have at
least three more rounds of cupcakes
right mom I think I overdid eating the
cup we only have four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
