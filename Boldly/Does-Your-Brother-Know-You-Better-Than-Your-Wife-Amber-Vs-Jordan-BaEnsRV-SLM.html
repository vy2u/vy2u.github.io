years I remembered him when he had
chicken wing hair
I knew Tyler through every relationship
he's ever been in not just this one ever
doesn't know anything about Tyler
I've known Tyler for six years I think I
know everything there is to know
definitely more than Jordan College you
weren't around you're a kid neither were
you member here's the day-to-day
kvetching and you have heard it for many
years but you know you're you're a
little more removed you and out you
totally done very much between two and
I'm sure you are
oh no I thought you talked to Amber
slightly more than mom spelled WR OMG Oh
who the is Alicia super sad
listen he was in love with her I was
torn between Penelope Cruz in selma
hayek i first wrote down Salma Hayek
alright we all got right everyone got it
shower well done guys as how around
cutting to the core mines in the ball
park your slash you're so good with
young people they're given regular aged
people but I've got a knack no it is
true I'm pretty sure I know this one
pretty sure you know this one
cocky mother here I kid so many girls
yeah baby I don't ever ever actually
it's summer that's it I got her
I got a point on the board really you
have nothing she's filled out
oh we all got it it's not weird at all
your weirdest superstition is literally
the most common she looks at my phone 20
times a day no I don't eat man walking
on the beach so you're right if it Tyler
and amber on a mountain they're
constantly posting pictures of
themselves on mountains is it wouldn't
live in the mountains like ever since I
moved to the mountain yeah it can't be
more proud that they are near mountains
well amber I think the game is rigged
I think it's good that you're in a
relationship where your wife knows you
pretty well I'm glad I didn't just like
smoke amber but I'm a little
disappointed that I got smoked I
believed in you I thought you had this
well now we're the chance now everyone
knows BuzzFeed videos aren't rigged this
is my video right I kind of feel like
that Penelope Cruz when we should give
it to you but didn't I knew me better
than I knew myself should you put jazz I
saw yours and I was like no that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
