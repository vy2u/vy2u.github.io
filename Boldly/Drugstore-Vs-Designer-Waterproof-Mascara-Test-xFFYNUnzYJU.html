best day to wear white is just trickling
down I'm currently on the lookout for a
new waterproof mascara because yet girl
cries a lot so I'm gonna make six of my
co-workers try on six different mascaras
3 will be drugstore brands and three
will be Sephora brands and I'm gonna
make them go through ridiculous has to
find out which waterproof mascara it's
actually the most waterproof
what are we doing our first test is
gonna be the crying test and we're gonna
cut this onion ooh
it's potent I didn't know we were
actually gonna try and make me cry cry
really freaking easily very easily
that's I thought you know I've seen that
in movies they know who did that
ratatouille it's clearly misty it's
still on though it's like kind of
smudged at the bottom over here I don't
know how it got there for drugstore
mascara and yeah I didn't change at all
that's surprising and you can see a
little dot yeah I think it's the wand
and it's definitely flaking there's like
a little smudge down here really okay
ready for a night out I am got a little
you listen to Whitney before you want
out I'm feeling it a little bit I could
watch the notebook in this mascara and
still look okay is the water cold Oh
Lord it's cold is this big enough for my
head I don't think this is big enough do
you ever have like hold your breath
contest one two three
oh no that doesn't look like Superbad
the Diorshow works really great for
volume I'm not sure if that's what you
want on the beach but you know it might
be nice if you're crying don't walk out
you're wrong it's kind of wiping off on
my fingers oh there's specks but it's
not as much as other things like I've
not full-on Milan right now I'm gonna
get better than sex
I honestly think I'm gonna give it a ten
out of ten yours looks exactly it looks
exactly the same
it performs really well under harsh
conditions it gives a very natural look
and it separates your lashes very well
well pretty well it's great for like and
every day going to work or class or
watching movies and crying by yourself I
look you can't see right now it's just
like black is like halfway up my wiping
off the face nope
they stayed up though they did sit like
buried up dude yeah this is definitely
smudging down here I did have a little
bit of run it but it looks so natural
and I feel like anyone could wear this
and be happy
voluminous I had faith in yo what I was
pleasantly surprised with the results of
the mascaras because I think they posted
really well I actually think the
drugstore one did better than the
high-end brand that I'm wearing which is
really impressive no ugly crying always
use good mascara you don't want to cry
like Selena Gomez is it better than sex
though the only thing better than sex is
burritos like that's true whoo speaking
the truth right now fan thank you for
sharing your truth with me look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
