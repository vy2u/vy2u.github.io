and adults I can say that a drunken
adult and a five-year-old are exactly
the same thing I fell asleep in my
hiding spot while playing hide and seek
I was drunk woke up about 6 o'clock in
the morning the next day not really
understanding what had happened at night
I knocked out a guy's tooth for telling
the same stupid joke over and over again
I was a kid
sorry Chris I slept over at one of my
friends houses and heated bed two nights
in a row
I was drunk we had to hide it from him
both times because we didn't want them
to like kick me out of the house okay
someone told the knock-knock joke and I
heard it and I cried for four hours
straight I was drunk I don't remember
what the knock-knock joke was that's
where I learned that comedy is pain I
was at a party and I wound up getting
naked and throwing a bag of at
everyone
I was a kid my parents were having a
Christmas party I appeared at the top of
the stairs completely naked and with a
bag in my hand and before they could say
or do anything I threw it at the wall
and it turned out to be a very full
diaper Merry Christmas I got in the
driver's seat of a Jaguar and
immediately crashed it into a tree I was
a kid and my mom was much more careful
with me in the car I saw a single boob
in a ball pit and I was drunk it was
with this girl that was like a friend of
a friend and I was having a terrible
time reading her advances we ended up in
a ball pit that my friends and I had in
their dorm room we decided to make a
ball pit that's a whole nother story
honestly only seeing one boob of this
girl really made sense if he knew this
girl I slapped a stranger in the face
because he didn't wish me happy birthday
I was drunk
started chasing after me and I hid hit a
Whole Foods parking garage while my
friend stalked it down drugged me
thought this is the funniest thing in
the world I had to go pee on a really
long car ride and then when I was almost
home I peed on the elevator
I was drunk I'd never no one ever knew
it was just a long night you know it's
my birthday and he goes back it doesn't
matter everyone's got a birthday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
