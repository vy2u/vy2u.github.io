too much foam okay what was that
Oh
love would be a piano in organ a harp or
something it's so beautiful but so
complicated it just feels like like
string like heart strings and piano
strings but I just realized violin also
has strings but violins are nice too
you know I don't know
where can you come up with these what
are these cars chicks love is a
butterfly because it's just so free and
careless but if you look really close
it's really scary-looking both can
totally be a cat cuz it's like their
butt doesn't need to be at the forefront
of your thought all the time
that's a good question I picture love as
a bottle of tequila but also I just spit
everywhere you know like a gif of like a
heart and then like this like look like
ripples coming out love looks like a
picnic in the middle of a beautiful
Prairie I picture the person that I love
and I feel really happy and warm I think
love is great because love is there for
you in good times and bad all I can
think about is my cat cuz I love
my cat so much but that makes me sound
like a crazy young adult cat human it's
such a relief to tell somebody you love
them and they love you back and it's
like the best feeling in the world and
cry but it's like all these emotions all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
