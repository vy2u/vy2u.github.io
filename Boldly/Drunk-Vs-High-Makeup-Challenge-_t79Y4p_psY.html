bottles of Prosecco and I'm going to be
recreating the same makeup look as I did
when I was drunk challenge one eye
shadow I don't know what I don't know
how drunk I was to want to pick black
eye shadow but I did the 100% look I'm
going for
cuz I'm just trying to go a little bit
lighter on this shadow it looks like I
have two black eyes this looks so bad oh
no no no no no no this spot and my eye
won't cover yes okay I've seen this on a
runway somewhere yeah I was really
positive that I would do better when I
was high I've never won black eyeshadow
in my life and I don't know why I
decided now was a good time all right
foundation I started drinking at about
2:00 o'clock and right now it's about I
feel like a zombie my makeup looks like
it's done for a horror film I don't know
if it's the lighting or if I'm just now
realizing I'm wearing the wrong shade
foundation
I don't remember the majority of that
drunk video the next step is highlight
contour and blush rihanna told me to
wear highlight so i'm gonna wear a
highlight this looked like a lot yeah
it's about you it's a little bit bold
next to my dark a sigh I don't even know
if I'm actually contouring I have to pee
so bad I don't even care I pretty
positive you can't even see this bronzer
[Laughter]

on a lash in my life
like this yeah that looks right this big
to apply away why I feel like I'm
something in my eye

to my lid okay now comes a little
lipstick my mouth

to pee so bad Wow this look is one of
those looks where I'm like wondering if

see my lashes this is the best I've ever
pitted my nails in my life I mean I know
