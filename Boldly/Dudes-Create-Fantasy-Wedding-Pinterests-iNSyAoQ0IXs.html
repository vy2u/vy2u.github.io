cuteness right now
goodbye world I've heard of interest but
I don't really know anything about it I
did when it first started getting really
popular so I joined it and then realized
only girls were on it think Pinterest is
a place where women go for all their
wildest dreams to come true marriage has
come up in the conversation between my
girlfriend on numerous times every guy
has submit at least once in their life
to think about the wedding and what's
gonna look like I have a general idea
what I want but not really let's plan a
dream wedding I'm thinking like outside
wooden table let's look little wooden
table I mean the picture for Pinterest
is already like a good-looking dude with
a baby that's I'm not their target Emma
huh there's literally like every single
thing that you could think of on a
wedding Oh what if I got a tiger for my
way oh wow
this is cool pimp your cupcake bar
that's done see now I'm going down the
rabbit hole now man I'm like kind of
overwhelmed well I'm kind of like super
excited oh my god yes I'm getting a baby
tiger and a baby wolf and they're gonna
bring the rings down the same three
dudes with banjos keep on showing up so
far I'm seeing things that annoy me I'm
not very many things I want I'm gonna go
back to the woodshed that's wrong wanted
to I want to see some more cool things I
can do with pieces of wood I can semi my
best man my Pinterest board be like I
want exactly this I think it's super
cool because I can get like inspiration
from it I guess that's why people use
Pinterest we've done sick sets this is
like a mecca for the dope photography
and dope I think planning a wedding
like just looking at the 15 things like
Pinterest is gonna be a little bit more
difficult than just interesting them
this is this a bunch of cute man
this is a trap bro from the standpoint
of making the wedding board I couldn't
care less because I just assumed I'm
gonna let my wife choose everything
about the wedding you know we all have
seats for jay-z and Beyonce to come and
show I don't know if I'm me about my mom
