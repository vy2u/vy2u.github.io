didn't know that having sex would lead
to pregnancy she had no idea an old man
came into the office complaining of a
new spot in his chest they had to tell
him sir
that is your nipple everyone has these I
had to explain that pastors do not cure
anything but just covered up a wound the
patient in question had tried to cured
her recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes
by sticking plasters all over herself I
had a lady who measured her baby's
temperature by preheating the oven and
putting one hand in front of it while
the other hand was on the baby's
forehead
she told the nurse her baby's fever was
about 250 degrees I've had to inform a
few male patients that the condom only
goes on the shaft and should not be
pulled down to cover the testicles I've
told more than one parent that their
infant should not be drinking dr. pepper
out of their bottle I told a lady that
she had to have her foot amputated she
wasn't concerned because she said it
would grow back patient comes in she's
upset she's pregnant and she doesn't
understand why she's on the pill upon
talking to her at great lengths I find
out that she only takes the pills on the
days that she is sexually active and at
no other time I once had to use the word
dick instead of penis because the
patient didn't know the proper term for
genitalia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
