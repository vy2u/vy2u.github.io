terrible secret I think he's just kind
of sinister it's kind of like a chew toy
for a dog there are some beans in his
butt ear here there's no feet which is
kind of weird cuz like has he get around
it's kind of like he committed a
horrible crime and Santo was like
basically tortured him and cut off his
feet and sewed his hands together it
looks like he's passing gas thank was it
at night he probably goes out and gets
into trouble he probably goes around at
night looking for like feet to take so
that he can have them it's like I'm
gonna wake up and he's like trying to
strangle my arm it kind of looks like if
you touch him he'd like it so I heard
that you're not supposed to touch him
otherwise he loses all his magic do I
get his magic can I like steal it if
he's getting moved in the middle of the
night I guess that's all up to him so
we're all just kind of scared of this
elf
let him do its thing in our own homes so
I think the purpose of him is that he
spies on kids so that the kids are on
their best behavior it's actually pretty
clever because you spend like 20 bucks
and you buy this little doll and you can
tell the kids that the doll is spying on
you and boom instant behavior it's a
cute way to scare your kids
