considered the first selfie in history
it sure looks like one parmigianino a 21
year old Italian artist painted himself
using a barber's mirror he gave it to
the Pope as a gift so even at the
beginning it was established selfies are
for sharing in terms of drawing
Rembrandt put together this pretty great
duck face self-portrait in 1630 the
first photo self-portrait was taken by
Robert Cornelius a chemist from
Philadelphia he had to take off the lens
cap run into frame sit for one minute
then run back and cover up the lens
selfies used to take that kind of
commitment
the modern selfie began with the first
true camera phone which was made by
Sharpe and released in Japan in November
of 2000 it had a mirror next glance so
is basically designed for selfies even
though that term wouldn't be coined
until 2002 in Australia where they had a
habit of adding the suffix ie to things
like Barbie for barbecue and Aussie for
Australia in 2011
Jennifer Lee became the first person to
use the hashtag selfie on Instagram
since then it's been used more than 80
million times but there aren't as many
selfies posted as you might think
only about 5% of Instagram pics are
selfies the city with the most Instagram
selfies per capita is Manila in the
Philippines
number two is New York City 3 is Miami
and at number 4 Anaheim California
thanks to Disneyland the 4th most
magical place on earth take a picture of
yourself across the world women take way
more selfies than men they also tilt
their heads more a 12 point three degree
tilt for women versus only eight point
two percent from n the average selfie
photographer is twenty three point seven
years old but in the over 40 selfie
crowd photographers are more likely to
be male than female as you probably know
selfie was the Oxford English
dictionary's Word of the Year in 2013 a
year that included the first ever Pope
selfie and President Obama's selfie at
Mandela's memorial service but it
wouldn't be until 2014 that Ellen's
Oscar selfie blew up Twitter and became
the most retweeted tweet ever in the
grand scheme of things
selfie history is still in its infancy
we'll continue to evolve or is it
already in decline what do you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
