it cut a certain time
Kelsey knows more about like the video

send last week's episode with me and my

amount of footage versus your download

last one guys yeah reunited cuz you say
uniting we don't see each other -

and my friendly off to the woods in a
cabin who are you I beat it baby yeah

vacation this weekend was the first
moments of chill I had just because when
I was home for Christmas
I got really sick after you listen to
the last podcast so I'm just glad I'm
excited to get back to work I'll just
 say that I'm excited to get back
into the routine breaks like this always

makes you feel like for some reason
but also wildly optimistic optimistic
New Year's Eve Kelsey can't talk yeah
I'm excited
I got did you drink you did drink for
New Year's you and your when Jesus
Christ did I drink I so I had all these
plans to go out for New Year's and then
 our friend Garrett Warner who
all of y'all know from BuzzFeed said hey
let's go to Korean barbecue at 6 p.m. so
that's bad he's an enormous human being
so he could drink a lot he's like 6 7 I
don't know if that Kali is very tall and
6 o'clock is 6 hours away from midnight
I don't know if you guys who are doing
math know that and well let's just say I
got to 11 p.m. and then I blacked out I
have no idea what happened I woke up
with my boots on in my bed I
my plan was cuz I'm back in Philly right
now and my player Bosley in Philly yeah
uh and my plan was to hang out with my
friends until our other friend got out
of work and then we would all go to her
boyfriend's our other friends bar
whatever that wasn't confusing to fall
out yeah you guys got it anyway we start
drinking and then I was like oh I'm
tired
this isn't good this is this is bad and
I should say that I did it but I did
take an adderall to stay up and dogs
even disagree I know but I took it and
their years we all make mistakes
sorry about that dog barking whose
 dog is that I don't know I think
it's an outside dog oh but not that
lives outside but it's just not within
my reach or control but yeah and then
I'm just full blackout full I got in a
car I got in the lift and they had
straws just for no reason a bunch of
like a cup of straws
okay in in the door and I just grabbed a
couple and put him in my bra I was like
you never know
that cage my friend yet I have not yet
okay but but now I think I already told
you this story but I don't think I told
you all the deets right I don't my
Christmas my Christmas make out about
your Christmas miracle
I said make out cuz you still wanted to
hook up in 2017 to tell us what happened
guys
I just I tried this is you close did you
come close here's the thing ya know not
coming I didn't I didn't get close to
that I got close to we were being his
kid who I liked that was blown for a
while is it man
oh yeah I always say kid we just take it
you're right yes a man is he's older
than me a father's gotta clarify for the
other day you have you careful at that
 I know I got a garret actually told
me that he's like you really need to
Stassi sorry man anyway this man and I
thought it was really cute for a long
time I was drunk enough to be like I
want to make out with you this is the
guy from back home
yeah and then we did we were making out
and yeah you with its you were
bugging out so I I know I even put the
like blanket over us and was doing one
of those Cyrus oh it's the Thoreau
classic yeah footsie and everything I
was just going for it and then mind you
I'm almost in a full blackout at this
point yeah yeah yeah but I I knew that I
wanted to hook up with him but he was a
decent guy he's a good guy what does
that mean hey he knew I was away drunker
than him be he was like we're not gonna
do it on the couch when there are other
people in the know so you guys were like
at a house party trying to bone on a
couch or the other and I was like forget
about the like a real piece of
 and he was like I really don't
think we could forget about them but I
still wasn't listening so I was like ya
know we're gonna have sex right we're
just gonna that's what's gonna happen oh
god I want that so bad for you so I took
my tights off and then when I looked at
all that's hard it was gone
and I was like you've got to be
kidding and you like turned around to
take your tights off and then when you
turn back round poof he was God like a
magician Harry Potter you just I was
just really focused on taking my tights
off so I was under the blanket like
serving a task yeah yeah air control
Tonica yeah it was hard but then he was
just be vanished he may have said Byetta
was he hard I don't know I think so what
I didn't touch his dick either we were
in the thigh area if you did just graze
over the deed
no okay that's usually good indicator
you know if I don't know so wait I don't
know anyways the next day you felt
really bad because why because I felt
bad that I was so drunk because here's
the thing I'm not I'm not innocent in
this uh-huh because once you left I was
like absolutely not check there was like
what that's like that is that I'm worse
that's the worst like then I know
something's over and you're like wait I
have so much more I want to say it do I
was like come back I texted his friend
and was like he's mean oh no no I really
like white girl wasted out oh that's
yeah that's what like a couple times
this break one of the types oh dude you
can't drink in an every Instagram story
I know I'm not drinking again for until
I want like you're not gonna drink until
you want to again I'm so frustrated I
really want to have sex with him well
you should carry that frustration over
in the 2018 and maybe touchdown
speaking of great quotes with New Year's
my buddy who it also has a podcast his
name is dr. Chris he had this great
quote that made me think of like us and
just how we talk about ourselves about
New Year's is like you have to be really
careful around this
year because it's when like society is
at its got its dick out for the
gym and dieting and trying to be a new
you and shoving it in your face
everywhere you look it's what I'm
talking about it's like for fuck's sake
can we just all make an agreement this
year that in January we're not gonna
 make ourselves feel guilty about
 just because of what day of the
month it is hole yeah yeah it's nuts
it's such a it listen I get close to
buying back into it and having like it
eating disorder is if it's a hard time
of the year to be like no balance I
don't have to go you know one way or the
other with anything I don't have to join
this gym and get this like rock-hard
body and yadda yadda yadda it's like
everything or not that one yeah and I
like I just I never want to present to
anyone like if it the listeners or you
know whatever I just never want to
present that as being like that means
you're worth something if you diet and
you exercise and you try to get a better
you that means you're worth something
because it's just weird that because
it's such a moneymaker
it is diet magazines like get rid of
this stubborn belly fat and it's like
wow a belly fat that's what a person has
that's a real but it's also like what if
what if we put because I thought about
this I thought about how much time and
energy I put into worrying about like
what I would I would eat or like how
much I would work out or something and I
was like oh I put that much energy into
my writing and like what I wanted to
write and like even stand up or like I
would mean yourself yeah dude it's just
it's but I mean it really like the
people profit off of it that's why I
like Jenny Craig and has yeah not
to say any about Jenny Craig I mean
whatever
I tried Jenny Craig before the food is
 terrible
I am I saying it I don't mind cuz I
don't care about I'm not trying to get
any sponsorship from any sort of weight
loss thing yeah me neither
I'm saying that right now I don't if
you're listening you're like oh cool yo
girl we had a chance to do an ad for a
sort of miracle body we won't say which
one because we obviously don't realize
direct anyone towards it but we had a
choice and you immediately were like you
will not hear
here no absolutely does our viewers know
one we're bullshitting and they don't
know dude but that makes me so mad like
I understand how this how this works and
stuff and I'm sorry if what I'm saying
is it like brand friendly but I welcome
to my life really don't like the idea
and I know this is it's a business it's
how it works but they're like oh a lot
of young girls listen to this podcast
cool let's do a bunch of stuff to make
them feel bad about their bodies Howie
it starts so young it's like let me yeah
I mean it's that old saying right that's
like well I guess it's not that old
because I just write the other day I was
like you know back in I don't
know 2000s before sir mix-a-lot came out
like having a big butt was not cool and
like it meant you are fat you know pH 80
and it meant you were like a specific
type of woman and in my culture yeah in
white culture and then now it's like you
have like thick Rihanna thick Kesha like
everyone's here for all these thick
stars and it's like dude if your ass or
your tits or your face or your
arms or your belly fat or whatever it is
that you're just liking about yourself
today do because it's not in style it's
eventually your butt will be I
don't even like like I understand the
it's the body positivity movement and
being like big is beautiful and this is
beautiful and that's beautiful but it's
I'm also like does it have to be
beautiful like why do we have to just
why is beautiful still the end goal yeah
that's it that stuff like makes me mad
it's like oh good Rihanna like gained a
little bit of weight now it's okay for
me to have no no we should Rihanna to do
whatever she could do whatever she wants
to do she is perfect you are - yeah that
drives me nuts cuz I used to but
I just
cuz I'm resentful I'm like genuinely
resentful of all the time I wasted and
money holy oh my god and like
Marian said yeah oh my the experiences I
would like hold back from doing because
God
fad or like I don't have anything or I'm
not feeling like worth it
yeah oh god I mean that kinda goes into
like what I'm feeling right now about
this whole situation that I told
you I was texted e about yesterday I'm
just like are we gonna talk about it
yeah cuz you know what okay so I don't
know what the
so I have this but he's my neighbor
and a couple of podcasts ago when we
first started hooking up my big thing
with him was that he dict me over
because he had unprotected sex with
other girls and lied to me about it yes
and I would ask that I don't care if he
has sex with other girls my big thing
was I just want you to use protection
like if we're having sex the most out of
the week then please these protections
and so we like I kind of cut it off with
him because I was like I don't need that
 it's toxic it's stupid what do you
 five years old so everything's
been going great
since and then it has nothing to do with
like feelings it has everything to do
with like trying to make it feel like
it's not my fault what happened in some
weird way when I know it's not
when for New Year's he went out of town
and had a threesome with two girls that
are fans of his he's in a entertainment
business as well and had unprotected sex
with these two girls and part of me is
like yeah yeah like that threesome
is awesome that's dope as hell
like I would want that for anybody like
I don't want to be the gray
cloud on the fact that you had a
dope-ass threesome with two girls that
like probably did everything you
wanted cuz they're fans yes and so I we
were texting and I asked if he like had
a New Year's kiss or whatever because he
had never had one cuz he's normally
working when whatever 1 min.i habits and
he send me a video of him and the two
girls freaking out and I was like oh
dope like good for you that looked like
hell yeah that's awesome and then I was
like
wait a minute did you them and he
was like yeah and unfortunately it got a
little sloppy and the condom came off
and yeah I was like hey I don't mean to
laugh no I did too I was literally like
yeah he's just full of Jesus Christ
now it's a thing where he's gonna do
that and as long as he gets tested and
it's fine he thinks that like I'll have
sex with him again okay let's let's
unpack this okay
how do you feel about this how do you
feel about um I don't know dude I just
feel so torn because I would have done
the same goddamn thing if I was able to
have a threesome with and it presented
itself in a way that like you know like
that's so rare and I'm all about that
and the other thing too was like him and
I talked about having threesomes all the
 time cuz I'm into that and
I really want to and I'm like you're
ruining something with me over something
that you can do with me yeah and like so
now I'm just like uh it's already done
you know like so part of me is like
what's the point of even harping over it
or even bringing it up it's already
 done also like I don't care
about the three something I really do
care about the fact that again it was
such like a you to me to do that
without a condom I mean there's so many
layers of him not giving a yeah
like even about himself and not using a
condom like god he does it if he doesn't
give a about himself how in the
world is he going to care about other
people you can keep this in and I
want him to know that that's my opinion
on it and he may like me I don't
think he thinks of it that way he's like
yo what was they're supposed to do
there's yeah that's a dumb thing to do
you're an adult
yeah use a condom don't do that
everybody is like complicated everyone
has their I'm not saying right write him
off cuz he's a bad dude for saying this
stuff I just think that these parts of
him need a lot of work I need absolutely
nothing from him one of the best pieces
of advice I got about dating was if
is really really good at talking he got
that way on purpose
no yeah he doesn't think he does
you're not like other go and I hate I'll
 say all guys if you're listening
to this
don't ever say to a girl you're not like
other girls other girls are dope it's
probably you that's shitty yeah probably
you that's yeah you're the common thread
it's kind of like if you're going to buy
a wedding dress okay and the visits the
perfect one like it is perfect but they
don't make it in your size and you can't
get it altered it's like unalterable and
you're like I I'm just gonna cry it's
like okay you could sit here and you you
can cry you could be sad about it
because that sucks
but at the end of the day you know that
you gotta move on from this one yeah I
mean you and your metaphors are
so goddamn good I feel like I'm a pretty
liberal cool chick like there's
not a lot that yeah I'm asking for in
this situation not at all yeah and like
do you know how many dudes would
kill to be my buddy and like like
what Maya Angelou said if someone shows
you who they are believe them or however
that quote goes I have to believe that
this is who you are and I do I do
believe it but it doesn't hurt any less
to might go well it's no reflection of
you he's very self-indulgent yeah cuz
I'm a very selfish person especially
when it comes to like relationships and
feelings like I will withhold and I will
I will protect myself and I won't give a
 about the other person and like so
I get where he's coming like I've done
this you know any mean like I've been
yeah that person and I think I'm just
older and wiser and a better person now
and I think that's all it comes down to
it's like I just took better oh yeah
yeah I'll probably leave all of this in
just because I think it's important for
listeners to hear a side of me that's
not just like I don't know Beckett I
feel good all the time oh I hope they
know I do not feel good what do you go
to you how do you wrap this up how do
you wrap this up you wrap up
your dick if a girl is letting you
put your dick in her you
 respect that you please
leave all this in I will I don't give
you shake it's really not a tall order
it's crazy
anyways
should we answer fan Q's let's do it
okay we have two ones of longer ones
kind of like for me and ones for you one
for me one for you okay so Adventures of
AB asks what do you say to a guy when he
wants to know how many people you've
slept with especially if you've taken
part in Hove mber no you tell them you
tell them the truth right yeah no I mean
that's that's correct yes I want to I do
think he just deserves I didn't like
this window ya know I just also think
tell the truth that's what I was gonna
say is either tell the truth because he
 ass so he obviously wants to
know and then you can find out if it's
worth staying with him based on his
reaction or if you don't feel like you
have to tell anyone you don't
have to tell anyone that
yeah I just feel like none of your damn
business
wait until later when you when I could
tell you that you know what I mean like
it could be later in the relationship
also I mean people have to like what you
like or whatever but I think it's insane
it's like if it's too many then no is
that really a thing is it really is
ready talked about that yeah with a body
count but to me that just blows my mind
that someone would be like wow you're
too experienced and - I know love with
yourself and you're too into feeling
good with facts that you I don't want oh
wait dude wait that reeks to me of like
ownership oh yeah I you're mine and I
don't want like a used part oh so I went
to church on Christmas even one of the
their readings was talked about like how
Joseph was such a good decent man
because he was gonna divorce Mary in
private so that he didn't bring any
shame to her and it wasn't until God was
like hey that's my son that she's
bearing she is a virgin dude and then he
was like oh I guess I'll stay if the
whole thing was just like when a man
marries a virgin I'm sitting there like
this is why because I think there's so
many good parts of it but I think it's
very much like you didn't want use I
don't know dude the whole thing is
that's terrible to feel like that
there's a part of you that's you like
not right or used or broken because you
enjoy sex
wow that is so up in backwards
and not correct that's it's just a crack
that's what religion does to people not
all religion most religion yeah I think
it's I don't want to I don't want to put
anyone down for for finding something
that helps them make sense of the world
sheriff and death and everything I think
that it and if it's like a moral code
and you fall on this thing that makes
you a better person cool but I think
that there are a lot of parts that are a
little skewed and we're written by him a
lot skewed there is a lie that is a lot
skewed and if it helps you whatever in
ways that's fine but if you it's if it's
shaming you and making you feel guilty
that's yeah that's not religion that's
not that's not something that you should
subscribe to this is coming from someone
who has unsubscribed from the notion of
that for a long time and I know you
very much still I'm spiritual I'm not
necessarily like I I have residual
Catholic guilt about absolutely
everything I've ever done in will ever
true but and I like I will like a lot of
the principles that it taught me of like
caring about other people and trying to
put other people before you and stuff
but sometimes you could take it too far
yeah yeah it's I'm not saying that it
yeah I don't know I just don't like that
idea of being like a woman is being
owned and that can go back to the
question is like if it's something
that's gonna make you feel bad then you
don't have to say anything but
if it's something that like you I I'm
all about like owning that if you
know if you're not gonna like that part
of me you're not gonna like me so yeah
and it kind of feels like if you're
scared to tell this person because
they're gonna judge you or something
then like that's literally the least
amount of information that you could
share with somebody or if you're gonna
like date or be with this person you're
gonna have to put up with a lot more you
know what I do yeah so I might as well
start honest uh anyway okay let's move
on to the second one this one is from
Asia dot C underscore underscore what
does that word underscore underscore
that's cool sorry it's early no it's not
I should yeah anyways mmm she wants to
know hey I'm a 16 year old from Canada
hey get it up and I watch your podcast
like it's Netflix I was wondering if
it's normal that I'm not doing anything
what I mean is the fact that I don't
hook up party drink smoke weed I've
never been kissed and only have crushes
I feel as though that I'm missing out
and I'm not doing much with my youth and
as I watch my friends go do things and
have boyfriends and girlfriends I think
I'm doing something wrong and I'm not
worthy of a boyfriend do I need to do
current things to get a boyfriend or
have fun I like Kate take this one hot
off the press Oh Lots unpack your well a
hear yours six to 16 you're 16 you're
you're not doing anything wrong by not
doing this sort of stuff I didn't do it
either I mean that's that doesn't it's
not like hey look at me because I've got
a lot of but I think that as long
as you just do what you're comfortable
with there's no timeline there's no rush
do what you're comfortable with when
you're comfortable doing it because if
you do some you know someone else's
stuff you're just gonna you're gonna be
living someone else's experiences and
you're just not gonna have a fun time it
won't be genuine it won't be fun if you
want a boyfriend if you like you really
want one then you could try to find out
who do you like talk to the people that
you like who you share common interests
with but if you think you need one
because all of your friends are having
one just like find something else to get
like really really good at like it
really a bit like the guitar or know
like read a code figure out how
to code oh yeah coding that's dope like
you don't have to put all of your time
and attention on something just because
everyone else is doing it you could do
something that's really good for you
that you want to do it's just whatever
you want to do you're not a freak you're
totally worthy of a boyfriend also
having someone like you doesn't other
people's feelings about you does not
qualifier it doesn't it doesn't make up
your worth it has nothing to do with
that so my advice would be enjoy your
youth being there's plenty of time to
date there's a but if you want to you're
gonna date a lot
there's so much time to do and meet so
many shitty people you'll go you're
actually avoiding a lot of well
that's why I was gonna say from my
perspective because I totally agree with
every year everything you're saying
about like do @uy and have Worth and I
watch it I will say growing up in
Florida exposed me to a lot of sex drugs
and alcohol very early on and I watch
people move out to LA who come from
these small towns who have never really
partied never really drink never had a
lot of sex and they get here and it's
like the whole world is open to them
it's like entering the willy wonka
factory and they get sucked up the
chocolate tube and I never see them
again and I think a reason why I've have
been able to remain so successful out
here and really get out of the of
the shittiest I went through was
because I got all of that out of
the way when I was young to honestly
answer this question like to wrap it up
I would say don't come try really hard
and it's really not easy but try really
hard not to compare yourself to what
other people are doing and once you once
you could just figure out what makes you
happy and what you want to do what's
right for you that's when you'll really
have fun when I was in high school I was
like this is it this is my entire life
this is my existence this is who I am
this is these are the only people that
matter also your hormones are going
 nuts like you don't cook if you
can't control how you feel about some
 how dramatic you are or how
emotional you'll get over things but
when people would say like wow none of
this actually matters like when you
leave high school you won't actually
care I was like wow how wrong are they
this is Eddie
this is all the things that matters
because TV projected that way like the
movies and film and TV was like this is
where it all mattered and this is where
you become popular or you're a
loser and Wow
can I just say truly to all of our
younger listeners Wow
high school will not matter I
would actually argue the people that
like peaked in high school and ended up
getting married really young and having
children really that's what they want
that if that's what they want that's
cool but nine times out of ten the
people I saw do that are
miserable now they're divorced
they are so pissed that they you know
married the high school swear that's
hard that's bad to say but people that
that kept their indulgences in high
school and never blossomed and got out
of their comfort zone and left and saw
experiences that were unlike theirs and
talked to people that were unlike them
and traveled and oh my god high school
just doesn't matter guys it
really just it's so doesn't but it's a
fun time to go and celebrate your youth
yeah I don't have to do anything just do
what you want get good try baby is not
college also doesn't matter I don't know
just don't be a dick just be a good
 person and you'll figure it out
just just focus on being a good person
and just have fun however you want to
have fun and be safe about it yeah be
safe but if you start giving in to what
other people are doing that is a recipe
for disaster girl isn't it yeah okay

great answer all right let's move on to
