just pulled down and this one are the
only style bras I've ever worn in my
whole life and now I'm wearing some cups
here
growing up I was really self-conscious
about my body it was just like a little
boy just bored bored for just flat I was
always aware that I was a little bit
bigger than all my friends or more
muscular bills and all my friends and it
was kind of tough and I would think that
I had football shoulders and that I was
masculine like I would fear getting too
big I got made fun of a lot and I was
really self-conscious about it it was
really difficult to embrace my strengths
I was never as ripped as the other
athletes I was never as skinny as some
other girls but I was really strong I
never really equated like being an
athlete to being sexy so being in
lingerie today and having a little bit
more sex appeal is going to be out of my
comfort zone I've never been like in
lingerie so I'm super nervous we have I
got myself into coming on site here and
seeing how cool and just chill this
atmosphere is there's no pressure being
here with seven other wonderful female
athletes is surreal hair makeup team
over there beautifying everybody I'm
trying not to focus on the fact that I'm
about to go do a photoshoot in lingerie
I'm getting pampered for the first time
in a really long time and I think that
is something that you are allowed to
indulge in from time to time and you
don't have to just be an athlete and
make everything super hard and make
everything painful and you don't need
makeup and you don't need this you know
those are my conditioned thoughts
watching Victoria's Secret Fashion Show
I appreciate it for what it is there's
so much glamour there's so much beauty
there's so much fun but at the same time
I want to see more diversity I want to
see women of different shapes I do train
really hard and I know that their diet
and their workout regimen is very strict
and much respect to all of them they
look fabulous and myself and all the
other athletes here we train more
performance based and we value our
performance over our aesthetics we're
just all used to wearing sports bras and
now we're in lingerie so now I feel like
really feminine and pretty and who
doesn't want to be a Victoria's Secret
model sometimes I see so much of the
stereotypical ripped trained athlete and
as a curvier woman I don't always relate
and I do wish that there were more body
shapes so that women that grow up being
athletes like myself can see that and
feel beautiful empowered and strong too
when you see these like
fashion shows everyone looks like they
either have fake boobs or they're
wearing like the best bras in the world
that make them have like perfect
cleavage with me having an athletic body
and I don't particularly find myself
feeling super sexy I struggle with like
a lot of weight problems I get too thin
I get too big and I definitely like
overcame everything by being not only
like physically strong but definitely
like mentally strong being healthy and
strong is definitely the key to
everything being healthy and strong to
me is mind and body mind-body connection
if you don't have one you don't have the
other modelling lingerie especially pink
lingerie it's not something I would
normally wear and it's definitely
putting me outside of my comfort zone
and I really just want to embrace myself
and embrace my confidence thank God for
Kim because she got me here she was like
you have to do this it's a find at the
back of Carolina I haven't seen her for
a while and we were both on the Olympic
team in 2008 together did one use some
group shots together yeah we thought
that okay are used to being competitive
in athletic and so this is different
trying to be softer and I think it's
hard to do strong and so often have that
be a dynamic that is balanced when I was
getting my picture taken
I just felt free I just felt free and my
own skin I just saw some of the pictures
and I was like oh well look that's me it
is a really surprising how could I look
so pretty but you know I grew up so
rough and being so tomboy Xylo look at
me now I told my younger self to just
stop worrying focus on yourself better
yourself saying you know what screw it
I'm just going to be sexy anyways and
it's sexy to just be confident I've met
seven other wonderful athletes and it
really helped me feel more comfortable
being in front of the camera and just
like embracing my body it's been amazing
and I can't wait to do these group shots
with them being comfortable and your
confidence is something that sometimes
hard with women you don't want to be too
confident because you don't want to make
someone else feel bad but I think that
when we allow ourselves to shine we
actually giving permission for other
people to do so too
one two three
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
