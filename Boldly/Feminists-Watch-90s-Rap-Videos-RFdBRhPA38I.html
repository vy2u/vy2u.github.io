see someone
I think it'll be interesting to watch
these videos again just because of the
kid rap videos were the only place where
I really saw women of color I think
they're gonna be pretty fun and I'm
gonna forget about the sexism in them
I'm gonna girl walks in with an itty
bitty waist and a round thing in your
face you get all I'm doing is like
feeling jealous of these asses sitting
on a mountain of butts I feel like I'm
playing Where's Waldo only the game is
spot the strong female protagonist and
nobody's going to win I want some woman
to write a song about big dicks at least
this one's like cute and funny and
kitschy and like celebrates various body
types this is basically like the
explicit version of thriller
oh he's controlling the women with his
crystal balls
he's abducting women with his magic yeah
oh god I want to give every woman in
this video like a hug and a sweater
the men are fully closed if people are
gonna be naked can we all be naked I
have a problem with that because it
makes women look like objects it makes
it seem like I am there for your beck
and call and when you tell me to pop my
 that's okay moments like these
that I think about what it would've been
like if women had run the world from the
beginning of time that queima to pink
I'm already digging like the saxophone
beat she was so cool like where is the
Queen Latifah of our generation she's
wearing a turtleneck that is sleeveless
you know you you don't give up when
you're like my neck is gonna be wiring
my sleeves I don't care she is touching
on so many things she's touching on
catcalling she's talking about domestic
abuse
everything that she's saying in this
song goes back to where raps foundation
was which was giving people who felt
like they didn't have a voice in society
that voice to be able to voice their
concerns
I feel like rappers couldn't just step
up their game like there's so much more
to be done in the music videos in
Houston
there and a bunch of ladies like shaking
their butts maybe try a bunch of men
shaking their butts try to make
something you wouldn't mind your mother
watching I think rap has a very strong
message and a very strong purpose and
it's just kind of gotten muddled over
the years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
