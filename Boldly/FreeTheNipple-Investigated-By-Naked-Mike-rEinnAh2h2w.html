they can't post topless photos of
themselves on Instagram who am I talking
about
kendall Jenner Miley Cyrus and Hillary
Clinton that last one was a joke ha ha
ha
kendall Jenner recently posted a photo
of herself wait to celebrate 40 million
followers on Instagram where she exposed
her breast but Instagram censored her do
you think that Instagram should censor
women posting their breasts yeah I do I
think that it is every woman's choice
what they want to do with their body
it's really not fair that women aren't
allowed to show their nipples on
Instagram while men are completely
allowed I just don't thinking nipples
should be shown to the public without
censorship I think if it's done in a
non-sexual way then I think it's fine
coming from Germany Sonoma yeah the
people can do that and the women's
breast is like a man's press yeah
women's nipples are a form of art their
bodies form an art and that it should be
displayed if it's displayed tastefully a
woman's body is very beautiful to
someone and it's very it's like a pink
painting so I don't understand why you
would want to expose your painting to
someone when it should be for one person
only one way that women are getting
around the censorship is by taking
photos of male nipples and putting it
over their own nipples in that I've seen
that kind of brings light to the
situation guys can do it you know why
can't we do it I think that if I just
thought a man's nipple and a female's
nipple but not knowing it was a man or a
woman I would be able to tell the
difference
I have men's nipples okay why do you
think America censors nipples more than
European countries because I think that
America often focuses on selling sex
invented it's more of a taboo than
it's something that people want more I
think that they're worried about what
children children seeing them and taking
it in the wrong way and thinking is it
being a provocative thing a disgusting
thing and it's not it's called private
parts for a reason and if it's not if
it's public then there can be a public
part do you think women should free the
nipple or not free the nipple free the
nipple free the nipple free the nipple
high the nipple free the nipple free the
nipple - nipple some people want to free
the nipple some people want to hide the
nipple maybe America would be okay just
seeing one nipple or half a nipple I'm
gonna go home and put some clothes on
aren't you cold I'm not that cold oh
your nipples are perky okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
