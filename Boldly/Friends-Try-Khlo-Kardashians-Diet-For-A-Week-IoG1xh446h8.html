just explode Fountains at Bellagio Lucia
chopped up hi I'm Maya
hi I'm Salaam and we're friends here at
BuzzFeed and today we're trying the
Khloe Kardashian diet Khloe was thick
UM's just like me in the beginning and
now she looks thick um's also but
healthier everything is just like I'm an
emotional eater if I can change that by
introducing a new habit I would feel
better I don't like cooking because it
takes out of time and I also don't like
the things that I cook I really hope
that this makes me a little bit more
willing to try my own home-cooked meals
if metabolism is a function of heat
calories and heat energy units and the
question is how many calories do I need
to eat a day
compliance is critical working and Khloe
there's like amazing because she is
warrior s Khloe was totally open to the
coaching of eating for food takes a big
leap of faith for breakfast she has a
shake made of protein powder almond
butter and a fruit of her choice I don't
know sound good for breakfast it's a
liquid Kris that good meal is a piece of
fruit Chloe that's not a male journalist
or Hanson's of chicken breast with a
good veggies or a salad that's high in
iron such as spinach her fourth meal is
a cup of celery or tomatoes and 12
almonds 12 almonds her fifth meal is
more vegetables but this time was one
egg dinner and fatty fish like salmon as
well as eight ounces of veggies or salad
and then after dinner she could have one
more piece of food she's allowed to have
one more these before dinner
where does the cake company is allowed
to have one cheat meal oh we go out for
this she me up and then making sure you
hydrate correctly not sparkly not bubbly
enough flavor just plain ass water in
the beginning it's a complete pain in
the ass you peel a lot but like you get
flushed out your skin is like there's
the recommendation to stay away from
dairy so I choose dried fruits read them
I can't eat bread just give me a minute
he's like metabolic heroin you
I kind of like this because you are
eating really small portions throughout
the day but you're eating a lot I guess
you don't feel that hungry and you're
still being nourished okay I see eating
rabbit food but we're gonna do and then
that's gonna be great we're gonna have a
lot of fun not eating sorry and bread so
today I plan out everything I planned
out my outfit I had water sitting next
to my bed I had a weight powder and
almond butter ready to be mixed up at
work I did not come to play today I woke
up that morning and I'm like I'm a boss
ass I'm drinking breakfast while I work
like I felt on me so I made a chicken
avocado brown rice spinach Bowl I used
lemon and a little bit of olive oil as
the dressing which normally I love me
some blue cheese but listen on the Khloe
Kardashian diet so gotta do it this way
I'm supposed to have eight ounces of
vegetables tonight I'm just squeezing
them in so that I can get more
vegetables cuz I'm so hungry right now
also make some cod fish I can't
completely say I'm excited to eat this
no one said I couldn't season it and
it's he's like so I'm gonna season the
end of this fish spinach is my best
friend right now hopefully all this
healthy eating and fruits will get rid
of this pimple does Khloe Kardashian
have pimples I don't think so I think it
was nice that Maya was doing with me
because there were moments during lunch
where I was like what are you eating
today there are no options for me what
did you eat for lunch just a little bit
of chicken
see at least you can eat the chicken
there's tofu we can't eat soy I was able
to get beans and some lettuce
I just got Reitsma chicken it just felt
great having another person supporting
you and also going through what you're
going through my what are you doing what
is that my am I'm out here eating fish
food and you're having that listen I did
good I don't my smoothie I had like
fruits I had myself a lot of preparation
yeah yeah true I don't know how to eat
dry salads that's something that I'm not
used to know you can put a little bit of
olive oil and lemon oh so I'm a little
mad at myself I was walking towards my
friend's desk and I noticed he have some
M&amp;amp;Ms and instinctually I grabbed them
and put them in my mouth
I just eat whatever I want because I
can't there's M&amp;amp;M is on the table I'll
eat them because they're there there it
goes again
don't worry I ate like some like a
little unhealthy things I did feel bad
automatic it's weird your body is so
used to eating this good and then when
you put other things in it's like no we
did have fun making the smoothie I don't
know if it was good or not it had a lot
of protein powder in it it just tasted
like full-on chocolate sludge there's so
many different things going on in my
mouth right now I like it I'm into it
we freaking did it and what is this life
I'm literally allowed to have 12 on this
that's all that I can eat I'm eating my
fruit for the day before it was an
inconvenience switching out fruit for
chips or cookies like I would do every
single day around 3 o'clock at work and
now it's just kind of like common sense
I'm starting to notice I feel better I
feel so dumb because it's always been
there but sometimes we get lost and like
unhealthy habits this week with Chloe's
diet has really just opened up my eyes
to smaller changes just with switching
out a fruit for chips who was i before I
don't know she days coming up I'm
already thinking about it I'm definitely
creating cake like so bad but I've been
working out
so good with this diet I do not wanna
spoil it I don't know I think we can
cheat but I don't think we need to go
crazy I'm gonna have a date with the
pizza he's gonna take me out or gonna be
beautiful together
peace so we're on our way to our cheat
day place and Mayas tie my shoelace like
a true friend you got read that works
like dome-shaped you touched it and you
went boo boo boo squishy oh so good
Mayon is so much of the bread and the
salad that by the time you got to the
deep dish we're full after one slice I
don't even want to take anymore
I wanted to throw up because we had been
clean eating for this entire week and
then to just ruin it and eat massive
amount of cheese and salt and bread I
felt out of breath that's one thing that
I have noticed I didn't get out of
breath this week because I wasn't eating
these fatty foods well we're going back
to the diet tomorrow I feel like I need
to like work out a hard core though oh I
already like walked up to large hills
and then ran this last one which is
something I would never ever do I feel
good I feel more inclined and excited to
work out and to feel I'm getting
stronger physically and I know it sounds
weird but I feel like I'm getting
stronger mentally as well even though I
have cheated on my diet already so I'm
probably gonna work extra hard okay
biking
well the week is over and thank you
Jesus the difficult part of this entire
thing was not eating the food it was
breaking the habits that I have been
doing for years that have been unhealthy
I never have that kind of thought in my
head like oh maybe I should eat this
because it's better for me not just eat
this because I wanted I really had to
hold myself back a lot and just kind of
be like no similar you can't do that all
the time you can't eat chocolate for
breakfast I was creating things that
would make me feel better once that kind
of clicked in my head I was like it's
game on let's go one great thing that I
did not tell you that I will reveal now
is that I have lost three pounds it
wasn't easy
I did cheat it's an ongoing process be
healthy do the thing and do it well eat
your vegetables cute broccoli does not
come in bags yeah I dock broccoli came
in like individual little treats but
comes all in one I did not know that
that was an experience
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
