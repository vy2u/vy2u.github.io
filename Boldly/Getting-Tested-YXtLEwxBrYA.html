almost had HPV yeah I thought I had it
for like two days is like looks terrible
but turns out it was just UTI so maybe
this is just UTI or a yeast infection or
a third weird infection vaginas guy I
don't know why I always assumed you
would be the one with an STD STI hmm
their infections not diseases shout-out
to my very hat seventh grade health
teacher mr McGrath
but yeah me too
this is really not like me have you been
having any I've only had sex with like
five people it's okay we just relax the
sores are symptomatically consistent
with genital herpes but I'm gonna have
one of the nurses do a culture swab to
confirm before we put you on any
medication herpes it's actually much
more common than you think about 1 in 6
people have it I haven't had sex with
anyone that had any sores or anything
well it's possible you've had it for
quite some time and you're just
presenting symptoms now
I mean eggwin herpes is pretty badass
it's like a literal sex wound okay sorry
I'm just trying to make you feel better
I don't get it me and Lucas were so safe
except for maybe like once and before
then I hadn't even had sex for two
months what sucks but I mean it's normal
it happens all the time not to you
you've got sex with like five times as
many people oh my god please five times
three times that most you're gonna tell
Lucas I mean I don't want to
ladies I know that I might not even have
it um that's not certain mmm I think
anything I'm not saying you did I just
think you should probably get tested
I've been tested yeah well I guess and
you should probably tell anyone else to
maybe see you well the doctors say a lot
of people have it like one in six people
and some people never even show symptoms
sorry
Hey
how was your night that bad then Lucas
is a dick and he doesn't deserve you hey
see you dick or is he just having a
normal human response we told him I have
an irreversible diseases stop James Hey
he has AI coffee
you
okay please just one drink I surely just
go home and like soak my vagina
something come on you should have fun
and I don't really want to go to a work
party alone
I even like Evan isn't having the best
seriously love him I never get to see
you anymore since you switched
apartments yeah you're coming visit us
sometime
yeah yeah I should yeah then we can all
go and get drinks like we're doing right
now true great yeah yes yeah or here's a
page we could go together just the two
of us no co-workers at a different bar
mmm I like where your head's at
except you probably don't wanna do that
because according to WebMD there is a
77% chance that I might have herpes yeah
wait
oh really uh maybe maybe not maybe
I just never have sex again and die
alone so I'm good I'm good
