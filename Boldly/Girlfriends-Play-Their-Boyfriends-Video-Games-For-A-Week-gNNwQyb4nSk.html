you're just baseball batted that mongrel
dog's head off
I have played video games all my life I
adore them but he's definitely more of
the gamer in this relationship I
understand why people love them there's
like an element of escapism to them but
I can't stand them so I've been hooked
on this game called rocket League now
it's a simple concept it's cars and
soccer I will go to the bathroom you
know do my thing come out lo and behold
he's playing rocket League lately my
favorites been fallout 4
that game is tremendous and I think you
would actually really enjoy it maybe if
after the week she'll understand a
little more why I'm so addicted to the
game alright here we go for the record I
would never put flames on my car
someone's tongue it died I've walked 40
feet bitten I've been engaging in
violence and I don't feel really good
about myself okay hold on why'd you stay
on the fence you need to be on the field
everything all over the place the
cameras just shifting is like vertigo oh
now you're looking straight up okay oh
no hold on again what does it happen
oh it's booby told you to kill yourself
what'd I miss mario kart right now my
blood pressures up I'm bored and I'm
hungry you know play it's a face
conviction oh my god napo's almost there
hair what am i doing get off the fence
I get so good and then I almost sudden
lose all credibility
I just tried to turn on my roommates ps4
to play fallout and I don't even know
how to do that but I might play portal
that you stood on the floor
my going oh there stop it
I want to learn me oh my god no yeah
look at least I'm following ball came
out of my room in a car like this oh my
grandparents she doesn't even pick up
calls anymore straight to rocket League
how shitty so much fun yes
really I'm enjoying playing portal thing
I've always loved the puzzle games and
there's no stress of bang-bang
shoot-'em-up I really loved like I guess
non single-player games when you get to
play with someone else and the coolest
thing was like I lost track of time
later on I started getting the hang of
it and being able to like follow the
ball but it's not just that it's fast
paced but people are being I think it's
great that you're open to the idea that
there might be other games out there
that are up your alley I wouldn't say
she's like veteran status now but you
know she's better than when she started
and it's upsetting it is upsetting
because I'm competitive and I want to do
well unfortunate and it's the truth
