three
great betrayed I have been throwing out
the idea of waxing something on him for
the entire time we've dated it's
basically the equivalent of like a guy
trying to put it in someone's blood
we're waxing you're very Sicilian
armpits is that my problem area I don't
think you have a problem area oh that's
nice but yeah that's my problem area
this area this lovely area that brings
me joy he has this tuft of hair above
his butt crack that is called the
muskrat she named it that by the way
that's not a scientific term it looks
like something is growing out of them
right my piece really bushy and then you
just come in with the scissors and then
you just get a bunch off at one time hey
what's up bro
guys ready yes all right let's do this
please assume the position should take
the holes this is good video and we're
just gonna just brush out the hair and
trim it like a haircut ie that's so much
of my hair ah okay not a forest what is
book it's a bush it's a bush that is
quite warm yes okay and lay it down run
with the direction of hair growth again
alright so against the grain just like
that one two three oh my god yes it's
like a beautiful piece of abstract art
do you think we're gonna frame this
later stand it out oh my god just don't
just rip it dear that's ribbit ribbit
look me it was a sharp pain and it just
kept going I can just do all the
sweating my armpits every time she like
rips it I never bites the dust' bitches
oh there's a little bit of blood wonders
why you should give me a heads up about
that he's um flaming a little he says
I'm an inflammatory response happening
two three
he looks great feel light-headed like
that looks great I mean compared to the
other side
oh wow I have been waxed I've been waxed
by my wife I uh it was amazing
better than I ever would have expected
it was a trouper also I think he doesn't
feel much down there I just want to say
thank you for allowing me to explore my
dreams and supporting me the couple that
waxes together stays together like it's
like cleaning your just like cleaning
the bushes cleaning the bushes I'm not
sure if it's gonna make you more or less
insecure now that you only have one done
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
