let you know I got the invitation and I
am so excited for your wedding and that
I will definitely be using the plus one
so super excited by Cody can't come to
the phone right now hey Todd it's Kelsey
Kelsey Darragh mom I should go outside
Mikey will you please just come to this
wedding with me no but you're like my
hottest friend so who cares why do you
care about seeing these people so much
it's just that it's gonna be all of my
old friends that I haven't seen in years
and I just want them to feel bad when
they see me you know not like bad bad
but like oh my god she's so pretty and
so high now and she looks like she's
doing so well I hate my own life all of
a sudden you know would just be happy to
see you're doing well
listen going to a wedding single and
alone is tricky okay you have to you
have to have confidence but you like
need to be believable oh I get it I get
it
you want to remain neutral and your
singledom you don't want to be like
learning the choreography to the single
ladies dance or anything right yeah no I
would never I would never do that good
cuz you can't dance I'm just saying how
can Forks cost $150
you know what Mimi I'll get new Forks I
have thrown away so many Forks so this
is nothing to do with the fact that
Peters going to be there right oh my god
no I totally don't even know he was
going did that's unreal no just make
sure you have a fierce ass dress and
don't worry about anything else I just
hate that I'm wasting vacation down this
you know you don't need to get yourself
all up about this no you know I
think you're not doing that thing and we
were staring wistfully in the mirror
feeling bad about yourself are you no I
am a strong independent woman how long
has it been like 19 months Jesus I know
but I need someone out of wedding
actually you know what I wish I could
make fun of it but it sounds about as
possible as all the other things I've
been trying
not your right everything's gonna be
fine I just hope I get invited to the
divorce party two critical soulmates I
know I'm just feeling sad for myself
I'll talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
