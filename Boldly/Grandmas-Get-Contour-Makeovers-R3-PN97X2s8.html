and sensational hi my name is willow
Hale and I'm 65 years old I'm the kind
of person that does my makeup in about
five minutes I'm really excited I
watched my own mother in her 80s at the
at the end of her life with her flaming
white hair and it should look quite
different and I actually thought she
looked quite beautiful I was always told
I was cute and I used to resent that as
a little kid and now as I've gotten to
be a mature woman I've gone back to
accepting cute with romance with my mate
I appreciate his getting older as much
as I think he appreciates my age in my
lines in my face well I think the beauty
really comes from the soul you can paint
a person's face but if they don't have a
healthy positive outlook on life
unfortunately that translates to the
face I'm anxious to see what I'm going
to look like
Oh oh it looks beautiful I'm some Cod oh
wow that's amazing it really brings out
the eyes doesn't it I feel like the
contouring brought out the brightness of
my personality I can't help but reflect
back to my younger self but I love
pretty darn good considering that you
know we all age well I think it's time
to go hit the town don't shoot the tan
we're honest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
