the zipper is broken so this is my
normal outfit that I wear all the time
just like a plain black t-shirt I'm
definitely looking to dress up a little
more at work
we had a boss that wore the same outfit
every day since he left I decided I have
to wear the same outfit every day I
usually wear a lot of jewelry very
casual shorts I don't really care for
pants today when I'm looking for more
jeans and then more shoes options my
style I would say is very eclectic
hoping that by the end of this I can be
able to look more sophisticated I'm
Katherine jubair and I'm a wardrobe
stylist there are a lot of people who
really need it it's not just for the
rich and famous it's for everyone who
needs a little bit of help making sense
of their wardrobe and closet and really
kind of maximizing everything they have
so let's start by looking at your pants
the way that this one is ripped it's
gonna be very hard to even fix it but
there's always a way to put a patch on
my butt patch on your booty the rip
isn't the problem it's the zipper but
that's an easy fix a zipper can be
easily replaced you can go to your local
dry cleaner or a tailor 1015 dollars you
can get the zipper replace and you'll
have a brand new pair of jeans you like
to wear black and I could see that you
have I think you're covered you've got a
good variety of like charcoal gray and
black black jeans these are great nice
slim fit sort of like the ones you have
on same exact one these just faded yes I
got you a little more warm I'd like to
say that my style is bohemian chic meets
Turner hippie I have no idea what that
means I just know it sounds cool I see a
little bit of blue but also a lot of
black this is a good color if you're in
a really good mood one morning this is
the shirt you pick up these are black
jeans that you bought recently you said
they're like the pair of pants that I
wear right now so we need to get you
more BAM yeah this one is fun because
you can dress it up or down pair with a
t-shirt this light gray by the way goes
with everything based on what I've seen
for call we're gonna look for some dark
wash jeans some joggers since you don't
have any if we find any shoes that would
work with all the outfits that we're
pairing today for you Kayne will
look for a blue jeans every guy should
have a pair at least in their wardrobe
other casual shirts like these too
because you want to start wearing them a
little bit more get some more jeans that
fit you better that are a little slimmer
maybe more button-down shirts in
different types of greens maybe a little
print like a plat something like that
slim jeans in a blue wash we talked
about more button-up shirts maybe a pair
of shoes so my experience was rather
awesome typically when I go shopping I
like in 10 minutes I get so frustrated
that I can't find anything that fits me
properly or is it my size and just give
up and I'm like get me the F out of that
Katherine is super nice and super
helpful she would like just grab stuff
that I thought I liked it would also fit
me and she looked through everything to
find the right outfit so we went with
these pair jeans and the jacket was an
awesome fine buy came it's super in its
very own brand most is I already owned
however I did buy this to match these
shorts so this sweater is much nicer
looking than my plain basic hoodie it
was just like another black polo that
has a little bit of like flair to it
with stitching in stocks it does feel
nice and soft and kind of hid going into
I was super weird about like thinking
about getting blue jeans I don't know
why I've never paired these two together
the sweater and nut with the boots it's
great I got blue jeans finally I haven't
had blue jean with in years
these shoes are like lighter than shoes
that I normally have and I normally
would not get the issues I think it's
cool I finally found an outfit to wear
with this jacket I think I was afraid
that this was like way too formal but
then with the jeans balance is out of it
there were things that she pulled and I
was kind of thinking about it and she'd
be like oh it matches your skin tone and
if you think about it cuz if you pair it
she started talking I'm like you know it
doesn't match my skin tone I'm like I
have a great skin tone this isn't
something I normally would get but I
like it a lot if it's well too comfy
it's a dresser I could button it if I
want so I actually already had these
they're actually joggers even though
they literally kind of like dress pants
I like it and it feels comfortable too
he actually suggested to pair this with
a long-sleeve shirt and just jeans he
said it was a very kind of nighties vibe
where already when she was suggesting I
liked it I haven't really had any pants
that have elastic in the bottoms I
really like these and they're really
comfortable
- sweater was love at first sight this
is something I would wear to work I
would wear to hang out so this is my
little brother's Boy Scout shirt we
talked about incorporating it with a
little bit more of an everyday look
something I would wear to the office and
I like it I also got these new jeans no
holes and then we picked up these bad
puppies right here these little uh
Chelsea like boots these pants she told
me to mix it up with a khaki color
everybody this is a great look for like
a breezy day it was so nice getting a
second opinion from Katherine I was like
what do you think and she's like I love
them I was like okay sometimes when
you're shopping for yourself you're
unsure I thought that whenever I would
go shopping there's always like doubts
in my mind so I'll be texting friends
like should I get that should I get this
but it was really nice to have Katherine
there in the flesh and then to find a
piece that I loved and her be like yes
like you should get that and I'm like I
should get that and I will get that
she's like this is how you wear it I'm
ago I didn't think of that
it was just so helpful to have someone
there that maybe wasn't biased like one
of your friends I could be like oh yeah
I like that it's cute as she was gonna
be like no like I don't like that I'm
like okay cool thank you I would have
never thought to have bought a smaller
sized Jean like when you put on pants
it's like this is your size and that's
it
but apparently no to denim is are the
same and you got to try them all until
like you get one that fits you might be
wearing the wrong size dude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
