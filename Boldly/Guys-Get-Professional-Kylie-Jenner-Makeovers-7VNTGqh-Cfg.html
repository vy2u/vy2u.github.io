ourselves we decided we wanted to see
how we look with professional makeup
artist here we are today with Yuki Yuki
no media and I'm professional makeup
artist she's gonna show us how it should
be done are you ready I think so
okay ready yeah
I don't think I'm on vacation what is
that
it's the eyebrow gel it makes you eivol
really define the don't worry you're
gonna look good now you can just balance
I consider to make it I bought to find a
clean shadow
vanna youth this color this eyeshadow is
so good I love it so pretty color it's
like a little massage for my eyeballs
I'm gonna use brown powder outlines here
it's just more defined
I'm just keep blending right now because
I'm all about that this eyeliner
eyeliner try to look down yeah okay yeah
I'm just terrified my gosh it looks so
weird
you can't wait until it's dry or you can
just be apply the eyeliner when I use
the liner on top of the eyelashes so
it's more like emphasizing you look
beautiful ready you don't have to make
you really thick for the foundation
because we're gonna contour if you apply
the foundation too heavy mixer on the
cake in cream consider booster highlight
you makes your cheekbone come out more
we're gonna use that anestachio cream
contour palette I'm gonna blend it a lot
better when it's wet we've been using it
dry
I'm gonna use this one for the brush
you're so pretty
finally we're gonna use Kylie's look
good I'm gonna use the Pliner First
Opium lengthen another yes sweety smooth
huh it's like vanilla cupcake it feels
like a lot is going on right now on my
face cuz I can see my eyelashes Wow
woah my eyelashes are like an ocean wave
beautiful isn't a big enough word to
describe how I feel right now I am truly
beyond pretty it looks very smooth and
very professional my eyebrows and
eyeliner is much cleaner than what I did
I just think the lines are a little bit
more symmetrical we were already at a
nine nine and a half before we were just
like you know at a 10 now from just
feeling how the brushes moved I feel
like I learned a lot even the steps in
the order that she did things were very
different so today we learned that if we
want to bully become a general
Kardashian just hire a professional we
knew I could pass for a
kardashian-jenner before but now only
proves I can neither understudy if they
ever needed someone for a precedent but
we're like tired that day send me today
I learned so many new makeup tips and I
can't wait to apply them to myself or
the lucky lady that wants me to do their
makeup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
