control freak one of four so I guess
it's the least powerful they have it's
got fist control so that's probably a
little bit more I don't I don't know
what this is $25 $20 comes with a pump
so I don't know like 30 bucks so this is
a bra it bends and twists I don't know
if that's a normal feature I should know
probably have to buy about what two of
these a month i I don't know how often
these are destroyed I've never thought
about how much abroad costs before and
everyday bra I'm gonna say costs $10 $10
I was wondering if rods get more
expensive the bigger they get but the
medium and extra-large shirts are
generally the same price right this is
an herbal daily shampoo yeah I say just
because of the accent on the e this
would be a little more expensive than
the the bedhead is French everything's
in French it's using the metric system
this is probably like $50 $30 says daily
shampoo so imagine this is like four
dollars and it's just like regular
shampoo and a fancy bottle on I don't
know Tampax radiant plastic tampons is
this is this a tampon or is this like
some kind of other thing this is I'm out
of my depth here designed for incredible
calm
like you'll be more comfortable with
this in 15 dollars it's $70 I have no
idea how often you would need a new box
a box of tampons I'd imagine I'd have to
buy once a month I don't know like four
months I'm gonna come up so ignorant
what's looking like an ignorant man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
