domed multi-purpose brush I don't know
why it would have such a long handle I
guess you only need one of these in your
arsenal I would say and it looks kind of
fancy I mean I guess it's horse hair
there's a lot of French here
I think French is a very important thing
in women's beauty products
twelve twelve dollies this is probably
like 40 bucks so this is obviously a
hair blower it's branded with a
celebrity so you know it's going to be
more expensive right off the bat heavy
lots of settings all 50% faster drying
time so this is this is nice and it's
got London Paris and New York written on
it so it's got to be expensive john
frieda is a stylist don't ask me how I
know that I've seen these run for about
15 bucks because this box is shaped so
interestingly I can tell that this is
probably like a $200 hairdryer they're
just blowing out hot air so it's like
pixi by petra this is a flawless vitamin
veil foundation is this that you put it
on before the makeup maybe there's also
a lot of French on this I want to say
$35 but I feel like I'm overshooting it
so like a drawer some kind of this thing
I don't really don't know what this is
$30 $18
so I am looking at a wedding gown this
is a high-end wedding dress just because
of the long veil line it looks like a
Barbie doll no I don't know I'd say this
could go for $250 this dress costs
$6,000 I don't understand the
differences between them like they're
all white and they just have the frills
in different places I feel like the
worst Price is Right contestant ever
