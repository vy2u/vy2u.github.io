what it is like furtively it's like and
I was like oh if I still didn't really
know every time I thought about a vagina
I was convinced that it was one hole
I remember definitely thinking that the
vagina was like flat in front like it
was just below the belly but I assumed
that women had the same genitals that I
did and then it was like it separated
into three separate tunnels for the poop
the P and the baby I remember very
specifically seeing a picture of a naked
woman and being like she doesn't have
anything down there what what is what is
going on
I wasn't sure like what was supposed to
be like I knew that it was supposed to
go in a hole the male took his penis and
just rubbed it on top of the vagina not
inside the vagina a man lied this way
and a woman lied this way yeah I wasn't
sure like how like where I always
thought missionary was just the way you
had sex to make a baby and when you were
a heathen you would do it doggystyle
because that would get it into Willy
Wonka's chocolate factory I was looking
for a blank VHS tape so that I could
record a new episode of Mystery Science
Theater 3000 I put it in and it was very
close-up of a woman's vagina and a
woman's face comes into the frame and
like what is going on and suddenly you'd
hear people going down the stairs and it
would be like oh my god and I remember
one time I got here I got that that was
fine and then I went to close the tabs
and I closed them but there were pop ups
and my mom came around and then she
clicked on it and there was this pop-up
and it was like way dirtier than the
stuff I was watching but you're not
gonna be like no I wasn't that watching
that porn I was watching other porn I
just wanted to watch a couple robots and
a man make fun of a b-movie I got so
much more
my parents were just like I'm never
gonna talk about sex to Keith and then
he'll never have sex every time I tried
to have like a sex talk with my mom her
like instinctive response is don't do it
your dick will get cancer and I was like
well I will never stick my penis in
another person I can't remember how he
said it but he basically wanted to start
a conversation about sex and then he was
like don't worry I lost my virginity
when I was 15 and it was with an older
girl and I was like well I'm 16 and I
still haven't lost my virginity and this
is the worst most embarrassing
conversation we can possibly have right
now shut up how do I solve this
conversation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
