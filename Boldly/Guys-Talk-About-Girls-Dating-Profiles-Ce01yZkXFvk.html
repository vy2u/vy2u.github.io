minute sprint when you hold your phone
and you just oh I got a match what do I
think about dating apps I love them
because I move around to a lot of
different cities and I use it to meet
girls in order to meet new friends my
current girlfriend we met on tinder so
like that's been awesome I see them as a
game I didn't have the biggest school
and I wanted to meet new people so yeah
let me try dating apps I'd prefer to
meet someone in person I like the club
but I also like to just watch Netflix
binging Netflix cool tell me is
something that not everybody likes to do
if the first line of a girl's bio is I'm
five eight and I don't like guys are
under six feet I'm usually swiping no
even though I'm a talker about Kelsey
Pizza Netflix coffee music and puppies
the emojis with like lipstick and all
this other things ain't gonna happen but
if you're really hot I'm still gonna
swipe right you need to throw something
in there that shows like you're a real
human being if I can tell you're kind of
witty and also a little bit sarcastic
that's usually like bait for me she has
to have likes that reflect mine but also
that are just like really interesting I
like when people are fun or weird and
they maybe live within five miles don't
deceive me in your bio and try to make
it all cute and funny and then be a
really cold person some girls would just
have like all selfies if a girl has more
than two selfies I'm done and I'm just
kind of getting this vibe that you take
a lot of pictures of yourself becomes a
little less attractive you know what to
know this pose if you have a picture and
you're doing the sorority arm you're an
automatic out for me like she's playing
the angles she can't really tell like
what all is she working with so another
thing that like grinds my gears about
ladies and their dating profiles is the
fact that you take pictures with tall
hunky men if girls have other guys in
the photos
doesn't really bother me unless they're
making out then that bothers me
the pictures are very natural outdoor
activities I know that's super cheesy
it's not all just like super makeup on
same pose over and over and over again
if you're creative with your selfies
then I'm not gonna mind if someone that
doesn't take themselves too seriously
like this drills like rock climbing and
to me that's dope
someone that I can just wear sweatpants
around you can't really judge someone
purely based on their profile what I
wish girls did more of when my profile
is like show their sense of humor I
would I would love it if a girl hit me
up more online because it saves me the
trouble I think it's a wild wild world
out there that I am very scared by but
have to be a part of it it's kind of
just a self-esteem game you know you
just kind of like okay cool somebody up
there likes me at the end of the day
yeah we're all lonely and we're you know
animalistic creatures but you know I
want like BAE you know I want wifey it's
like one out of like 500 you don't get a
match right it's insane
Eunice with your eyes closed to know
Matt is this I got a match</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
