gonna put it on I don't want it today we
are going to have some guys test the
differences between daytime and
nighttime maxi-pads let's see what they
know
maybe the daytime one is like I don't
know like a friend and then the
nighttime was like a nightmare like it's
this monster the other one gives you
more energy the other one has melatonin
so you can sleep better yeah
nobody's ever mentioned the difference
between daytime and nighttime maxi-pads
it's really important for a man to know
because if I have a daughter and I'm a
single dad how the hell we're gonna
explain that to my daughter
what is menstruation the process in a
woman of discharging blood and other
materials from the lining of the uterus
what is happening you're the lining of
your of your uterus is falling yeah
shedding Chandi like a snakeskin you
came out of line yeah that was the last
time I touched one what about the whole
syncing up I heard like some women's
sync up like bluetooth aa maxi with a
flexi wings you know none of my clothing
has wings and it says incentive some of
these come with since absorbs in seconds
with up to eight hours of leak
protection that's what you want how long
do they suppose you sleep if you need
this one
tears Wow yeah it's definitely bigger
than maybe it's really supposed to hold
you in there so it's bigger so like that
if it comes out sideways you ain't going
no whistling I don't even know how this
is gonna work how are we gonna bleed oh
my god is this how many good it is super
warm is it bad no it doesn't look like
we just go for it
yeah we're just gonna go element to this
point
what is it chunk Smiths Shetty you
okay it's going in ah
the wings are pulling my hair's out oh I
feel like girls are like in the bathroom
like having life decisions being made
about how am I gonna go through the rest
of my day at this point oh god oh my god
what do I need to sit down
ah it's just moving around this is not
good this is horrible it's okay I just
kind of like put like underneath my
balls okay yeah pay attention to your
pad or tampons absorbency to avoid
stains on your clothing or bedding
someplace sleeping in the fetal position
is very helpful yeah I feel and there's
a chunk of my culo feel super compact
and super chunky I'm on a day one sort
of alone this has been an experience an
eye-opening one I had a little bit of
staying here got some spots got some
edging thank you if a guy had to go
through this for a week we would find an
immediate way to put this do it in men
are the biggest whiny babies anybody's
ever met hey when men get hurt you know
it immediately extra now having gone
through this it really makes me like
understand more what it feels like
Tilly's have to go through that
discomfort even for a few seconds I feel
like women should be able to work from
home when they're on their period women
are incredible
I can't do that this is horrible
how do women walk normally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
