just beautiful eyes on fleek today we
are going to attempt to recreate Kylie's
iconic makeup looks each one of us will
have a different Kylie look that we're
trying to recreate my experience with
makeup has not been good I am
comfortable looking at people wearing
makeup I've never touched it I've never
applied it I'm actually a big Kardashian
fan I just discovered Kylie was famous
maybe like two months ago I can't wait
to look just like highly they don't have
ghostly pale so I think I'm gonna have
to go in this oh did I get a white shirt
is this too much or too little all
inside of my lips pop out so much more
it's got like that pregnancy glow it
also could just be the sweat I look like
a wax figure I think I don't know I just
look dead but look I'm trying to go for
requires a lot of contouring made that
face this is a marker in kindergarten
when you're just like coloring a
coloring book but like it's like your
face a part of this is kind of like
really therapeutic this is nice it's
like neat I'm DC the different DC like
I'm contouring my face looks kind of
just dirty now so now we're moving on to
Chi shadow my biggest fear right now is
to end up looking like a raccoon I've
spread this so far I'm J doin of my eyes
closed
oh god I got my eye oh that is oh my god
is the water gonna mess with my makeup I
can't cry mine looks like the remnants
of SpaghettiOs all right awesome now
we're gonna go on to the Chi light I see
what she's doing with her product names
and I like it I feel like I'll poke my
eye out I'm like twitching haha
how do you do it without hitting your
eyelashes
oh no I rushed this is the part in
American Ninja where people fall I look
like a monster what I'm gonna put on her
famous lip kit and put Kandy K - Brown K
Dolce K denim night
Mary Jo K whose marriage okay that's so
thoughtful
young lady I'm hoping that this fixes
all of my problems this mascara the
blood of her grandma it's important to
keep your lips closed like a little
butthole they do that right I'm gonna
draw it a little bit bigger just because
Kylie likes having big lips looks like
the Nilla cupcakes so chocolatey cookies
okay oh
looked like a conductor from like a
silent film train my name is Caine so it
also matches the kylie brand candy cake
it stands for a candy cane she's trying
to say I'm sweet as candy and I'm saying
run for your life I don't look like this
beautiful young woman I instead I look
like a creepy man you would call a
police on
I think we're twinning right now and to
be honest I think I actually look like
the hotter twin I think I nailed it I
look so good right now
I'm lying through my teeth I look very
far from this picture today I learned
that makeup is so effin hard I would
think a toddler did it but like I did it
I'm an adult and I made this happen this
is just so scary
yes I'm just like one of those general
Kardashians now if Kylie saw me right
now she'd probably canceled her Kylie
lip kit line she would probably cry
Kylie tears so much what I did undo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
