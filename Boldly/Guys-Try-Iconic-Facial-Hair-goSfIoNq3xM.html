point where like every man that ever
shaves his beard before he shaves it off
is like what do I look like with this or
what do I look like with this nobody
really gets to see that part that hour
in the bathroom where you're just like
you know what I couldn't be good in the
Civil War and now I get to do it for you
it's crazy officiator changed your look
I can't really grow facial hair so I'm
excited to put some on it's going to be
really interesting to see what it looks
like with different facial I mean I
always thought the handlebar was the
coolest one I am here to provide moral
support I'm nervous I'm excited while he
does whatever he's about to do oh it's
gonna get weird I'm very excited about
this I'm scared it's been two years
mutton chops are pristine and clean
right there don't want anything
distracting anybody from the chops if
underneath this beard was like another
super cool beard yeah I don't love this
nevers he's gonna like it and then I'm
gonna have to walk around with him this
is the mutton chop of mutton chops boss
life Amy my dear friend it's time to
turn around try not have an orgasm athle
delicious oh this really where these I
actually thoroughly enjoy it like I'm
wrong as you wake it up with this oh god
you could have this first thing in the
morning babe like this even this I like
why do I like all these like this is
like a horrible Christmas present this
is the handle walk is the soul patch
this is the whole Cogan Amy okay it's
better than your last one I still hate
it but it's bad vision the worst time
 I am
oh nostalgic for the mutton chop do you
think of the handlebar you know I'd like
this one this is like a toy that boys
get to grow on their faces very Wild
West
I feel like a villain but a bit a
villain nobody's scared up I just feel
like you're the guy on the other end in
a chat room where it's like age sex
location only a well-groomed man can
maintain a handlebar mustache
I feel like today with facial hair less
is more but back in the day like a lot
more it was more the worse is definitely
the last one I think that the absolute
worst was the soul patch I'm sure I did
not like the chops at all there was a
part of it there was
okay for the guys who can't really grow
facial hair I mean that's no problem I
think less is more I completely agree
shave safely kids shave safely right
like I said I learned a lot of this very
liberating regardless of what your
facial hair is own it enjoy it don't let
it define you you're not your beard
that's what I'm saying alt I was doing
this you went out your beard I'm kind of
jealous honestly do you wanna do it yeah
with your legs okay John be the chin
strap it's just like like racing stripes
down the side of my leg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
