you don't do makeup it makes your skin
look healthier when I was a kid yeah
like my parents after every shower I
have to pollution arms legs everything
my neck my back that's why you look
young and the healthy guy usually gets
oily I like to use pshoo salve it a
little bit softly you don't want to take
off your moisturizer yes yes yes I loved
appearing I prefer not to put too much
foundation for men dying size not too
much because it creates a really
artificial look and you don't want that
that bit too
yeah it's a bit kind of it is this what
I could have looked like we're taking
care of myself since you use consider
only if you have a pimple or dark circle
cars or anything you want to hide choose
the almost same color as your skin tone
we could check it right here yes haha I
think we're finally getting the hang of
this I don't you can say that you will
jinx us
oh it's not too dark for you creating
more dark Sokol oh and then you stuffing
her toothless and tap it don't rub tap
finish the consider you're gonna do the
powder you only gonna apply where you
need and where do we need key don't here
are the teeth yeah before you apply it
happen remove the extra powder yeah

our necks hell light yeah he's mad tan
we're doing it right you guys have a
pretty much perfect eyebrow so you want

well

put too much keep repress a smile in
there yeah perfect oh just a little bit
to moisturize your lips yeah so is there
any difference between like this and
let's say my local birds bees wax no oh

good job yeah
once you get the hang of it you can
probably do it in like 5-10 minutes
you know I would do this if I hadn't
slept the night before just make it look
like it wasn't as tired of all the
thought that I wouldn't put makeup
because too obvious but now I feel like
knowing all the secrets and like the
steps it is possible to pull it off with

up getting like a really bad blemish you
do to get redness due to something that
