it doesn't hold me back from my style
but it definitely influences what I'm
able to actually buy what I'm actually
able to wear I'm here today to try all
an ASIS man plus collection problem that
I have with clothing is that I have an
hourglass figure which is not something
that men would usually associate I think
with masculine bodies clothing companies
assume the wider you are the taller you
are so because I'm both short and wide
nothing truly fits like even this jacket
is too long on me my biggest problem is
pants fitting my thighs in my butt
because the men's pants typically are
made for this I love my body I love my
curves
I love everything about my body so I do
most of my shopping in store because I
could pretty much see the size I can
know what will fit I'm truly afraid of
ordering online I'll put a lot of third
stores I find shopping in person to be a
really stressful experience when you
know that a lot of the standard Styles
don't fit your body I try to avoid
shopping to be honest hi nice to meet
you I pulled some pieces from ASOS his
new plus-size collection for men do you
want to check it out uh yeah
one-five were you going for today what
do you feeling I just want to go out of
my comfort zone today my personal style
is basically just a lot of black more so
in recent years since I've gained weight
just cuz I try to kind of hide myself as
opposed to be visible to everyone else
anything drawing you in I really like
the color palette was not I was like
these are all colors like definitely
already wear XL dogs tiny like a medium
but typically wear a skinny G and less
than like a material like this um just
because you know I work hard for my legs
I'm gonna show them maybe some denim
maybe all denim yeah
I actually love this look
I'm pleasantly surprised with how the
jacket fits it's a little bit small but
it still looks really great I feel
comfortable but I also feel very
fashion-forward confident the pant
certainly well I like very fitted pants
so these look really great on me and
this is a perfect size to go with this
kind of more tailored jacket feel I play
with the fluidity of clothing so I could
be like really feminine one day really
masculine one day this look would
definitely fit into my wardrobe I would
wear this jacket over like maybe like a
black crown I really like it this way
too
I'm really feeling it I'm comfortable
wearing denim but I usually go for
something a little more fitted and it's
nice to try a different style and I
think pull it off the clothes made me
feel a little bit uncomfortable at first
because I wasn't used to the way these
fit on me but having seen the photos of
myself I'm super super into how I look
so it's a really liberating experience
actually I don't know I just oh like
really shocked by how much I love this
look I think I look amazing to be honest
I didn't want to be seen but now I feel
more comfortable you know just living
lovely
I hate being in front of the camera I am
much more comfortable on the camera I
feel like I've kind of pushed through a
fear that I had and ended up with
something that I feel really great about
so it was really fun if I could change
anything I would say just more
consistency in the sizes this is a three
XL and it doesn't fit like a three XL if
it's more like a to excel so I guess I
wish it was a little bit bigger so that
was actually a little bit more oversized
on you you know you want to look like a
little different have a different type
of appeal every day I really really
enjoy this particular look like oh I
shouldn't wear that you know I shouldn't
be seen in that but now I think I should
be you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
