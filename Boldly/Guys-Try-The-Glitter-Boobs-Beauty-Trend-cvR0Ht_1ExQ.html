my video producer out in New York I've
been seeing more and more people wearing
or not wearing something called glitter
boobs so you're seeing it on makeup
tutorials on YouTube you see on
Instagram and so I was thinking what
would that look like if I had my male
coworker shiet doing a glitter boob
video as a sentence I never thought I'd
have to say in my entire life and yet
here I felt like this has been coming
for years we're starting ooh uh glitter
there's jewels six jewels there's like
medallions this looks like a process
that there's levels and layers to this
we're gonna mess this up I'm pretty good
at crafts okay this is in my wheelhouse
I'm still into it yeah I'm into it I'm
just intimidated I'm gonna be a little
slower than you use oh yeah I get a head
start just right on the nipple right on
the oh that looks beautiful that brings
out your sternum delightfully look like
The Terminator meets I don't I think you
look beautiful thank you when it went
clear booming it's always important a
couple days that's just the rule I
follow it's real fast it's going to
alright that's one grilled eye
whoa whoo here we go I'm going to jewel
my right breast
one two like I know what I'm supposed to
be counting oh here we go that is
hanging by thread that is oh no there we
go
whoa that's it's beautiful thank you
yeah thank you very much you've made
quite the progress as well look at us
oh yeah no the the glitters your enemy
we did in the wrong order
I think chest hair is not helping me out
I wouldn't imagine it is it doesn't it
doesn't really grass the jewels
this is shadowing yeah what's known in
the boob industry of contouring really
boring it is I think you whore
ha ha I mean ho how pretty you feel
right now I've been more confident yeah
in my life ha like I feel awful about
myself how did they do it like how do
they get the jewels the stem I thought
we came into this well-prepared with the
tutorials but there's something we're
missing
I feel like we need to apologize to
anyone who actually does this because I
hope this makes you proud sorry I hope
you like what you see and what you've
done to us
he who adorns himself with too many
jewels ends up with no jewels at all
merely glitter dancing across his nipple
oh my god see the fumes have gotten too
