involved just seems really uncomfortable
just cramping they can sync up like
Bluetooth phone it's not like bluetooth
but it sounds like bluetooth I'm already
so lost I've touched a sanitary pad
playfully before but I've never opened
one and seen what it's like what's it
smell like nothing well kind of reminds
me of a diaper it's like a speed better
if I was wearing it there's this the
front that's all I got I don't know so
you stick it on like that and then do
you have that word Oh
so there you go that I don't know I
don't know what these wings are for they
just part of the packages like
aerodynamics what's going on here are
these are the wings they appeared to be
sticky on the outside but not on the
part I'm assuming kind of contact with
the skin I feel like they'd attached to
my school Road oh oh oh you can use the
wings to like wrap around here for extra
tightness you hold them down tight down
here it took me a while but I got to it
now I got my little hammock I figured it
out and there's this like pretty big
part of women's lives that I was never
told about it's a natural thing and I
don't think we should be so squeamish
about it my dog would do this weird
thing when all my sisters run their
periods where she'd like go through the
garbage and pull it all apart so I grew
up having to take up like a bunch of old
tampons and pads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
