some saucy moods today so I was trying
to make it a little bit darker of an
intro yeah I'm mad it's just one of
those one of those times where nothing
looks particularly it was both angry for
now he said I mean no I mean I guess
things did happen I just feel like I'm
out of control of my life right now
yikes that's a scary feeling yeah you're
right into it yeah control I
don't know man I used to like really
like being in big groups and stuff
because I was like oh I could perform
here and no one will ever get too close
to me that's great mmm but now I really
don't like it I like being with only
like the people that I know are my good
friends and who I could say like ah I'm
feeling weird today you know what I mean
like otherwise I get too nervous and
overwhelmed that there's like a ton of
people that I'll start drinking a whole
lot and then I become the loudest person
there
and then I wake up with the hangover
blues I left a group hangout yesterday
and I took the queso dip I brought in my
tiny purse you know that won't hold
queso dice I just put it I went okay bye
guys
did you eat it again yeah ah but
sometimes you need that if it's helped
with the hangover blues yeah someone
made a comment on the last two videos or
something on YouTube that was like one
of the top comments we try to stay away
from the comment section but sometimes
it's good constructive criticism and
someone was like hey have you guys ever
thought about not drinking cuz it seems
like you both talked about how sad you
are
and you also both talked about how
wasted you get every week um guys this
is a dull I don't know if you heard
us the first time it's the podcast where
we up so you don't have to we're
still learning we don't know sometimes
we know we know you're right we know
something sometimes you said it in the
other podcast you said that you got a
lot of that out of your system
yep when you're younger uh-huh I did not
I did not I did not I stayed in watched
hairspray from college oh my god earlier
John Travolta
- box and - like I think we go through
stages in our lives like I can remember
a time where I was partying really hard
in my early 20s and I look back on that
time and I shudder even thinking about
yeah the hangovers I get and now it's
like you get one bad hangover a month or
two months and you kind of go up I don't
like that feeling I'm not gonna do that
again yeah I picked a full bottle of
wine out of my nose last weekend and I
don't feel ever this is the first time
okay and I went out with my boyfriend
boyfriend my hello boyfriend so I
scrubbed it I know and I said no yeah
that was my hand I think it was a good
size Aegina does not feel like a hit I
don't know dreary uh but we went out to
a jazz club where Wow
Kate really hears it okay there was this
gorgeous gorgeous he was the most
gorgeous bass player I'd ever seen my my
life stand-up bass not like Aaron Aaron
oh yeah I like the big boy in case like
wow I want to put my mouth on that and I
was like oh do you now BRB I'm gonna
help you today
okay ID swing woman wait wait wait light
what tell them what what the you
said to him oh dude I was pretty drunk
did you not hear the part where I said I
puked a bottle of wine ah what you said
to him and then we're like oh I went out
to him and I was like wow you're a great
player and I think he thought I was
hitting on him so I was like oh by the
way I'm over here forever my friend if
you turn around she's one with the big
titties and he turned around I was like
wow let's go talk to her but good news I
was like down to or something I
didn't say you were DTF I would never
say that right to his face I'm sure I
slid it in so it sounded like you were
yeah about it so in my mind when you
want to talk to someone you'd be like
hey do you know who's really interesting
and you might have an emotional
connection with boom I just led with
titties cuz you got great titties what
do you lead with titties then it's like
all she wanted to do was you
weren't trying to establish an emotional
connection well of course I was I've
always tried to do that even
I've never just trying to are you
insane we've actually found out that he
didn't live here you were like oh I'm
down to just bone yeah in theory man not
really okay like I would still have two
tacos I was still want to talk to him
like I wouldn't want to just be like I
don't know anything about this person I
can't I eat some sort of emotional
connection to be like okay what you know
you know about that my last my bad it's
okay it's just when he came over then
interested by over two years and it was
talking to you I was like oh here she
goes she's on her own good for heard so
I reversed my way right when I called
you guys that night later
what did Chelsea oh she looks back at
the DJ just goes sure here's the thing
here's the thing here's the thing what's
the thing okay so we were talking I was
asking a lot about his personal life
just like that's good guys like to talk
about themselves yeah I was asking him a
lot and then he asked me what I did okay
wait say what right whatever before you
say what he said just wait okay cuz
you're gonna think something but that
left but then let me think let me say
what I think he meant okay are you pre
plating the rest of our conversation yes
you go so then he said sorry of a
mouthful of spinach feta wrap was it
alright herb yeah comedy Oh like a Lena
Dunham vibe you have like a Lena Dunham
vibe and I went nice and drunk I do not
and so you just got eyes like he was
calling you Lena Dunham whereas I think
he was just trying to relate to what you
were doing he's trying to keep the
conversation going like oh you're a
white comedy female writer yeah I'm a
comedy female writer like I think he was
just trying to find a connection I don't
think he was like calling you Lena
Dunham who while she does great work in
the lives of women with endometriosis in
chronic pain we do know that she can be
problematic as so I think you
probably took that offensive
we're a little tipsy and probably went I
am not hurt yeah I got real mad and I
actually wouldn't let it go like I am
NOT Lita denim
Wow it really matter than he just slowly
took with it I wish I could I don't
remember how that ended but I do
remember you left puking yeah you left I
stayed for a minute I shouldn't have
been there alone
you stayed alone oh it's cuz I thought
Quinta was coming right yeah mm-hmm he
left me there hi my name was the ID
that's all my bad yeah you had to throw
up yeah I had to puke I get it that's
how I was last night
Oh Pookie left last night
what'd you do last night well last night
I just went to a picnic and I got
nervous so I drank a whole bunch and
then I left and I took the K so that's
always telling me about ah I have
carefully speaking it's when there's
people around that I'm like you're kind
of a dream I just
well you it's easy to drunk cause it
yeah good you're you're also like you
know a fun yeah you're fun drunk and but
we all has that line where once you go
one drink over the fun drunk
it's either sad drunk or mad drunk or
two funny drunk yeah that's usually my
problems I'm just - hilarious
I get warmer I know it's annoying but
it's the it's like the best way to keep
people at like an arm's length instead
of being vulnerable cuz all I wanted to
do is just be like I'm sad today
building that when I was with like a
bunch of people I didn't feel
comfortable being like I'm sad cuz it's
a group setting you know you're not good
any like we like we're not in the group
text I feel like we've lost a little bit
of our group text mojo and yes and I
feel like usually you should know that
you could call it I tried facetiming you
I know it's just it wasn't a good it
just eyes like study will spiral I just
like fully spiral and I just had one of
those weekends sometimes it's better to
just fully spiral like you say and feel
all the feelings rather than
well that's the thing event yourself
from having a meltdown right and I want
to feel all the feelings I think it's
just I'm getting frustrated that I don't
have a better coping mechanism so
instead of like feeling it and being
like okay this is what you feel and
that's alright I usually like eat or
drink it away and then I feel worse
about it because then it's like think of
something I could put my hands on you
know I mean like if I if I eat or drink
a whole bunch then I'm like oh that's
the problem I can't stop eating or I
can't stop drinking but really I just
can't live in this like discomfort and I
don't really know what else to do and
even when I want to like ask like reach
out and be like could someone help me I
get nervous it's funny how we like do
things that we know are bad for us just
by like knowing that it's not gonna make
us feel better but it is like a quick
fix
it's almost like a punishment I mean I
mean there are two centers in the brain
where it's for what I was talking about
in Santa Barbara that's another
conversation but I had a really good
conversation with a friend and she was
talking about she was talking about
micro dosing and how they're using that
to treat like PTSD and trauma and even
things like bipolar and anxiety into
that and she was talking about how
there's two centers in your brain
one is the reward center and one is mood
so things like alcohol cocaine that's
reward space and then things like you
know anything like mushrooms LSD MDMA
those are mood parts of your brain so
we're rewarding we're doing the
rewarding versus treating the mood oh
nice teen psychotropics and micro dosing
and
I mean I might be wrong so it's we got
people out there who plant based
medicines uh let me know but yeah like
in alcoholism resident we all know that
yeah it's not it's not something you're
not gonna feel great after drinking a
lot I don't care who you are
yeah and I just I like I could Koons
myself in this weekend until yesterday I
was just like I stayed inside watched
queer I can we just pause for a that is
like really posh iced talk could we get
them on the show yo any of them any any
who's your favorite if not watching
queer I first-rate guy was a show that
was on what channel was I don't think
it's clear for the straight guy anymore
I think it's just clear very oh that's
smart because it's not just treatment
yeah right
20:18 uh it's on Netflix it's five gay
men make over someone's entire life and
it's been all men so far yes as the
person yeah yeah and who I mean from the
first episode just here opps
it is just beautiful because it's it's
just beautiful it's a beautiful
uplifting hopeful wonderful thing and I
just love them all so much and I did
it's a feel-good show yeah and those
four there's five queer men and they
each represent like a part of the
makeover so like one guy does his style
one guy does his foods one guy does his
house one guy does his hair and then the
other guy does the landscaping or some
 right landscaping gargy no he's
like a light coaching life coaching yeah
I don't which one's your favorite I
truly don't know who I for one minute
I'm like oh the hairdresser guys my
favorite and I'm like no life goes good
coach guys I'm here and I'm like no
that the clothes guy is my favorite and
yeah I don't know any of their names
it's it's tan Bobby Corrado and Dini
Anthony and Jonathan holy I follow
them all on Instagram I love them so
much oh my god that was dresses yeah
yeah okay Ramazan real world news unreal
world oh no fear my god that's why he
looks so familiar was he out on
the roof yeah and he was like cuz people
were like oh I thought gay men dress
like this he's like no I just wear like
jeans and chance that I love I mean like
most of my closest friends are gay men
and I love seeing the what the like
representation in the spectrum of like
masculine versus feminine lack thereof I
should say between the five guys like
they're all so different and they're all
brings such a different perspective -
yeah it's that's why it was really nice
is that it's now like I think even when
queer I first came out like the original
Queer Eye for the straight guy I don't
know I feel like if you're the first of
your kind doing something there's sort
of like archetypes you kind of have to
fit into to you know easily transition
into people smaller Minds honestly and I
just think it's really nice to see the
progression that everyone was just like
nope
you know this actually this is my
personality that's us that's my
sexuality is kind of secondary like who
I choose to be with this is just who I
am and it gave me so much hope because
they did go to a couple like Middle
America places where you would have it
was in Georgia yeah yeah yeah yeah I
know what do you mean I know that it's a
reality show and they had to say yes to
this does not like these people are
bombarding ya you know people were
unwilling to be open to this but it was
really nice to see even like the cop
yeah the firefighter guy - yeah the cop
was big for me like that was it that was
such a I don't want to spoil anything
but all of these things like I I just
feel like you guys should watch it yeah
every potential argument or like oh oh
that yeah be trouble was met on with
such love and understanding and like
coming from a very genuine place of
being like let's really talk about this
like let's let's understand each other
and that was just facts you wanna cry
right now
oh my gosh it was just like and just a
genuine care for other human beings you
know I'm right I'm right you know it was
so nice think like anyone could watch
this show - like I I almost encourage
you to get straight mail
I'm trying to get my daddy my real life
yeah because I my boyfriend and I watch
it together and we both like openly
cried together I felt like my friends
from home - and then their boyfriends
are like yeah you love it - and they're
not making sure the other one like yeah
yeah
go watch the show that's great um I
almost had a foursome in Santa Barbara
go on that's it almost dead got you
drunk and it didn't happen you the DJ
and then another couple two two chicks
yeah how big is he that it didn't happen
he actually wasn't pissed at all he was
like you it's all you it's whatever you
want to do and I went on autopilot and
was like I need to go home cuz I'm too
drunk and the worst thing that I just
knew my limits and I had hit them
we had been wine-tasting for six to
eight hours probably like four bottles
of wine at least oh yeah it was after
you just do a point to I really gave
myself ah but it didn't it didn't happen
but boy did it almost yeah yeah how does
someone go about initiating well I don't
think anyone could do that unless
they're drunk I feel like we yeah it
does help to have alcohol but I also am
openly by and like we'll talk about it
and I think specifically women always
have questions and I you think it would
be men like oh do you hug chicks
but it's no one's ever really that rude
that openly - yeah yeah like and so I
think women like to ask questions about
it and then I'm like yo here's ten
reasons why you should absolutely eat a
 before you die and then it's my
job to like convince that it's not so
much convincing as like letting them
kind of exploit here yeah yeah I kind of
like them creating a safe space yeah to
be like bloomie made like yeah watch
like lesbian
yeah yeah and the DJ is just sitting
there like hey I'm just here to support
you guys I'll just sit back I'll let
y'all do the talkin No
really it was a fun weekend the L bombs
were dropped guys we dropped the hell
bombs it happened I was drunk when I
said it but don't regret it you know in
old movies when they go to like hug each
other
the people are in love and then they
don't actually want to hug each other
like mad they almost like push each
other away or get really mad before they
finally hug each other because it's like
no it can't be real um that was you oh
oh I forgot I got drunk and was talking
to you too Jesus what the hell happened
us is we could hate I was you literally
what did you say to me that was like a
UH ha moment I said I was like I don't
like it he'll destroy me if it if it
gets up I'll be destroyed I was
like well you didn't have friends last
time yeah close friends that were here
yeah the last time when I went through
the bad breakup that I talked about all
of his friends were my friends and yeah
including the females they were females
I should say that I will get in a lot of
trouble for calling them females but
here's the women a male/female girls
think about bitches later that like I
truly felt like I lost all of my friends
when I think about them yeah and yeah
that's something Kate said to me because
I was being all drunk like I can't tell
him I love him because he's gonna why
did I say destroy me that's also
dramatic but I would be really sad Kate
said it's cuz you want friends didn't
have friends the last time and I ain't
no one could really handle that on their
own it doesn't seem so scary when it
feels like I have support yeah and I'm
so used to people not supporting me and
relationships are life choices that this
feels it just everything feels new and
different and if I'm really happy and it
feels good to have friends that want you
to be happy that's awesome I want you to
be happy dude I don't know what to do I
don't either I was doing good you but
that I think it's life man yeah yeah I
always just think that that it's like
this like it's just like an up a steady
uphill like progress like you know
the numbers are rising it's good we're
getting better but it's not it's like a
valley one yeah one step back doesn't
take you back down to the bottom of that
hill I know I you think it's made so I
mean this just let me even look at the
podcast like how much you've grown in
like oh my god how many people truly
love also my fans are gonna get read
talking about this but I think and
that's why I don't want to do just so
everyone out there knows I don't want to
do anymore come updates oh it's just I
like I was in therapy and I was talking
and stuff and I I just I got to a point
so just being like I won't like a lot
myself have fun I won't like you know
let loose or whatever it's it's way
deeper than that it's like a genuine
 terrifying fear that I haven't
been physically intimate with someone
even myself so I don't want to talk
about it anymore and guess
what that's the way it's gonna be I love
you guys yeah and you know what I think
you've helped a lot of people realize
that it's not and it's not abnormal to
it yeah I don't know I'll talk about it
maybe sometimes but yeah being like a
segment every week and people kind of
asking and I know it sounds fun and
stuff that people be like what did you
come yet or that'll make you and
it's like I know that we all feel like
we're close to each other but I that
makes it that makes me clam up way more
yeah well it's like when you have
anxiety and people go like have you
tried doing this and you're like yeah
yeah obviously I tried this
thing right like or if I don't there's a
reason why I haven't done it yeah yeah
you have to go at your own pace and you
have to you know you can lead a horse to
water what does that apply here I honest
to god I blacked out
[Laughter]
that's good dear mmm we also guys have
our new podcast to email address we got
a flood of messages yeah it's adult
podcast at gmail.com adult spelled
with a 1 and I should we do it should we
just do a question since we're already
talking about and also we love this
you guys send us the my favorite thing
has been just reading
the email subject lines because they're
hilarious
yeah and very attention-grabbing
official Dabney says hey Kelsey you've
been loving the podcast you and Kay are
awesome I have a question maybe need
some advice I'll try to keep it short
some background I live in New York with
three roommates one from my graduating
class and two from the year before who
delayed moving to the city for a year so
we all moved in in June and one of the
roommates give us issues the whole time
with how much she'd be paying the
application requirements and she keeps
some massive furniture pieces none of us
agreed to in the living room so all in
all we're really annoying we have to
move because Iran is raising so the
three of us we're just going to break it
off but another friend of ours will not
be joining us we haven't told the girl
we don't want to live with her yet and
aren't really sure how we still have to
live together for a few months but we
want to give her enough time to prepare
we want to avoid hurt feelings but it's
awkward all around we're all fairly
close and she's often not home and a bit
left out so I'm sure living with us
hasn't been great for her either
question mark any advice from you Kate
would be great you guys are so
insightful and great at really thinking
through things Thanks I think you're
really good at thinking through things I
kind of just go off of my first emotion
which is I'm not gonna thinking through
things for other people oh damn
burn but doesn't that make you feel good
self like some I think your purpose in
life is to help other people ah yeah I
know now I'm just kidding I like I know
what you want to go home yourself go
guys my initial instinct is uh you gotta
 tell her it's an adult
conversation no you don't want to have
but you gotta have it also have you guys
been talking to her about all the stuff
that makes you annoyed or a parent oh
crap or is it cuz sometimes and not
saying you guys doing this and I used to
do this sometimes when I would have
roommates like before I live by myself
when I they would like do stuff like a
roommate would do something and I would
never tell them it was annoying I would
just be I would tell everyone else and
then it became this weird thing where I
was like oh I used to really like
complaining about them and just me like
oh my god listen to what they did this
time and it's just like I don't know you
take it it becomes a good scab and you
just like like to pick it
no you know you shouldn't just fix it
just let it you know talk to him about
it but sometimes it's like it's a hard
conversation to have but yeah I mean
your home is your home
right I have to be comfortable and
everyone should feel that way yeah you
shouldn't feel like you're coming home
to be like tension or like a passive
aggressiveness and especially if it
sounds like you guys live in the city
like with four chicks that's just gotta
be either y'all got lots of money or
that I'm sure the space is tight yeah
and the videos it's a cramped yeah it's
a cramped City and then you come home
and you feel cramped or you feel like
overwhelmed that I think you would be
much yeah here if your your safe space
is actually a safe space yeah and I I
definitely think that there is like I
think I feel like you guys aren't
talking to her about what she's doing
that's bothering you and she probably
picked up on the fact that you guys
talked about her yeah three guys one
might feel all anti invading and I know
that like believe me do I know that you
know putting up your own boundaries and
being like hey this actually makes me
feel this way is really hard because you
don't want to hurt the other person but
please believe me when I say that
talking about the other person is way
more hurtful hmm
she'll have frickin trust issues being
like they didn't like me I know I'm by
myself and I have to fight so I would
say like I would try talking with her
and like just talk to it and some people
really just aren't meant to live
together and it might be good that
mm-hmm
I mean I hope she friends no offense
better people other people to live with
because it kind of sounds like you guys
sort of have your minds made up about it
and you don't really want to be the bad
guys in this situation and you're only
the bad guy if you're a dick about it if
you're a dick about it and talking about
someone like that when you're not
actually like trying to change the thing
is being a dick and don't I wouldn't I
would maybe have one person talked to
her I think all three of you guys
approaching her about it would come off
as like I would immediately get back in
defensive or be like okay I don't give a
 y'all bitches anyway so I would
maybe take so the person who's like the
closest with her or how
the most control over the like lease I
don't know how you guys have split up
but someone where it's like hey I want
to sit down with you as a friend and a
roommate and talk about the upcoming
situation that you know the lease is up
and we're all gonna have to move and us
three are gonna get a place and it's
because we think we live better together
and you know if you seem unhappy and
maybe you could tell us if you have been
there haven't been but I don't think it
doesn't sound like she's gonna be pissed
that you guys don't want to live with
her if she's not happy either yeah also
I do you guys tent like I'm right now I
feel bad for this girl like did you guys
tell her you didn't like the furniture
did you tell her all this sort of stuff
it kind of feels like this is like and
if that's the case if you guys have if
you have talked to her just tell
her that you don't want what you've you
Varda is like oh no we've had these
disliked actual discussions not passive
discussions actual discussions trying to
find a solution and not trying to stay
mad if that's the case don't worry about
it she'll figure it out if it's not the
case which I feel like in my experience
I've seen it multiple you know times
where it's it's no one actually has the
conversation until it's like kind of too
late if that's the dynamic just putting
this out there between you three that
you sort of wear like this girl like
it's you know yeah that will follow you
into your new home just so you know
there will be another one that you guys
because when you get rid of this one
there everyone has these unresolved
feelings it will happen to one of you
from the other chick off like living
with friends it's always a risk you're
always taking a risk I've been really
lucky I've been able to live with my
very best friend and her now-husband and
so it was great I was like being in a
throuple and now I live with my other
best friend who is literally the best
remain in the world except for when he
leaves pizzas in the oven it almost
burned the house down every couple weeks
when he's drunk besides that I've been
really lucky in roommate situations but
it's because I've been really picky
about who I live with
I've never just been like willy-nilly
like oh we're all going to the same part
of town like or oh I'm trying to save
money
it's I think you have to be really
careful when deciding to move in with a
friend because you need to know that
that friendship can withstand hard
conversations like money or
responsibilities or you know tough
conversations and I think if I think to
that comes with the more you live with
people the easier it gets
yeah especially in like a big city like
LA where people are constantly moving in
and out with each other I think and your
experience with it sometimes people just
don't do well living with other people
like who me
I don't I wish I did it would be nice I
would like to not be so alone all the
time but I also I'm very particular like
I don't want anyone in my space yeah so
yeah just talk to her and I know that
it's really hard and I hope you know I'm
not like blaming you or calling you guys
bitches even though it might sound like
I was ok um but definitely like just be
honest
just everyone wants to have a good time
no one does anything on purpose to hurt
you yeah she didn't bring the furniture
in to hurt you she didn't make things
hard to hurt you know what I mean it's
just her own stuff so maybe try to get
to the bottom of it and like really just
talk cuz you know if you guys could be
fine and you guys could end up being
friends again yeah maybe you could also
any overwhelmed and nervous and
you guys could be too it's just it got
communication being young and like
having roommates and whatnot is like so
stressful it's weird because when you're
when you're in your family home you like
take out on your family and then
when you get to like a roommate
situation if you don't have that being
like that comfortable dialogue sort of
established then it's gonna be gonna be
right but please write us back and let
us know what ends up happening I'm still
thinking about that girl who's question
we answered two weeks ago she never
wrote back to me on Instagram but about
what where's she wish she was hooking up
with her best friend's ex-boyfriend I'm
still dying to know guys I think we lost
the listener that day I think oh wow
 I'm gonna maybe mess
do you wanna pause and then dokie before
our super special gas comes okay roba
yeah
wait we have to do the thing we did with
grace where we go ladies and gentlemen
our next guest just got here you know
her as the food drunk quicken and
 and host of the new hot
hit podcast yeah how did that come about
fruition uh well first of all thank you
so much for having my huge huge fan of
all about their work analyze this
you know I'm actually one of two Hanna's
on that podcast the second being my best
friend Hannah geld and yeah I don't know
we always talked about mental health and
like I like to go analyze this the
self-help podcast I just can't help
itself the adult rip podcast or we
up so you don't have to our sounds like
more crying but oh oh
ours trans crying too self-deprecating
humor oh this is that this is the line
between 20s and 30s guys right yeah I'm
like you know why actually today I'm
gonna try and love myself just a little
bit but your shoes arational
I mean like you've written about it in
your book and you've talked about it on
YouTube and everywhere but like
giant really hard like how do you we we
joke about that we don't know what we're
doing so that's why we're allowed to
give advice but how do you feel like
does it help giving other does helping
other people help you I know you're like
I think that thing about it helps you
know um I kind I guess it's not so much
a giving advice as it is like relating
relating experience so for instance
today's episode that just went live is
all about trying out a float tank I've
been in one
yeah sensory deprivation chamber I don't
know I like to call it watery coffin
yeah yeah it's terrifying
yeah you better chill for the whole two
hours I guess you'll have to subscribe
to handle it and you find out I got out
early yeah I got out I fully got out
early I was like I can't do yeah well so
like we go and so you know each episode
has like a larger theme so in that one
it was I'm like about like styles of
meditation like trying out different
things I feel if sitting and meditating
is it for you there are ways that you
can get into a meditative state and so
we go out and try this float tank
because we just want to save people some
money you know and you know most
expensive nap I ever took and was it
expensive
I mean per nap yeah yeah that was really
interesting when he said look cuz I went
through the what was it two hours no I
went for one hour I went I went three
hour one for anybody either way about
two hours and he was like the the thing
that scared me is that he was being like
very particular about the ear your thing
I got water man yeah he was like you
don't want to get that in your ear you
don't want to get that in your ear it I
was like aunt water so then I'm laying
there kind of like this yeah it was like
talking about water company couldn't
relax
I couldn't relax no no I like what you
said though about the different styles
of meditation because we've done a ton
of videos about it at BuzzFeed with like
people try this meditating or this kind
of healing or this kind of whatever and
it's all just all of us trying to calm
our brains but my therapist told me
something wonderful once he was like
your form of meditation is going to the
movies I go to the movies by myself
every Sunday or I watch a movie by
myself I like that's my alone time
that's my recharging time and it's the
time where my mind feels most at peace
and I think as long as you're not like
you know doing coke to achieve that same
feeling meditation can really be
anything thing yeah chopping wood
washing dishes
chopping wood chopping wood video game
are you guys serious up I do not go hard
you chop wood
sorry when I go camping not like my
house
camping form of meditation I think it
can be they kept I think it can't be I
like you know and when we were talking
about one of the other themes of he
analyzes is that my friend hand is like
I don't know man isn't it kind of scary
to even think you could be at peace or
you could even think you could be happy
she's like I like my up stick she's like
I like my ups and downs but like you
know I like myself I like my ups and
downs I like my drama I like this is my
emotional experience of life and it's
not that you get so good at meditating
that you become a monk you know not that
you're like hello everyone
right you see you against my face by
this as well it's more like it gives you
the access to the clear blue sky of your
mind whenever you need it so more you
practice meditation so if you picture
your mind like a like the sky sometimes
it's cloudy sometimes it's raining
sometimes it's stormy sometimes there's
a couple clouds in the sky it's the
ability to go above those clouds when
you need to like if you're driving to a
job interview and you're super nervous
being able to breathe and kind of give
yourself that space yeah that's the
access point yes just like having time
to yourself as well like we were so
bombarded with technology and stories
and what are those little
goddamn alerts that come down on my
phone every don't even notice occasion
yes those notifications from like even
BuzzFeed news be sending outside
notifications that maybe should I turned
it off but I keep getting a should
probably know yeah be part of this I
wanted to ask have it does your host
also identify as having mental illness
or mental yeah health crisis mental
health everyone has we all have minds
well it's a refined to call it an
illness I totally understand that right
I think like just talking about it I
feel like I like to say well like so
hannah has a chronic depression as I do
as well and yeah it's interesting the
word mental illness we like to say like
works with their mental health they're
like you know tries to improve men
health of a heart of you yeah yeah all
of you you think you know it sounds like
it's not it's like it sounds so intense
yeah I mentally ill yeah cuz I get it
you automatically get a picture ahead of
what that looks like
also it's the implication that it's a
disease with a cure but it's not it's a
state of being
so like you're predisposed to depression
you're not ill you're not sick you're
not about them all the time looking for
a cure yeah sure this is like okay cool
so if I'm always gonna be at a negative
five
yeah I have to figure out how to bring
my negative five up to zero so I got a
part yeah it's almost like it's like you
just
it's your perspective to and your
perspective is just like oh sorry every
time I see that I think this and that's
just a thing that I that I think and I
have to just I don't know I yeah I was
thinking about that a lot this morning
is that every time I do something that I
that I'm like a little embarrassed about
or I find out a truth about myself it's
usually I try as hard as possible to
push it away or to change it so that it
doesn't sudden I don't have any like
controversial part of me like it has to
be an undeniably favorable you know what
I mean so it's really hard to like push
that stuff out to away and try to change
and then I thought about this morning
and it was like that is a it will never
happen yeah you'll never change these
parts of you and yes comes to like
working with them and knowing how to
work with them and yeah I think that's a
really really good point you know as I
discuss and buffering on chair tales of
life yeah so good Kate couldn't read it
she had to wait it's it's triggering
what people are expecting but in the
chapter where I discover or in the
chapter where I discuss living with
depression the metaphor that I like to
kind of think of it as is
once you identify your demon it's not
about outrunning it and it's not about
Dafina gate it's about learning to walk
alongside it yeah like oh hey buddy
you're here you're here today
oh you're big today yeah oh yeah it's
not we said this so many times on this
podcast about the ankle that society
tells us we should be is
happy the same way that they tell us you
you're only in a successful relationship
if you end up married the same way that
you know it's not
why does happy have to be the end goal
it's like people get on you know a
medication in a sec okay well now soon
I'll be happy yeah it's it's why is that
why can't we accept the ups and downs oh
I can't we accept the sadness as
something that makes the happiness
better feels like a failure sadness
sometimes when when like happy I think
happiness and beauty are two things that
were like maybe for men too but
specifically for women happiness and
beauty are like the two things that we
which is very interesting because we are
literally predisposed to being like sad
like what at least one some if you get
your period um
did think did you know that men's
hormonal cycles or cisgender men as
hormonal cycles are 24 hours what yeah
so we have a whole month but men go
through mood swings all day like yeah
that's why they're so moody I mean
 like that is why do they teach
you that you know the guys wake up with
morning wood
yes yeah that's part of their hormonal
cycle it's a 24-hour cycle and like you
know how sometimes you get horny right
before your periods fully I know they
don't see that
yeah they don't cuz they're not alive
I'm a lot of feeling be our if we are
not allowed to just we're not allowed to
talk about yeah yeah yeah it's so weird
cuz sometimes even like talking about
wait I have a point oh yeah you were
talking about predispose all the time oh
yes yeah oh but do you have like
impossible you got bad we got there's
like impossible standards it's it's not
impossible but it's impossible to to be
constant like you know beauty and
Happiness can't be for forever if it's
only one thing you know what I mean if
it's just like it has to be this or
nothing
you're right so but but there's such a
good market there you see you sell these
books you you try this diet you do this
thing this that or the other thing and
maybe you can achieve it and when you
don't you go right back to try it it's
kind of like it's so funny because in
that using the diet analogy it's like
it's so much less sexy to be like you
can graduate
change this constant state over time
many years and practice are you gonna
market that no like a laser a button or
a switch Ellen I getting this
all the time because Ellen my partner is
she's great and she's like you know what
that's it I'm cutting out there three
months boom cutting out dairy zero dairy
three months let's go let's go let's go
and I'm like we can just try reducing
just a little week I feel like self-care
now is getting roped into that
monopolizing on now what self-care is
and becoming part of the problem that
this is the first time exactly like and
in the whole industry my yeah popular
now though like well you can't yeah go
through Instagram without seeing a quote
you can't scroll through Twitter without
seeing a funny picture about self-care
and taking care of yourself and now that
that's like humor is a way of coping
what did I guess have you guys ever read
the poem I'm not gonna read it now but
it's a great poem it's in the profit
it's called on joy and sorrow and it
talks about how the relationship with
happiness and sadness like so if we
think of happiness and sadness not about
goals to achieve but rather our
experiential states the deeper your well
of sorrow the more joy you can fill it
with so that means that when you feel
the the profound
pangs of like loneliness or existential
crisis that's because your quality of
feeling is heightened so your joy that
you feel is sweeter it's a more extreme
it's and there's a there's I guess
something to honor and that you know
yeah and I would rather navigate with my
river
yeah then feel less yeah I think that's
I remember talking to my therapist about
that I was like I don't want to be numb
I don't want to beam of and that's why I
like didn't want to go on medicine at
first and she was like that's funny
because you numb yourself all the time
every time I have like any sort of
feeling I'm like dude strange yeah this
is gonna hurt other people my feeling is
gonna be a burden to other people so I
better just not have it and like think
about it well it's easier to not feel I
remember when I was going through the
scariest most frightening of my anxiety
attacks bitch you best believe I'd
rather take a xanax
feel nothing or sleep and that's what
ended up happening I slept for four
months because I was afraid of being
awake because I was in the fear of
having a panic attack I was afraid of
the panic attacks so I would just nun
myself that's where the drinking started
getting heavy when I was in my early 20s
it's where I any form of escapism was
easier than just confronting it and that
confronting it because that sounds so
it's me it's feeling it I'm feeling it
I'm a very pro of finding the medication
that's right for you very pro that
because if your reaction and for those
of you listening on the podcast you
can't see but I'm making wavelength that
is bigger and smaller
yeah peaks and valleys if your reaction
to those extremes is to Anessa thighs
through drinking or numb it out then
what medication can do is it can make
your pink peaks and valleys something
you can experience yeah you know I found
that I'm on antidepressants and it
doesn't mean I don't still experience a
fresh depression am I like low but it
makes my ability to manage my low you've
been my reach and know that like no and
this is pretty and I don't know like for
your listeners this is pretty I guess
the singular talk so when I say my low I
mean if I'm in a depressive state and I
for me my depression manifest in
isolation and I withdraw you know I
don't I don't like get mad at people I
don't like you're like me I just rot and
I'm like perform yeah yeah I'm just like
I'm just gonna know what he's seeing how
I wanna shut the door do they don't look
at me like that was bad like - do you
know when Delon I first started dating
it was really hard for her cuz I would
just I'd be like I'm good I just uh I
just got nothing easier when you're
first dealing with feelings you're not
used to or or it's so intense that
you've never had them that certain way
it is easier to just think okay I'm the
only one that deals with this I'm gonna
figure this out this is my thing where's
like when I have talked about the job of
making air quotes craziest of my panic
attack thoughts or my craziest anxiety
thoughts how universal that has been and
how other people have been like oh you
you couldn't breathe and you thought
your body fell down your own body like i
100% felt that ever Derek when I first
moved to Los Angeles that was the first
time I ever had a panic attack I
actually have the ER slip and I wrote on
it Hannah's first panic attack I didn't
know what was happening but I put a
little footprint
I took myself hospital because I was
convinced I was having an allergic
reaction and I went through this phase
in 2012 so this was like after the
career just started something off and I
just moved to LA and I was there were
all these reasons that I was having
panic attacks for the first time in my
life and well but I thought I was
allergic to foods so I went to an
allergist and with this because I was
like no seriously my throat is closing
and the doctor was like by virtue of the
fact you're speaking
no one is not closing yeah I was like I
don't know about that chest oh yeah
you're a doctor and all but he was like
it might be your diploma like I think
you're having a panic attack and I was
like I don't
I'm nothing's wrong yeah he's like okay
and then he asked me about my trauma
history and I was like yeah life time
and then he was like well nothing's
wrong now but your body is carrying yeah
panic area and it's coming out and this
is a year later it can be your it's
Maxie out of nowhere and that's
where when I win how many times
people have said I've gone to your
taking myself to the ER like I think I
needed to go I was like I needed a
medical professional to go nothing is
wrong with you here's your EKGs here's
your blood tests if you need to come
back another time we'll run the same
test again it's offensive it's a
privileged position for sure especially
good rose on my parent's insurance but I
invited that I needed it's all someone
to tell me that I was okay but it was
also it that's like or I could realize
it I to me that would freak me out even
more if I was if I was going and I was
like I'm something's happening
in my body and I don't know what I'm
doing like I'm you know and they were
just like yeah no nothing's wrong I'd be
like well not that they gave me give you
they give you tools and to go go they
gave me had a van there yeah you're
having a pant act here take this did it
work my bag
oh it's gone what's up I feel better no
yes oh yeah it's just anxiety and again
I think I'll be 10,000
in that nothing's wrong because yes the
difference is that when you have panic
you're like I don't know what's
happening to me now I do I feel fine
they just kind of come out of nowhere
they explain to you the fight-or-flight
response like your body's way of the way
that it produces adrenaline there is a
science behind it and I'm one who kind
of likes to read about things I'm scared
us understand it better I know many
people it's triggering but for me I'm
like the more I understand it the more
I'm less afraid doctor I always act at
all times because we're all the same we
hire doctors - yeah and I'll just be
like Hannah is this wrong here is this
normal Mike keeps doing this what do I
do
I'm a doctor repeat your veterinarian
literally just everything that you've
ever dealt with sciatica well in this
room I heard you oh I gotta go okay wait
could you do could you back you back
sure today yeah oh right you want that
way that's not really thank you for the
treasure have you learned all the like
meridians and no oh okay
Kate has to sign a waiver no I'm
learning so I got a book I'm learning
I'm in the process of learning I've got
a book I'm teaching myself acupuncture
because I've gone to acupuncture number
times and I've had some success with
self-practice at home and Ella has a lot
of sinus problems and so I've been I can
comfortably do her sinuses and then I've
also started doing acne hormonal acne no
my mother god girl it's like you
were listening to my podcast the guys
are annoyed by my okay I say my cat and
I think it really bothers her I see my
cat your cat it bothers your cat to be
like No
birth control about six months ago and
all of a sudden this acne I never had
acne in my life not even so much is like
a bad break out and now it's
quick where do I put the needles yeah I
love acupuncture it's it's well so we'll
talk about that offline because I don't
know anybody doing this oh good complain
you guys the podcast where I up so
you don't have yeah exactly she can
up her own advice that she got from some
mysterious person yeah but I get
hormonal acne on my neck and jaw and it
doesn't bother me so it doesn't mean you
sure it comes up once a month one week a
month I have acne I have it constantly I
just have it cut your skin if says
you're crazy why are we crazy
wow I was using like all of these really
look expensive products and then I ran
out and I was just like okay I'll just
use my Neutrogena and regular Neutrogena
and it started working and then I've
only been putting like a low on like the
actual soft tough field you know he got
to talk to hello and then I did the tea
tree oil lotion oh my god did you guys
really the whole skin talk tonight at
Reza's my little sister Maggie fares the
best she was using salicylic acid based
treatments and a son as soon as she
stopped and switched to benzo wit yeah
Ben's except like that benzoyl product
so it's different yeah it's different
like people with severe acne will
usually be prescribed a benzoyl peroxide
first and it can it can make your skin
I was allergic to my acne medication
yeah you're gonna know yeah you have to
go to the right dermatologist too they
just did a video here about it and when
they when they test like sometimes it
can be like bacterial mm-hmm and it's it
just so happens that your skin is just
more susceptible to that not that you're
not like washing your skin and then
other if it's like bigger act like
bigger pimples and like really painful
ones it's more assistive and they have
to treat that more topically that's
something I've had to be respectful
about because both Ella and Maggie had
cystic acne really bad
so for me again being like I don't care
about my little zits
yeah I've had I have one sistex it if
those you're listening and watching
cystic acne is to acne that built under
the skin yeah it's like more like
inflamed it's that hard yeah I had a
cystic is it like a couple weeks ago a
month couple months ago and it was like
the first hit ever had and I was like
how I had that all over my face yeah
this is why I forgot when I start to
seize it because I didn't want to go
back to that now that this hurts and
she's like oh I didn't know but
seriously like I was dismissing this
experience that other people were having
with their skin because I was being an
asshole I didn't know well I don't
it affects people and they're always the
same way that like you know you could
have perfect skin your whole life and
then you hit a certain age and it comes
out or life and environmental changes
caused that to come out the same way
with like not trying to wrap this back
to anxiety but like when you're I mean I
was gonna ask your episodes have theme
yeah we kind of take the most clicked
baby thing out so like I think Grace's
was blowjobs grace helped I told one Oh
themes that happen after you shoot yeah
yeah yes we don't go ahead and you just
chop no no we does not but I did want to
circle back because you were talking
about being on medication and I was
thinking wow I was on medication for ten
years of my life and this is now that
yes yeah but how are you 27 I started
when I was 17 my first you're not even
fully formed immediately and now I'm off
of it but I do truly think I needed it
during those times when I did need it
and now I know that's always an option
and god is it hell to figure out what
medication sorry can be hell for me
let's figure out what expand occasion
whether it is hard it's excessive yeah
and yeah but when I we got it changes
gene side
gene you Jane say you guys not
know my gene type it says it's you guys
don't know it does mother but yeah
there's a certain type of swab test
again but if you'll say expensive unless
you happen to be on Medicaid or Medicare
and they'll cover it because and I think
this is up the government wants
to save itself money so gene site is a
swab test you can take that will tell
you what medications are processed by
your body for instance I was on
350 300 milligrams of wellbutrin mm-hmm
which was double-digit so anyway here's
here let me explain how it works more
you do a swab test and it comes back
results and the results in different
categories of antipsychotics
anti-anxiety and - depression etc tell
you the medications put them into it put
some medications into three groups
not effective meaning you will not feel
anything your body cannot process it you
might only feel the side-effects
you might only feel like though of like
weight gain or pee all the time or
whatever but you're not gonna feel the
results not effective middle one is
moderate effect meaning you might have
to take double the dose of the
medication to feel anything from it and
the last one is use as prescribed which
means it works and says what it's going
to do good so the web you trained for me
was in the middle category the moderate
effect which is why I was teaching
taking such a high dose of this thing to
get such a marginal effect right I
switched to Zoloft which is in my users
prescribed category I'm on fifty
milligrams are you kidding yeah
gene site genes say our insight talk to
your doctors about it now is the thing
Hannah really is doctor thanks Pharma
doesn't want us to know this is my god
okay it's serious I got all your ladies
I don't know what what's the best I
can't get through one day without talk
about big pharma my mind conserved my
mom so she my mom is my mom is mentally
disabled she has schizophrenia it's
debilitating etc or she has
schizoaffective disorder major
depressive disorder etcetera etcetera
anyway medical Medicare which are the
government disability programs that give
you insurance they they cover it because
they don't want to spend time Wow paying
all this money a month they want to
figure out what's the most effective
thing so my mom's Jean site was free
covering medical event care my cost
$3,000 $3,000 also that's insane that
this gene whatever it's called
knows how expensive it is why why how do
we how do we make it less expensive less
out of pocket well you have to pay the
insurance money in insurance companies
more money than pharmaceutical companies
pay them oh wait we can't Big Pharma
it's also it's like
it's it's like a control thing - it
feels like look I'll get the money where
I can get the money and that's it I feel
like that's we might be able to give
away like like free products and whatnot
and it's like so you can you can lower
the price of the-- you know what i mean
like a lot of guys are super in flip and
i also think that it pays like
depression and or like mental illness
makes more money than people who are oh
my anything as you said like about the
beauty industry
yeah it's that we create these standards
of happiness create these standards cody
and then we spend money trying to
achieve them yeah and perpetually
dissatisfying the spiritual hunger that
we all have for a purpose in life but i
will give some credit that it is very
difficult to nationalize approvals for
food and drug regulation for all bodies
cuz all of our bodies are different
right and so they're trying I believe if
I'm trying if I'm if I give them credit
maybe in their heart of hearts they're
trying to find baseline thanks largest
common denominators and apply them to
everyone but we're all as unique as our
fingerprints like biochemically right
yeah so that's the one thing I will say
is that it must be very difficult but I
also don't think they should just credit
any knife holder back cuz it's really
effective dude yo Ella and I almost
poisoned ourselves the other day so you
know st. John's work yeah st. John's
worry it's a royal antidepressant but
you can take it it's like a picture or
whatever but it's a mood elevator and
it's herbal etc and it's like you cut
what I know what the story is going ok
so just st. John's wort um we were like
oh we should try this maybe this will be
good maybe we can you know do this
instead of taking more Zoloft 1 my
period comes a lot and I was like are
you sure you can take this with medicine
you're on I'm like we just bought this
at sprouts like no I've read it about no
warnings on or whatever it says not
approved by the FDA it's st. John's work
what could the harm be so like mix it
into like a little water and I drink it
Ella looks up online she says mmm
maybe you should call your doctor I was
like why and she's like it says don't
make st. John's wort and zoloft it may
cause death Oh No
John's work it's such a legit effective
thing it actually has an effect with
Medicaid with a prescribed
antidepressants I believe it yeah
 believe it
I call my I texted with my psyche and I
was like hey I just had 30 jaundice
drops at st. John's work am I gonna die
he was like mmm did today for the first
time and I'm again he's like just don't
do it again oh my god because it's not
like I was putting it in my system right
three times a day but shouldn't they
have written that on the bottle I'm like
hey fYI this actually does work
it's not a placebo I have anything
that's not a probably a the same thing
with CBD oil it's it's a technically
considered cannabis because when you
ingest it it fires off the cannabinoid
receptors in your brain even though
you're annoyed sounds like a little bit
like a weed robot girl little bud they
had they don't have to label on it that
you know certain people's cannabinoid
receptors can ingest cv which has zero -
you've seen it and you can feel the
effects of being high that's what
happens to me when I don't a lot of
people a lot of night good night good
yeah I know Simon I had like terrible
cramps I was like can I have some I put
some what oh my god I put like maybe too
much and under my tongue and then I was
like - did it today go into therapy then
I was like uh-oh pull over
oh man especially if you're on a certain
antidepressants when you're SS when your
receptors or whatever are open so like
that's how Isis our eyes work as they
allow you to receive more bah blah blah
anyway all important all of our Norton
googly eye even stern it increases the
effect of yes soul I can exacerbate like
if you're on a to the presence and you
drink it makes it like one drinks now
feels like to drink yeah and that is
where I miss are you guy here we were
like maybe we should say some of Kate's
story from today to go enhance because
you know not now I'm not I was
over in the middle of tonight last night
last night yeah over in the middle of
the night from yeah I said really no
because I was a daydream I can't
daydream either
I can't a drink cause the table for me
it was bigge stop the table didn't I
have to make a decision
I can't danger cuz I'm like well this is
ruined my day yeah and then you have a
hangover like yeah yeah I fell asleep at
8:00 and then I woke up at 2:00 and I
was like I guess I'm just up now but and
then I was like hungover and I just like
leave so much water by the fact that my
boyfriend taught me about chugging water
before you at bed your body can only I
don't want to say in jest cuz that's not
the right word but your body can only
process 9 ounces of water per hour so if
you try and wait til the end of the
night to chug all your water I don't
know what this looks like I'm sucking
your dick chug all your watch you big
honey enjoy water what are you holding
my breath is it this I know sorry
but so if you try and wait to the end of
the night to do the Pedialyte chug or
the water chug and it won't work cuz you
I can only handle 9 ounces 1 1 2 1 1 2 1
1 train you got water yep all I'm saying
is that when I was I was telling Kelsey
earlier long story short I got nervous
to be in a big group of people's and I
think I just needed to be like in a more
intimate setting with people who were
like hmm feel like I could have said
like I'm unhappy right now I just want
like a friend yes I was in a big group
so and I kept being like no you should
just have fun everyone else is just
putting their emotions aside just having
fun so instead of doing that I was too
nervous to then which is weird like the
eating disorder will come back in weird
ways I was too nervous to eat in front
of Enya and then I I just started
drinking and then and then it was like
nope I'll avoid the little vulnerable
part that I needed someone to yeah and I
wasn't asking for so instead I just
turned into performer mode when you're
too drunk yeah it's like it's obnoxious
I might have not been enough as it might
you might be thinking it was obnoxious
because well if what matters is how the
experience was for you yeah right so
we're not looking at this to what other
people think of other people look at you
it's like you were like man I needed to
take care of his vulnerable part of me
and I tried to numb it out yeah and then
I woke up at 2:00 a.m. huh
yeah yeah it sucks I just yeah it's like
day drinking is such a alcohol so
readily available as our like anesthetic
of choice and it's available in every
social situation and it's it's hard to
honor yourself and it's hard to take
care of yourself when there's such an
easy out
eventually when ideally socially who
looked out yeah it doesn't you know it
delays yeah you're right your
hundred-percent like you're feeling
didn't disappear it's no no later now
