solid work it's clap it up a little bit
now we're going to do now I'm going to
jump into a little slideshow showcasing
the top performing ads we had this
quarter let's see we can apply this
moving forward let's take a look this
one one of my absolute favorites once
again outstanding use of cleavage really
selling that Coke Zero just a great use
of breasts
what an organic perfectly natural choice
or you want to take us through what went
through your mind making this yeah I
just tried to combine the most organic
things I could think of boobs or Gerson
coke syrup
innovative
it's another one from Davis ever tell us
a little bit about your thought process
going into this when I got tasked with
this project I immediately thought let's
flip the script
you know let's change the game so
naturally I thought we need to go with
luscious thick locks but what about
breasts
Bobby I think this was you on this what
I love most about the ad is the way it
draws your eye right to the beer the
breasts the beer the composition genius
yeah I mean this ad in my opinion
epitomizes what the American people want
breasts
you're the next slide please once again
an amazing use of breasts I want to see
this ad everywhere and I did it's in
Time Square right now because it's
beautiful was this you Annie
yeah how standing that is what I call a
successful quarter all right let's make
the next one even better what do you say
let's get some lunch cannot believe that
she's doing this in public</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
