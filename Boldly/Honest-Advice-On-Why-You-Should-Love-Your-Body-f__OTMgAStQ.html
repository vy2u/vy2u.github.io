much as you think eat what you want no
one cares
someone finding you unattractive isn't
going to stop you from being beautiful
every time you look in a mirror list off
things you see that you love not what
you hate positive self-talk goes a long
way except the things you cannot change
and change the things you can it's
really up to you doesn't matter if
you're tall short chubby or thin curvy
or flat if you manage to see all the
beauty in yourself other people will see
it too nobody notices the same things
that you hate on your body seriously
what you hate someone wishes they had
ignore the media and most men completely
stop trying to fit your body into
someone else's standards because if you
do then you'll be living their life and
not yours your body is the home to the
soul cherish it and be proud of it
learn to love yourself other people
won't do it for you there's always
someone who'd be overjoyed to sleep with
you that's always an ego boost
your body is strong and beautiful love
the body you have because it is
beautiful and has done so much remember
you are more important than a pair of
pants
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
