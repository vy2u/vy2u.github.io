what this sucks oh yeah you know bars
are the worst who came up with the idea
bars anyway all right our research is
showing that people need a new place to
meet other people does anyone have any
ideas well yeah the church that's been
done before how about this a large room
where they can drink alcohol just a big
place where they bring their liquor and
drink where's the profit in that no no
we would sell them the liquor for like
way too much like 16 dollars a pint oh
you're serious
and we can charge a cover fee like
something ridiculous like ten dollars
and that's the thing they'd have to pay
to get into the place and we'll just
call the place like a bar or whatever
you're telling me we just buy this bar
and then pay to keep the electricity on
no lights off we keep it as dark as
possible
to save on power and that way they won't
see how dirty the place is because it
will be oh it's gonna be filthy look
you're not gonna attract quality people
to a dark filthy room see that's the
beauty of it there wouldn't be anyone
there that you would want to be with it
would just be a bunch of sloppy
alcoholics and douchebags we don't have
to pay for an AC we just fill it with
people with way too much money and not
enough self-respect you're telling me
people will pay $10 to pay $60 for a
drink to get drunk in a hot dark
disgusting room full of drunk douchebags
absolutely how because of the small
glimmer of hope that they all get laid
we're gonna be rich
