you are just feeling your oats it's a
dating app but it's more of a hook-up
app people use the profile part of it to
say what they are attracted to or
sometimes with they're not attracted to
simple preference like they don't like
black people no Asians no Latin for
people who are fat no friends no
hamsters I saw that once I was very
confused any of those little things I'm
not racist what's a sexual preference
when I hear preference I think you know
I'd prefer this salad over this pasta
that I would have doesn't really mean
that you hate something just means that
you favor something else the weird part
is that a lot of those profiles do end
up messaging me like asking me if I'm
hung someone sent me a message but then
they didn't look at my profile picture
until later and then they found out I
was black I think I didn't have a like a
picture it was still loading and I was
brave enough to message someone and then
I sent them my photo and their response
was ouch and I just told them yes like
every man of my race we are ten foot
long we wrap our penises around our legs
it helps us with our fast running and
long jumping me and my best friend we
like laugh about it now but I just
remember the moment how much it hurt and
how embarrassed I felt and how small I
felt he said that I should have known
that in words like you don't know how to
measure maybe you should go back to
second grade so no your family never
graduated high school I think it's okay
for you to say what you're into and what
you're attracted to but you don't need
to say what you're not attracted to I
could be into black people more that I
could be into white people but that
doesn't mean that I'm going to
disqualify all white people from you
know coming at me and you know saying
hey for a community that has fought so
hard for equal rights there is still a
lot of discrimination that goes on
girl you're holding yourself back why
are you holding yourself back there's so
many like people different flavors
tastes textures out there a lot of the
times we're attracted to what we see in
the media always that white man with the
six-pack abs and that gives people that
idea that that that's the person was
supposed to be here that's pretty much
opposed to be attracted to taste the
rainbow the full extent of it
