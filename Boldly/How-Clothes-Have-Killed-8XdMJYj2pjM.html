pain but what about beauty is death
beginning in the 1730's and through the
19th century mercury was used in men's
felt hats think top hats the mercury was
brushed on - rabbit fur to help it form
that felt feeling but big problem
mercury is toxic
hella toxic its literal poison sadly the
most common victims with a hat makers
themselves since the lining luckily
protected the hat wearers if he didn't
die mercury had some other lovely side
effects paranoia
tremors and tooth decay - name with you
ever heard the phrase mad as a hatter
and yeah now you get it a snake was once
used to dye dresses stockings and
artificial flowers a brilliant green
product sadly as with the Hatter's the
people died in the garments were often
the most affected in 1861 19 year-old
Matilda Shira who made artificial
flowers died in spectacular fashion from
arsenic poison she began to convulse
vomiting green bile not only had the
arsenic reached her lungs and liver and
stomach but her fingernails and whites
of her eyes turned green you've seen a
hoop skirt pink Scarlett O'Hara hoop
skirts were large stiff garments
expanded by in you've guessed it
oops it seems glamorous but for some it
was downright deadly in the summer of
1865 a young woman named Cape Tagore was
arriving home one night and stepping
down from her carriage suddenly the
horses became spooked and started to run
at full speed down the street poor Kate
skirt got caught in the runaway carriage
and she was dragged two miles to her
death before anyone could stop the
horses when 42 year-old Mary Halliday of
Niagara Falls mysteriously died in 1903
no one could figure out why she was
relatively young and healthy
finally an autopsy revealed the cause of
death two pieces of corset steel had
pierced her calves doctors couldn't
figure out how long we still have been
in her body or how they had got there
and she's floating
stabbed herself but someone used the
steel to murder her
no one ever found out the hobble skirt
was popular in the early 20th century
and was named for the way its tightness
near the ankles caused women to well
bubble as you can guess from the mere
name of this fashion item it turned out
to be a really bad idea not only did it
literally hobble women but it also
caused several deaths like that of
18-year old I did go out in 1910 Ida was
walking across a bridge when her hobble
skirt course had a stumble she teated
losing her balance and plunging over the
bridge to her death scarves are elegant
chic and sometimes fatal in 1971 a young
woman was wearing a long scarf while on
a ski holiday she jumped on a ski turf
to head up the mountain when a passing
chair caught her scarf she was ripped
from her seat and strangled to death
hanging from the moving ski lift these
deadly outfits give a whole new meaning
to the phrase fashion victim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
