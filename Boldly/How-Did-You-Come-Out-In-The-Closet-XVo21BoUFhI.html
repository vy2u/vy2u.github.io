tianjin dam dam gent engine
chitty-chitty Jen Jen everybody happy
coming out day coming out day is a
wonderful day where we celebrate people
coming out of their shells so coming out
can encompass all different types of
things doesn't necessarily have to mean
your sexual orientation it can mean your
gender identity it can mean types of
relationships like you can't your
romantic style your any of all this
stuff this is a space where you can come
you can watch you can hear about things
and then you can talk in the comments
and talk about your stuff and tweeted us
and it'll be a good time we have a very
special guest today talk about coming
out good friend of the show Kenya is
here come here tan come on in crawl in
through the side door of the closet
everybody how you doing hey mate yeah we
might have to be thigh defy a little bit
you know how tall you are in centimeters
yeah like about 185 centimeters I'm
pretty sure about this debate hey my
name is 10 I'm Australian gay and so
excited to be here today happy coming
out day awesome
what pronouns you use Shane her is my
elbow on your knee okay like this yes
about that that's okay okay quick
question lightning round
how long have you been gay ever since I
can remember which is you know going
back to being like to me when I was
about 14 15 I was in love with my best
friend we were kind of together kind of
kept it on the DL because we went to a
really strict school we even had like
boyfriends on the side but we beer
Spears
if you had a boyfriend to you but he
wasn't a beard you were just you know I
was just dating I also had a boyfriend
he also wasn't a beard but he also
wasn't really a boyfriend yeah that yeah
a socket so let's talk a little bit
about coming out there was one time like
I had a hickey on my neck and my mum
asked what's that from and I was like Oh
from Natalie and she kind of was taking
him back it was maybe like a few months
after that where she asked me whether I
was gay and I just said yes and I was
probably about 16 or so and she reacted
really really
badly to that her and I are fine now but
back then she completely lost it and it
was really quite a sad scary time for me
to be completely honest
she said everything under the Sun that
you you hear about all you watch movies
about right and we've actually had some
family members completely disowned all
of us as a collective immediate family
so I feel like if you're not going to
love me for who I am then I can't give
you the same yeah love so I'm actually
at a place in my life right now where I
feel really good so you and your mom are
at an okay place right now though yeah
we're pretty tight now and I honestly
never thought this day would come
they were like years where we didn't we
didn't speak at all what was your what's
your story
I realized when I was really young I was
gay and then I was had a very tortured
sad depression II period of time there
are some people that I told cuz it felt
natural and some people I told because I
felt like they forced it out of me it
wasn't until I got a little bit older
that I was actually really comfortable
being out I mean I don't know Nicki like
what your story I probably like came to
the realization when I was like 13 or 14
I only came out to my family last year
after the Supreme Court ruling but
something that kind of made me wait that
long
like if my family knows they have to
come out for me every time they talk to
their friends that is like very nice
that you were like thinking about other
people well because like my family being
Asian has something to do with it right
that's the thing I was going to say we
all have different family values it
comes down to culture comes down a
tradition religion there's so many
factors as for me I was just like this
rebellious asshole teenager who just
didn't give tips tips tips nipple yep I
have tips for coming out yes from tan
tips from teen wait and see that tips
from 10.com had coming out is very
different for everyone
for some people it's incredibly
dangerous and I wouldn't recommend it
and for others it's a walk in the park
I think only you know whether it's safe
or not and if your gut is saying not yet
or not at all
go with that there's no one way to live
or come out online resources are really
handy youth forums going to like LGBT IQ
groups if you can and realizing that
you're not alone
we literally have all gone through this
it takes a lot of courage but you will
get there for people that want some
links to places where they can find
information or community we've included
some links in the description of this
video so you can check some of those out
and hopefully get some answers or even
some friendship ah friendship now we're
going to play a little game that I think
Nikki made up but we're here too for it
and make it up oh and Tim Tam slam hey
yes Tim slams ten times a quintessential
Australian biscuit you're in for a treat
are you ready yeah yes a Tim Tam slam is
when you bite the corners off the Tim
Tam like diagonally and you suck through
like a hot tea coffee hot chocolate and
so it melts the inside it becomes this
really silky smooth chocolaty goodness
and then you just shove it all in your
mouth what's wrong so we now have hot
chocolate I'm so excited for you are you
yeah just whoa yeah got it
ten turns yeah I had a girl call me Tim
tan once because I bought her a box of
Tim Tams as a gift did it work out yes
ah so you bite the corners okay get your
hottie cheers Cheers
away
and then here whoa muffin
whoa YUM again again did you just lose
it
