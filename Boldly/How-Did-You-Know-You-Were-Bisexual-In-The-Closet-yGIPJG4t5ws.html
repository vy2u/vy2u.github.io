first guest is Jordan a lovely young
woman who is also my friend despite what

yeah okay right yeah hey big ladies big
dreams big old ladies hey Jordan what is
the topic of today uh being by identify
as a bisexual and or queer person my
preferred pronouns are she and her I am
a lesbian and my preferred pronouns are
also she and her I would define
bisexuality as being attracted to both
your gender and other Jen I guess it
would be hard to define for everybody
when you're just one person were often
seen as not gay enough for the LGBT
community but also not straight enough
for the straight how did you know that
you were bi in high school my friend was
like I think I liked you and then I was
like oh that's interesting I think I
might like you too and then we dated
he's a woman and yeah my friend was a
woman or a young girl at that I guess
yeah then I dated some guys and then I
dated some girls and I was just kind of
like hey it's pretty cool I'll just keep
doing this thing how did you know that
you were a lesbian
I was like in a car with my mom and I
was thinking to myself what if I was gay
and then all of a sudden as soon as I
had that thought there was a cold like
chill and then that just was like would
you have a boyfriend right now I
currently have a boyfriend yes a lot of
people kind of just assume I'm straight
well like if you marry a guy are you
still by what being a bisexual woman in
a heteros
relationship kind of makes me not gay
enough like if someone tells you who
they are believe them
Yeah right as a bisexual woman how do
you use the word gay and how does it
feel comfortable to use the word gay
I think I'm fully comfortable like using
it to describe myself and be like oh I'm
a little gay or what are we talking okay
all right so we've been chatting and now
it's time to play a little game I like
to call truther gay which means I ask
you a question
and you tell me the truth or I make you
do something gay truth or gay truth if
you had to be nice to me for 30 minutes
what would you do I would spend 30
minutes going to the store
um and like buying you a pizza or
something and I bring it back in my 30
minutes be over so nice truth or gay
okay the gay thing is just doing
something to a gay person yeah give me a
little makeover that's the gay thing you
gotta do yes truth are gay truth truth

day or hang out with Nicky all day

to hang out with me and Nicky all day I
