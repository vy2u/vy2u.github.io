guys are like in a corner kissing yes
i'm Hampi you're not gonna slow them you
know you're not gonna let down like a
conscious decision that gets me I'm on
board right away when I first meet
someone and if I'm attracted to them yes
I'll want to have sex with them very
quickly but um once I get to know them
personality goes a long way they're all
ready I'm ready I mean let's just call a
spade a spade I'm not gonna like try to
have sex with someone on the first date
if we're like at their parents barbecue
you know if I meet her at a bar at like
11 o'clock at night and we're both drunk
I might try to have sex the first night
I feel like I know if I want to have sex
with someone within five minutes of
meeting you to this point where you
start to be able to recognize the
difference between people you want to
hang out with and people you won't have
sex with which for many years for most
people I think is sort of a hazy gray
area somebody can be super attractive
and if they're if they annoy me that
just makes them so unattractive to me
and she hasn't seen Stowers yet let's
get through that and if she enjoys it
then you know we'll do the damn thing
it's crazy how you can be so physically
attracted to someone then they just like
have some viewpoint that is so wrong
that you like lose all interest in sex
with them which in theory should just be
a purely physical thing I'm really into
a guy I think I want to take it take it
slow and kind of like you know get to
know them yeah their parents and
personality how much you like them
definitely factors in I mean the more
you like someone probably like a short
amount of time you want it to be but the
longer it's gonna take it's not going
well but I'm physically attracted I'm
like uh yeah I think it's when you get
that like feeling in your stomach or
you're like oh
this is going to be a lot of fun the
sexual you better if you have a better
connection with that person and so like
it is better to wait sometimes see a
future I'll take my time with it but
obviously one of those Netflix and chill
nights are gonna pop up in a 2-3 month
span so I let it go from there if
activity like bowling seems more
interesting than having sex with this
person that's a clear sign you should
probably lace up the shoes and go
bowling you know I want to have sex all
the time
first date third date 51st hour I'm like
yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
