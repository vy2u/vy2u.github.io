important but we don't hear a lot about
how people ask for consent so we're here
today in Hollywood trying to figure out
how people ask for consent do you think
consents important yes very important
depends on what it is but yes yes yes
yeah yeah yeah why because I think
people need permission to move on
because you're allowing it to happen if
not then it's it feels inappropriate in
a sense no means no and that's pretty
important I think know is pretty
important because a lot you're taking
advantage of someone doing something
that I don't want so how would you ask
for consent can you show me how you
would ask for consent it depends on the
situation that I do not know what this
sure that's a tricky one yeah cuz I
reckon it can be implied as well I've
never been in that situation honestly to
ask as far as that it's kind of just
happen can I touch you I would formally
have to ask if they would want to do the
certain thing that they want to do are
you comfortable
can I touch your Weiner so would you
ever verbally ask for it do you think
that's important having it's important
but I don't hang it why anyone would do
it really why not
I mean it's kind of just like one of
those things if you click with something
or someone something's gonna like lead
to another thing and it's just like okay
we're here if I want it then I'm gonna
let it happen but if not I'm gonna say
no ask who's not a bad thing very true
so most people agree consent is
important but when it comes to thinking
about how to ask for consent people
didn't really know what to say
how would you ask for consent we're not
kids anymore like we know what's gonna
lead to and we go home with someone what
sex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
