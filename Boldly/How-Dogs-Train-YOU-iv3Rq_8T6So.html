training your owner when your owner has
food it's important to promptly remind
them to fix you a snack this can be
accomplished by sitting near them and
projecting calm assertive energy it's
crucial to hold eye contact with your
owner until he or she shares a snack
there you go excellent work the outdoors
can often be an overwhelming place for
your own it's important that you keep it
tight leash and if they are not walking
to the park
gently guide them to the appropriate
destination welcome to the park we've
all been there you have an itch
and you need your owner to scratch it no
problem simply roll over on your back to
get their attention and say goodbye to
that pesky itch that's the spot
many honors can be tinted at the park
this is easily curable they find it the
filthiest ball and drop it at your
owners feet they'll be playing fetch in
no time
has your owner forgotten to refill the
water bowl again you can fix that in one
easy step using your front paw
repeatedly tap the ball and your own
are' promptly respond with more water as
with water owners often need a firm
reminder about dinner service use a
verbal command of your choice to let
your owner know it's time for food
mm-hmm enjoy your dinner
if all else fails give them a deep stare
as if you're staring through them as if
you're staring inside of them as if
you're seeing both the past present and
future they will do anything you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
