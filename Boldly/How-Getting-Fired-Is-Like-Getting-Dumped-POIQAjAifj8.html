old days and all the friends you'll
probably never see you again you start
thinking how did it get this bad I don't
let this happen well maybe gonna last
out a couple of their jokes you thought
you can act anyway you wanted to and get
away with like they needed you more than
you needed them if you stop caring like
you can walk all over them and they just
take it oh no

perfect no cracks no whistles nothing

tan you should actually buy it you get
out there and try it again

you're not thinking this position you
get used to rejection I just want like
you like a lot of rejection you find a
rebound and figure out is just easier to
settle

accomplished at the end of the day which
is great for change

something um I just wanted a six inch
turkey on wheat of course I should have
