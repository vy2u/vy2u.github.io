dish and they're like the disease the
pestilence it's here I would believe
them the thing is that I tend to replace
the most often are anything that I use
around my eyes but anything else I
typically keep it for as long as
possible
here's the thing good makeup is
expensive with lipstick and mascara
specifically I paid a good penny for
this I can't just throw it away after
three to six months I have a lot of
liquid lipsticks I don't really know
anyone that like with places and
lipsticks before they're out I don't
think that's a thing I clean my makeup
brushes definitely once a month I deep
clean is Russia's lipsticks melted on
the brush but it's clean I promise you
this is clean I'm interested to know
like what hides inside of these liquid
lipsticks oh god I just realized what I
set myself up for I think after people
spend a lot of money on these makeup
products they probably don't want to
throw them away so that's probably one
reason that there's an accumulation of
these bacteria that are building up on
the powders of the brushes we use swabs
to swab the surface and then apply that
to the bacterial please in some cases we
were able to apply the brushes or
mascara directly to key bacterial plates
so we actually found two different types
of staff we also found bacteria that can
cause gastrointestinal problems in
diarrhea bacteria that also are
associated with strep throat UTI
infections even meningitis all right oh
no oh no oh no what is it
Wow
this is gross this thing looks
disgusting okay please tell me that
mine's not the worst it was mine was the
worst one thing that I have control of
in my life is the cleanliness of my
makeup products take that bacteria I'm
very shocked by the diseases like staff
is pretty alarming I wasn't expecting
that
this is staph infection what is my life
what am i doing with myself so
thankfully this like crusty germ like
pool is apparently normal so I'm happy
but I'm like if this is normal
what is the nasty stuff I really thought
that with the past two years I was
pulling it together and then I see this
 and I just realized that I'm I'm
nowhere near becoming a successful adult
I have been slipping on watching my
brushes and maybe I'll try to watch them
every week but again life comes at you
fast so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
