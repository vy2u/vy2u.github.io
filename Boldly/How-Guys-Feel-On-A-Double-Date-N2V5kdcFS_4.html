something stuck in your teeth just short
ribs
do they give us more bread and what's
that like even though we're done eating
I don't know do you think they'd give us
more they don't normally bring bread

mistake

you didn't I was looking that way okay
so I'm coming back from lunch the other

man who's not wearing a shirt he's no
fool but God working fire you sit down
they put a whole fresh French leg up on
a wall and of course it's Kurt again
ways it's the same Kurt that leaves his
stuff in the microwave oh my god such a
jerk Kurt I'm the Kurt that asked you to
lunch your first day that's all we'd
like Kurt I mean we did but he turned
out to be a total creep
oh okay but for the record I know her
kitchen kind always liked Kurt I'm not
in one anymore

tweet about Tim Allen I should find it
