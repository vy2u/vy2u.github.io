rollercoaster that you just learn to
enjoy the ride
hello hello
Freddie Here I am coming to you from
Lady light you may have seen some of our
recent fits that include within
furniture modeling with Miss J and
wearing Juicy Couture sweat suits like
it's 2005 so I'm gonna be talking about
that today along with a lot of other
questions that you all submitted on my
Instagram first we're gonna start with
hair my hair routine actually started
last night so let's rewind and I'll show
you a little bit about what I do at
night okay I'm back so it's as my shower
she cooed my hair with this gap really
Union's shampoo line really like it it's
opaque free it smells amazing diva curl
one condition I love this conditioner I
like it because it's really fit and it
lasts throughout the entire week this is
my hair this is what's going on just get
into it
usually when I know I'm thinking about
first thing in the morning I'll do my
part video way
Carol's kind of just rushed through it
all right this is my first twist I kind
of just detangle as I go with my fingers
I try not to use combs too much when I'm
not parting for moisturizing i go in
with real ass hookers oil so I'm taking
coconut oil and just going through each
section now I'm just going to go ahead
and flat this
I'd go I'll usually pin down each twist
to kind of keep it down and keep it from
shrinking I think it is so real and I
feel like that's the case for a lot of
natural hair girls I did it when I still
see my hearing
step number 463 good night y'all alright
y'all I'm actually still exhausted from
having to do my hair last night it took
about two hours maybe two hours 15
minutes for me to do it so this is how I
wore my hair today I'm just gonna go
ahead and take out my twist and show you
all how I style it so before I get
started on twisting my hair I'm gonna
answer one of your questions new noodles
asks how long does your typical beauty
routine take during the week if I'm
doing the whole face like anyway we'll
go on camera it probably takes me about
15-20 minutes to do my makeup if it's
like the weekend and I'm really trying
to go in with my makeup it'll probably
take me about 35 to 40 minutes let's get
started on twisting my hair sometimes if
I'm really trying to be careful when i
untie
I'll have coconut oil like on my
fingertips to make sure that it reduces
the frizz and the amount of frizz is
sort of based on my mood sometimes I
want my fro to be really big other times
I'll want my curls to stay more defined
and just naturally get bigger throughout
the week what I do to make sure the
curls still stay defined but also my fro
looks as big as possible is I'll take
the afro pick and I will just pick out
my hair from the root so I'll let go
deep within and just like pull it out
pull it out pull it out pull it out G
writes asked me what is your go-to
hairstyle I would say this is a pretty
typical go-to hairstyle for me I
personally think my hair looks the
cutest when it's in like a topknot bun
or when it's back some way girl like
Hughes asked me what are my inspirations
for hairstyles and I would say that on
YouTube I watch a lot of natural 85 she
has a lot of really good updos for
natural hair also y'all know who I'm
gonna say Tracee Ellis Ross
I don't even explain that one so a
well-thought-out mess asked me what gel
and technique do you use in your hair to
get those amazing slicked buns thank you
a well-thought-out mess I take pride in
having very slick buttons both sets I
use this design essentials natural honey
and Shea edge tamer is a big difference
between gel and edge chamber edge tamer
is much thicker than gel and that's what
I use for my baby hair
quick technique on how I'll usually
slick them usually I'll use a toothbrush
but I'm using a bit of a bigger brush
today and then I'll take this rat tooth
comb and just kind of like separate them
this is just kind of what I've learned
with trial and error and what works for
me would not be doing this the night
before a pool party but you know I love
y'all I'm also not going to the pool I'm
going to the office now that we are done
with my hair let's move on to skin Cici
Johansson I hope I'm pronouncing your
name right ask as a fellow dry skin
person I'm wondering about your routine
/ products to use for that I was put on
to this moisturizer that also doubles as
a makeup primer I was put on to it from
my friend Ariel Amira who is a makeup
artist he just used this on my face one
day and I was like what in tarnation is
this moisturizer next this is for sure a
summertime moisturizer / body radiance
situation that I like to use it is
bronzy AF it doesn't withstand the pool
water but it's nice to get Instagram
pics and now I really like this
Neutrogena sport face SPF I actually
recently just learned that anything
above 50 is like not really doing
anything and this is 70 plus so yeah so
I'm finished with my skin routine this
is honestly everything that I do on a
day where I know I'm gonna be getting in
the pool before I go figure out what I'm
gonna wear I'm gonna answer a couple
more questions Kate not hate asked me
what is your favorite easy summer snack
that is very easy to answer
cheese it I love cheese's like any
iteration of cheese I'm here for it and
then I got asked what my favorite summer
jam is like my favorite music to get
ready to or just thing to get me in a
summer mood and it's honestly just
anything Frank Ocean his album channel
orange specifically now I'm gonna go to
the bathroom to moisturize the rest of
my body I'm going to start with just
this cocoa butter Palmer's formula
y'all know cocoa butter is thick and so
am i and I'm just kidding I'm not big
while I do this I'm gonna talk about my
two outfit options that I would normally
wear to a pool shhhhh ending this option
is like more of a chill cool vibe
thing I was just where to pool with some
friends I got from SC this is one of my
favorite bikinis I got it this summer I
don't know I love high-waisted I rarely
reveal the belly button these are thrift
these are really cute fun like fringe
even shorts that I got this one is more
of like oh I got an invitation in my
inbox we're having a pool party this is
an RSVP outfit I love this bikini top so
this was from a suggested site on
Facebook I got these bottoms and I got
these beach pants from ASOS we're gonna
answer a couple of more questions this
is America asked what are some of your
favorite clothing stores well I love
ASOS they have new things and stuff all
the time
I also have two days shipping so you
know that is bo2 and then print I love
vintage stores I love thrift stores
another question is from dog and Anna
and that person asked how do you have
the confidence to rock any look first of
all that's very sweet very sweet of you
to ask that I mean I think sometimes I
am a little nervous to wear things that
are a little bit more out of my box and
when I am I usually just take pictures
of the outfits and send them to jasmine
or Lindsey after I lather my body with
this I will throw on sunscreen I really
like this tree because it does not show
up with white I really like it because
it just goes on seamlessly smoothly you
can still see my glistening skin one
more question before I change women of
BuzzFeed asks what advice you have for
anyone who's afraid to wear them looking
long
I think it all depends on how you feel
in your heart when you're wearing that
particular thing if it makes you a
little bit uncomfortable to the point
where you're feeling like you're pushing
yourself out of your box into new
territory I would say do it because I
think it's healthy to try those little
things now that I am lathered and
sweating time to choose my outfit hi as
you can see I chose the RSVP look also I
changed my hair I'm literally just like
throw inside and then I just kind of
stretched it out so that it kind of
falls on the front like a little
pineapple or as some say pineapple the
lip is the final piece of the puzzle I
chose to use tulle that color pop I love
color pop I can't
I have so many of their liquid lipsticks
this is my completed look all I have to
do is throw on my shades and then I'll
be ready to go off to the pool
aka do more work at the office
before I head out I'm gonna answer one
more question the question is is there
any beauty advice your mother gave you
that has stuck with you he's a beauty
advice that she gave me just throughout
my entire life is just to embrace the
Sun when I was growing up I was the
darkest in complexion I'm all of my
friends everyone else was a little bit
lighter than me or even considered like
skating and wanted to go to the beach I
didn't want to get any darker and I
would hide under the umbrella and I
would kind of avoid getting a tan
because I just thought I was already too
dark that was coming from insecurities I
just wanted to fit in and look like
everyone else and my mom always told me
like do not hide from the Sun your
darkest skin is beautiful embrace it and
don't be ashamed of it to everyone out
there who doesn't want to get tan or who
doesn't feel like they should be in the
Sun because they're too dark or they
already look a certain way just don't
don't do that don't live your life that
way cuz you're beautiful this concludes
get ready with me Freddie version and in

want to see next

have great style and great makeup tips

and let Bobby know and I'm going to head
out and not go to the pool I love you
