port wine stain birthmark on half of my
face it also goes into my head my ear
and my neck I think it's really
important for us to do something a
little bit different with a so many
makeup tutorials out there on how to
cover up your flaws your blemishes let's
do something a little bit different and
embrace it to be able to see a video
like this I think will be really
empowering and this is something that I
definitely would have needed growing up
because I was bullied and you know
people thought if they got too close to
me that they were gonna catch this let's
be bold my skin is so much thicker than
the rest of it I'm so it like breezes I
think it's even thicker and thicker so I
actually have to get like laser
treatments like every maybe five years
to kind of calm it down makeup I think
is awesome
it's fun it's creative and that's where
it needs to stay
I don't think makeup needs to be a
necessity to feel comfortable in your
own skin enhance what makes us different
because different is not wrong alright
so we got to look once more like a
natural day-to-day look there is no
makeup on the birthmark and it's
completely natural when it comes to
everyday I don't really do much at all
I kind of keep it with just like a lip
maybe the eyebrows if I'm feeling
energetic growing up was really
difficult and because of all of the
bullying and with everything that I saw
within movies and magazines of how to
look it made me really self-conscious
with who I was and how I had to feel but
I want to create a new meaning into a
flaw that it's there is no right and
wrong and not a flaw is just part of you
and it's just different and it's what
makes you unique okay so this is more of
a glamorous look it'll kind of kept like
the Browns just a little bit darker on
the I definitely a more of a bold
eyeliner and then
course the lips the lips are probably my
favorite to do especially for like going
out at night and then sometimes I
actually like to fill in my birthmark
but with like a pink kind of
pigmentation this is really similar to
the color of my birthmark already but it
is a little bit discolored like right
here around my eye it's a little bit
darker so I'll just kind of fill it in
just ever so slightly it kind of gives
it this one color that I think looks
really cool now we're gonna move on to
our fourth looks we're gonna kind of
just add a different color for the base
because I love doing anything that's not
my actual clover the birthmark I think
it's so much fun but we're gonna attempt
to doing like some real flowers and fill
it in and see how that goes there's such
a community that I never even knew that
existed and I wish that I would have
known about that when I was younger
because it's so common and yet you feel
so alone even like the days that I
wasn't actually like feeling very
confident I just tricked my mind into
that I was and that being unique is
 awesome
this is our bold look filling it in the
birthmark that's kind of one of my
favorite things to do as far as getting
creative I literally pulled flowers out
of my garden and my neighbor's garden
filled it in with a nice purple kind of
shimmer cream eyeshadow I usually kind
of use eyeshadows or lip colors to kind
of outline and fill in could totally see
this like on a runway for like a spring
collection I think that would be really
cool just to put a garden on your face
if you were to do something like this
with your birthmark or whatever it is
that you're uncomfortable about you see
something this cool and just even weird
you don't see it as something that
you're like self-conscious about anymore
we all have our own challenges our own
stories but ultimately if we can just
come together and to realize that it's
unique and it's beautiful you'll never
feel alone ever again you'll always feel
like you'll have a home I would totally
wear this on the red carpet this is our
final really bold look kind of like a
futuristic avant-garde this is actually
edible gold so that we just filled with
in the birthmark and then to kind of
just add some boldness we just do like a
dark blue for the eyebrows and the lips
call this hard work it's all gone away
well that was fun today was kind of
inspiring and empowering for me if I
haven't been able to do anything
creative in a while so it's just to kind
of remind myself I'm just how unique
that we all are and all the
opportunities and outlets that we have
available to us to do something really
cool and I hope it was really inspiring
for anybody else who have a flaw that
they're really uncomfortable about there
is no right and wrong that you are
beautiful no matter what it is that you
have that you're challenged with that
you're not confident about do something
with it
embrace it highlight enhance it love
yourself be who you are be bold about it
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
