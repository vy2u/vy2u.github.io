things I am most proud of
is that I have never cheated on anyone.
- I believe that when
you're in a relationship
you should be committed to that person.
- I have cheated on someone, yeah.
How men feel about cheating
Have you ever been cheated on?
- Let me try to go back
to that place in my life.
I've tried to like bury...
I slowly noticed my girlfriend was
becoming more and more distant
and I try to pry and she
said nothing was wrong.
One day she was just
like, &amp;quot;I wanna break up.&amp;quot;
And I was like, &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;
Then I found out that she had been
seeing someone else for weeks.
- I was cheated on by a girl who I was
trying to restart a relationship with,
after we had been
separated for a little bit.
She couldn't stop
sleeping with her...
The guy that she was with
kind of in between us.
I guess her honesty
was appreciated but
made me feel awful.
- It was middle school, so who cares if
your heart gets broken in middle school.
Your hearts gonna get
broken in middle school.
That's gonna happen.
But my girlfriend
started seeing another guy
while she was at church camp.
While she was still dating me.
Which is like,
the most wrong thing you can
do at church camp, right?
Like, start seeing someone new.
Granted, he was more religious than me.
Maybe in the eyes of the lord
that was the right thing to do.
Have you ever cheated on someone?
- I went out to a club
with all my friends.
Met a girl there.
I was kissing her, dancing up on her.
Doing like all this stuff
and I was a few drinks in,
so I'm like, &amp;quot;All right, let's just take
&amp;quot;this to the next level.&amp;quot;
I was like, you know, &amp;quot;Gimme a ride home.&amp;quot;
She takes me in her car,
takes me to my place and I'm so drunk that
I forget that my girlfriend was living
with me at the time and I'm like,
&amp;quot;Holy crap, what do I do?&amp;quot;
- This girl and I were
&amp;quot;dating&amp;quot; exclusively
and I made out with someone else.
She wasn't like my girlfriend, well...
Okay, what it was, was she...
This was 10th grade and she was
not making out with me.
She would not make out with me.
She would only kiss me closed mouth
and I had this beautiful girl that
was willing to make out with me.
Sorry, I made out with her.
Have you ever been the other guy?
- I've definitely had,
how shall we say, older women
use me when I was younger.
I'm 30 now so that's not a problem
but in my early 20s I
definitely fell prey to that.
That's a real bad situation.
Don't ever get yourself
in a position where you're
potentially dealing with
somebodies angry husband.
Not recommended, I'm not gonna go
into anymore detail than that.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
