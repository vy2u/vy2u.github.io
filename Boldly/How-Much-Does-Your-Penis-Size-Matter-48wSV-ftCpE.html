like them very much they help me all the
time so they're my friends
yeah Sciences recently announced the
dimensions of the average penis but
there's no such thing as an average
penis every penis is special I mean I'm
not gonna say I've seen like a lot of
dicks but like I've seen enough dicks to
know about dicks I always say they're
like icicles they're all different yeah
all types different colors you know
Asian dicks to Indian dicks to black
dicks to African dicks I've had them all
I haven't really met one that I can
complain about to be quite honest
they're all they're all great I've seen
some different penises and what really
matters to me is the man that it's
attached to not the size or the width
size does not matter and I feel bad that
guys are judged so harshly on their size
I don't ever think about it when I'm
dating somebody and like I'd be like you
have a perfectly fine dick like
everything is going great and they like
no no no no like oh my God my dick my
dick my dick I don't know if you're
judging someone's dick like you suck I
grabbed a dollar and I put it underneath
the dick and so it kind of went like
this and it didn't meet up like the
edges never met so I always thought he
got he has a dollar dick sometimes the
individual doesn't know what to do with
it if it's like super long it's just
really invasive also I've been with guys
who have had huge dicks and like didn't
know what to do with them and it wasn't
fun and there was nothing happening and
then like been with dudes you have like
really small dicks but they're like
super fun in bed if anything like I
remember one guy who was like huge and
like I like it was was one of the worst
like sexual experiences I've had I think
that he was just betting on the fact
that like his dick was big and like that
was it you know and it was just kind of
like
oops there's so much more to sex than
just like you know it's more about like
the movement or what's happening around
it I'd say you know there are none of
those uncircumcised penises or
circumcised penises or big ones or small
ones like it doesn't matter and I think
it's like what you do with it honestly
as long as you're you the owner of the
penis are honest and know what you like
and are able to like please your partner
then like who cares
so the general consensus seems to be
that it doesn't matter how big or small
your penis is what matters is that
you're proud of your penis and that you
know how to use it and most importantly
that there's somebody good attached to
that penis also how did they spend all
that time measuring 15,000 penises they
must have seen a lot of penises also
where was the signup sheet for these
penises there's several people here who
would have been down to have the penises
compared to other penises and then
mathematically boiled down to a single
number of penis everyone wants to be
involved and I feel like 15,000 penises
is not a good enough - of penises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
