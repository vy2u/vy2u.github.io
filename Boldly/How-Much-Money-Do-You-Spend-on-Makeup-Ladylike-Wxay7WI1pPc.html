one item from Sephora and then I'll walk
out with like seven items from Sephora
it's like going to like the pound for me
like you can't just get one puppy you
got to get all the puppies I don't know
I'm like really afraid how much money is
hiding in my bag I feel like I'm just
gonna be upset with myself I recently
had to get a new makeup bag because my
old makeup bag was too small for my
everyday products so with that said I
don't have a very good feeling about
today oh I'm very anxious all of a
sudden I feel like I've accepted myself
so I know that my makeup bag is
expensive I know that I spend too much
money on makeup but I Know Who I am I
expect to have the cheapest makeup bag I
expect people to look at the stuff that
I have in here and be like that's gross
that brush is old I think my everyday
makeup bag probably costs around a
hundred a hundred and forty five dollars
or so in that bag I don't think mine is
the most expensive I have a lot of like
Mac foundations and powders and stuff
and every single item in Mac is like $30
plus $500 120 dollars I think me and
Zack might be neck and neck I'm ready I
am so scared okay all right I'll do it
this reminds me of when I got like in my
sorority in this you'll find your future
my only hope is that Tyler never seen
this video Oh Oh yikes okay all right
259.50 m cents $295 70 325 219 dollars
three hundred eighty-seven dollars four
hundred and sixty dollars education my
life is a money garbage disposal oh man
that's depressing you know why because
like for a lot of men in row dollars
that's less than I originally and it was
so I'm proud of myself but with the car
favorite that's half my rent it's like
ten like three star meals this is three
burritos the most expensive thing that
is currently in this bag is not
even makeup it's a makeup setting spray
the most expensive thing is the
foundation yeah this is the NARS tinted
moisturizer the most expensive thing in
my bag so bronzer palette is $50 I have
a full Naked palette that isn't even in
here I am a self aware makeup addict and
this seems about right to me I'm not
really spending two hundred fifty nine
dollars on just a product I'm spending
that money on something that's fun
you'll pay more for certain types of
makeup because you want higher quality
we all have our vices right I don't ever
want to see this again I'm gonna burn it
and just pretend I never saw it three
hundred eighty-seven dollars is a lot of
money but can't put a price on happiness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
