to the dollar is not fully accurate
description of the gender wage gap it's
not right I get it okay do you what is
it know what test me now I feel like the
word feminist is like a hot word I don't
think it's like a word that I think of
it I'm like Oh pleasantness it's about
the Equality of both genders being aware
that it is an equal playing field and
advocating for that feminism is my
lifeblood yeah I even wear my shirt
today I feel like I'm not super read up
on like what a feminist like it I feel
like it's one of those terms that's been
hijacked it's become such a trigger word
that people think that it's dirty and
that it's bad I like situate them with
people who wrote tests about female
rights all the time they're very
intrusive about their opinions about
certain things
you
I believe I'm a FEMINIST I always
thought guys and gals all equal I'm
definitely not not a feminist I'm not
against them
I'm not lanced feminism president of the
club I will probably get like a 98%
because I think there's 2% wiggle room
for the internal misogyny that I still
hold I feel like you're gonna like judge
me no matter what I'm excited to see cuz
maybe I'm not as feminist as I think I
am I would be willing to give up my
salary if I had to so that equal pain
workplace could be a reality what why do
I have to give up salary I'm definitely
down to give up some portion of my pay
to have some type of equality I guess
I'm like socialist or something I can't
help but bother them when their song
includes misogynistic lyrics even when I
otherwise liked the song
like it's a song I feel like I'm not
bothered I don't know whether I'm
desensitized you know you don't mind yes
I do
it does actually piss me off like if I'm
both my form of protest is not paying
for it and you can rabbit sing about it
all you want but you're not gonna get my
money I believe it's important to
encourage women to negotiate I wish
somebody would have taken me aside and
taught me how to negotiate I don't know
who bell hooks is I feel like that
should ring a bell I believe Jennifer
Lawrence should earn as much as her male
co-stars I think Jayla makes more than
her male co-stars here we go oh gee I
had a bad bitch right there I'd be more
like her I have taken a woman's and/or
generous sleaze class yeah yep have you
I have not really I can define
intersectional feminism sorry
nope I don't read enough I should this
one I believe that women who possess
certain types of privilege are
responsible for advocating for women who
don't have their level of privilege I do
not think a movie should be released
unless it's past the bad Joe test I
don't know Teddy is obsessed passing the
Bechdel test would mean that it has more
than two women in it and they're talking
about something outside of men
if it's not needed what you mean is not
needed Adam you know Rob without know
women and women should be allowed to
apply for a job if they fulfill 60% of
the job requirement
I mean dudes are lying like 40% of it so
women should be able do that yeah I wish
I could be as confident as like men who
really don't know anything sometimes I
believe a woman is a woman if that is
what she calls herself regardless of her
physical attributes and makeup agreeing
what yeah you got a higher score than me
yeah well you're not that bad though
that's the best no pass my average
feminist Wow 70 you love women I do I
feel like I'm just so swayed by my own
life choices my own perspective that
I've never had to really like breach
that are you a feminist
aren't you effeminate end of thing you
know there's some certain terms and
words and tests I don't know but given
time I think I could have a higher grade
vote for black rights and then women
rights and all that all those things
it's twine because you know how to feel
City marginalize my relationship with
the word feminism has always been kind
of tense because I'm a black woman and a
lot of what feminism mainly gets at is
white women's issues but at the end of
the day I think that it's important for
us to all come together if the goal is
equality for everyone then it's like I
need to be a part of that conversation
as well and advocating for what I need
as a black woman alongside with white
women they're gonna tell women on your
dates that you're 70 percent feminist
yeah yo girl yo girl
I'm Stephanie percent man just to let
you know I'm saying percent feminist I'm
I would say I'm listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
