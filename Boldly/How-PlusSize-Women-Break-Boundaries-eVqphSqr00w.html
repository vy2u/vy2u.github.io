comfortable was kind of when I just let
myself just be like whatever you're here
you're at the beach in this bikini just
like rocket ladies and gentlemen please
welcome to the stage miss cherry on top
I think I did really well we accept big
boobs and big butts and wide hips but we
don't really accept big tummies I think
having a big tummy is just one extra
prof you get to jiggle and I think this
was really a great way to see that like
no one cares in being pitted against
each other on Instagram and Facebook God
don't want bones they want curvy girls
like okay that's great you could like
what you want to like but we're not here
to say hey we're better we're here to
make space to show that there are women
of all sizes who can be beautiful at the
other day people are just people you
never know where someone is with their
body you should have a lot of kindness
and empathy for other people and what
they're going through you're allowed to
be you so let's just all let ourselves
be yourselves
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
