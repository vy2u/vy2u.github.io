probably seeing a picture of me and I
didn't realize that I was that big I
don't know if it's like one single thing
it's been like a journey into being
healthy I was kind of moving into the
overweight for how I look I've always
been a big guy I think I finally decided
that I was ready to make a change I
moved to Los Angeles from New York and I
didn't really know anybody here and I
was just trying different things to get
to know people I suffer from depression
I actually doctor recommended it I said
you need to start exercising I have
struggled with my weight since I was in
second grade I'm kinda at the point of
my life where weight the one thing
holding me back I feel like
first start moving like that's an easy
goal where that makes sense and I
started off working out at home I didn't
have a gym membership I've tried a lot
of different exercises and it takes a
while to find something you're like ooh
this is for me and I'm excited I went
from zero to 60 so I was going to the
gym four five times a week because of
such a lifestyle change you gotta really
dig deep and find what you like to do I
started by signing up for a group that
was running the LA Marathon I would
always go for community as your number
one step I'm gonna cook on Saturday and
then I'll have lunches for the rest of
the week and that would take that
decision process and take it out of the
equation anything that's in a box get
rid of any time I catch a weird craving
I try to go to Pinterest to find
something new that might be healthier I
take a water bottle with me around
everywhere shop the perimeter of the
grocery store because if you don't even
go down those aisles chance to be
getting something that's complete and
healthy goes down you can make these
little replacements in your life like
every time I find myself wanting to go
to the kitchen at work instead I'm going
to walk around the block
everything in moderation if you have any
kind of deprivation and you're going to
go back to your old eating habits
because you're just not happy one bad
meal isn't going to make you fat but one
good meal isn't going to make you
healthy it's definitely an overhaul that
takes time
motivation is something that needs to be
happen every day because you can lose it
consistently and get frustrated with the
gym I definitely suggest finding
something in the morning at the very
start of the day to get you going don't
feel bad if you slip up I always have
moments the point is I don't stay there
the kind to yourself don't beat yourself
up every time you think you make a
little mistake you just have to pick
yourself back up and and continue to
work on it
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah you don't know the half of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
