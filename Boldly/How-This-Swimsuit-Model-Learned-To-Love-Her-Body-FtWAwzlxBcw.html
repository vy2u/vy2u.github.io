is because I want to help set a new
standard of beauty in the industry they
are the epitome of representing women of
all different colors sizes shapes
I mean I've struggled with my body image
my whole entire life
one day I became anorexic and I stopped
eating I get a little bit emotional
about it because I wish that I never did
that to myself if I'm stressed about
this and I am the girl in the magazine
imagine how the hell the rest of the
woman out there feels
I think now for the first time in my
life I'm actually comfortable in my own
skin and I really found that through
health and fitness that really changed
my life
being sexy is about what's on the inside
it's about intelligence it's about
strength it's about who you are as a
woman and that is so much sexier than
the size of your boobs or the shape of
your body I wish that I told my 13 year
old self to be happy you can do whatever
the hell kind of woman you want to be
literally the sky is the limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
