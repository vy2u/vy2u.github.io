down a lot and if you're not paying
attention chances are you're doing it
wrong this is wrong this is wrong this
is wrong two people who sit down at work
have twice the rate of cardiovascular
disease and are 54 percent more likely
to die of a heart attack research
suggests good posture can make you
happier more confident and more willing
to take risks
let's explore good posture together
start by sitting with your feet on the
ground if you're short put a box under
them it's like bringing the floor up to
you except it's a box and you'll have to
explain this to people don't cross your
ankles don't cross your legs and don't
cross me because we're talking about
your finger here your knees should be at
or below your hip level keep a small gap
between the back of your knees and the
seat make sure your lower back is
supported use a pillow if your lumbar
doesn't rest easily against your chair
keep your shoulder blades back and down
elevate your chest and draw in your
tummy it will make you look more
attractive and it costs nothing that's
what you're really after isn't it give
your arms the support they deserve use a
chair with arm rests that allow your
wrists and forearms to be straight and
level with the floor your desk should be
at elbow height with the top of your
monitor at eye level now get out there
show the world what you're made of and
sit like you mean it
