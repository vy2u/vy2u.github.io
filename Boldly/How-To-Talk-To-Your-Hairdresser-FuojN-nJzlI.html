someone's head and think oh what a cross
role I don't trust anyone with my hair
I've had the same girl cutting my hair
since I was 15 I think I always walk
into like getting my hair cut and I'm
just like please be nice to me do you
want our just tightest the picture doing
a little looser um have fun with it what
if we did a cute braid in the front and
I did some loose curls her hair girls a
lot a half an inch a month so you just
get regular you know now I hear your
hair might grow a little bit faster
depending on how many carrots I eat you
are going aroud it's super important to
get it trimmed so you don't want to take
more than a half an inch hmm so it has
to be short enough where it's cool and
fresh like the person that I am and long
enough that you don't see my grotesque
mole on the back of my head there's like
a dent right here and so you almost need
to put more volume right there junior
year and senior year I did my hair like
it was prom because I felt like that was
the only way to like hide it just what
you're wearing tonight
why is bad I just meant it's like a
couple minute with your outfit uh-huh
it's a question that you usually should
get asked when you're getting your hair
styled my head smells like a mint yes
this has peppermint oil in it which
stimulates the scalp which helps prevent
hair loss okay so how you came in here
like guns-a-blazing like I don't have
one person doing my hair that would off
put a stylist oh I'm so no not I mean
I'm fine don't come off that like
they're the only one that's if my hair
just be like I have a there can only be
one I've ever ever right how much do I
tip you I mean we're like in a way like
waitresses like what you're paying is
not what we're getting
yeah I prefer if you don't aren't on
your phone it can be a little
distracting for me but you shouldn't
feel like you're imposing you're paying
for it so you should feel gentle I'm in
your house you know I'm going to the
salon I'm in your house this is
I did it oh my god I'm so excited this
is so cool oh my God thank you
waiting this appropriate yeah okay yeah
hairstylist very touchy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
