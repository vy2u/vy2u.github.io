meanest and evilest thing you could do
to someone in a lot of cases it means
you are unhappy with the way things are
and the rather than dealing with the way
things are in your current relationship
like you kind of seek an escape with
someone else
I have been cheated on and it really
really sucks I had a boyfriend in
college who would cheat on me all the
time and I had told him at one point
like look if you're gonna do it just
like tell me and like we'll talk about
it but don't keep it from me like that
was the bare minimum that I asked for
and then he still would keep it from me
he was away for the summer and he would
come back to Boston to visit me and our
visit was very sweet we'd sort of hang
out all day and like have ice cream and
walk through the Boston Common and then
you know at night he would go see a
couple more friends and then leave after
that summer I found out that like he'd
have ice cream with me during the day
and then like screw his ex-girlfriend at
IKEA yeah it was the first time I
understood the kind of fear and anger
people feel to the point where they only
know how to react physically um by just
combusting into tears
and throwing hair dryer
yeah I have cheated on someone but it
was never like it's never been like an
affair so I was on a break which is
really weird but I feel like a lot of
people have been through it and then I
decided on my own accord that it would
be okay to pursue another person or
allow someone to pursue me so but I
think in in certain situations people
think that's cheating which I actually
think is too I have never cheated on
someone um I I have been the one that
the cheater has cheated on someone with
um one time I had no idea until after
the fact in one time I kind of I kind of
knew and yeah I kind of rationalized it
like there's been so many times where
I've done the right thing where I've
told someone no you break up with your
girlfriend and then you can talk to me
and then they eventually break up
something always happened but they never
ended up with me so this time I was like
maybe I'm supposed to do the wrong thing
and maybe that works out sometimes and
it really that's it it's just really
painful and messy and awful and some
capacity cheating is like for me in my
situation it was like getting back at
the person versus like me being taking
the high road and being a better person
so it's like a tear it's terrible that's
terrible it's a horrible feeling it
makes you feel sick
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
