you should do when you tell someone that
you love them and they don't say
anything back I required love with a
bitch I mean isn't that the story of
everybody's life it's hard to say that
this won't feel like the end of the
world because it'll feel like the end of
the world this is the toughest life
lesson that I've ever learned maybe
they're just nervous to say I love you
some people think it's a really big
commitment thing I think when you say I
love you to somebody and they don't love
you back you kind of suspected that to
begin with
it hurts like nothing else does but why
would you want to be with somebody that
doesn't want to be with you back maybe
you can say you know like I had a bad
taco that day you know I just I'm just
having word vomit I actually now want to
vomit but blame it on the alcohol even
if you don't drink just say you were
drunk you know what I mean in the
aftermath you're just gonna get stronger
getting your heart broken is a good
thing because it's gonna teach you who
you should love you've got to get out
there you got to keep putting yourself
in loves way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
