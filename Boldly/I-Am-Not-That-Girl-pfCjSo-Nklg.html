who comes out of a relationship and
instantly finds herself in another you
know effortlessly like it was destiny I
guess it was just never destined for me
to be that girl that girl who never
stops having people confess their
unyielding love for them
that girl who people can't stop talking
about how pretty they are
that girl who can get guys to buy her a
drink at the bar all of the smack of her
patent leather soft lips and a little
hair flip just like effortlessly like it
was destiny I guess it was just never
destined for me to be that girl that
girl who knows how to flirt properly
that girl who can put our makeup on
flawlessly that girl who can post a
photo to Instagram and not find a
million insecurities lurking at the tips
of her fingers as she presses the share
button and I know that I shouldn't let
these things define my femininity I know
that I shouldn't let these things bother
me but they do it's like having a lack
of male attention in this world is seen
as an abnormality it is seen as less
than womanly and I'm always forced to
ask myself what's wrong with me but
maybe it's because I was never destined
to be that girl maybe it's because I was
destined to be something more
to be that girl who just lives her life
that girl who loves herself for who she
is and doesn't rely on male attention to
make herself feel all right that girl
who knows what she wants and fights
until it's hers that girl who still has
insecurities but at the end of the day
just says whatever because we all know
who runs the world yeah I want to be
that girl
