it can be really difficult as a person
of color to find makeup that works for
me so I'm going to be going to four
different stores and buying four
different foundations based on the help
of the clerk's based off of previous
experiences I've had with foundation
matching I'm not super confident that
this is going to be a good experience I
just finished my shopping spree and went
to Chanel Sephora Target and Ulta let me
tell you about each one so I went to the
Chanel counter and the sales lady was
very nice she was very helpful
she sat me down and she was trying to
match me and she informed me that this
is the darkest shade that they had look
at me one side is the alive me and one
side is the ghost me just like super
ashy super pale no warmth or life in my
skin at all I feel exactly like Milan
when she like looks at the sword and
like wipes away one half of her face so
I went into Ulta and she was like I know
exactly what you need gonna test these
three different shades on you and the
whole experience probably took about a
minute it matches like the warmth of my
skin I don't feel like ashy or that I
look pale or dry or anything there's
like a little bit of difference in my
forehead because my forehead tends to be
is like weirdly darker than the rest of
my face
but overall it's like it feels like a
perfect match
so I went in to target our targets they
have like specific Beauty people in the
beauty Isles to help people out she was
like very sure this w6 warm was gonna
work I look so sweaty and greasy and I
feel like honestly if I did actually
start to sweat you'd get like these
lines of color coming down my face is
like my natural skin tried to break out
of its prison I couldn't walk around
outside like those people would wonder
what was wrong with me I went into
Sephora she pitched two shades to try
out on me and she got it right on the
first try which I was really impressed
by they were almost identical to me
honestly I couldn't even tell the
difference if I couldn't even tell that
I was wearing foundation when she tested
on me there isn't much of a difference
between my face and my neck it's very
like warm and bright like how I want to
be when it takes out any like weird
discoloration that I have in my skin I
went in really thinking none of it was
going to work out for me but I ended up
coming out of it with two really nice
foundations that I'm probably gonna use
for a long time it's nice to know that
there's a brand out there that has like
a perfect match for my skin I think it's
just better to test all of your options
and see what works best for you one
person doesn't necessarily have the best
eye to match you so it's better to get
you know four or even more different
opinions on what looks best for you she
told me that this is the darkest shade
that they had but she was like oh yeah
we're kind of waiting on the darker
shades to come in I was like are you are
you really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
