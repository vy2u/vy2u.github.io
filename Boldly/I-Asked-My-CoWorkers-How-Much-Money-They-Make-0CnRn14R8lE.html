me number no oh oh God I don't know uh
we want me to whisper this to ya
I think we all know what we're worth but
we're afraid to go after it because
society tells us that you're not worth

you that you're not worth it why do you
think no one teaches us why is there not
like a class or something cuz it's all
about power like the less information
you have the more power the other side

tactics I think some people do they have
