you think you're with this person for
forever and so you get something that
represents that relationship or
represents him or her and then it falls
through I was in a relationship for five
years and out of that relationship we
had a beautiful daughter named Naomi but
unfortunately it ended about a year ago
and within that relationship you got a
tattoo for me and I got a tattoo for him
of my nickname I thought that was love
he was willing to represent me on his
body I figured I should represent him my
relationship was abusive
it was definitely mentally and
emotionally abusive and maybe even
physical noting where I was hospitalized
or severely injured but there were times
when we would Tuffle with each other it
was rough it was a rough five years and
it wasn't a relationship
I needed my daughter to be a part of and
stay in and live with it took me a while
to build up the courage to leave but I
did
and I'm glad I did it's been a long time
coming I've been working really hard
just to move forward and and not feel a
certain way about my life anymore and
the things that I've gone through this
will be the end of this would be the end
of all with the article of the physical
emotional mental stress and worry and
this will give me the freedom to just be
and live and be worryfree it's good I'm
