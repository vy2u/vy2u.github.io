parents decided we should learn English
and that is a day their whole lives and
future's changed
dear BuzzFeed when I was five years old
I lived in Tijuana Baja California
Mexico with my older sister who was 8 my
older brothers who were 11 and 20 my
parents and my nanny
one night my oldest brother and my
parents decided we should learn English
and that is a day their whole lives and
futures changed every day for the next
10 years we cross the border to go to
school in the u.s. at first it was all
very exciting but we didn't really know
what we were getting into we will wake
up at around 3 a.m. so we could shower
and get ready for school
my mom dad would take turns to cross
with us through the San Ysidro border we
cross by car and would arrive at the
border at around 4:30 a.m. to make line
which could either be five minutes or
four hours there was no way for us to
know how long we'd be there sometimes
fights would break out or officials
would give us a difficult time forcing
us to arrive very early in the morning
if it only took us a short time to cross
we would go to a park in front of my old
elementary school and sleep for a while
after about seven years we began
crossing through the pedestrian lane
alone after we crossed we would take a
trolley than the bus that would drop us
off in front of school this process
would take about 40 minutes after 10
years of crossing the border we finally
moved to the US the youngest of my
brothers went on to graduate from San
Diego State University as a computer
science major and is working for a
coding company my sister is a 4th year
student at the University of California
Berkeley my oldest brother owns an
online bookstore that provides the US
and Europe a massive amount of Latin
American publications it's one of the
biggest bibliographic catalogues of the
Spanish language and finally I'm a
student at the University of California
Irvine as an undecided undeclared
danger I wanted to tell you the story
because we literally had a border to
stop us from getting an education in the
u.s. we faced so many challenges
throughout the years fights breaking out
patronizing cops and being late to
school but we didn't let it stop us
instead here we are 13 years later
trying to make this country a better
place thank you for taking the time to
