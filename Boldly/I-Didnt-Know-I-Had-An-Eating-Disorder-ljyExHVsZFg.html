made no sense
I was always such a healthy happy kid I
knew something was wrong but I didn't
tell anybody I thought it was just a
one-time thing and I didn't want anyone
to worry
I couldn't keep food down so I kept a
plastic bag by the dinner table I
couldn't leave my dorm room I miss
classes and parties I was up all night
puking in a plastic bag boiling acid
lined my throat like a blazing fire a
constant and throbbing pain that made it
hard to swallow or speak or think the
pills I took made my entire body shake
my palms sweat my heart count
I kept gasping for air but I couldn't
get anything I prayed to God please make
it stop
make me better I looked in the mirror
but I didn't recognize my own reflection
I used cigarettes sex cocaine anything
to distract me from the pain I avoided
places and situations because I was
terrified of getting sick the illness
had completely taken over in my life I
couldn't keep any food down I spent an
entire summer eating nothing but breath
mints when I did eat it felt like my
stomach was gonna burst open like there
was a wedge of dynamite stuck in my
intestines ready to explode exercise was
the only thing that made me feel better
so I went to the gym and then I went to
yoga and then I went back to the gym I
beat my own body I tried to rip the fat
off my stomach that was keeping me sick
my fat was standing in between me and my
healthy life I counted everything miles
calories
I didn't eat one wrong look from someone
and I was on the treadmill I wrecked my
car because I was binging my nose was
bleeding I was dizzy but I was terrified
of being caught eating
when I was finally ready to talk about
it I found out that I wasn't bad or
crazy or weird and then most of all I
wasn't alone
