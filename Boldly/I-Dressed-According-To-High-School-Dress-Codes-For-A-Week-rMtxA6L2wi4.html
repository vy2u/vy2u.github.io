to a high school principal and said
excuse me
this beautiful boys muscles are ruining
my school day no one would do that no
one would listen this week I'm going to
be following the dress codes from seven
different American public high schools I
have a theory that it's a lot harder
than it looked for guys dress codes are
basically like don't wear trench coats
or shirts with curse words on them and
for women it's there are a lot of very
detailed rules you must follow that
dictate how much thigh and shoulder you
can show some of the dress codes are
actually super vague which will leave it
up to me to determine whether or not
what I'm wearing will get me sent home
from school all right here we go so it's
day one of dress codes and today we are
going to be following Los Angeles high
schools dress code which is very vague
there weren't very many rules but most
of them are things like don't wear
things are excessively short like what's
excessive what's not excessive is that
determined by how angry my principal is
that day so day one was super easy in
fact it was so easy that I forgot I was
even following a dress code which I
suppose is the whole point so I'm trying
to get dressed for day two and I think
this is okay I'm supposed to have at
least one strap I'm holding this up and
I suppose this isn't really a strap this
was the first day when I realized that a
lot of the clothing items I thought were
totally fine are actually not so I'm at
work and I told my co-workers that if
they could see any of my bra straps or
my bare shoulders this week they had to
tell me it's 11:00 a.m. and I've already
been told twice and I'm already more
worried about people seeing my shoulders
then literally anything else I don't
think my clothes scream huge distraction
to boys but here we go the rules for
this dress code were a little bit more
strict no tank tops no spaghetti straps
nothing backless I was gonna wear this
dress until I remembered it has a
keyhole back all right
I'm dressed for school and it only took
most of the school day
day four and this is getting real I
can't have any shorts or skirts higher
than four inches above the knee as a
short person I am at an advantage when
it comes to the shorts thing because my
arms do not go down very long which
means I can get away with a lot more
options and say someone taller than me I
guess this is okay I mean I have time
for this so it's day five and this dress
code is a witch riddle if you choose to
wear shorts on your skirt or dress it
has to follow the fingertip rules for
shorts and skirts over case okay let me
quickly explain why this rule is bonkers
this Court is fine because it extends
past my fingertips but this dress is not
fine because it reveals slightly more
than the tops of my knees I read the
rule for shorts and skirts for the
school probably 11 mm times and I did
not get it so I thought I was following
dress code but then I just realized you
can see a little part of my bra strap so
now I gotta put on the sweater it's like
a billion degrees outside wearing a
sweater not happy
it's day six and today I'm going to be
following two dress codes from Kentucky
because I could not decide which one was
more terrifyingly hard the first one I'm
going to be trying is actually a school
that was in the news a few months back
because girls were not allowed to show
their collarbones but they revised the
dress code and now you can show some of
your chests a credit cards length from
your collarbone which means that this
shirt is too sexy for school I was so
stressed trying to do this that I can't
even imagine having to go through the
stress and then having to go to school
uh I'm literally wearing a shirt I sleep
in and a skirt with a massive petticoats
halfway through the day I change so I
can follow the dress code from the other
Kentucky high school I picked I've got
to put together an outfit that is no
more than six inches off the ground when
I'm kneeling to simulate how this might
be potentially humiliating I actually
had my boss measure my skirt for me this
is Alex he is my boss almost four inches
it's four okay about all right that's
good it was awful in every way that
something can be awful it takes a
situation that has a huge power of
balance anyway and makes it so much
worse so it's day seven I literally
don't think I have the clothes to do
this dress code tops without collars
must be of a solid color and must not
contain logos emblems or designs all
dresses have to reach the bend of the
knee that is so long
it's Texas Texas isn't very hot State in
case you did not know that has designs
this isn't gonna work for all the
reasons oh this is the outfit that I
have to wear for day seven this is a
pajama shirt or running shirt I look
like I'm cosplaying as a crunchberry
it was really demoralizing like people
like actually came up to me and we're
just like açaí are you okay I think
you lost a part of yourself yeah I'm
like I'm generic brand Kristen
not only was this a lot harder than I
thought it would be it would have been
even harder if I've been tall or had
wide-set boobs one of the biggest things
I learned is that being able to follow a
dress code is contingent on luck where
you live how tall are you these are all
things that people cannot control
there's things that I've worn to job
interviews that were not appropriate and
they were not appropriate for the most
arbitrary asinine reasons rules like
this become part of the background noise
of your school experience and you don't
realize how hard they are to follow
until you don't have to anymore so high
school girls I understand where you're
coming from it is a very dark and sad
place and you don't deserve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
