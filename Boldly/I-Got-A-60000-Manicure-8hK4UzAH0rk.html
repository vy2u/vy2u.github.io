expensive we somehow laser the
opportunity to get a complimentary fifty
thousand dollar manicure experience at
this nail salon in Irvine so they're
gonna be shutting down the entire salon
just for me but I'll probably be like a
little low get in loser we're going
shopping so we're going to Avon
California hmm and I'm getting a 50
thousand dollar manicure why is it fifty
thousand dollars so I think a jeweler
comes in and you shoes like what gems
jewels or diamonds you want and like
whatever you choose that's how much the
manicure is can you actually tell the
difference between a diamond and
absolutely not me there what kind of
light do I have to have who do I have to
marry where I wake up one day and I yep
let's do it thanks for coming with me
yeah I'm excited
I'm also a little gassy aren't we all
my name is Tony million and I'm the
general manager of images lectures in a
lounge today afraid it will be getting
the glitz and glam gear package the
package includes us closing down the
salon the client comes in where are we
wait I see snacks in the back
establishment is this treaty a client to
a mani-pedi facials Botox failures
whatever service they need basically a
full makeover oh my god what is this day
it's gonna be a lot of fun
I'm sure Freddy will actually remember
this experience for the rest of her life
first ratings will actually get a
consultation with a jewel the package
ranged from ten thousand enough the
reason why it's up because depending on
the time that they choose and how many
times they select to put on their hands
so the sky's the limit when it comes to
that pricing these are the diamonds that
we're presenting today
okay how do you tell the difference
between like a real diamond and with a
real diamond it's the strongest hardest
stone so you can't cut it fake diamond
obviously it's very fragile you can
break it so how much is like each one of
these that
well these right here are 150 dollars
apiece each little yes it's so tiny its
knees are just breathe this one right
here is 554 diamond you can choose how
many want on each this one right here in
to close 25 just me and you baby these
numbers aren't even registering in my
mind I wanna do to $25,000 great awesome
oh if she what is she doing I'm gonna
have this set and get it ready for you
already
awesome actually carry a wide range of
polishes from Yves Saint Laurent
although it's chanel along with the
Christian Louboutin it was my next foot
don't look at me everything is so
everything so like thought out there
like an amazing boyfriend can I get my
water a little hotter roses was 25 mm I
mean he actually wants her water hotter
I don't even know Friday me during the
service of the mani-pedi she would
actually get some real 24 karat gold on
her toes so she could walk around
diamonds on her hands gold on our feet
feel like gold on your nails it's like
definitely like a thing right people see
your nails it's some next-level to
be getting gold on your feet do you guys
get some ugly feet coming in here
sometimes are you like oh oh that lady
has some ugly feet I think what is
really cool too is that the attention to
detail and I think that like that's
where maybe a lot of the money go sees
like she is in there with tiny little
tweezers putting tiny little leaflets of
gold on that tiny little toenail
I know it's so beautiful my toes are
just like dancing in the wind whoo
she's changed she changed
now she's going in for the massage with
what looks like a Olli but it's not you
know like in movies were like they show
the person outside and the rain and the
cold and they're just watching people
eat inside of a restaurant that's like
me look at I have my gold-leafed toes
done I have my acrylics on it's so crazy
even though these aren't that long I
still feel like a totally different
person now I'm gonna go over there to
get my diamond installed curly what's up
I'm just living my best life right over
here got a little oh no it's right here
all right all right
oh there you go I'm ready let's do this
feel like my actual skin is getting
pierced it doesn't hurt at all but
that's what it feels like
Queen Freddie's complaining about a
little bit of heat on your finger to
twenty five thousand is the fifty
thousand okay I don't know if I'm ready
it's huge
it's so big you are a lady of leisure
like you cannot be bothered with simple
tasks I think they pretty much like
trying to avoid at all costs this
diamond falling out because then the
feds will have to come back as someone
that's very whole ordeal look at these
things I'm carrying around fifty four
thousand four hundred dollars just on my
hand
plus my $40 a so shirt you know what I
wouldn't even need to get engaged yeah
you know like this is all I need in this
lay I like that better
I don't want to leave the salon like

to come
and it ain't over it ain't no what's his
own yeah part of the package we actually
sprinkle 24 karat edible gold onto our
desserts and pastries for her to enjoy
snack rate tastes like nothing tastes
like oil you have gold in your view you
