getting ready to get Botox in my vagina
I never thought that I would add his
words
in college you know I only tried to have
sex one or two times total all of those
times were very traumatic for me because
I chose partners that I thought would be
understanding and I thought that I could
make it through and I thought I could
just push through the pain but I never
could and I never should have tried
when I would talk to doctors about it
they definitely made me feel like I was
overreacting and that it was something
that I could just like get over your
vagina made her butt soften into the
world I think it's sometimes hard for
people with chronic pain to like keep up
with their social life when she bails
she's not bailing because she's a shitty
friend she's bailing because she can't
get out of bed and she needs her heating
pad and she needs to be on a shit ton of
medicine this is my dilator collection
as you can see five sizes this is what I
started with several years ago seems
insane that this hurts so badly to put
in there's been so many times where
she's like this doctors the doctor like
this therapist is the person so I hope
this is actually the thing basically
what I know about the procedure is I'm
gonna go to the doctor's office they're
gonna put me under so that my muscles
can completely relax because anytime
that I go to any sort of gynecologist or
doctor I'm automatically tense and then
they're going to take some needles
filled with Botox and inject them into
muscles inside my vagina here's my
vagina the walls and then they're gonna
wake me up and I'm going to go home in a
couple days later I might be having sex
who knows Botox is still a medicine that
we use for a lot of different things
it's been sort of popularized because of
weight works aesthetically so if Botox
does it's a neurotoxin so basically it
stops the nerves getting to muscles and
it'll stop muscles from contracting not
another goal with you would be to do the
injection but then really rehabilitate
your pelvic floor do you know aggressive
physical therapy and so as this is
working
hopefully rehabilitate your pelvic floor
muscles and train them not to go back
into that state than a crazy day going
through the consultation and stuff and
honestly all I feel right now is hope
eating with the doctors I don't know
they just validated me so much and just
it was like one of the first times that
that's happened where doctors set me
down and I'm like yes you have these
things you are in pain we believe you
and we want to
help you and I know that there are good
doctors out there they could be few and
far between for women with this
condition but they are out there they do
exist and they do want to help us and
for me that says we have a bright future
ahead of us and this is just a step in
the right direction
but seriously thank you a key for the
nicest doctor I've ever had
do you even realize when we were doing
it I definitely felt it but it was like
it felt far away it was almost like an
out-of-body experience I did it like
just with some laughing gas and now here
I am on my way home and it's done and
it's over and now I get to recover and
hopefully in a week my vagina will be
normal again
first say that I actually got the Botox
then I was quite sore my vagina hurts
but it's nothing that I haven't felt
before it is something that I can't
handle the first couple of days I was
really really anxious that I have just
gone through getting needles stuck in me
for no reason and that I wasn't going to
work today's the first time I feel up to
trying to use my dilators so I just
tried it and I was really worried that
it wouldn't work but it did and it was
so easy I didn't even know how to handle
I just started bawling immediately in
the last five years that's never
happened for me ever I'm 25 now it's
been 10 years carrying this weight and
then all of a sudden I do one procedure
and like 80% of it is gone I just
finished with physical therapy and it
was one of the best sessions I've ever
had it was a little painful as physical
therapy is but she was able to get
places that I've probably never been
able to have her get to and I'm really
excited to keep going kind of surprising
that I would go for a gynecological
issue to a plastic surgery office but
they did what needed to be done I cannot
express to you like how grateful I am
that I had these doctors to help me
through it and how glad I am that I
actually went through with it I hate
talking about this because it makes me
uncomfortable talking about sex still
makes me uncomfortable
years later even though I know that I'm
not alone in this and shouldn't be
ashamed
la-dee-da just because I couldn't have
the vaginal intercourse before did not
mean that we didn't have a side
like I was able to orgasm in ways that
I'm now not able to do because those
muscles are asleep I've experienced so
much hope but I know there's still so
much work left to do and I know that
there is no magic here and there's no
100% fix it you have to do so much work
on your own I know that there are ways
to work around this and I know you know
that there are things that I can do and
learn this whole experience has honestly
been so freeing for me living with these
illnesses in my teenage years and into
my early 20s I constantly felt like I
was living with this dark secret that I
couldn't tell anyone about and having
the film crew follow me and being able
to talk so openly about this it has been
so freeing it's a real condition
millions of women deal with it and it's
about time that we start figuring out
ways to help it and Botox is just one of
many treatments that I hope are still to
come
