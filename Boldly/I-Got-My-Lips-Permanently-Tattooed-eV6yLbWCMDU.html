lips permanently tattooed since I was
little I've had a loss of pigment all
through at the top of my lips and I felt
like as I've gotten older it's become
more noticeable I just want to wake up
have fresh wonderful full looking lips
when I am on like a first date and a guy
goes in to kiss me sometimes I do worry
that like he'll think that I have
something going on or like wrong with my
lips and even if it does hurt a little
bit the results are what I'm looking for
my name is Grace Lara we're here at
elite permanent makeup and training
center we do micro bleeding eyeliner
tattoos lip tattoos we also do scalp and
areola reconstruction hi my name is
Manoj Mahalo I've been here since 2006 I
opened my business in 2013 today my nose
will be working on Caitlyn's lips she
has a little bit of unevenness and when
I was is gonna go in there and make sure
it's all perfectly smooth out so I
really live like your shape I love how
you have a bit more definition to your
lips mine is the 5 years ago
it usually lasts for a couple of years I
don't have to expect to come back for a
while yes
what do you have any cold sore before no
I have it if you ever had cold sore it's
gonna be a breakout if I want kind of
like a brown nude color would you guys
be able to do that today we don't do
Brown because Brown is always turn blue
as the permanent makeup you chant I
can't wait to see my beautiful new lips
I can't feel it like at all even though
I didn't think of it hurts like that
much I definitely didn't expect it to be
like almost completely known
when I was pregnant I start to do in
this job noise 19 years it is my two
kids a single mom ladies show you when I
convict two kids I don't know anybody
here and I just come but before is not I
start to work at home I go to the
English class and I ask my classmate to
come home tell them I'm going to do free
for them if they've been in for me to
the client for me we be single mom call
me the three kids and I don't have
anybody here this job is really helped
me to raise my children try to build my
client finally I opened this place
almost done belches no you can't be you
can't take care of it
oh my gosh it was like even better than
they thought they would be I love it I
evened it up to my lipstick almost as
good as yours
I feel really great I love my new lips I
think managed a beautiful job they're
even better than I expected so if I have
a date tonight should I you know go no
put ice on and off for a couple of days
okay just keep moist and then it's just
when you want she's just really soft
wash I love this color I think it's like
a really nice like kind of dusty rosy
color very natural still even just
waking up in the morning or when we feel
100% better if you can deal with chapped
lips you can definitely have your lips
tattooed I will have to avoid first
dates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
