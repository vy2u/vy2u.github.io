black Jesus having a good old time hey
y'all its essence and I'm about to have
my vagina steamed I have been doing some
research around this and I've read a lot
of reviews who say that it helps with
menstrual cramping so i'ma give it a go
to see if it's really about that high I
personally have bad menstrual cramps so
I want to know if it's gonna help with
that it's fairly new it's been on the LA
wellness scene since around like 2010
but it's been practice on the eastern
wellness thing for literally like
centuries
yeah and Tamira have tried it on
national TV Gwyneth Paltrow wrote a blog
about it so I figured I likes here and
Tamara I trust Gwyn let me give this a
try I'm kind of nervous because steam is
thought to be all up in my hoo-ha but
hopefully everything goes well my name
is Mel I'm the owner of Bloomfield wax
and skincare center located in
Bloomfield New Jersey what happens with
a VC I'm not gonna be lying down a steam
like blower going up my hoo-ha like what
exactly happens we go in the vaginal
steam room we console Tate we see what
herbs best suits you I do the herbs
according to your needs we actually
custom every herb mixture to suit the
client well I'm really excited to try
this out and we're gonna don't get
steamed okay let's go
this feels so pampering I'm just like so
mad I didn't discover it quicker the
week before my period and the week of my
period there's like some pain discomfort
my hormone levels are like out of whack
I cry at Cheerios commercials I got on
my own nerves that's how extra I am I
would be really interested to see how it
reduces symptoms I was like a little bit
nervous at first you don't want to think
like Steam moisture vagina ordinarily if
I just heard those words together I
would just be like yeast infection it
feels like if Jesus whispered a blessing
into your vagina close your eyes and
just let that sink and let that marinate
and that's what this feels like Open
Sesame
I just want everybody to be able to try
this v-steam Convention and we all get
our pot and our plush robes with mimosas
and just sit and escape the world and
then cuz they get on my damn nerves I
feel like a new woman
it's been about two weeks since I got my
feasting just won the experience itself
is very pampering but also it really
works half of every month I feel like
I'm actually on my cycle I didn't even
realize I didn't feel the pain until
maybe like a few days before my period
was supposed to come on because I just
didn't feel the symptoms that I normally
feel I had like no cramps at all and I
was like oh it's really probably because
of the v-steam and that's the only thing
that I did different this cycle versus
any of my other cycles I'm lucky a
little bit shook for me personally I
really like the V scene because it's a
more holistic treatment to minstrel
discomfort and pain and I'm just not
really big on medicine so I would
absolutely do this again just comes in
about sitting on that little pot with
the steam put your little mimosa and
just like go into a happy place I
actually wish I was sitting on one right
now I wish I had one at my desk I want
one for my home but I don't think I can
because I'm not certified in anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
