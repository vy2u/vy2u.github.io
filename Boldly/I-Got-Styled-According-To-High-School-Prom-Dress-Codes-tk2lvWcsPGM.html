hear stories about these girls who buy
perfectly beautiful dresses and then get
turned away from their high school proms
because they violated the prom dress
code so we've got a bunch of on-trend
prom dresses here and we're gonna see
just how hard it is to follow some high
school prom dress code
move here fashion stylist happy to be
here you feeling 17 yes I'm feeling very
sweaty and unsure of myself so lark it
going problem season here we go alright
so first we to find a dress for Central
High School in Aberdeen South Dakota
dresses must be formal short or long
fitting and modest I don't know what
modest means but we can just I don't
know dresses must not be cut below the
bust line
if flesh touches flesh from your boob to
your arm that dress is not good so this
shirt is technically inappropriate
because of this little tiny jump it fat
that I have yeah because your flesh is
touching your gross flesh
Wow get it on things that arm things
gonna be the thing
we have this dress and it's so pretty
you all that I should touch in flesh
welcome to my tip let's try this one
okay cool oh there's flesh touching
flesh look at the sexy armpit yeah
frustration long sleeves let's do this
must be no sure the tip oh it
wouldn't eat this shut your leg
just made it so okay basically the only
way for me to meet this dress code was
to come up with something that covered
me up to here yeah ed long sleeves
really almost every single one of these
are because like too much spill over
poop fat
what do you want me to do now we're
gonna do a high school from California
this is Paraclete high school which I
don't know if I'm pronouncing that right
all dresses must be tea length or longer
the front cannot be cut lower than the
middle of the chest where do you define
the middle of the chest I think they
mean I don't know what they mean to me
this is the middle of my chest education
at work no no no no even though this is
long-sleeved it's not acceptable because
it has she see through on it here we go
okay so here we are what are we thinking
about this dress it's beautiful I think
it's another one that says you know I
want to walk a red carpet or I'm a
little bit older than I'm going to prom
we also have no idea what the front
can't be cut lower yeah let's not even
see it could mean different things to
everybody yeah next we're going to be
trying to follow the prom dress code for
Crawford High School in Crawford Texas
this one is a Doozer my neckline cannot
be lower than five inches from the base
of my neck no sweetheart necklines no
strapless or one shoulder straps oh
we're not done whoa and then the dresses
must be no shorter than mid thigh okay
okay so let the rid of everything that
we can't yeah
can't wear this dress no can't wear that
dress no that's a sweetheart
jeez 19 dresses we can eliminate right
now yeah without even trying anything on
let's ride this guy okay you surprised
pleasantly I am pleasantly surprised
it's true oh you know what
ooh how many I totally forgot yeah this
might be a little deep I'm a tape
measure
oh no no no five inches is right there
we're off by an inch this dress doesn't
work let's try again this is gonna be
our next option we try hey work it is
five inches on the dot so in the end I
had nine options that worked out this
was easier because all these dresses are
my size right you were a genius who
brought dresses that you knew would like
work with my body it's just like mr.
Andrew mrs. rendom high schooler
right into a store this would take days
now we are going to try to follow the
dress code from Broken Arrow High School
in Broken Arrow Oklahoma area is
normally covered by a one-piece bathing
suit shall also be covered by opaque
material we ran a lot more options to
food fighters
take your pick she wants the pink here
we go
this feels like a prom dress yes it does
all prom dress code should be like this
yeah Oklahoma bring it at home 17 the
kid yeah I'm gonna kiss a boy tonight oh
no I'm not
this might be the hardest where we at
where we at in the US now we're going to
do the dress code for st. Augustine high
school in New Orleans Louisiana okay
nothing to see through shawls or jackets
must be warm with sleeveless dresses the
shawls that I have for the strapless
dresses are all sheer so I don't even
think those would work
they're like see-through you know short
dresses period Wow okay no cleavage ah
and then the boys have easy ones
no canes no that's drop one no that one
no even the long-sleeve turtleneck dress
would it work because of the length of
it
this sucks literally just being like I
love you while I'm gonna have two
dresses I guess the only thing I would
make your decision easier because
there's lost options it is a very
beautiful dress but I think as a
teenager I would have been a little sad
which is okay because like some dresses
are for teens and some dresses are not
for teens you feel like super frustrated
as a stylist having to like Oh 1,000% if
I had a 17-year old client that was like
these are my prom guidelines help me I'd
be like all right I did not think we
were gonna have this whew me neither
I thought that we would have like maybe
like a hot 5 oh I was shocked
honestly at how hard this was I had a
whole list of schools I thought they
were gonna go from easiest to hardest
and it went from easy to hard heart
impossible impossible you can do all of
this and also get a date depending on
your body type there are all sorts of
trip wires you could fall over if you
have big boobs then you have armpit fat
issues and you have cleavage issues cuz
like I have pretty decent jugs but I
can't imagine what it's like if you have
with a couple of bolts wagons right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
