new year and that's when people try new
things right something I haven't changed
in a really really long time is my style
and the clothes that I wear so I'm going
to the most stylish people I know
ladylike let's actually go talk to them
right now and find out if they'd be
willing to help me hello um I really get
for a video and I was wondering if you
guys would want to style me for a week
yeah yeah so this week we're gonna be
styling our friend Nikki and I am so
excited because I love with
Nikki each of us will be styling Nikki
for one day each day is gonna be
drastically different that only can
consist of clothing but we're gonna
throw in some accessories have a try
different makeup looks even different
hair looks we are dressing Nikki like
our favorite video game characters I am
gonna have her dress just like pac-man
I feel like Nikki has a certain swag in
a kind of like lumbersexual way I don't
know there's just something very like
Pacific Northwest to it comfortable
Portland I'm going to a bonfire but like
I'm very pulled together he looks to me
like a lot of lesbians I know she likes
flannel flannel flannel flannels even in
the summer
flannel so most of the time I dressed
comfortably I dress efficiently and I
try not to spend too much money I I'm
actually surprised Nikki was to do this
videos but I think is too diva cleavage
at work okay let's do it let's do it
Nikki size are gonna be front and center
I want to see something
I know that these girls are gonna push
me out of my comfort zone but maybe I
might just pull off clothes that I never
thought I could so it's day one and it's
Sophia's day I know Nicky doesn't wear a
lot of dresses but for this week we're
gonna go for it I got her a tight dress
not too tight comfortable still it's a
dress and then I got her a cool bomber
jacket and little heeled kind of lace-up
combat boots
I just think she'll look more feminine
than usual maybe a little more dramatic
than usual Nicky's gonna look a little
bit like the 20-something Asian cousin
of the Addams Family like you yes so on
my way to work this morning I was like
how does someone wear something like
this all the time and I was like you
know what Sofia doesn't and if Sofia can
do it with confidence maybe I can't do
today did I do it Fred I just want Nicky
to wear like a dramatic cat eyeliner
something about the dramatic liner kind
of just like makes you feel a little bit
more badass so I'm trying to infuse that
in I think you look so good
yeah you look great the little heels are
doing a lot for this booty I should've
outside Oh room looks wonderful what she
looks like Sofia sobs outfit was whoo ha
whoa oh it was tight everything was
tight
making its way that was one of the
outfits where I was like I can't believe
that I look good in this because I did I
looked good in it
day two is Freddie's outfit so I kind of
went for a sporty chic kind of look with
thigh so I chose like an oversized
t-shirt dress that's long sleeves and
has two stripes here really really cute
thank you buddy made dresses and I have
to shave my legs more often and then
most importantly I wanted to wear her
hair at a high bun with gold hoops and
sneakers okay thank you
right I wanted to channel JLo jarrell
I'm real early two-thousands do you like
my dress I do actually that's as high as
a bun I could get I think Jayla would
have put it higher I'm not JLo
how do you feel it looks so comfy it is
cute okay I'm I need your hands on yeah
okay Oh worked the earrings really took
me over the top
which I think Freddy wanted but I was
like who odd this is not me
Who am I right now Bayless I was JLo
which I was never like wow I really wish
I could look like JLo there's never
really a thought I've had ever
just like you play tennis your legs look
fantastic I love you earrings I'm a
little bit
I did not even though this was Nikki it
is crazy
the earrings jiggle every time I most
and my ears kind of hurt and it's really
hard to wear headphones with them so I'm
gonna take them off
definitely not far outside my comfort
zone I could possibly wear that dress
again
I just have to shave my legs today is
gems day okay so here's what I got Nikki
I'm very excited about it very proud of
it I'm gonna put her in these like nice
blue pants and then a white button-down
but then this is the important part I
got her a brown pair of leather
suspenders I never worn suspenders
before and then a brown skinny tie and
it looks really cool it's only a matter
of time before anyone tries to wear a
tie so let's just make it the time right
now took me a long time to figure out
the suspenders so I gave up because I
was late for work I also don't know if I
really know how to tie a tie what do you
think how'd I do either good you're in
Mad Men I like it the shirt is a little
big it is but I think if you if the
shirt was a tad smaller if you can
assess it yeah I think it's badass in
general but like yeah yeah I like it a
lot you look like a flight attendant
very badass I got a lot of responses for
the outfit that Jen put me in and I
think that was probably because I felt
like I knew how to command myself in
that outfit suspenders are now down here
because it's hard to be you taking
everything off Nick yeah and I like
totally had this moment where I had to
like walk into a room and like meet
someone new and I was in a tie and
suspenders and was like hi nice to meet
you and I had this total power moment
and it felt really cool and I was like I
get my people just like this you think I
can pull off this look like any woman
should it was a little formal for maybe
just like a Wednesday at work but I
looked good okay Devon so my approach
for this week is I got Nikki this kind
of cosmopolitan look it's a black
bodysuit very minimalistic and she can
wear it to the office she can also wear
it on set and she could wear it out we
don't fully understand what I'm supposed
to look like all the time she looks
pretty comfortable and she always looks
kind of clean and simple
I hope this outfit brings out Nikki's
like professional boss ass bitch side
I'm getting to the point where this is
really tough and it's like raining and I
can't just like hop it into a cozy
sweater I'm sit at my desk all day
do you like I'm gonna tell you I feel
really uncomfortable in this I really
like it's super not me
Devon's outfit really put me out there I
had a really really hard time with it
but that is just me you look great I
have done some compliments I think you
look amazing what do you like very
stylish something
really yeah you know yeah the shoes I
really like it that's a no yeah well I
don't wear lipstick very often and I
feel like I look like a toddler who's
putting on her mother's makeup like I
think I did this all wrong
people thought I looked really good and
the style itself is something that's
like in style but I like I was just not
familiar with it I really didn't know
how to feel and how to carry myself the
jumpsuit looks great the shoes look
great and the blanket is very Devon so
we did it day it's Kristin's day and I'm
willing to bet she got me a dress all
right so I wanted to see what Nikki
would look like in a dress but I know
that not everyone has the same dress
style
I picked a dark navy hmm dress for Nikki
I was right it's sleek but it's not like
here's your but I think this look is
like I'm in charge of people and people
listen to me amazing I love it okay yeah
love this dress on you I feel like you
can see all of my lines but it looks
good this color on you I look like a
signer I love like the shape of your
arms in this dress yeah I honestly had
no idea what your body was like before
right you have a body I think you look
like Michelle Obama oh yeah I really
appreciated Kristen's approach she
wanted me to try something new but she
gave me something that she knew would
align with like how I like to dress
myself amazing
everyone's really shocked that I have a
body and curves
it was pretty formal so this wouldn't be
something I'd like wear to work but if I
like had to go to a cocktail party I
don't totally throw that on its
shawntel's day so I wanted something
that was kind of like to make Nicky feel
like a little tease
I got Nicky these black kind of like
faded overall romper Jersey situations
oh it's like a jumper like romper from
romper it's something completely
different than she would normally wear I
won't be offended if she doesn't like it
but I will be sad it's cute but how do
you feel in it
oh this is totally like comfortable yeah
pants yeah but yeah it feels like
something that I I wouldn't see you wear
it it also doesn't look out step too far
outside yeah no I also have morning
turtleneck since maybe I was like a
teenager yeah I can t romp around and
honey stop it's very solid
Chantelle thought that was like a really
great happy medium
Carly doesn't like my turtleneck case
you're a little kid here
I tried on a romper like two years ago
and I looked horrific in it and I was
like wow okay these just aren't for me
but I think I like I looked pretty good
in the one she gave me so maybe this
little like I just can go back and visit
other rompers overalls aren't cool in my
book but you pull it off and I think
that's a big deal right I'm sure
I can pull a lot everyone likes looking
at my body I didn't realize this was the
thing this is definitely Chantal velvet
how could you tell cuz she wears this
kind of stuff all the time
yes I like honestly did not think I
could wear rompers it was fun I can move
around I'm definitely surprised with
myself how I pulled all this off
I think Nikki slayed this week she put a
lot of trust in us and I'm not sure why
my favorite outfit was my outfit Nikki
tested Nikki approved but I'm wearing
pants today it's wearing my own clothes
today and I can do this I'm wearing my
own clothes II just feel good to wear my
own clothes again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
