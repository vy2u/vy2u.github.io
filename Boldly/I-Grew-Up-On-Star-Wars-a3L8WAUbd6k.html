yeah thanks to my father growing up I
was an athlete and my brother was a book
smart guy and was always just reading
science magazines and building stuff he
and I didn't hang out ever except with
Star Wars or Star Trek one of my friends
had a Star Wars themed birthday party
shortly after the Phantom Menace came
out as someone at that point who had
only seen the Phantom Menace I was like
oh I wouldn't be Amidala but that is a
hard costume he started dressing up like
Darth Vader for Halloween when he was
his teenage years
Darth Vader's famously a father and my
father constantly betrayed it so that
like Luke I am your father moment was so
epic it's like of course you are of
course you're the dad you're my dad we
would play the Trading Cards we would
play with the action figures that was
the one thing that we could always just
hang out and spend time together with
and we wouldn't fight so I was like okay
who else's Star Wars
Princess Leia my mom doesn't watch Star
Wars so I was like I want to dress up as
Princess Leia
I barely even knowing what that is and
she was like what does she wear and I
was like um a bikini and she was like
you're not wearing that the first time I
did see Darth Vader like horse joke
somebody that was a little startling cuz
it's like oh my dad's character murders
people I ended up wearing a white sheet
that my mom draped over me she put my
hair up in the buns obviously and of
course that came out after like five
minutes but I thought it was great at
the time now we get along great and
that's why we decided to get the Star
Wars tattoo because that was the one
thing growing up that meant so much to
us we got them together on the same day
we were just like hey you're rebels I'll
go Imperial boom it's always been
something that sort of brought my family
together and we're gonna go see it
together this Christmas back at home I
was like um no you can't make fun of me
for being a girl I like Star Wars and I
know all this stuff and so like guys in
my class would be like ah she's right
okay you know like yeah she's you know
she's not really a girl at grilling we
can't wait to use her there's no just
one Star Wars fan there's no mold you
know I am like a young woman of color
like absolutely not represented in the
Star Wars universe out of yet but I
still love Star Wars Star Wars fans are
everywhere and you know there's no
one that's the same as another
