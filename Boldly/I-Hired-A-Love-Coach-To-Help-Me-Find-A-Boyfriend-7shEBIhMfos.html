could be much for yourself Pedro I love
you me too
that's me eating a sandwich alone in the
bushes
my name is Salaam and for a while now
being single has kind of been a part of
my identity
I know what you're thinking how does a
charming radiant bombshell of a woman
like me have trouble finding a man
that's exactly what my mom says
literally everyday via text when it
comes to dating in LA meeting people
gets kind of weird there's online dating
apps but they're also very weird in
order to meet someone I have to learn to
talk to people in the real world so I
did what any normal gal would do I hired
a love coach a distractingly hot love
coach you are going to be my love coach
I'm on it that you chose me you were the
first person who popped up on Google
that's it that's how you tell you know
research what exactly what happens when
one hires a love life strategist I've
been making videos for years about ways
to help your love life and your
confidence at the same time there are
too many people that are single and and
not happy with being single so my whole
philosophy is okay firstly let's figure
out how we can be happy no matter what
happens but also let's figure out how to
create more choice when women say I'm
old-fashioned I don't make the first
move I say well then you don't know what
old-fashioned is because old-fashioned
is the hundred years ago a woman walking
past a guy and dropping her handkerchief
and the guy sees it and he says this is
an extraordinary opportunity to be a man
picks up the handkerchief he walks it
over turn he says madam you dropped this
and she says did I and they have a
conversation but he thought that was I
did in this day and age you have to
figure out how to drop the hanky it's
clever just carry some handkerchiefs
always carry okay you mentioned that
you're gonna be putting me through some
mini challenges this week from what
you've told me being in a new
environment would be good and meeting
some new people but also learning how to
do a few new things when you're there a
nice thing you can do in terms of
dropping the handkerchief is just ask
someone a favor
you say to a guy I could really use your
help with something and it won't feel to
him like you approached him instead
it'll just feel like he's doing the
polite thing so I went off into the busy
streets of Hollywood with the
not-so-hidden
to see if any of these gentlemen collars
would answer my questions excuse me hey
use your help I'm looking for something
my phone just died unfortunately while I
was out there I realized that once
someone does do a favor they kind of
feel the need to leave and walk away
which meant that I had to find some way
to keep the conversation going which I
was not very good at what else do I ask
people which way do I go
they're like that away after getting
rejected by pretty much everyone in
Hollywood I moved to a coffee shop where
was a little easier to start
conversation I decided I was going to
talk to a man who is reading these
papers in the corner and I proceeded to
do the most Awkward dance around the
room to find a way to talk to him I
found a way to start a conversation by
grabbing the newspaper he was reading
and asking if it was any good and it
actually started a long and an
interesting conversation between the two
of us
Matthew was right by asking a favor I
was able to break the wall and engage in
conversation with a perfect stranger
success when you are talking to a guy
touch is really important they don't
even necessarily register it consciously
but they'll register more of a
connection with you than the last person
they spoke to people wonder why it's so
hard to kiss someone at the end of a
first date because the whole day we
didn't touch and then all of a sudden
I'm supposed to like lean in and bridge
this mile-long gap if we've been doing
that during the date then it's much
easier for us to feel closer together so
my mission to you is touch someone in
the first 60 seconds so weird
okay so this one is a challenge for me
anyone who knows me knows that I'm not
exactly a sensual touch here I noticed
that a lot of the times when I touch
someone I give them this weird pat on
the back like their kid that just scored
a homerun in Little League
Matthew was not a fan okay that's the
worst thing you can possibly do you did
that to me and I'm a guy you like I
wouldn't think you like me a light touch
on the arm like oh my god you have to
hear about this just that touch there
well serve you a thousand times better
than the old arm slap I managed to stop
slapping people on the back but instead
I'd do this thing where I dressed the
back of my hand on their shoulder kind
of like a okay I touched you that works
this was definitely not a successful
challenge for me one of the things that
makes me scared is if I think I'm gonna
have to walk up to someone start a whole
conversation and then stay there instead
here's something you can try it I call
it to hit in theory let's say I go to
the bar and order a drink you could be
standing next to me and I go hey how are
you and you I'm fine and I go great I
hope you're having a great night
maybe I cheers you and then I walk off
but the great thing about that is when
you leave you now seem much more
approachable to that person because you
already approached them okay so this is
probably my favorite challenge that the
luck coach gave me all I had to do was
say hi to a guy walk away and then go
party and they come to me over the
weekend I went to a bar and a rooftop
party at my friend's house both great
places for me to try the two hit 30 I
asked him what drink he was getting it
was genius with a great approach he's
gay yeah only problem everyone is gay a
few hours went by and the men just
simply weren't coming but it was fine I
was having a great time and I wasn't
really worried about that
my god okay I'm not gonna lie I thought
a lot of the stuff that the love coach
was saying was just kind of like not
really relevant to my life but there was
a sky leaning against bar that I thought
was really cute so I decided to try that
whole thing where I go say hello and
then just walk away and so I did it but
I didn't really expect anything to
happen by the time I'm walking to the
car with my friends
he kind of chases me down took my
friend's car and he's like hey can I get
your number and I was like I don't know
I guess overall confidence works I'm
gonna go to bed now now the last thing
what I want you to do is create a happy
hour someone you wouldn't normally
invite for a drink you say to them me
and a couple of friends are having
drinks I'm inviting a couple of people
you're welcome to join that doesn't even
have to be a guy you like by the way it
could be a woman it could just be
someone that is an acquaintance but you
feel like they could actually become a
friend so the party was on I invited
some friends and asked them to invite
their friends but I didn't tell anyone
that I was going to be using love coach
tactics on them so the goal for the day
initiate conversation by using the two
theory or asking a favor
and touch someone within the first 60
seconds do you have to get this in the
hole yeah she almost made it does this
pizza good
it's all good
I don't mean I make you feel bad for
instead of taking you to the animals
they're like you're gonna be okay you're
gonna be okay guys yeah we're all gonna
be okay
you look so confused I've had this like
once before and I got food poisoning the
next day from this place so if I get
sick you're gonna bring me pepto-bismol
and yes get sick don't blame me just sue
them we should exchange numbers there's
anything we should exchange numbers just
in case just in case I think all of
these challenges are really useful but
they're all just about getting out of
your comfort zone and finding ways to
talk to new people started to notice a
lot of moments when walking down the
street where I meet new people and I
want to talk to them what this helped me
realize is that everyone really wants to
make conversation everyone wants to meet
new people but no one knows how to do it
any way that you can go out and just
engage with a new person every day is
completely worthwhile
