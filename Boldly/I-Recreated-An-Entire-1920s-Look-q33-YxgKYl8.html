massive industry with endless new
products and trends but do you ever
think about the makeup of times gone by
welcome to behind the beauty today we're
exploring the glamorous world of 1920s
makeup when I think 1920s
I think flapper haircuts and those
glasses that are like squashed champagne
glasses but what exactly was the makeup
look of a decade there comes a cool an
emotion the 1920s was all about being
bold before the 20s it wasn't socially
acceptable for women to wear makeup at
all
apparently visible makeup was associated
with promiscuity so along came the
Roaring Twenties and the previous
generation was shook well for one was
over and women finally got the right to
vote the war had given women a taste of
what it was like to work since a lot of
the men went away to fight and it seemed
they didn't want to give up their
newfound independence before the 20s
make it was actually pretty difficult to
put on the twenty saw a lot of
development in new cosmetics and ways to
apply them movies also became a thing
women were inspired by silent movie
stars like Joan Crawford and they wanted
to imitate their glamorous Hollywood
looks so let's take a look at exactly
what they put on their faces all right
let's start with these weird-looking
eyebrows this brow look started with
silent film stars wearing their eyebrows
super thin because they thought it made
them look more expressive women then
started following the trend eyebrow
pencils became very popular in the 20s
for the eyes Kohl eyeliner was common
but to be fair that's nothing new what
was new was modern day mascara it just
been invented in 1913 by T L Williams
Williams called his product Maybelline
have you heard of it and why did he call
it that it is a combo of Vaseline and
his sister Mabel
so Maybelline sold KEK mascara which you
mix with water before applying but
mascara wands weren't around yet so
women painted the mascara on with this
thing that kind of looks like a
toothbrush he was pretty messy to me
back in the 20s
women will blush in circles on their
cheeks it was actually called Rouge and
the popular colors were red and believe
it or not orange lipstick was a huge
part of the 1920s look the lipstick tube
that we know and love was invented in
1915 and totally changed the game it
made lipstick portable and it became so
popular that even touching up at the
dinner table was acceptable how daring
so women preferred the Cupid's bow shape
when applying lipstick the after and
lower lip were overdrawn and the Cupid's
bow was dramatic one of the weirdest
products of the decade were lips
women used to get the perfect shape
let's talk to the owner and founder of
Besame Cosmetics an la-based brand that
makes vintage inspired luxury makeup so
what made you want to start a vintage
makeup company I find a lot of the
antiques that my grandmother had left me
and I really admired how they did their
makeup what are you selling your store
that is 1920's inspired so the cake
mascaras definitely inspired by that era
our Rouge is also based in that era
where do you see the 1920s influence
still around today the mouth shape some
people are actually doing over lining
all right I'm gonna stop with the
history lesson I'm gonna get made up
with a 1920s look and then we're gonna
recreate three iconic photos from the
time I'm so excited this is one of my
favorite looks it's very classic and
accurate to the time period
I please love this look and think it
looks crazy we are now gonna go and find
out what my co-workers think of this Oh
and erect attitude I haven't heard your
voice I don't think I would have I've
always wondered why they love the thin
eyebrows I love my thick eyebrows it
feels like worse a hole I also love me
like what do you want it I was literally
like is she okay you look really pale I
like the definition of the lips I do
love how over the top everything lines I
love that there was always just a lot of
accessories beautiful a pretty answer it
one kiss all to me that I don't know
what it is we really want to put this
lip to the test so we found three 1920s
PT icons and we're gonna try to recreate
their photos
oh my god what day this is so much fun
overall I think this look is actually
really cool and I think that you could
bring different parts that are into like
modern day life especially the lips
things I do not like the eyebrows
I would never pluck my eyebrows off and
draw them on as thin little lighting
sucker just can't handle it but what did
you like about it
also what decade do you want us to
tackle next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
