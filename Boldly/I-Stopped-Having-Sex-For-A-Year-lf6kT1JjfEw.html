really difficult I won't
sugarcoat that but if I'm being for real
for real it's an experience that I don't
regret my name is Dasha and I challenged
myself to go a whole year without having
sex well kind of a whole year like many
women when I first started having sex I
couldn't have an orgasm and it's not
like I didn't have the ability in fact I
was very well aware of my ability but
for whatever reason whenever I tried to
recreate that flame with someone else
it's like I couldn't get the wick to
burn the closest I ever came to having
one until I met Brandon a year ago was
when I was in my first and only
long-term relationship
it wasn't an orgasm I know that now but
for a long time it was the closest I'd
ever come you gotta admit that was a
really good pun Brandon was the first
guy since my ex-boyfriend that I
seriously wanted to consider dating from
the moment we first met he always knew
how to make me feel comfortable our
first date lasted for hours talking
about everything and anything the way he
pulled me in and held me close on our
second date he would switch between
caressing and lightly pressing on my
thighs there was this harmonious
combination of love and lust in his
touch that gave me those damn proverbial
butterflies date 3 was the night before
we got into it I noticed him kind of
looking me over with this look in his
eye that I was really unfamiliar with he
said to me you are so beautiful I wanted
to jump out of a window
because that was the first time that
anyone had ever said that to me and he
said it in a way that actually made me
believe him you know what's even crazier
when we did end up having sex that night
I orgasmed
but I didn't even orgasm from
penetration I remember just kind of
laying back stunned after it happened I
was like
he'd do that I've never felt comfortable
enough with anyone to let that happen
but I I can tell you I was really
excited to try and explore Brandon and I
didn't last for reasons that are way too
long to get into for this video and we
only had sex that one time when we
finally did decide to split I decided
that I needed to sex him out of my
memory jack had all of the elements that
we as women are taught are supposed to
make good sex he had a body that was a
work of a god the way he kissed me it
was so tender and sweet and you know I
don't want to get into too many details
about his you-know-what but let's just
say it was a package worth being home to
except from the mailman personally oh my
god my mom when we finished sans orgasm
on my end I didn't know how to feel here
was this dreamboat that I had been
taught would give me all the orgasms
that I could ever imagine and that
14-year old me would have flipped to
 to know that she got this guy to
have sex with her and I couldn't orgasm
but after sleeping with Jack I just kind
of realized I needed to chill the
out in August
Brandon entered into a relationship with
someone else and I always thought that I
didn't know what sparked my orgasm with
Brandon but now I believe that it was me
finally learning to let someone in and
to trust them mentally and physically I
feel like my inability to have an orgasm
was my body's weird way of saying your
orgasm is worth so much more than these
 boys who won't even acknowledge you
after they come you are not broken you
just don't dress them it was in this
moment that I realized I needed to
figure out how to be with someone
without sex and learn how to build that
trust after reading an interesting
article about this one guy celibacy
journey it actually encouraged me to
pursue the idea of dating while celibate
he basically talked about how being
celibate eliminated a lot of the
pressure
of the when is too soon to have sacks
and what is this gonna mean and it truly
allowed him to connect with the person
he was dating Alex was like the
relationship that I always imagined
having in college it was fast and fun
and just completely unpredictable so I
definitely noticed the shifts in our
relationship the night that I told him
even though Alex said that he was a
hundred percent okay with my decision to
not have sex
his actions definitely started to show
how much he actually wasn't my celibacy
journey was starting to stress me out I
really hated the idea of losing another
great guy to my little experiment but
being with Jay actually really reminded
me of the significance of why I was
doing this in the first place after I
told Jay I was celibate I always have
the small twinge of fear wondering when
the text that would initiate his slow
fade would finally come but it never did
I didn't stay Jay in a lot of ways like
Brandon not only said the right things
but mainly let his actions do the
talking on our first date he and I also
talked for hours which made me realize
my love of deep conversations the way he
grabbed my hand and caressed my palm and
had that same twinge of love and lust
that Brandon had introduced me to many
months ago but I feel like what really
did it was his genuine ability to
embrace new things whether that meant
making out with me while I had an
eyepatch on because I scratched my
cornea or being able to fully embrace
and not being threatened by my sex toys
or just accepting the fact that I wasn't
having sex for two more months he made
it very clear there was constant
engagement his affection and his respect
for my decisions that this is what I
needed to fully trust someone both
mentally and physically two weeks shy of
my celibacy expiration date which was
six weeks after we met I finally decided
I just want to have sex with Jay I know
I know
there were only two weeks left but I
felt like
at this point it was only going against
everything that I set out to prove my
goal was to figure out how to put my
pleasure first and learn how to build
that trust our sex is amazing but it's
not always perfect
I don't always orgasm every time but I
also love that we've built this sense of
trust where I don't feel internally
pressured to have to orgasm every time
sometimes it really is just as simple as
knowing that every part of you trust
them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
