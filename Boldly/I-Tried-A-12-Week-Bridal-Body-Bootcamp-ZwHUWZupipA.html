get longer Fitness hey
I'm Nikki and this is my fiancee Kelsey
we're getting married this year and we
can't wait to make this perfect day or
not it's wedding season and this week
we're talking fitness and nutrition
health and fitness is like what everyone
talks about when they get ready for
their wedding I'm gonna have that bride
body I'm gonna look so good everyone's
gonna look at my arms I have a really
poor relationship with health and
fitness because I don't like working out
if I don't have to be why should I be
that being said I'm a little pudgy got
some love all around all of these areas
so I am getting the help from a personal
trainer and a nutritionist to achieve my
healthy ideal bride body and who knows
maybe will it be a completely different
woman my name is Jill I'm known as the
LA bride trainer I don't really focus on
losing a certain amount of pounds right
but I want to feel healthier get better
stamina I just got a little bit of punch
and I kind of want to get rid of okay
we're gonna turn us both continents go
so intimidating first thing we're gonna
do is your pre-workout workout I'm gonna
get your heart rate up where your body's
burning calories a significant level
1500 brides
so far have had a hundred percent
success rate well and they've all been
sexy Brian okay I regret everything
going forward we'll do sculpting and
toning followed by cardio followed by
ABS yoga class or flexibility training
is the perfect way to be at your
absolute best on your big day okay you
can do that an addition to fitness
nutrition is so so key to getting the
body that you want my name is Kelly
Levesque I'm a holistic nutritionist and
wellness expert here in Los Angeles we
work together in cleaning up the diet
but for the most part it's really just
balancing blood sugar making sure
they're fueled post-workout so they have
energy if we can easily take advantage
of extending your fat burning by just
making breakfast carb free I have a
formula for smoothies it has 20 grams
approach
10 grams of fat 10 grams of fiber so
protein fat and fiber together turn off
all eight hunger hormones in your body
it's overwhelming at first but really
it's just four things my goal for this
is to be the healthiest I've ever been
because I believe that if I'm the
healthiest I've ever been I'm gonna feel
the best I've ever been and I'm gonna
look the best I've ever looked I
understood my first workout with Jill
she left like 30 minutes ago and I'm
like still recovering
so Jill has me on her 12-week bride body
program I work out with Jill three times
a week I do the bride body program by
myself I do a day of stretching and
rebound and then I do a day where I do
like 30 minutes of cardio
we just got right into it in that first
week and she kicked my ass for the first
week all I'm gonna want you to do is
have enough protein of fat at breakfast
to get yourself to lunch without being
starving so one of the first things that
Kelly wanted me to do was swap out
breakfast for smoothies this was the
first morning I did that I'm curious to
see if it's gonna be enough for me to
last through the workout even though I
could like barely handle the workout
Jill was never like a drill sergeant she
was always like let's figure out what
you can do but give a little bit more
let's try a little bit harder and that
was definitely something that I could
get down with good job today what you
just needed at our wall could probably
take somebody's three hours too long you
should be proud of yourself I was
supposed to do a little bit of cardio
over the weekend and I fell asleep in
the afternoon oops and then it was dark
outside excuses excuses
so like I found one of those aerobics
videos on Netflix Kelsey and I did one
together in the living room just to get
your body moving for 30 minutes it's
actually like really silly and really
fun my muscles weak too was really hard
because BuzzFeed's queer prom happened
over the weekend we're supposed to do
at-home yoga yesterday is but I worked
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. so I didn't do it
on top of that how do you say no to free
food so really hard to say no to these
things it's hard when like life gets in
the way work gets in the way your
routine Falls to crap and then you just
gotta start over you gotta do to get a
few of my co-workers have seen me
working out and are joining me for
today's workout
it is really hard I'm glad I did it with
other people otherwise I would have quit
after the warm-up it was a hell of a
workout I'm starting to love it though
yay hate running because they never last
very long but I was like able to
actually keep up a pace and do it
several times now I'm getting to the
point of I know what I can give and I
know what it feels like to get better I
like kind of like the workouts now ah
Who am I
I literally just worked out and now
what's happening tell say you didn't get
getting some hot pot it's zero calories
it's bacon cheddar flavor oh my god I
never realized the importance of eating
well when working out there are days
where I don't eat as much protein for
breakfast and I feel it during my
workouts Kelly's been really helpful in
healing my body in the right way for my
workout so I don't feel completely dead
after in the morning I start with a
smoothie breakfast and then at lunch
I'll have salmon or chicken cauliflower
rice and like a bunch of veggies for
dinners it's usually the same thing as
lunch so just a lot of proteins hacking
as many vegetables as I can I'm gonna be
all ready tonight
I start on my period just want pizza
we get it Nick you're on a diet great so
yeah going on Sunday Ron it's totally a
different energy when you work out by
yourself than when you do with people we
encourage each other and it was like a
really great time now that you're going
for runs with your heart it's just
important for you to just be like it
doesn't suck so much now I kind of want
to get out Johnny and move our cups to
before lunch but what Kelly's
recommending is that I don't eat between
breakfast and lunch but today's workout
I felt really really empty like I hadn't
eat and then I'm gonna give a Kelly a
call and see what she thinks and see how
I should be switching out my diet to
make sure that I don't absolutely feel
drained during workouts
yeah so next week is my birthday I'm
gonna want all the things I need to know
what is okay and what isn't otherwise
I can do that I got Korean barbecue with
a bunch of my friends and then on my
birthday weekend Kelsey and I went and
ate really really great Italian food
it's so hard for me to approach special
occasions and like not want to indulge
myself because somehow I feel like for
turning 24 I deserve cake and my diet
just completely went to shit last night
I ate Indian food thus I'm running my
body was like Nikki you okay we're on
track I'm gonna measure you I want to
see what your inch loss I had pretty
much just like lost three inches all
around which sounds great but apparently
I'm like not on track for what I should
be I know that the fitness is only half
of it and that if the fitness and the
nutrition don't line up I'm basically
sabotaging myself which is a really
frustrating thing because I feel like oh
I worked out so well let me eat this
cookie but then that cookie makes the
work out like not count anymore so at
this point I kind of just have to
recommit to eating really clean in the
long run it's only twelve weeks of my
life and the progress that I've seen so
far is crazy that I'm like excited to
see what's possible in the next four
weeks
nothing bought boxing today let's kill
it ready
yes let's do it Jill did a little bit of
boxing with me and that's a workout I
could totally get on board with my arms
are so tired all the time now I'm sore
but the good kind of solar I remember
the first workout that Jill and I had
together and we are just miles ahead of
that now makes me really excited to know
what's gonna happen in like 12 weeks I'm
just super impressed by the fact that
every session you go all-out I'm like
really impressed with myself so this is
like a typical lunch some salmon
Bellflower ice and veggie stir-fry I'll
clean no flavor no love no like fine I'm
fine with it I look different like my
body looks different smaller these last
four weeks were tough Jill really ramped
up my workouts I did more cardio every
time I did more strength every time I
did more weights and on top of that I
did SoulCycle classes on the weekend
which are just giant sweat fests this is
our final workout we're gonna do exactly
the same workout that we did on day one
brick by this time the very first time
we worked out you already sat down and I
know now you could go for sure
to the end of it one more rep I'm done
you did it yeah I didn't think we'd make
it no I knew you'd make it whatever I
asked of you you always do and I
sometimes don't get that from people
thank you you're welcome
oh my god this is the most challenging
aspect of the entire process but
honestly it's been the most rewarding
three things I learned from this
experience one there's no way that
changing everything about your diet and
your fitness isn't hard there's no easy
way out you just got to put in the time
and you got to be really really
disciplined that being said to not
everything works for everyone you have
to find what works for you someone else
could have done the exact same diet and
workout regimen that I did and had
completely different results but don't
give up if one thing doesn't work for
you three this is possible if I can do
it honestly you can do it 12 weeks
fitness nutrition Bridal body bootcamp
now I just have to make sure for the
next month before the wedding I don't
eat a piece of every day just no matter
how fit and clean you are lots about
pizza will never end
wedding planning next on wedding season</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
