of my new outfit look I feel like you
should be fronting a punk rock bands
really yeah kinda
I really hate shopping in the whittling
section because it's too feminine and
doesn't really fit my style but I also
don't like shopping in the men's section
because it's boxy and it usually doesn't
fit me right grayscale goods is for
people like me who are more masculine of
Center hello hi I'm Sarah med I'm the
founder and CEO of grayscale goods I'm
gay and I have a ton of queer friends
one girlfriend would be saying oh I love
stitch fix it's awesome and then her
girlfriend would be saying yeah I wish I
could do it but I wouldn't like anything
that comes in that box it's just kind of
dawned on me so what are the next steps
that we're gonna take the first thing
that you want to do is go to the style
profile the style profile consisted of
four parts part one your body these were
a general body measurements such as
height weight and body type what best
describes your body shape I guess I'm a
column part to sizes and fit are to ask
me which sizes I typically wear and how
I like my clothes to fit part three your
style I was asked to pick from outfits
that I would typically wear on several
occasions as well as my style crush
which contrary to popular belief is not
Ellen DeGeneres but Ellen Page to
complete my style profile I uploaded a
full-length picture of myself wearing
something I'd wear on a typical day part
for payment there are three budget price
points to choose from and Sarah sent me
items from slate and charcoal also
there's a styling fee of 48 dollars for
each box that you received I'm ready to
ship out your order I pull up your style
profile and I go shopping for you and
then you get an email saying you're
getting your box in two days
whatever you keep we charge you whatever
you don't want to keep then you put back
in a prepaid return envelope and it
comes back to me if here in total I
received two pairs of pants four
button-down shirts three bow ties and
two neckties and one corduroy blazer
this is
how much everything cost you think some
clothes that I already owned I put
together three complete looks I really
like the fit of the shirt even though
it's more of a boxy fit this collar
necklace is something that I never would
have picked out on my own
but I actually really like it overall
this look is something that will
definitely add some variety to my
wardrobe this is more of a casual look
that I would wear on an everyday basis I
really really want to keep this flannel
but I think I'm gonna have to save
myself for myself and not by another
flannel the final outfit that I was able
to put together is a more formal look
the jacket fits perfectly I really like
the white button-down kippur shirt it
wasn't too boxy but it also wasn't too
fitted now all that was left to do was
to send back the clothes I didn't want
in the prepaid bag that came with a box
of clothes overall my experience with
grayscale goods has been very positive
it's awesome that there's a service out
there that caters to people who dress a
little bit more androgynous Lee my
favorite part of it is always working
with real people you can really see that
you're making a difference in their
lives there's something about looking in
the mirror and knowing that you look the
way that you want to look and that's a
journey for so many people in so many
ways but clothing can really play a huge
part in that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
