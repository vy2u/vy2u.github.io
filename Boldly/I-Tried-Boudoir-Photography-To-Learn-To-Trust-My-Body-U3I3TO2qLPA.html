strides in my weight-loss journey and
then a few months later I just happened
to really be looking at myself in the
mirror one day and I realized that my
clothes actually didn't fit me as well
as I thought they did and that I had
actually gained a ton of weight and this
was just the first time I was really
seeing it and seeing myself in this way
made me realize how much I actually
don't really trust my own perception of
my body I wanted to try boudoir
photography because I've definitely been
a lot more critical of my body given my
recent weight gain I'm really tired of
feeling like my weight dictates my
beauty and my worth what I like about
this style of photography is to see
people out of their comfort zone but
owning what's happening around them I
was really nervous about letting people
see my body like this I have stretch
marks
I have rolls I have acne I was
definitely all in my head at first eyes
forward my shoes you know I was
definitely just kind of like I don't
know what the hell I'm doing how's my
face
good yeah there was a moment where I was
trying to put my finger in my mouth all
cute and sexy and like it definitely
wasn't working for me all I could think
about was the horrible things that my
body was doing and how these photos were
gonna be awful and what did I get myself
into
and then Christophe a witch showed me
pictures of myself in between shots and
I would have like a fall out-of-body
experience because I was like who is
this girl who's this really confident
and beautiful girl that you're taking
photos off and you'd be like that's you
and I'm like that's not me that can't be
me and it's really sad how easy it is
for us to be so negative about ourselves
and to not believe that we can take
beautiful photos or that we can be
beautiful people I think for most of my
life I believed that my beauty was
dictated by the number on the scale so
the skinny I was able to get the
prettier I'd be for about three years
when I was in my teens I fluctuated
between starving myself and binge eating
and extreme exercising you know nothing
was sustainable because I didn't really
see any value in myself to begin with
for me being healthy is being together
mentally as well as physically
I know that I'm still gonna have days in
the future where I'm going to question
my value of my work because of my size
but I think what I love now is that I'll
have these pictures to say hey like that
confident and amazingly happy and
beautiful girl that's you and that's you
with weight gain so it's like you know
if you can look this fabulous in this
confident at this size you can look
fabulous and confident at any size
feeling comfortable with who you are
whether that to being a hundred pounds
or 300 pounds is so much more sexy and
desirable than looking good in the way
that society says looking good is
supposed to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
