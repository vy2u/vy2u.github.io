married and one of the problems that I
have is that I have to go to the
bathroom all the time so I was wondering
how am I actually going to use the
bathroom in my wedding dress we're gonna
try lifting the skirt over the back of
my head while my friend lifts my skirt
from the front this one I'm very worried
about why because I'm not gonna be able
to see the water okay oh my god everyone
should give their bridesmaids more
presents I don't know I don't know what
to do yep I feel like I'm a cave dweller
like how do you take care I hate like
dumb trying I'm trying
alright I did it oh we did it yeah you
literally if the stare be in the iyp
haha good bonding go okay this is the
bridal buddy I'm going to put it on
under my skirt and draw it close like a
drawstring and I should be able to
gather my friends skirt in it so I can
sit on the toilet let's see if that
works
I gotta get under this thing I will say
that this thing probably shouldn't be
white cuz it's very confusing okay
that's an arm shoot um we have the best
oh so so far I've learned that you have
to put this on before you put the dress
on oh snap
all right I did it
yay I didn't quite get it right but it
did work I'm also going to try the trash
bag method where I tear a hole in the
bottom of the trash bag step into it and
then gather my skirt into it there we go
okay like I'm taking out the trash and
I'm the trash just when you think you're
out of dress it just keeps going okay oh
okay any of you got it
tada I think that this is a very cheap
effective way of peeing by yourself you
do feel a bit like a bag of trash we're
gonna try sitting backwards on the
toilet and having my lovely friend here
lift up my dress from the back while I
lift it up from the front all right
first of all I got to turn around sit I
did it yes we did it we did it
ooh this is a good method no it just
depends on peeing in front of your
friend overall depending on the type of
dress you decide on sitting backwards on
the toilet or the trash bag were the
most effective ways to go but sitting
backwards on the toilet is free first of
all and only requires you to be able to
pee in from another person so start
practicing now be nice to your
bridesmaids
it's not easy helping someone pee in a
wedding dress I'm super sorry
bridesmaids everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
