$88 and the ones I'm wearing right now
are cheaper than that are you surprised
by those yes I'm blown away so this week
you're going to be trying Spanx as well
as the cheaper versions of Spanx that
they sell in targets and Kohl's everyone
knows about Spanx they cinch in your
waist give you those clean lines
whatever celebrities talk about wearing
shapewear it's always banks brand but
they're also really expensive which is
great because they also make a lower end
line called assets I have a theory that
the cheaper versions of Spanx are
probably just as good as the more
expensive versions so we decided to try
a bunch of different types of products
I'm gonna be wearing very skin tight
dresses taking photos seeing if anyone
will be able to tell the difference
these are the cheaper Spanx short I feel
like a mushroom wearing black shorts
they are already rolling down my back I
don't know why it's doing this I secured
it these are the cheaper assets short
they are the thickest fabric here are
the more expensive staying shorts
they're slightly easier to get on than
any of the other shorts there's a light
fabric you want but it doesn't roll down
these like the same they're like the
twins from the shining these are the
space tights the weird thing about the
tights is that I do feel flattered even
though I know I'm not flattered so these
are the assets they are $14 you feel
secure it feels comfortable
this is the Spanx bodysuit it is the
most expensive thing I tried on this is
the assets bodysuit it's $60 my body
just looks the same overall I'd say my
favorite thing were the $14 pair of
tights once I put everything on and
realized how similarly they felt I
wondered if they even looked different
we took a bunch of pictures of me
wearing the Spanx in the same dress to
see how they compared it wasn't so much
pushing everything in as it was just
pushing everything up I had a rounder
butt but I also had a round or tummy
I have always assumed that more
expensive Spanx equals littler okay now
I'm gonna go ask some of my friends if
they think I'm wearing Spanx and if I am
wearing Spanx how much it costs and
we're in country are you wearing Spanx
or not um I've never looked at you this
deeply ah
I see your buzz yeah am I wearing Spanx
right now yeah okay your posture has
changed okay
these are like 15 15 bucks am i wearing
Spanx right now yes or no no are you no
this one looks great it does I don't
think you're wearing Spanx
when you're wearing them do they hurt
more no I'm sense of fun they feel got
the same then what's the goddamn
difference a lot of people struggle to
figure out whether or not I was wearing
cheap or expensive Spanx or Spanx at all
you're gonna guess which of the group is
the most expensive which is the least
expensive most expensive being one and
then middle to least expensive three you
think the one on the far left is the
most expensive and one in the middle is
the middle expensive and the one on the
far right is the cheapest yes the
purpose of things that like suck you in
right presumably right presumably it's
kind of like sucking you in the most
medium and the least no wait that's not
what I go with your one I think you're
you're overthinking this
this feels like an eye examination I
love it your butt looks really good in
this one okay so I must say like this
one is 60 so I think that the the most
expensive is the photo on the far left
the medium is the one on the far right
and the cheapest is the one in the
middle how long did it take you to try
on all these Spanx way too long can they
all be evenly priced is that an option
do you think they're all evenly priced
all three photos look exactly the same
to me you said that this one was the
most expensive yeah this one was the
middle one and asked when was the least
one this is $88 this is $60 and this is
just underwear what what I don't see it
I looked at pictures of me in just my
underwear four times and you ascribe
them with four different values I should
not be on The Price is Right ever one I
feel deceived to feel a little dumb
everyone should feel free to wear things
that make them feel better but I think
that we've all been kind of conditioned
to believe that Spanx are just like this
thing that we need to look smaller and
slimmer no one really notices I think
wear what you want but don't feel like
you need this in order to be the best
you things do come with these great
little butt holes because having a big
butt is in right now so we don't want to
touch those in too much
