I would think but who knows it could be
crazy
I've never been very girly I've never
been good at makeup I've never thought I
was good at makeup so I kind of just
didn't try it was easier to say didn't
try and to try and to fail
whoa that's a feeling out there and
forth this is just to cover your lower
lashes
Oh
Oh
holy crap no oh my god I really don't
even think I recognized you want that
different feeling to look very different
this is bizarre can't stop staring at
myself though good day in my life I'd
ever hear Kaitlyn says she can't love to
get her stuff oh I'm all about like hide
or minimize any attention another fact
that I have these like boom eyelashes
I'm kind of a psycho honestly I feel
like I'm looking at a snapchat filter I
dislike now this is a mirror one thing
that is really weird is when you take a
shower and then they get really heavy
and then you can't see - blow-dry my
eyelashes after my shower because Vegas
this is my life now
they got a receipt you do like people at
work just kind of stared for a while
they either said something or they're
just colic hmm like you doing a view
butter eyelashes and I was like yeah in
last four days which is how long I have
had these elections usually but
absolutely none
kind of like being like a celebrity but
like you woke up like this
Justin yoga I haven't say that I do
really enjoy the fact that makeup
running all down my face I have big
eyelashes on and nothing else so gonna
yoga is like a breeze because it's like
well I don't have like a giant raccoon
eyes less cool
this isn't finally the most fun I've had
with something beauty related in a very
long time and I just want about my
eyelashes all the time even though I
look really dumb I'm sure so admittedly
I have had quite a few glasses of wine
but tonight I am really really liking
these flashes I don't know why
I think I've decided that ultimately I
really like these lashes but I don't
think I want to keep them which is I
know I'm contradictory but I don't want
to brush my eyelashes anymore or like
dry them after the shower or find them
on my flow do you see that that's an
eyelash that fell out while I was
sleeping I think I would do again I just
personally for me I don't think it's
something I want all the time how did it
feel having something like this what the
attention was like drawn to you
I honestly hated having extra attention
ah yeah our beauty thing that we should
make you try one day we're having permed
your hair this is my beautiful BuzzFeed
boss friend you have in the comments
below have an idea what we could do to
her next let me know and we're gonna
prove your hand 5 I'm at the end of the
day I guess they're really just hairs
growing out of your eyelid so I'm very
glamorous say what you think about like
the new maker I look huge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
