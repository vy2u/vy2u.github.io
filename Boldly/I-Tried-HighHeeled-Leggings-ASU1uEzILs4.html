my but in this box there are high-heeled
leggings and I'm gonna see what the that
means oh my god they're green
is this a color you chose mm okay smells
like like a swimming cap to me oh my God
look at these this is a high-heeled and
it's fully attached I'm to the legging
if you want to wear these pants you
gotta wear these shoes like a which is a
witch's shoe they expect everyone with a
size 8 shoe to wear the same to be able
to fit to these pants okay
well let's test it out I guess these are
kind of like superhero pants right now
everyone will remember these they will
be burned into their retinas the
material feels really nice very
stretchable I was surprised to find out
that it was pretty see-through how much
are these
okay 195 I think the shoe should be a
little more comfortable well I'm gonna
go show these to people and see what
they think of them and hopefully they're
not to me I want to know what you think
of my pants is there like a Robin Hood
convention I think you kinda look like
Peter Pan for like sexy Peter Pan there
needs to be a separation between the
shoe and the pant your boots are
connected to your tights thing what do
you even call them bites it's a moment
they are stylish this is a good color to
see this wrong man am i smelling them it
smell very yep they do boot pants I love
them this is like serious superhero
vibes this is not something a good guy
was where this person you know stabs
people in the eye with the stiletto stab
stab and they see through if you bend
over okay let's find out are you under
where you're not right I can't tell your
outfit is basically done all you gotta
do is find a top how do you wash these
yeah I was thinking that dude I guess
you just tossed them in the washing hand
wash gotta be hand-washed
are they like $200 bingo bitch that's
too much I think that's worth it what if
you you need to go to the bathroom out
your shoes on and what celebrity do you
think could pull these off Rihanna
literally only Rihanna yo-yo could pull
these off obviously everyone says
Rihanna would you ever wear them no no
oh yeah are you kidding me
either you loved it or you hated it I
wasn't sure how to style these and I put
a jean jacket on because that makes
everything look cool I will wear them
with a dress so that you can't see my
but I'm eager to take these off and I
definitely should have worn them with
socks
all right good can I take these off
someone just got raptured but they're
like feet stayed
leggins attached to shoes baby I'm gonna
hit myself okay oh my god I suddenly got
afraid I was gonna hit some lights</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
