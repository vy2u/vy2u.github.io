I'm very close we actually tried for
months to find someone who would let me
walk in a plus-size runway show and one
of the bigger problems we ran into
besides that I'm not actually a
plus-size model is that I'm too short
I'm 5 foot 3 I think we're used to
beautiful women being very tall so when
we see shorter women doing something
we're just like where did 1/3 of you go
I think it's gonna be awesome I think if
anything like I just want to prove
publicly that I am gonna be good at this
I saw that I was like that's me yeah
that's my face so what are we gonna be
doing today you're gonna get to put on
your three looks we're gonna have our
tailors pin them make sure they fit you
perfectly
I've three looks give three like okay
we're excited to show you what we picked
out for you I'm excited too let's do it
very intimidating to be changing while
like eight people are waiting for you to
get dressed
yes all of my girlhood dreams are coming
true look what this does I'm going to
need to do some this jacket oh yeah I
very short arms
I feel like an American Girl doll look
in the best possible way
after the fittings I was feeling good we
just looked torrent I love the office I
got it's very intense like you're in a
room and there's just several people who
are focused exclusively on your body and
there is nowhere to hide and then on
Friday were coming back to do the runway
show I'm excited and terrified I'm
excited I walked out the door this
morning without remembering that a lot
of people are gonna see my underwear
today so I had to go back figure out
what underwear I can like make peace
with God about everyone singing turns
out not many pairs I felt pretty good
going into this and by the morning of my
confidence was swirling down the toilet
like I see the runway when we get there
and it's so long I feel like I shouldn't
be allowed here to start the day one of
towards brand ambassadors Georgina gave
me some tips on how to walk the runway
from winning girls I'm Georgina bag and
amatory brand ambassador this is a long
runway like full stop so you've got to
give energy from the minute you get on
to the end and back again remember when
she got your garments on they're gonna
be steamed and prepped no sitting down
you're now professional you stand up and
if your feet hurt you suck it up
welcome to model school all the other
girls I'm walking with are beautiful
they are so tall they just like wear
clothes the way that like you've always
wanted to wear clothes and so I stick
out like a very short strange thumb so
I'm gonna be closing the show yes at the
end up in my the way that's the most
important job you're the last memory
they take away from that show Oh usually
at the end of the runway they'll be like
a pit of cameras and you get blinded and
it's
that's when the magic happens stressful
it's like you're walking to your doom a
little bit yeah so many little things
you can think about what do you do with
your eyes we do with your hair what you
do with your hand one thing you may want
to watch is your arms like yeah let's
not swing them too much so this raises
bad so that's not when I go to the
grocery store a little happier in the
face feels like you want to kill someone
we're walking into it the cookie turn
that one you nailed awesome I think you
got this happy then it was time for hair
and makeup I assumed that my hair would
be like long and curly and luscious a
big because I consider my hair to be my
best feature but then they told me they
wanted to put it in a ponytail
and I was very scared ponytails make me
very nervous so I mean I think that my
anxieties about it probably kept me from
enjoying it as much as I could it really
forced me to be like okay here are my
features and I have to like them whether
I want to like them or not oh boy that's
crazy
it's so pretty they also let me know
they wanted me to go out my glasses so
both of my security items completely
gone you're exposed I'm very excited
flow to the elements oh our cat I like
to wear big glasses because I feel like
my eyes sink into my face that
definitely is like Finn anxiety of mine
let's do some eyes
yay eyes so for makeup they gave me a
really bold eye and a basically nude lip
which is the opposite of what I do you
have to trust that people can see you
and see their vision on you and that
your insecurities don't really mean much
in the grand scheme okay that's it oh my
god you love it this is awesome
like the one
yes awesome on the show I start having a
little meltdown um did that think that I
would be the scared I am a little bit
though so cool everybody in the
environment was super positive except
for the little mean voices in my head I
started thinking about like why did I
think this is a good idea could I
possibly still get out of this right
before we went onstage I literally
almost started to cry and we look I
can't cry my eye makeup will run
everywhere every step I took was like
don't cry please don't cry like it was
the stress of just being there and how
loud it was and how like unprepared I
felt and how horrible I was just like I
can't cry I can't cry I can't cry
I got upstage the first time it was like
I think we should leave the first quick
change went okay I definitely change
with plenty of time to spare
too late to go home right just I just
thought I'd check a lot of it is letting
the clothes do the work for you so I
thought like I would just do this little
unrehearsed spin in the middle of the
runway on the way back usually I don't
like to do things that I don't plan but
this turned out ok and people liked it
and they cheered a little more I can do
this guy's I'm not about to cry anymore
so
I'm like an action try Oh God
I know what the relief of having done it
my body literally quit and just started
leaking okay to my feelings I went into
this thinking that I was gonna be fine I
did not expect that this required nerves
of steel yeah I feel like it got knocked
down a few pegs if you could walk a
runway there's probably all sorts of
things that you fear that you can also
do
