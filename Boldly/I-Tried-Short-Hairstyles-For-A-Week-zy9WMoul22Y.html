hairstyles over the course of a week my
hair is so important to me it's like
basically a security blanket that grows
out of my head I always have admired
short hairstyles I think they're really
cool but I don't think they're cool on
me and I've been told repeatedly I have
a round face I cannot do short hair I
think I've had long hair for a long time
and I'm very curious to see whether or
not that's actually the best thing for
my face okay let's try some short hair
I'm very worried look like oh my god I'm
never in here like this before
I live with a fat best friend and wrong
call he's so good at opening my own I'm
T feminist bookstore yeah I cannot get
over this hair keep going from Mirror to
mirror being like what does it look like
here and also here Wow
are you evolving yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes oh I told you you'd look good
with short hair I told you I won't you
yeah well good on you feel like wigs are
better being hair than hair is this is
like the green beret of hair I would
never get this much volume in real life
I love that color that color warms you
up so much I am shocked by this
revelation but actually it's great very
on-trend long bond love you're really
funny all right
and today one pretty successful
it's very different it feels too short I
know this look is supposed to be like
early 2000 Sarah Jessica Parker and if
you ignore my face it is I feel like
there's two commas around my head like
my face is in quotation marks
in ways when you have less hair every
piece of it matters much more like if
one little part of this is out of place
the whole Jenga tower comes down it's
like I do this and like I don't know
what like this is gonna take me to oh I
don't even know
not ever it what do you think about
Kristen it's you look older look
southern someone just said hey you look
different today what's wrong with you
this hairstyle is interesting so we're
on three everywhere
oh wow I don't know if I like this one
Debbie's like and weird little side
pieces I kind of look like a sassy Civil
War general so this is more of like an
a-line Bob got some staff players in the
back but I don't like it
it's definitely drawing lots of
attention to here what I don't want that
the bangs are nice though I like the
bangs but it looks cute this actually
might be my number one this hair is very
Katie Holmes around her Tom Cruise era
and she makes us look very glamorous so
it's not like this haircut doesn't have
a good head home but wants one it's just
that my body is probably not the
neighborhood this haircut should move
into
person better near a mirror I haven't
seen myself yet here we go I'm like on
the run from myself I'm Becky
like someone who will cut you because
I've already cut something not afraid to
cut you all right guys what do you think
of this one no I'm sorry you with me oh
that is just the angle there I really
like this a lot I feel like the length
works for you
what egg Hut I think there are nice
things about this I just don't know if
this is the shape for me I asked my
fiancee when he thought of my hair and
he replied sure same buddy
frigo already got a mirror who's full
mom I'm complete now this is the last
week is there anything about this that
you like colonel no man when I
inevitably turn 40 I should not do this
here
I look like Snape's middle-aged mother
she's very mad at him because he hasn't
gotten married yet wait I gosh it's
getting to the point where I just hope I
don't see anyone I know so I don't talk
about my hair was born looking like this
- the lipstick in the glasses
I wake up basically this is what I look
like I was born it was the best of times
it was the Bobst of times as soon as I
put the short hair in my head it changed
my whole face I didn't realize how many
different kinds of short hairstyles are
wearing that sounds dumb
you think short hairstyle you just think
like this short the end well like
actually there's the long bob and
there's like things and then there's
like the nineties cut it was like an
Instagram filter but much more expensive
people's research will react it to my
hair a lot but if I did I think I
thought that no short hairstyles worked
for me but actually some do some still
do not and that's okay not every
hairstyle works for every person I think
that you should try any hairstyles just
try to vote you're gonna
that'd be like wow so hip and cool
because you were so Chrissy missed my
last day of short hair I wanted to show
her what it looked like am I just gonna
look at this photo of you yes it is why
does it have a center part
