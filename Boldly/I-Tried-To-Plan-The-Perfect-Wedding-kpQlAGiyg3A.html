priorities have fun eat cake get married
get married
hey I'm Nikki and this is my fiance
Kelsey we're getting married this year
and we can't wait to make this perfect
day our it's wedding season and this
week I'm getting married it's wedding
season and I'm getting married
while weddings are like really fun they
make you do a lot of really crazy stuff
ah I'm gonna try my best to remind
myself through all of this that it's
also that we can celebrate our
relationship together very emotional
because for a long time this was not a
reality in my mind and it was not a
reality in the world anywhere and so I'm
very very fortunate to not only like
legally marry the person that I so
hopelessly loved but I get to do it in a
way that celebrates who we are looks
like really fun friends and family in a
really beautiful place lots of cake it's
gonna be beautiful and everyone's gonna
the best time of their life having the
same vision it's going to set the tone
for the whole wedding planning process
Chelsey and I didn't have a traditional
wedding planner because it's not
something we could fit into our budget
we ran into this thing called the white
box which is online virtual planning
tools as well as signing experts who can
help you with every aspect of wedding
planning we went ahead and fill out
their questionnaire we told them who we
are as a couple oh he sounds like such a
lesbian couple yeah I'll take the cat
part out what our ideal wedding looks
like intimate time with close friends
also cute dogs
my mom's Doc's will be there and what
areas we needed help with ways to take
our current plan to next level submit
after we fill out the questionnaire
we're gonna get a call from one of the
founders of white box I'm Tara the white
box we help you when putting together
like your budget
look at making these big decisions put
them together in a box and then ship
them to your door yes there's wedding
palette color linen samples invitations
that you could use they did everything
from helping us build out our timeline
to finding specific rental places near
our venue and it was like really really
fun because they sent us candy
well my skin is glowy my hair is
beautiful I have lost about 10 pounds
and I have a suit that I look great in
and I'm getting married in like a week
our wedding was in Washington State
Kelsey and I both grew up there so we
loved the Northwest all of our friends
and family were like in the same place
for the whole weekend we decided to have
our first look which is when we see each
other before the ceremony
it was one of those things where the
weather was perfect the lighting was
perfect
it was just this really great moment
where everything came together
and she looked amazing like it's really
great to start all of the wedding
festivities with just that intimate
moment with the two of us and from that
point on being like alright what do we
do now we do together the wedding itself
was in an outdoor garden it was really
really beautiful because you can see the
water we were so lucky that we had good
weather so my mom has a lot of dogs two
of which were in the wedding and they
pretty much stole the show
welcome to the most happy of days as we
join in the celebration of making
cozy and I met when we were both pretty
young we spent a lot of the beginning of
our relationship in secret honestly to
think about those days where we first
decided to be together to now is one of
the most astonishing things I've ever
seen in my life and probably will ever
see in my life ladies you may kiss I've
always known that I wanted to get
married I've been really lucky to grow
up with parents who have just been a
great model for marriage that's always
been something that's really inspiring
to me the wedding itself was actually
this really great time that Kelsey and I
spent together through the ceremony
through the reception we were just
holding hands or holding each other just
the whole time and those were often just
like really intimate and lovely times
just to be together and we made sure to
schedule that kind of time in so it was
like a little bit of hanging out with
people and a little bit of time to
ourselves it was a perfect day
everything came together a place was
more beautiful than I could have
imagined
we like were able to enjoy the day with
our friends and family it really felt
like such a privilege to not feel like
we needed to do this in secret or we
need it to be anything else than who we
actually were if you told me five years
ago that this is what my wedding would
have looked like and maybe wouldn't have
believed you so this has been one big
journey and I did a lot of work in terms
of like being a bride and prepping
myself for this wedding I got Botox done
my eyebrows mic related I got an amazing
suit custom-made I worked out dieted for
12 weeks I tried out a bunch of
different hair and makeup looks I think
my goal early on was to be as physically
healthy as I could and it totally worked
I have never been this healthy and I
really do feel like I was like in the
prime of my life on my wedding day for
the honeymoon we went
Italy and I ate a lot ice cream and I
got a little bit fat in a little bit
tamp here I'm married
