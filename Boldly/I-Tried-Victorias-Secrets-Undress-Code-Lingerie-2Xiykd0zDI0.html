like yeah Nina how are you doing today
eyes up here buddy
so Victoria's Secret recently launched
this new line of lingerie that they
termed the undress code it's a bunch of
lingerie pieces like bralette sand like
lace bodysuit sliced skirts that are
very lingerie like but are designed to
be worn as real clothes I guess so they
actually pulled the ads because of all
the backlash they got but the pieces are
still available for sale on their site
so I thought it would be fun to buy some
of them and try them on the way they
styled it was a woman wearing this skirt
with just an oversized sweater I feel
naked and very clothes at the same time
I'm not even sure if I'd be able to sit
down in a hole on this tape I don't hate
the skirt put it under like a cute dress
maybe that's like short is your dress
it's a skirt oh it's a see-through skirt
oh where would you wear it in the
bedroom yeah it's on but I also kind of
want to borrow it yeah I love it
we're not some Paula's birthday Oh
sweetie okay I mean it's cute and it's
comfortable I don't think I'm gonna be
fooling anyone nobody is gonna think
that this is a dress it's like shiny and
lacy I don't have the straps June
stirred right it really shows my
cleavage off oh my god look at your
boobs I think that slip dresses are
really cool right now because hey night
is done yeah oh my goodness I think it's
like Marco tires no no it's really cute
after six noted
this is the one I feel most naked in
it's not great it's not really lifting
or separating or anything the way my
boobs have been designed if I put a
blazer over this it just like completely
covers up like any of like the actual
cuteness of the bra oh my god let me out
oh oh do you think this is work
appropriate no energy small angel people
working okay where are they employee I'm
not gonna lie I can't see anything but
is it Society conditioning me or it's
just your boobs I can't even imagine
what was going through their heads
honestly like they know they do lingerie
but they can't pretend like you can just
wear lingerie like out in the world
underwear as outerwear just because they
said it was okay they're very cute and
they're very comfortable I would
definitely buy them as lingerie or as
like loungewear I love my body I love my
boobs I'm very proud of them I think
they look very nice but like I'm not
super optical showing them off this much
you do you and you should feel empowered
but underwear as outerwear is a lie hi
oh my god there's just so much food yeah
I'm just sorry I mean Mohammed looks
great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
