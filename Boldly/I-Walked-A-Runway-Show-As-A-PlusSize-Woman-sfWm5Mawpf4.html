Fashion Week and I'm going to be walking
in a runway show as a plus-sized woman
for the first time so this fashion show
is the biggest queer fashion show at New
York Fashion Week it is going to be
insane there are several designers there
are several models ranging from skinny
to plus-sized to extremely androgynous
to extremely feminine to all across the
board and everyone is just they're going
to be working it I'm nervous to have
everybody looking at me all at once in
front of my face try not to freak out
right now I think it's one thing to like
post a picture and people like you but
it's another thing to be like in the
flesh walking in front of people I'm
very excited to be representing the line
I'm walking for Suzhou because this is
more of a street fashion line and I
think that style is more me I'm on my
way to my fitting my first fitting I've
ever done well actually I did one
fitting and I forgot my underwear once
so I'm wearing underwear and I'm going
to my second fitting of my life I'm
nervous because I hope I don't have to
walk in front of them either because I
just realized today that I should
probably start practicing a walk of some
sort I got to go and see a line that's
going to be premiering in the fashion
show
and it looks so awesome they had me try
on two different outfits one a black and
white outfit with a hood and another one
was a pink and black outfit that I had
to like take off and reverse
I'm kind of terrified if I'm gonna have
to do that for this fashion show like
I'm gonna have to be on point and on my
 I'm not 100% sure if I'm ready but
there's literally no turning back now
we're on our way to rehearsals to the
Brooklyn Museum I'm freaking out I'm a
little bit nervous to figure out if I'm
going to have to change my jacket
onstage because I feel like I'm going to
screw that up even though I put on a lot
of jackets and my time I got to the
museum and I saw where we were gonna
walk and it was so insane
I'm serious ago myself a little cry
honestly don't know what to think about
that I really like the area because it
looked like we were the art that was in
the museum it was really cool so I went
to the final fitting to find out what I
was gonna wear since I had no clue and
the designers decided to give me the
bomber jacket which only meant one thing
the reverse and so we are going to have
tonight
reverse it on the runway are you Kara
mm-hmm
yeah mm-hmm I've been dreading this
moment I got my makeup done honestly I'm
very skeptical about other people doing
my makeup and Lisa was the bomb while I
was getting my makeup done I found out
that we were doing the run-through and
that's where everybody else was and they
announced to us the way to walk so I had
to walk out stop at a certain place and
pose and then I had to walk down pose
and then I had to turn with my right
foot during the walkthrough I had to run
back downstairs and get the rest of my
makeup done
and then I had to go back upstairs for
the rest of the walkthrough alright I'm
nervous as I'm not gonna lie we're
lining up in 20 minutes apparently I
have to take this jacket on and off and
reverse it but I'm ready and I'm
confident and I'm just excited before I
knew it everything that we've been
prepping for and flew across the nation
for was here and I was walking in this
runway shell I remember like walking up
and looking down and then like from then
on I don't remember anything I know I
messed up on my jacket I should have
practiced more I walked back and blessed
I did a trip or fall or anything like
that I was so scared
being that this show is the biggest LGBT
show it was so true to the LGBT culture
of just like fun and acceptance and
rocking what you have at all times
people went on that runway and worked it
everyone was like cheering for each
other backstage on stage it was just
like a big huge show where we just set
and praised everybody the designers the
models the clothing everything I think
my biggest takeaway from this whole
experience of walking in a runway show
as a plus-size woman is just if you want
to go out and do this you can from this
whole experience I think I reached a new
confidence of myself that just like I
really can do this and I can do this
well and I can like go out there and not
be the Tyra
or the Naomi Campbell but I can be the
Jasmine and that's all that I need to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
