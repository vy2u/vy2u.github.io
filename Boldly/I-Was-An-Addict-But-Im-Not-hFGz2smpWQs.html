underwater for so long and you're just
waiting to come up for air and the
diction is just never being able to
reach the top that make sense
it started off just having drinks and
partying and then it ended up getting a
lot worse all the time I knew it was a
problem when I overdosed your brain was
tricking your body into thinking that
like things are just normal and that
everybody else is screwed up and I was
an addict I was an addict I was an
addict
I wasn't addict but I'm not more
creative because of it I'm not a
terrible person but I'm not dishonest
but I am NOT weak
it doesn't mean that we're weak it means
that we suffer from a disease I'm not
unaware of the harm that I caused people
I'm just learning to forgive myself but
I'm not an idiot
but I don't blame you from my problems
I'm a healthy happy person and I am a
taxpaying citizen and I'm still working
on myself I'm a good friend I'm a loving
caring boyfriend my life actually
changed for the better and I am a good
son that might be up for debate I'm not
a party pooper
I am the best kind of quitter every day
I wake up it's I have something else to
be thankful for my worst day sober is
better than my best day drinking and I
just want to make sure I spread the gift
of sobriety to other people for anybody
who's out there who has an addiction
there are people out there who started
off just like you try one day at a time
I was an addict I was an addict I was an
addict I was an addict and I am three
years clean I'll be coming up on my
fourth year I'm 22 years clean it feels
really good to say that thank you for
letting me share and not judging me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
