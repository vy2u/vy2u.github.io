started looking for a wedding dress
obviously Kleinfeld is the most famous
bridal salon in the world so if you're
looking for a dress why not go to the
Disneyland of bridal salons when you
first go in it's like a palace like a
Barbie Dreamhouse of every dress you
could possibly imagine on earth there's
lots of people there people come
together in like huge groups it's like a
huge group family thing for people to do
I've seen say yes to the dress so I was
really worried about finding something
in my size or if I had feel really
terrible about myself afterwards so they
put you in a room and they give you a
little robe so you feel like you're in a
very fancy gynecologists office they
asked me what kind of dress I wanted and
I said big princessy ball gowns so they
said they would be right back with as
many ball gowns I could possibly try on
first they put me in a Jim Hjelm ball
gown which was the most overwhelming
thing I've ever put on my body this was
literally a 14 layer dress I had no idea
that ball gowns were this hard to wear
it was honestly like being shoved in
like a ton of packing peanuts the other
thing was that I was not prepared for
how quiet the room was when I was in
there it was like a graveyard everyone
was just silent waiting for me to react
which was so intimidating because you
think when they're being silent that
like they just don't like the dress then
they brought in this Maggie Sottero
dress that was like and it was not a
silhouette I was very comfortable in at
first and the consultants listened very
patiently but even after awhile I had to
admit it was pretty sweet dress so then
the consultants realized I was falling
in love with the dress a little bit so
they left me alone wearing it I tried to
sit down on it but my boobs ended up
vacationing under my chin so I figured
that probably wouldn't be a good choice
for my wedding day so at this point I
kind of thought I wasn't going to be
able to find a dress because in my mind
there are only two types of wedding
dresses the kind that stick to you and
the kind that are the size of planets so
then they brought in this Michelle Roth
dress that was literally the greatest
thing I have ever put on my body it was
like a wheelbarrow full of puppies that
never leave you voicemails it was
seriously so beauty
all I could do was just turn in circles
and curse so then they asked me if I
want to try it on with a belt in a veil
and of course I did I now understand
what people cry when they see their
daughters in veils I almost cried I
didn't cry but I did say she a lot which
is what I do when I'm trying not to cry
so while I was alone wearing the dress
the owner came by to tell me that the
dress looked slenderizing on me and I
don't know if that's something that she
says to everybody but I believed it so I
ended up learning a lot about the
Kleinfeld process first of all if you
don't like pnina tornai don't worry her
name will not come up in your
appointment unless you want her to also
they won't tell you that a dress is nice
just so they can make a sale they let
you come to that conclusion all on your
own but also they won't tell you how
much a dress costs until it's on your
body so you better be honest about your
budget so if you're planning on going
wedding-dress shopping any time soon I
would say bring a friend who's willing
to give their honest opinions especially
if you don't like big silences that'll
help also don't worry about how
flattering a dress looks while it's
still on the hanger your body is the
ultimate hanger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
