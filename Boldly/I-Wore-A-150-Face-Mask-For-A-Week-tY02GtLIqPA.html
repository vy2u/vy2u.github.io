Doubtfire and $150
facemask
all right so yesterday I was rolling
around on Sephora and tried to find a
face mask and I found a face mask that
was a hundred and fifty dollars and I
was very confused here's six maps in
here and at one hundred and fifty
dollars up because have to be twenty
five dollars per mass no I'm very
skeptical that this is gonna work at all
so I'm going to try it for y'all and let
you know if it works or not it doesn't
even say what it's supposed to do on
this box is just super expensive
could this possibly work here are the
things that I want to see if this helps
I have so discoloration I have a new
pimple for me that I'm hoping it will
take away and have some kind of
roughness and I'm hoping it kind of
evens out the coloring moisturizes my
skin and take some of this redness away
so let's do it well my skin immediately
feels soothed mmm it's most of fresh and
floral wow this is a soft mask what is
SK - it sounds like a car model so I'm
kept me 15 minutes interesting on well
this is on this is what I look like like
a kabuki actor so apparently this
thing's supposed to lift my whole face
so this is like a cheap facelift
I guess my face doesn't really need to
be lifted my skin is just
terrible because I'm still in young the
skin problems my skin isn't saggy it's
just like you know it's definitely
a lot like tighter fitted to my face
than most masks that I born smells
really yummy and it feels kind of creamy
I'm gonna sit around for 15 minutes
check my Twitter and see if this works
at all okay what I imagined when is
Paltrow does when she's home she reads a
magazine and
with money on her face all right my mass
time is done it feels very very fresh
like I was just sitting in like ice-cold
rosewater pretendin but is it worth $25
all right
night two of my mask I did you know even
though getting my period my face did
look nicer today and it was definitely
moisturized it's the morning of day 2
and I feel like my face looks a little
bit nicer the pimples are getting
smaller now it's just in my head but my
skin is definitely more moisturize than
it usually is so maybe this thing's
gonna work what does my face look like
right now sweaty yeah it feels nicer
does it come out every day or something
or no not really it's just like
moisturizes it smells like a spa I'm
just gonna shave your face this way
water really is light now I'm looking at
it my skin doesn't look that bad that
was like dry it definitely does firm and
my pores smaller just got hard to tell
her how all is like period acting so
it's day seven and aside from just my
normal acne on my skin my face actually
looks pretty good like it feels really
moisturize and my pores don't look big
look rested
so I guess tomorrow we'll see if people
can actually tell a physical difference
so now that I've worn the mask for a
week I've printed out two pictures of me
one before and one after and I'm gonna
ask my co-workers if they can tell the
difference between my face and whether
or not they think that it was worth it
to spend $150 on
so let's go seafood I have a theory yes
Oh Lord already yeah they're the same
skin but it looks like you put
foundation on this one is this Photoshop
no no
many difference I think you sleep
it looks brighter in his picture Oh
usually it does look very high-grade
again but just this once for sure it
looks like
this is insane how much $150 do you
think it's worth it to spend that much
on a face mask I mean like if it makes
you happy
some believe
you'd spend more money to get her skin
and I understand that so there you have
it
it looked like my face masked experiment
worked every single one of my co-workers
was able to see a difference in my skin
as to whether or not I would spend a
hundred and fifty dollars on a face mask
or something for a week is still kind of
a gamble I kinda have a feeling that
like if you just put any kind of mask on
it would have the same effect but I
think if you're doing an event that is
like an emergency thing in one week like
a prom or a wedding or any kind of photo
shoot you would definitely be worth it
to do this as kind of like an emergency
last-minute treatment so I'm gonna give
this product to two fingers up that's my
rating is a peace sign I'm gonna give it
a peace sign because I think it worked I
did not know what it was gonna do but my
face definitely looks nicer so we'll see
you next time on what the beauty that's
a tentative title do you guys like that
I'll see if it sticks
