all over my face the last time I wore
makeup was probably when I was in high
school I was part of an orchestra
performance I was one of the
percussionist
when I was a kid I dressed like a boy a
lot of people thought I was a boy for a
long time kind of grew out of it but not
completely it was just never something I
wanted to do formal events or things
like that I never really got to the
makeup part because just putting on the
dress was like a hassle enough this year
I've been trying to do things that are
outside of my comfort zone maybe I will
like some of it I don't know
texted my fiance about that I was gonna
do this video he thought I was joking
I do have an acne problem if anything
maybe I'll come across something that
might help me with that
I don't know cover it up sleeve not
touching my face is probably gonna be
one of the biggest things I'll struggle
with I just got to do it open okay
my eyes watering now I don't want to see
it if I don't see it then I won't know
what it looks like and I'll be able to
go out and do whatever Oh
oh gosh oh man I think it looks weird
because my eyes are like really I don't
know it just doesn't look like me it
looks a lot better with my glasses it
just looks like everything smooth I
guess I like the fact that it evened
everything out the acne is it does no
it's full and I'm not training which is
desirable for a lot of people co-workers
and friends here think they'll probably
like it I think mostly it's just the
fact that I feel like I'm just gonna
just get my hands all up in it alright
so let's go see what my co-workers think
about me your eyebrows I really it's a
really really natural look like it's not
like what was old
so Gabi's never seen me wearing makeup
ever thank you but it's like very
natural I love it
Thanks the blush you think I look
different yeah I couldn't I notice right
away
my makeup it's like it's absolutely
perfect I'm learning that you need to be
aware of your makeup
I just went to lunch and I learned the
difficult task of eating stuff on your
lips doesn't seem to have smudged all
that much but it definitely felt like it
was smudging and I was hyper aware of it
the entire time your eye makeup is
fantastic I really like it I feel like a
mullet I'm all fancy on top of casual on
the bottom I just finished this whole
drink without getting lipstick on the
strobe oh yeah I liked it cuz it matched
my shirt my face is itching you want to
I want to rub my eyes so pairs that I'm
laid in the office for the day and I
survived a day wearing makeup it's felt
more like I was wearing a great
Halloween costume that I felt
comfortable in but expected to go home
and change
it feels okay now it felt pretty heavy
right off the bat I like it I think you
should do that a little bit more very
striking though so how do I look
Wow your eyes are like that's the
definitely the most noticeable did they
do your eyebrows do your eyebrows look
like waxed do they really know from this
distance it's not noticeable I think it
ate most of the lipstick throughout the
day what do you think buzz he smells it
I can't seem to get it all off my eyes
it wasn't near as bad as I thought it
was gonna be I expected to really really
mess it up throughout the day but
surprisingly it all stayed in place and
it was kind of difficult to wash off
would consider wearing makeup more in
the future
foundation I was you know happy with
that it did cool stuff made my acne go
away you know you're not seeing as many
creases or whatnot it's uncomfortable
because you go out looking in a certain
way every day you start doing something
different it's just takes a bit of
getting used to
he stepped outside my comfort zone I did
something new and I did I did learn
something before I really was not
interested in at all but I know for the
future now that I there are some things
that I could learn and could use and
would be happy with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
