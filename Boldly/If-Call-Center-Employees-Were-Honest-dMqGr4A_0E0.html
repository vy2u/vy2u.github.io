and I don't care why yes I'd love to
spend the next 10 minutes of my life
being told what a horrible person I am
by a stranger
I'll definitely transfer you to my
supervisor who will give you the same
information I just gave you as soon as
you started yelling a zoned out I'm not
sorry I placed around hold for five
minutes I was hoping you'd hang up oh
you're never gonna use our company again
great
that means I'll never have to talk to
you again I'm going to tell you the
issue is resolved so that I can go on
break I'm telling you that I'm finishing
up with another customer but really I'm
just catching up on office gossip I
asked you to repeat that because I was
too busy texting on my phone I'm gonna
hang up on you and pretend it was an
accident I'm attempting to sound
empathetic because Quality Assurance is
listening the only perk of my job is not
seeing your face please stop telling me
this pointless story just tell me your
problem so we could both get on with our
day I'm saying this with confidence but
I have no idea if this information is
true I fully intend to look you up on
Facebook after this just to see how much
of an will you are I'm not sorry you
feel that way I'm not sorry that
happened oh no I understand I just don't
care this job is made me dead inside
this job has given me a fear of talking
on the phone listen babe call me honey
one more time and I'll burn this place
down have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
