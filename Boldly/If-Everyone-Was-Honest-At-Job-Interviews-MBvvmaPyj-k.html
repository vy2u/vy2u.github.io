come on have a seat
don't get too comfortable though you're
never gonna see this office ever again
oh I'm gonna talk as white as I can
during this interview my smells got me
through everything in life so just gonna
be smiling a lot you didn't happen to
bring a piece of paper with a surface
level description of what you do on it
I made this in college and it's just
covered in lies it's a template from
online if you could just not read that
no bridgestone real estate does not
exist I saw it on a coffee mug put it on
my resume
yeah I'm not actually reading this it's
just a formality let me start
by giving you a big description of what
this job entails I'll listen poorly yeah
that's gonna help me realize it's never
gonna work out now legally I'm not
allowed to ask you any questions about
age sex or nationality but I'm gonna go
ahead and make some wild assumptions
about you based on your appearance as a
woman I wouldn't expect for you to get
past the surface level observation I'm
more concerned with the background check
I'm gonna dry them on myself into what
it is you want me to be so tell me what
makes you so damn special you know what
I can't think of a damn thing I'm
actually constantly afraid that I'm not
special at all so when you're not at
work how do you waste your time Oh
mostly drinking at bars and hopefully
complaining about you in the future I'm
not listening do you have any
ill-informed questions for me I didn't
think about this part at all how many
people here are douchebags like you do
you think I got a job well my gut
feeling right now is that you have a lot
going on on the outside you are a
nightmare to be with in conversation and
you're unfortunately still a woman so
you're not gonna get the job but let's
go ahead and press our dirty palms
together anyway that's fine I've got two
more shitty job interviews to get to
today safe to assume I won't hear from
you again I'm gonna go cry in my car and
replay this conversation and tell me
someone's an idiot I am well this was a
complete waste of both of our times cuz
I'm just gonna hire the boss's nephew
anyway I will literally never think of
you ever again
