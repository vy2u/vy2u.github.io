gonna be in a bad mood the rest of the
evening it's as simple as that
why is your ex so attractive and how is
she so close with all your family I'm
gonna get mad about this periodically
I've been planning my argument for days
with my friends so good luck winning
I got a tight defense I do not have a
good day today and clearly you did so
that makes me mad but I'm with you I eat
like it's your fault
never texted me back yesterday so
naturally I was mad at you the whole day
I think that's fair I'm gonna start
crying so that you'll apologize for this
and feel really guilty because I know
that I'm still right I'm gonna tell you
that I'm over this but I will be
harboring it until next Tuesday all of
my friends are single and it makes this
relationship really difficult I'm upset
because you said I was the hottest thing
to you to you what does that mean am I
not hot to the rest of the world not
listening to you I'm preparing my
rebuttal I say it's nothing it's
literally everything how do you not know
that just taking this out on you because
I know I can I love you
I don't know maybe this is all just for
the makeup sex because it's so romantic
and I just kind of liked it to get
context when you hook up sometimes like
tension and the number of these I don't
know but that's why I'm yelling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
