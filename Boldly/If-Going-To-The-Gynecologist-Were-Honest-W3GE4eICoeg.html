well it could be five minutes could be
20 minutes I'm really just guessing well
thank you for moving me from that larger
waiting room into the smaller one and
for putting me in this thin sheet like
piece of material I'm done making small
talk right now so the doctor will be in
whatever she feels like it
okay I'll be sitting here thinking about
every single person I slept with that I
regret hi giving the courtesy notes I
didn't walk in on you naked
even though I'm about to look at your
vagina and I'm pretending to look
natural even though my bare ass is
touching the table below me now I'm
thinking about how many other people's
blood subtype to staple let's make small
talk have you been
obviously not wonderful or else I
wouldn't be sitting here sweating
through this robe but in the interest of
following social cues I'll say good
excellent so tell me why oh here I have
something down there that could be an
ingrown hair or it could be an STI so
I'm really anxious for you to look at my
vagina today gotcha
have you been having a lot of
unprotected sex I wouldn't say a lot but
I'm not perfect and the public school
sex education system completely failed
me I'm trying to comfort you in a
non-judgmental way let's take a look and
see what's going on perfect they shaved
my entire vagina for this oh well you
want kidding yep I've prepared for this
appointment more than I do for most
first date I'm going to ask you about
your mother now because she's also my
patient and I really think your vagina's
are very similar she's great and I'm
super uncomfortable talking about my
mother with my legs wide open I'm going
to put this freezing cold speculum
inside you now and crank open your
vagina is going to be really
uncomfortable okay I'm gonna look at the
ceiling so I don't make eye contact with
you while you're inside me uh you're
great that is very cold
well everything there's no more right
now which is great because you don't
sound super sexually responsible I'm
really afraid I'm gonna queef right now
and good news it's just an ingrown hair
but I'm gonna do a full check while I'm
down here but I know you avoid the
gynecologist office
oh great I really didn't want to tell my
sexual partner that I had an STD I mean
we haven't even defined the relationship
yet and I still wake up early in the
morning
brush my teeth that sounds unhealthy
most of my relationships are so now I'm
going to stick my hand inside your body
and feel your ovaries whoo this is
exactly what I imagined getting probed
by an alien feels like well we're all
set it was awkward and uncomfortable to
see you thanks for looking at my vagina
no problem have a great rest of your day
and try to pretend I didn't just spend
the last 15 minutes digging around
inside of your body I won't be able to
do that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
