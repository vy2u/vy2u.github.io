hate men
I know exactly we're talking about I
went through straight bangs in college
once I met a straight girl the other day
you two should be friends so when you
guys go on a date
who pays there's no way you're straight
like I don't want to sound like
heterophobia Kaur anything but how did
your parents react when you told him you
were strange well how do you know then
if people like never tried it like never
go the guy you two are straight
can i watch so I keep noticing all these
straight couples and these YouTube
videos like there's kids watching it's
cool if you're straight I just don't I
just don't want to see it just kind of
like trying to push the straight agenda
you're straight but not like a straight
stereotype what's not like really sex
you know it's not natural
he just jams that and that you just
haven't met the right woman yet so are
both of your parents cool with this you
are so cool it's just I don't think I
can hang out with you I don't want
people to think I'm straight I love this
dress you always wear dresses if you
decided to have kids which one of you
would carry the baby
out dressing them now draped me no no oh
we support you you well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
