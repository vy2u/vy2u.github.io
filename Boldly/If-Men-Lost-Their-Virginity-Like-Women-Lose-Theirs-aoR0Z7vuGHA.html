months I felt like I had to I've been
there
regretted that I'm actually still a
virgin Wow
why would someone buy it as a cow if
they could get the milk for free
pretty sure girls don't see me as a cow
dad yes but you get the idiom you see
what I'm saying I want you to know
something you are a genie in the bottle
and you just have to make sure they
don't rub you wrong dad you're totally
misinterpreting that song though how
will I know what to do you don't have to
do anything just lay back and let it
happen she won't be disappointed you're
kidding she's gonna be so happy it's
happening there's probably gonna be a
play
it's gonna be a lot of blood should I
buy condoms no no way and it's like
you're asking for it but I am asking for
it you're making her work for it deep
breaths
it gets better the more you do it bring
a towel wait why do I need a towel oh
right
hypothetically how would I know if I was
ready once you put the ring on it you
can only lose your virginity once maybe
twice if you're in the butt stuff if I
do this what making a
better that than approved I'll just turn
the lights off and wear boxers yeah
no briefs girls like briefs that's what
they want it seems dangerous this is
gonna be great
before we do anything no I think I
should just tell you that I've never
done this before what I'm a virgin
Oh um I didn't know that and that makes
this a big deal and I just don't want
this to be a big deal no no it's not a
big deal whatever it's my virginity
goodbye virginity who cares legit 'ti
are you sure yeah I have my towel it's
fine okay
just don't fall in love with me they
neck it will hurt a little we'll just
tell me if it's hurting do I look any
different
no you're home wait
he knows and was just very tender very
sweet some of them got a little lazy
