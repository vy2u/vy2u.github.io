compliment about your weight actually
makes you feel anxious insecure and
watch I'm looking you up and down
because I've been socialized to judge
other women and take advantage of that
I'm worried that if you don't have a
perfect body people are going to think
that I'm a bad model II everything that
I don't like about the way you look it's
a projection of what I don't like about
myself I don't value your personality
nearly as much as I value your breasts
I'm gonna tell you your butt looks great
in that even though no one really knows
what a good butt looks like I've never
had a healthy relationship with food and
that's really gonna you up
I made comments about your weight
because I make snap judgments about what
it means when really I have no idea
what's going on in your life I'm
uncomfortable with people of different
shapes and sizes but I'm not really sure
why I accept the fact that our beauty
standards are based entirely on
Photoshop I'm gonna tell you that
everything here is really slimming on
you so that you shop here over and over
and over again I don't lift weights
because I've been conditioned to think
that looking beautiful and feminine
means not looking strong I think your
life will be easier if you're thin so
I'm going to try to encourage that from
a very young age this dress would look
good on literally any body type but the
smaller sizes look better on the rack so
we keep everything else in back I don't
like the fact that you're not conforming
to a misogynistic ideal of female beauty
and I can't think beyond that I
criticize skinny girls to cover up the
fact that I'm actually really concerned
about my own weight and putting my own
issues on you I'm completely unaware of
the damage that I'm doing I'm going to
tell you that this covers up your flaws
you don't really have any but I work on
Commission so I need you to buy this
I've been conditioned to be critical of
myself and use self deprecation is a
cover-up so people don't think I'm
conceited but the truth is I look
amazing
mannequins are all the same size even
though none of us are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
