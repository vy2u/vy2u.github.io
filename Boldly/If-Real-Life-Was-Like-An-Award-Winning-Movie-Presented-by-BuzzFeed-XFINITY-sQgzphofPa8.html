too which one do you want to watch first
perhaps we watch a red carpet interview
and men were compelled to watch all the
interviews upon the carpet of crimson
what then so much to choose then the
illusion of choice is the most beautiful
deception of them all Oh what red carpet

highlight oh sure
you guys are ridiculous did you have the
Bonanza burger or the bodacious burg do
you guys want to just split it evenly oh

just do it by item but nobody can do
that kind of math okay so you say you
only had an iced tea huh you didn't
order the appetizer but you did have six
bytes of the nachos which doesn't sound
like a lot that's ten percent tax tip
twenty percent don't be rude its 1153
steak curly fries or taunt 1132 tiger
theorem is not important here next time
get the bodacious burger but sub avocado
for lettuce it's the same thing as Nance
murder but to go is cheaper are you just
a busboy we didn't order like eighty
percent of the things he listed hey
Rocco's deli for lunch yeah totally cool

pickles since you cooked I can do the
dishes Oh get back I believe in you kids
