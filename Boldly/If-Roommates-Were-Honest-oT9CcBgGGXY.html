in furniture but I'm too broke to buy my
own stuff I'm listening to you describe
your day but really I'm fantasizing
about living alone of course your friend
can stay in our couch and of course I'll
be passive-aggressive the whole time the
second you leave the apartment your food
becomes my food I let the trash overflow
until you feel guilty enough to take it
out I want to put all the bills under
your name so that when I forget to pay
you're held responsible
I know it's my turn to buy toilet paper
but I'm gonna do everything I can to get
out of it every time you leave the
lights on ice cream on the inside
late at night I'm gonna watch Netflix
SuperLab because I have no concept of
decency I'm asking if you prefer I leave
the toilet seat up or down but I really
don't give a what you think when
you leave town pants become optional I'm
gonna hang out with my friends and talk
about you I'll see you in a bit
you know what I've been thinking lately
I hate all your friends one of my
favorite hobbies it's finally judging
you do you mind trying the music down a
little bit I'm trying to masturbate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
