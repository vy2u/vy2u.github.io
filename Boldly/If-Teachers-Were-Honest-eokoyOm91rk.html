find this job really rewarding but today
you all suck good morning class and
welcome to the first day of school if I
seem a little grumpy it's because they
have completely over packed this
classroom and totally boned me I'm on
active standardized test mounted next
week and there's nothing more than I'd
like to be them insanely drugged for it
oh my student loans are giving me panic
attacks yes you were there you seemed to
have some social clout in this classroom
so I will be making friends with you
very quickly who's your Brian's sister I
hated him quiet quiet
I won't forget more about just socialize
than you'd ever imagine I don't really
like to hunt some of you but it's
actually illegal so please don't try it
makes me immensely uncomfortable please
be quiet just doesn't have the same
gravitas if I could tell you all to just
shut up I think it'd be much more
effective thank you so much for your
advice I'm not gonna take any of your
advice because you're a shitty teacher
your essay was awful but it was
entertaining I'm gonna curd this test
that you all just took them not because
I'm nice but because if I realize I made
it way too hard okay it's really
important that you guys remember all
this stuff for next week but after that
it's gonna be a completely pointless I
know what you're doing I did the same
thing I'd like to call on you but I'm
pretty sure she weren't listening she's
just a few of you that I'd love to give
her a meeting about you you're the
reason I drink when I get home yep you
you guys are all of the reasons why I
Drive home in silence every day of
course I have a favorite school class I
really like you guys I mean you're not
as good as last year's last place will
make it I'm already counting down for
summer it was parent-teacher night last
night so as most of you know I met
almost all of your parents and they were
lovely
um except yours Brian your father's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
