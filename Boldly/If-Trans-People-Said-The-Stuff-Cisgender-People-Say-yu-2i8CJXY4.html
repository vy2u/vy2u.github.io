real name okay
was it difficult to come out to your
parents as cisgender are you afraid that
people will like hate you or they'll get
hurt like I support Brittany with what
she wants to do that's her life but I
just don't want it around my children
like how do you pee well so you're not
trans that's so cool I know another guy
that's not trans maybe you guys know
each other whoa

exactly like a man you're really short
for a woman you're really tall for a man
why don't you try to be more feminine
how come so many of your sex workers
like I can kinda tell by your eyes maybe
how do you know you're a woman how do
you know you're a man do you like have a
dick how do you have sex and you're a
straight white man you're not trans
