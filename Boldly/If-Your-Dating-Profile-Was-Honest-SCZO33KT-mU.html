Smith for starters I'm new in town I
already know my way around really well
I'm a morning person I've really tried
so late I'm so late oh so so so late I
have a great job
corner office assistant bonuses the
works I think they're grooming me for
partner I'm an athlete Fitness is very
important to me I'm a huge foodie yeah a
real gourmand
I happen to be a singer/songwriter feel
free to ask me about that later I'm a
wine connoisseur but everything in
moderation one thing you have to know
about me I'm very photogenic not ashamed
to take a selfie
anywhere and everywhere I've been known
as the man of a thousand looks you know
what forget all that the truth is I'm
not perfect in fact there's a lot of
stuff I'm working on but the point is
I'm trying making an effort I'm taking
strides I'm putting myself out there I
don't know maybe it sounds silly but
hopefully there's someone out there who
feels the same way I do anyway here goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
