identified more with boys almost kind of
felt more like a boy I'm kinda I live in
New York I was raised here I'm a
podcaster I'm Keith Malley the co-host
of Keith and the girl a podcast that's
been going on for nine years we do it
every day five days a week and and
there's my coast and then I dated before
we did the podcast we started the
podcast we end up realizing we're not
great for each other and then I would
break up and then she would start seeing
Lauren in part of a wood hat would make
me think like okay the relationship not
working out wasn't my fault at all she's
you know with a woman would what choice
or chance that I have and then you find
out you know Lauren's really a man and
then you think like oh okay she's made a
man better than I'm in a man technically
I'm a guy I don't want to be a guy I
just AM a guy I didn't want to like
girls just do like girls
I can remember when I first was told by
Lauren that she was transgendered and
you can't help but wonder like are you
confused yet you know do you just like
hanging out with guys better cuz women
could be a pain yes sometimes you know I
get or I wonder if there is something in
my body like some sort of gonads or some
you know remnants of something like mail
or some like miniature balls tucked up
in my ovaries or something that that
makes me have that feeling in connection
I don't know I'm also I'm a minority in
the trans community I'm a trans person
that has chosen not to pass you know as
my gender in society and I think that's
important too you know I don't think you
should have to transition
my future office
I am male trying to make it as an
actress in New York City so that is a
different scenario you know people don't
know where to place me really as an
artist or an actor though they enjoy my
work you know a lot of casting directors
like I don't really know what to do with
you you know it was tough for me to
pursue female roles as somebody who's
trans when I didn't know I was trans
because I was trying to fit this mold of
a female that I conjured in my head I
felt like I was in drag and I felt like
I was putting on this character of a
female and of a woman and people can
sense that you know and it's been a
journey for me feeling comfortable with
allowing myself to be you know one thing
or the other
discovering the word transgender has
freed me because now I know I'm not
mentally ill not many people know about
transgender this morning I just learned
what trans was not even five years ago
and you're talking about an actual trans
person I'm learning about this also what
that means and so we talk about it
openly on the show to some my audience
get turned off do they get the little
squeamish yeah I don't care I don't care
maybe I heard the word but I didn't know
anybody really I didn't know anybody
personally for sure in it you talk to
her you know and IKEA I do it now I do
it stuff all this time I'm supposed to
be saying hee hee
of course it feels good when people call
me by male pronouns because I feel i
dint off' I'd even if I know they're
trying it area if they do it she hee hee
she thing I appreciate it every single
time it she's the room he's the real
deal we're taught that sex and gender
are the same but they're not okay this
is not really a lesbian experience I
don't feel like a lesbian I don't know
what you're supposed to feel when you
are a lesbian do you know what I mean
like I don't feel straight I don't feel
like a lesbian I don't feel bisexual I
don't know what the laws of attraction
what are or were but they are here and
I'm really happy to be in this
relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
