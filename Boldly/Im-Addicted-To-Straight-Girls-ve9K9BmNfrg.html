this path it's a real problem now and
it's starting to affect her life I'm
just so afraid that she's gonna lose
herself
this is hard to see her go through this
guy what what is this is this is this a
surprise party for me you guys have
never no one's throwing me a surprise
party before Carol I'm Patricia an
intervention specialist please have a
seat your friends and family are
concerned that you're addicted to
falling in love with straight girls and
as a professional interventionist it's
really important that we discuss this
I'm just so upset
no one's ever thrown me a surprise party
before you know and I really thought
that that this is the moment we came
together cuz we just want to help you
get over this problem okay
this is absurd I've never fallen for a
straight girl okay yeah maybe one or two
one could argue three three what about
Felicia Thomas what about her I had no
idea that she was straight
the first thing she ever said to you
upon meeting you was I love Dom so much
I could never be a lesbian I thought I
mean anything doesn't mean anything to
you as an intervention connoisseur it's
important for me to keep us calm and
collected so we can really intervene
this thing trust me I'm a professional I
mean they got off a Craigslist and she
was cheap let's get back to the
interventioning real cheap
what about did a molar what Jenna and I
were really close you know till I told
her how I felt about her but if I had
just waited like a couple more years
before revealing that information I
think that we could be together no you
couldn't she has three kids by the man
she's married to you were a bridesmaid
in her wedding you know what they say
about women and sexuality believe a
woman when she tells you how she
identifies I was gonna say fluid but I
guess you're right okay what about Clara
right very good point
Carol I love you dearly and I just want
to see you the woman who loves you back
please stop the madness honestly no
straight woman would even know what to
do with you it's a good point mm-hmm
thank you good job
Terrence okay okay
some people want what they can't have
and we think that's what you are doing
finding someone who loves you back is
way less work than trying to convince oh
when you're right for them and at the
end of the day I just I think we all
want to do less work right wait
wonderful thank you Carol are you
willing to accept this interventions
yeah yes yes yeah yes she said yes yes
you're gonna be okay I'm really really
happy that we did this I think this is
gonna change Carol's life for the better
this was so fun if you guys can make it
out to Simi Valley I'm in my churches
production of Jesus Christ Superstar and
you know I didn't get the surprise party
that I always dreamed of but at the end
of the day I got a surprise intervention
and I really think that's a little bit
better
oh hey um did anybody get that
intervention lady's number
by chance she was really cute so she's
straight yeah so did I could she get her
number
do you Carol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
