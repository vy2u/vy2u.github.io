I'm adopted but I'm not less important
than my parents natural children but I'm
not your model minority and I fought for
my family I'm adopted and her race
doesn't change the fact that she's my
mom
I'm adopted but I was ripped away from
my country but I was in my parents last
option I'm adopted and I'll probably
never find my birth family but I don't
know where I'm from I don't know my race
and I don't know my heritage I am
adopted but I have no idea who my
biological parents are but I met my mom
when I was 16 the day my mom's met is a
day that we'll never forget
I'm adopted and I live with anxiety and
depression but even so I'm still afraid
of abandonment I'm adopted and I love
myself and no it's not the easy way to
have a child I am adopted but I aged out
of foster care at 21 but neither of my
families are my real family
so please stop asking me that I'm
adopted but I'm not Chinese or Japanese
or Vietnamese I'm Korean but sometimes I
forget because I sound just like my
mother
seriously it's kind of scary I'm adopted
and three moms are better than none but
I love my mom and I know my birth mother
love me I'm adopted but there are
millions of youth like me that need
families and someone to hold on to and
just to love them and to care for them
I'm adopted and I plan to adopt when I'm
ready to have kids and I hope you adopt
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
