totally lacks morals I'm a theist but
I'm fine with people having religion I
really don't care I'm an atheist but I
think freedom of religion is very
important but I don't want to ban
religion but I don't hate religion I'm
an atheist but that doesn't mean I'm
just worshiping science that's not how
science works I'm an atheist but I'm not
a faintness but I don't worship the
devil I don't even believe in heaven or
hell when you die you die I'm an atheist
but I'm not someone who disrespects
other people I'm an atheist but that
doesn't mean I'm being disrespectful
when I ask the question why
I'm an atheist and that means I don't
understand why anyone would fight over
religion I'm an atheist and I'm still a
good person and I'm a good person
because I want to be not because I have
to be and I'm a happy person and I live
a moral life and I love studying
Christian mythology and I still want you
to say bless you when I sneeze it's nice
I'm atheist and I'm fine with whatever
you want to believe just be chill about
it
I don't hate you if you're religious I'm
an atheist but I still have faith in
people I'm an atheist and I want to make
the world a better place I'm an atheist
and I'm just a normal person like
anybody else I'm an atheist but
unfortunately it feels shameful to admit
I'm an atheist and sometimes I'm envious
of people that have religion I'm an
atheist and I have a message for all
other atheists you're not alone I mean
metaphysically yes we are all about but
other than that you're not alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
