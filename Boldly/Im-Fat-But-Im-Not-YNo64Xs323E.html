I'm not a glutton I'm fat but I actually
like going to the gym but I like to take
the stairs but I'm a runner but I'm not
lazy but I don't need McDonald's every
day and I eat less than my skinny guy
friends metabolism is a bitch but I'm
not miserable but I smell great I'm fat
but I don't wear a bikini to gross you
out I wear one because I look awesome in
them and I love wearing them at the
beach I'm fat but I'm not glorifying
obesity but I enjoy food and friends
more than exercise I'm fat but I'm
comfortable in my own body I'm fat but
I'm not a skinny Shamer
I just feel like everyone is allowed to
love their bodies don't think that me
being proud of my body means that I'm
putting down yours
I'm fat and I'm a writer and I'm a
musician and I'm a writer filmmaker and
an actor and I'm a workaholic and I'm
motivated and I'm a wife and I love to
laugh and I'm good at sports I'm fat and
I look really good naked
there's been no complaints let me tell
you I'm fat and I love life and I love
traveling and I love going to the beach
and I love Chris Farley I mean he's the
best come on I'm fat and I'm sexy I'm
fat and my husband tells me I'm
beautiful every day
at the other day people are just people
you never know where someone is with
their body you'd have a lot of kindness
and empathy for other people and what
they're going through you're allowed to
be you so let's just all let ourselves
be ourselves I'm fat but most
importantly I'm a human</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
