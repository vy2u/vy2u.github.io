and I'm a professional feeler of
emotions
aka a writer I have two very rude
identities on being gay and disabled and
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone if you
had a choice
the second I realized I was gay like I
was just like that is a really fucking
rude life like why would you do that to
me like why would you hurt me like that
things were already hard and then you
just like put in a fun flirty twist of
me liking penis on top of it all in my
mind you know the gay world represented
physical perfection you basically have
an amazing body you have tons of sex and
you listen to like bad electronic
remixes and I just kind of knew you know
looking down at my like you know limp
and scarves everything like that and
being like well I don't look like that
so I'm fucked and I kind of assumed that
I would just like die alone I figured
that there was no way that a gay guy
with cerebral palsy could like find the
man of his dreams like there was just no
world in which that was possible so I
spent most of my 20s kind of not feeling
like I deserved a dick in my ass because
I was gay disable Dan that was
disgusting
occasionally I would do something crazy
like go on a date with someone but even
then I was like fraught with nerves I'm
like I would go to Rive at the bar
fifteen minutes early so I could be
sitting down so the guy wouldn't see me
walk away
and I would be sitting there literally
like my pants like totally fucking as a
roll but like would not get up the
fucking seat like I would rather have
pissed my pants on this new guy that I
barely know then like actually go up and
have him see me limp away I basically
kind of like came out of the disabled
closet to all my friends and told him
that I without any but my cerebral palsy
and it was really painful I feel like
I've repressed a lot of memories I like
a lot of the book was just me having to
like you know like redo the men in black
memory eraser that I had through my
thoughts my childhood when you're honest
completely about who you are life opens
up to you in this like new exciting way
and all these opportunities are
available to you that weren't before
you can actually fall in love with
someone because you don't hate yourself
anymore I mean
remember like being 25 and be like why
does no guy like me and like meanwhile
I'm like you know eating percocet like
they're gummy bears and like you know
looking like look shit and like not
understanding like oh maybe it's because
I'm like I kind of hate myself and when
you hate yourself you only attract other
garbage people you know the love that I
wanted I didn't feel like I deserved yet
so I couldn't get it but the second I
came out with the book and start talking
candidly about my disability you know I
got a boyfriend pretty much immediately
I mean it was like it was real I mean it
was so immediate like I came out of the
single closet and next week was dating
someone who was so amazing and I had
things happen to me that I just never
could have dreamed possible uh so you
know now at 29 I don't think I'm ever
going to like love being gay and
disabled I'm never gonna like be like
obsessed with it be like you know but at
the same time I'm okay with it
and I'm ready to talk about it and I'm
ready to like go there and and that's
just a really remarkable feeling you
know and I mean because I didn't have a
choice over being gay and disabled my
but my I did have a choice with how I
dealt with it and now I've just chosen
to just deal with it by just like
literally screaming it from every
mountaintop people are like shut the
fuck up like no I'm not done
silence for too long
it's here it's here
what get it get there ha I got it get it
get it get it it's here quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
