afraid of me I'm not evil not a drug
addict I've never committed a crime I'm
not a sociopath or homicidal raging
maniac I'm homeless but I'm working hard
to make ends meet I am homeless but I've
not lost my faith in God that's getting
stronger I am also a strong survivor I'm
motivated to make things better get make
things better for myself start again I
am an artist I am creative I'm a US
military vet I was diagnosed with
Bipolar
I messed myself up that's all I can say
and I blamed everybody for it and breaks
my heart but we can do it try again
we're all humans it doesn't matter if
you're homeless or not if you're game
you're straight of you're black of your
white we're all humans we're not trash
I'm striving to survive every day
everyone out here just one paycheck from
being on a sidewalk anybody can be
homeless at any moment of the time
through a natural disaster through a
divorce through abuse through anything
that you could basically think of any
situation that life brings us you don't
even have to give money or you know just
a nice gesture hello how are you it
makes anybody say next Monday
if you pass me on the street show
respect and we'll show respect no one
here wants to be mean anyone it just
helps knowing that with a part of the
community that people care money doesn't
define a human being I'm homeless
there's still a human being
I'm homeless but I'm still human I am
homeless but I am a human being
