in there and it's happy hour and I can't
go I'm a bit of an impulsive shopper I
have an ebay problem I spent a lot of
money getting my nails done and getting
my hair done I spent a lot of money on
food door dash's might go to a lot of
times I'll just end up spending like $50
on food delivery every time that I get
my paycheck I'm just spending it and I
think that's a really bad thing to do
I'm excited to try to only spend $50 in
a week because I don't know if I can I
think this is going to be really hard I
eat three times that's already $30 then
you only have $20 left right so I for
sure can't get my nails done I'm getting
older and eventually I'll need to pay
for a wedding pay for kids I can barely
pay for my dog I think you'll be good
and challenging and will kind of make me
ask myself where I'm spending my money
all right let's see if this week I can
spend less than $50 so it's the first
day of trying to live off 50 bucks and I
don't know where to eat
I really want a hamburger for lunch I
went to a build-your-own pizza place and
normally I'd walk by the toppings and
just want to get everything and today I
just got a margherita pizza for dinner
we got this chicken tikka masala from
Trader Joe's it was only 350 G really
cheap I'm trying to figure out what to
eat for lunch right now I really want a
hamburger but I ate a hamburger I have
to cook from home tonight
got some Chipotle which is like eight
bucks and I'm going to eat half for
dinner so that's like 4 bucks a meal
then we need a doughnut for lunch the
only thing I know how to make is
spaghetti so I got some of this really
want to say
guess what I got a doughnut 99 cents
can't beat that
they obviously doughnuts this whole time
and destroy my body so we're going out
tonight and my friends and I ended up
reading the alcohol and Amy brought
tonic water and I had the lime already
so you know we didn't spend any money
well I didn't said anyone do it I just
came back from pavilions and all the
food that I got was twenty one dollars I
think and then with the discount it was
like fifteen dollars so my friend is
shopping right now and I can't buy
anything and this sucks oh I want to buy
everything here I'm at a half naked
gasps I'm about to go visit my family in
the OC and that's probably where the
last of our money is gonna go you're
browsing through online shopping I'm
just kind of like picking all these
clothes online and putting them in the
cart
and then I just go and buy them oh my
gosh I just found a can of Pringles in
my car
hallelujah you should before we go to
sleep I get on eBay and bid on things I
don't need today is Mother's Day oh I
might go to the Ralph and get like
flowers or something it was a shirt I
wanted and I'm about to lose it
geez I can't bid on it because I can't
afford it this week
I'm nearing my last day of this
challenge but I ran out of this tea that
I drink and I just had to order $30
worth on Amazon so it's the last day and
check my wallet and I have 25 dollars
left which means I only spend half the
amount Alice was aside in a week stuff
like vacation and trips that's gonna
help your mental health is worth it even
if it costs more money but if it just
looks pretty or if it's an expensive
meal and I just really crave it in that
moment you're gonna poop it out and
you're gonna forget about it the one
really nice thing with being done is
that I can actually afford a doughnut
again so I'm just back to where I
started
I ended up eating a lot of instant stuff
so it wasn't necessarily really good for
my body but I think budgeting wise I did
a pretty good job this week and I wanna
be frugal and be able to save more money
in my future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
