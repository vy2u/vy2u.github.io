India and see a guy wearing
a full baseball kit, complete with a cap,
there's a high possibility
that he's an Eminem fan,
he has nothing to do with the sport.
- If you were a kid born in the '90s,
your first option as a
career would have to be
to become a cricketer.
- Cricket has a bit of class.
- There's more variety,
there are more options.
- I really like it because I love
making contact to the balls.
- I'm pretty bad at
cricket, so I think I'll be
quite bad at baseball as well.
- I don't know much about baseball, but--
- It's like a big deal in the US.
- I would assume it's
a really tough sport.
- I just know you hit the ball and you
go across the diamond, through bases.
- You just have one guy who's chucking,
the other guy's hitting.
- You have to hit it
and run, no matter what.
- The bat's pretty tiny.
- The ball is lighter
than the leather ball.
- I've heard that baseball
pitchers can pitch
up to like 100 miles an hour or something.
- What do you call the wicket keeper?
It's not a wicket keeper,
they're very funny gloves.
- After playing cricket for
like a good eight years,
I really don't think that
it's going to be a problem.
- I think it's gonna be fun.
- It's going to be pathetic and shameful.
- You can make it to B-team of Yankees,
or the Red Sox for sure.
- I have a feeling this is
not gonna work out all right.
- I feel like a construction worker.
- So how do I hold it?
- Thanks baseball people
for making this helmet
biased against people with long hair.
- Ready for baseball.
- Come on!
- You know what, I'm just
gonna do this without it.
- I'm scared because in cricket
we wear a lot of protection.
- I can totally kill this man.
- Hell dude!
- What the f--?
- There's no bounce, like I don't know
where to start hitting you know?
- Probably because we aren't
playing on a proper pitch
it's not getting that feel
where you just hit and run
for your base.
- And then I run right?
Leave the bat and run?
- So this game clearly isn't
as easy as I thought it was.
- I am killing this!
- It's easy to connect.
- To connect it's a f-- effort.
- OK that touched.
- Yeah!
- He had that one coming.
- Whoa!
What's the date today?
I'm gonna mark it into my calendar.
- Are you being specifically nice to me,
or is this how it is?
- He's frustrated I'm telling you.
- That was like two home runs man, easily.
Come on.
- Yo-ho-ho, my last
home run for this game.
- So I just played baseball right now,
and it was quite fun.
- It was really, really
nice, like I loved it.
- It's not that bad, like
it's kind of easy man.
- I'm sure he was very nice to me,
that's why I could play.
- Something which you see on TV is like,
you're doing it for the first time,
and holding the bat and
shit, it was really nice.
- I hope our little bit,
to you know try this out
in India today kind of
encourages a few people to
give it a shot themselves.
- This is one sport
which needs to pick up,
and which will pick up.
- So I think baseball should
definitely come to India.
It'll give Indians something
else to obsess over
other than cricket and
it's so similar to cricket.
- I hope I can give this another try soon.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
