losing weight gaining weight losing
weight for my entire life maybe it's
okay to just calm down
I have been steadily like kinda gaining
a little bit of weight for the past four
years which is also the amount of time
it's been since I have stopped my eating
disorder behaviors I just have been
really tired of like every morning
waking up and facing a closet full of
things that make me feel bad about
myself and that's the first thing that
starts my day is like being like a
I got to figure out what I'm gonna wear
and I know when I tried this pair of
pants on and this skirt I'm gonna feel
really bad about myself which is a hard
way to start your day when everything
else is pretty solid it's kind of like a
weird thing like I feel like this
internal shame about it about being like
I could lose this weight but I'm just
not going to and that's a kind of scary
thing to say
look at all this stuff
I literally just like took everything
off the hangers everything out of the
drawers and just threw it all on the
floor for the most part the things that
didn't fit were like bottoms so like
shorts pants anything with like that
waistline that was just like not gonna
make it for years
goodbye yeah it was really nice to just
get rid of everything that was like
making me feel bad in my closets and
it's actually starting to become kind of
fun like getting rid of stuff it's a
very easy and free way to feel very
productive and very pleased with
yourself
so the first shopping trip was a
nightmare it was like much worse than I
thought it was going to be um and I
ended up crying about it there was
something about like picking out things
that I was hopeful for being like I
don't know really my size but I'm gonna
try this one and then H&amp;amp;M and I hate
this so much I guess I thought that
naively that doing this would be enough
of a step to be like just suddenly be
okay with like the fact that I am
heavier now but I still have a ways to
go with being okay um with my body
I was wrong like I'm not okay with this
and I'm just gonna have to like lose
weight that's the only way and that's
exactly what I wanted to get away from I
wanted to give myself freedom to just
like exist and that's why I did this
whole thing kind of not psyched about
this whole project right now but the
alternative is not much better so I will
try again tomorrow
I treated myself to like some iced
coffee and local snacks and like made a
whole day of it and it was like a
complete turnaround I've never believed
for myself that I reach a point where I
would actually just be okay with
accepting my body where it's at
basically any time I've ever shopped
before I'll buy something and be like
this looks okay but it'll look even
better when I lose weight and it's
always this like not if I lose weight
but when I lose weight like a definite
and this was the first time I was like
this just looks awesome
it looks great as is on my body as it is
I don't feel like I love my body yet but
I feel like it's okay and that's
progress for me like that I can just
exist and not have to like change it my
happiness has improved like tenfold so
I'm so happy I did it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
