as well be speaking Swahili or hi Norse
to me
on fleek
well this get me in trouble if I go in
the subway and say the ladies sit next
to me who you're on Glee pauses who's
doing this interview is definitely on
fleek lit but one definition admit for
my youth is knee crawling wall clawing
commode hugging Trump not too far from
the old definition being that
stone-drunk
but I like it hey once covering an
election we got to about 3:30 in the
morning and I think what I said was this
race has become so chaotic so confused
so confounding we don't know whether to
wind our watch or Bay at the moon I have
a feeling of I said that the fighting
large in degrees global rather my wife
and she down line 21 in our my rather
wardrobe my reaction when I learned
these ridiculous definitions of these
acronyms that you throw a dead body
oh when was a granddad Bob which is even
worse than a dead body not a very good
body and I would say a dead body is what
Tom Brady the quarterbacks of the Boston
Patriots might get it he really has to
set up six games at the store the next
season Thurston you can't remember when
it weather is on Tuesday or Thursday you
just want to finesse it you say I'll see
you in Thurston
nearly every politician in all Ankerberg
or thirsty they tend to puff up like a
Blowfish
did you do giving attention I think we
just made that up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
