about nine I've investments out since we
were 12 years old we went like on the
playground just playing together and no
confrontation at all none whatsoever my
first memory of you is hating you and
fighting and then my next memory is
being the best of friends
Joey - she was a lovely little girl with
bushy eyebrows and I was a beautiful
beautiful swan of a gay boy he embraced
my unibrow mama we come from like
parents that were immigrants
we'd go to each other's houses and like
it smelled differently because of the
food we were exposed to different things
really early on and it was never like a
ill what is that it was more like yeah
like I want to try that what is that
that looks really good I've been able to
be a part of different world that I
wouldn't have been a part of yeah if I
wasn't your friend I'm really grateful
for that because we got so close early
on I learned about other cultures I knew
from a young age that I didn't like any
sort of jokes that were like oh so once
was a bad driver because they're Asian
because I would automatically think of
her and I would think about her mom who
would drive us everywhere and I was like
I don't like that joke because I think
of her mom is my mom and I don't like
that people knew we were best friends in
high school but they had certain ideas
of us yeah they thought I was like the
clients we was and I was like some super
 like yeah which is totally messed
up and like not based on any no an act I
was just always associated as like oh
she's funny and loud and obnoxious and I
think that they had a lot to do with
like my race they even if Ahri's louder
obnoxious and I'm mellow that day people
will automatically like revert to me and
that was hurtful and then also I think
there was like a dis-ease there yeah we
had to like address that you and our
friendship we all stood up for you yeah
we always stood up for each other I'm
just glad that that didn't tear us apart
like people viewing us differently
racial identity I feel like is something
that's assigned to you from the outside
like people on the outside looking
and their assumptions once you're
actually in it you see that it's a lot
different from those out of my
perception we grow just like fell in
love with each other for who you are as
people not necessarily what our waste
was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
