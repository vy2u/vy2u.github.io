one wasn't real no way let's find out
take a look around the internet it's
definitely a thing there are many
articles and studies that document the
orgasm gap happening in the bedroom
BuzzFeed com pulled over 200,000 people
and 35% admit to frequently faking
orgasm during sex if all this faking is
happening what's it like for the other
person can they tell I put together an
audio example of some sexy sounds to see
if my co-workers could tell if it's fake
or not no that was that was fake that
sounded like someone eating a sandwich
oh my god is this an orgy like how many
people are infected with the first audio
example admittedly pretty fake sounding
most people could tell who's faking but
the second one seemed a little more
convincing yeah I think that's real
so what happens in a relationship if one
person is faking and the other person
can't tell is this ultimately bad for
their sex life I decided to ask an
expert to find out more dr. Jennifer
Berman thank you so much for joining me
what makes you an expert in discussing
orgasm well I've had a lot of them I
wouldn't say I'm an expert in orgasms
but I'm definitely an expert in the
sexual health of which orgasm is a part
why would someone fake an orgasm there's
a lot of pressure on women you know to
be responsive to make the man feel good
it's not necessarily who I was with
because I feel like I faked it with
people who have been in relationships
with I faked it with people who like I
saw for like a minute the foreplay
wasn't exactly what it should have been
so the experience was just kind of like
after a while I was like I need to get
over with this he made such an important
thing and I just didn't have good
communication with him at the time to be
like this isn't everything like chill so
it was the only way to ever like finish
it does orgasm faking happen the same
amount in heterosexual relationships as
in LGBT relationships it's two women do
they still feel that same pressure a
date women sometime it's gotta happen
like one of you are gonna be on a
different way of length and you just
want to please done not to get things
over with but literally just to like
make them feel better about themselves
in this situation I remember once I told
a partner hey I didn't get off yet and
afterwards she was just so offended and
shocked and afraid to touch me again you
don't want to hurt someone so you faked
it it's not just women that fake orgasms
men you know aren't kind to fake it at
times as well sometimes you feel in it
sometimes you not not that I wasn't into
her I just wasn't into it like at that
moment I was like and I'm doing it like
I'm not really feeling this like it's
not really gonna happen things we just
weren't really
well relationship-wise and i think that
reflects the sex no we move fruit we
dated but for a while after that but I
will say that she never let me forget it
it is faking orgasm problematic and in
relationships being enthusiastic perhaps
not in an authentic reflex way but you
know through motions of your body
through your breath through your noses
is reinforcing in and of itself do that
and do that robustly and do that you
know happily but when you feel pressured
to have to pretend that something
happened to your body that you're
pleased in a way that you're not and not
being authentic to yourself and your
partner I do think that that can lead to
problems over time so faking the short
term all good but faking in the long
term could be a problem after going
through this investigation it made me
think about my own relationship with for
years
I realized I've never had an open
discussion with my girlfriend about the
orgasm gap was it happening with us it
was time to ask the tough questions hi
Gina
hi Alex is there any time that that you
have faked with me yeah probably in the
beginning but as our relationship has
grown we have to be like into and like
we're both having good days that is
gonna be awesome
yes usually I'm so in my head about what
I can be doing be in your head be in
your body
being that bad I love you booth thanks
for talking with me me too
overall the orgasm gap seems to be
present in every relationship but how
each partner addresses it matters open
and honest communication with your
partner builds trust and intimacy which
means better chances of sharing the Big
