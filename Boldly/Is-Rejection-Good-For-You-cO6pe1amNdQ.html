it's the worst it's pretty easy to avoid
though if you just don't put yourself
out there hey man but is there any value
in it is rejection good for something
these are the questions that JA Jiang
was asking himself when he started 100
days of rejection therapy
I feel growing up I was afraid to step
out and do things I was afraid to get
rejected by my family and friends and to
fail so I did this thing called a
hundred days of rejection based on a
game called rejection therapy or
basically you go out every day and look
for rejection so I said I'm gonna do
this for 100 days I'll start a video
blog about it after the first time I
started basically I wouldn't and how to
found a stranger and a second ball $100
from you excuse me do you think I'm for
$100 from you no all right that was one
of the most awkward and scary moments I
feel almost in my life so the next day I
said I'm not gonna run no matter what
happened
a burger refill
after the initial rejection I didn't run
I stay engaged and that made me feel
much more powerful much more confident
that life and death feeding was gone all
right so from there all I said my job is
putting myself out there
ask ask for things and see what happens
can I deliver your next piece of Prayer
you may be a life manifold for you can
you see me like a German Shepherd I
found out that rejection says much more
about the other person than me I can
take a quick nap here really the fear of
rejection is very sneaky is the force
that at the back of your mind that
controls a lot of decision you're making
sliced pineapple so sometimes people do
say no it's still alright it's a little
awkward I asked for a discount at
Starbucks the lady just like thought I
was crazy the most surprising thing to
me was just how nice it was to just talk
to people a lot of times I think if you
preface like I know this is super weird
but I come here in all the time and I
really really like these pen sometimes
if you do something weird and go out of
your way it opens up this like human
connection that I forget is there can i
buy these pens there I think the FedEx
guy just seems like the guy who's
working there but you ask him a little
question like something's kind of weird
and we really had this bond where he was
like can't just just take a pen
okay and the guy behind me at Starbucks
I never would think to talk to anyone
like that I'm always on my phone you
know
but I got your coffee today you played
wanna fight me come yeah okay yeah
there's the worst absolute worst thing
that could have happened was he was like
no and he found it kind of weird but
instead I had this like nice moment with
his stranger and as I was leaving her
but just both smiling not really made my
day and I didn't think it was gonna
happen like that I feel like the thing I
learned most from this experience was
just that you know putting yourself out
there it's kind of like fun and it comes
with Rewards sometimes you people say no
but like no isn't a big deal
rejection is a good and normal part of
life and if anything it just clarifies
who you are so don't be afraid to go out
there and try something new
you might hear no but you might get a
big old yes so do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
