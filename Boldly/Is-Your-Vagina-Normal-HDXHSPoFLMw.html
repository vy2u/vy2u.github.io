generally no but pain during sex can be
caused by many factors ranging from fit
and position to more serious heart
conditions such as endometriosis cysts
or vaginal cancer I have a lot of pubic
hair is that normal for sure everybody
has different amounts of pubic hair and
the choice to remove or keep it as a
matter of personal preference is it
normal if I can't reach orgasm through
vaginal penetration yes it's totally
normal
only 30% of women can orgasm through
penetration alone
the majority of nerve endings in the
genital region are located in the
clitoris which isn't always stimulated
through penetration is vaginal discharge
normal to a certain extent yes typical
vaginal discharge cleans and protects
the vagina normal vaginal discharge is
either thin inflexible or a thicker
sticky texture signs of abnormal vaginal
discharge include a change in smell
especially if it smells bad and changes
in color particularly if it's greenish
or grayish is it normal for my vagina to
itch or burn no this may be a symptom of
a sexually transmitted disease a yeast
infection or another problem so make
sure to get it checked out does my
vagina look normal there is no such
thing as a normal-looking vagina vaginas
can come in all kinds of different
shapes sizes and colors
it's a bonafide rainbow of genitalia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
