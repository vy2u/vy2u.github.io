competing against a thirteen-year-old to
see who can do a full glam look the best
in 20 minutes that includes foundation
eyebrows eyeshadow contouring lips
mascara all everything you can put on
your face we're gonna be putting it on
we got 20 minutes we're gonna see who
reign supreme is it the teams or the
girl wise women
hi I'm alia Muse and I'm 13 years old
I've been doing makeup for about 3 years
now I love doing makeup and I think it's
great because like breaking stereotypes
that you know kids shouldn't wear makeup
and that it's not okay and it teaches
younger girls and boys who love makeup
that it's okay to wear it I'm Kelsey I'm
26
hi I'm Quinton and I'm ageless I've
always loved makeup I like to think I'm
good at it she's good but just like any
other like millennial girl I took every
morning on my Instagram to see our page
and watch YouTube tutorials thinking
that like I could do that but I can't
I've never mastered the going out looks
or anything like that and so as I got
older I just stuck to like eyeliner oh
thank you I expected to be pretty fun I
think that they can do makeup too I
personally love doing smoky eyes and I
love doing like you know the classic
eyeliner and red lipstick look I see
these kids these teens on the internet
these days they're talented they got the
internet how to learn we didn't have
someone teaching us stuff how that got
machines you can hold up to your skin
and get your perfect foundation match
it's crazy every who flaw which walk
gizzard blizzard trick machine yeah
micro bleeding
boat oxen I'm not surprised she's
probably gonna be schooling insane I'm
pretty sure that this little girl is
gonna kick my ass and I'm okay with that
I'm gonna try to beat her because I'm
competitive and sometimes I see kids
stare at me and I hop and I can't do
anything about it and I hate that so
this is my moment to get rid Redemption
fairly of course under a good umbrella
through HR and through the art of makeup
all right here we go
we're about to begin this competition
who can do the best full glam look in
only 20 minutes are you mark get set oh
go so don't cheat against Cathy don't
you to get show of any penalty so my
makeup is probably the wrong shade but
we're gonna make it work oh yeah she's
putting the foundation on first amateur
kidding
so you're going you're going heavy on
the eyes very very heavy okay should I
try and do something like what you're
doing no it's not too bad it's not good
at eyeliner on me
 don't crush when you know it's
not classy look god the wings never
match
yeah I did I I did everything but I
didn't do it like as best as I could in
20 minutes is still look like that I
kept up like I had all the products I
just don't have the finesse that you do
I did the best I could with what I was
given I have my cell phone back and say
that you know Quentin did the thing is
is that it doesn't matter if you're
better at doing to make up lumps you're
a good person support each other you
call it matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
