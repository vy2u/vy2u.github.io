if it could be worse one thing I want my
kids to understand about beauty is that
there's beauty and difference that
people of all different shapes and sizes
can be beautiful and that we can feel
beautiful because of how we feel about
ourselves about our self-esteem about
who we are and what we do that you know
beauty is more about doing than about
I like yes I've never looked better
I want her to know that beauty comes
from within that all this is just
surface it doesn't really matter it's

pika it was you know beautiful who's

are more important things than physical
beauty um but the most important thing
