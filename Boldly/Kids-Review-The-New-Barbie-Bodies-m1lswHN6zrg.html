Barbies except she's like blonde
I'm ready wait should I close my eyes
whoa oh my gosh she has like the same
hair type as me the regular Robbie's is
just like flat and of course you can't
like curl the other Barbie's hair cuz
it'll like melt it has black hair and
darks darker skin like an African
American it looks a little weird and I
think it should be like a different kind
of beat sighs so she could be able to
wear anything not all girls like to her
heels oh oh so they're like not as tall
yay cuz I'm like really short oh she's
like me very tall this one's very very
tall then they have this one she's more
fat there's some women who are skinny
and some women who are like I don't want
to say this but they're like chubby this
one actually has some muscle it looks
really strange they look a little
strange but they still look mama sewed
up I really really like the curvy run
because some people don't look that much
like Barbies so I like how they made a
marker here and their feet aren't real
life positions like I think they were
like really creative doing yeah these
can also stand up normally except for
that one I have to identify this one cuz
I'm really tall I like this one and
everybody's like are you 13 years old
and I'm like no I'm 10 years old why
would you think that between African
American Barbie doll like me and I love
her hair her hair's like resembles mine
hair actually only this one can stand up
normally this last survivor
people now can see like the resemblance
of them and these type of Barbie dolls
there's really no average body type but
all of these they're all different which
sort of represents the difference in
people and real life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
