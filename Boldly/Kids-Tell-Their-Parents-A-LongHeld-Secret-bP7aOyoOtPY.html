was a little person at the time and it
was just to have fun
she'll be a little angry with me and I
hope this doesn't prevent her from being
generous in the future it surrounds what
I really did on my prom night I think
that she'll probably be like Oh a few
years ago for a birthday present my mom
you got me these really nice pearl
earrings you went to an after party
wearing these pearl earrings and I drank
a little too much the earrings
disappeared that nice a long time you've
been lying to me I wouldn't call it a
light save bet the truth I'm not too
thrilled unreal when I was really little
at home when you were not at home I used
to dress Russell at Russell's my brother
I used to dress Russell up in princess
clothes and paint his nails and do this
makeup take all the makeup off of
Russell and everything before you came
home so you wouldn't know when you say
we your mother is very honest in this
plot and Russell lake did he had fun
when I was in high school
hmm I snuck out of the house all the
time all the time are you serious yeah
where did you go to
the beach my boyfriend and his friends I
don't even know how I didn't know that I
don't know either
that is bad I suck I actually did not go
to prom the prom that you've got the
tuxedo far and paid all the money for
yeah I went I like it took a trip with
my friends then they it Mexico what yeah
what what if just wait what about the
girl here were supposed to take
she came with no I don't believe you I
tell you what happened we went to Mexico
yeah there was a concert that weekend we
went to go see it so basically I paid
for you to go to Mexico where I thought
I was paying did you wear the tuxedo and
you that's terrible I think you should
pay me back I'm not paying for Mexico
what did you think
I don't know your romantic encounters so
moms don't want to hear that Oh God
I still love her but I'm not happy well
now I know why it looks a living pair of
black pups it gives me a little
ammunition to bring up once in a while
if the situation presents itself it
probably would have been a lot angrier
if I found out about it right after it
happened
especially since he'd put on this whole
masquerade though thankfully you weren't
like all on the streets doing crack or
something that's true because we do know
well well I did sniffs Smarties once
just once though what does that do
nothing it just fills your nose this
sugar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
