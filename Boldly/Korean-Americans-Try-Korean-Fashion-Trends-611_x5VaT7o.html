pushing numb the literally translates
the urban war you're not a beast you're
like a deer in grass because you're
innocent and you're not aggressive I
guess today we're trying Korean trends
when we got a fashion stylist from Korea
to handpick our outfits today never
really went all out with a Korean trend
style before I'm half curious and half
concerned how I'm gonna look like
standing out and expressing myself
colorfully these people have jokes that
I wouldn't like it in Korea I'm excited
because I've always wanted straight
eyebrows ha
career it's really about what society
dictates what is the trend what is
socially acceptable
you
the top look that can get you the most
opportunity or what they say better life
would be the goddess look slightly
lighter skin tongue long hair big curls
focusing on the bottom the one of the
main looks for men is smooth intellect
circular glasses cropped pants we find
smartest sexy I like the makeup and
everything I just don't think I look
good with it up it's not bad it's not
particularly what I wear I don't think
they're gonna recognize me at first if I
just sit down next to them like it was
this guy just do the quick reveal and
they'll realize oh my god it's him I
guess if I lived in Korea this is
alternate universe Rachel would look
like straight eyebrows don't look good
on me I look sad recogniz you look
amazing
your kpop with the jacket and the
glasses but then it's banana republic
with your daughter yes you so beautiful
doing these Korean trends and you
realized we don't have to be stuck to
one look sponge experiment this isn't a
really typical Korean guy look I'm not
of used to this much Mako or any makeup
at all double eyelid thing going on oh
that's why you look different I would be
willing to implement little bits of
these into my usual wardrobe I would be
willing to try a middle part I would
probably do it with my usual eye makeup
just so I'm more used to it this is more
preppy Sylvanas good to win in the
middle
feel like can go step beyond my fashion
game I'm sure this isn't the only Korean
trend that's out there there's probably
like subgroups and I'd love to try all
the different ones I don't see myself
ever putting on makeup it's interesting
what people go through every day
actually applying makeup yeah this also
just makes you realize whatever seems
trendy now here gonna be gone and it's
like all these things are socially
constructed don't stress out about what
school you tried new things find your
style be unique it made me want to
experiment with my eyebrow shakes more
not a very different person oh no
eyebrows no eyebrows one eyebrow for
eyebrows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
