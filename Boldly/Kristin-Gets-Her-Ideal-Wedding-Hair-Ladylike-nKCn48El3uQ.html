marasmus nurse yes ma'am wedding
christen is getting married today she's
literally getting married today and I'm
marrying her today we are trying to find
Kristen's ideal wedding hair and it's a
competition
Kristen is gonna look like an angel
today and I'm here to judge her because
that's what friends do
they're like hey I'm feeling good about
myself and I'm there to step in and be
like well fucking don't okay listening
to evaluate my hairstyles we're going to
put them all through three challenges
the first one is walking down the aisle
in the veil the second one is pictures
with a big fan third one is the dance
party my name is Laura CK and I'm a
bridal specialist at Studio K which is
my salon and we specialize in only
Bridal hair whenever I was taking a look
at Kristen's Instagram pictures I got a
very strong vintage wind blown at me but
three people selecting these updos are
Freddy Chantal and Jen I'm ready to say
I do to it up do if I had to describe
Kristin it'd be this this is how I
describe Kristen I feel like Kristen has
this kind of like hidden vintage miss
behind her that she doesn't really
expose very much and so with my hair
style I want to bring it just front and
center
you
I'm fine but I love
it looks a little bit stiffer than I
than I imagined it to but because of
that it's not gonna go no I'm gonna have
this hair until my 50th and
do you feel like I'm in a movie and like
the nineteen fifties like it's I don't
think my hair has been this high ever I
think I'd give us Harris six it gets all
the points for staying in place but I
think I need something that feels a
little bit more like the person who
sleeps through their alarm and doesn't
curl their hair until the last minute so
I chose this really cute deep body wave
down do that's very like old Hollywood
Grace Kelly vibe I'm not too worried
about the other girls I'm kind of just
like banking on what I know Kristen
likes and what her style is
oh my gosh oh my gosh my style is
excellent Freddy knows pretty good buddy
knows Betty knows what part I am
interested to see how it holds up
hey this is staying together pretty good
I think there's a lot of hairspray going
on and it was stood like the fan which I
was really worried about yeah overall I
think Freddy made a pretty good choice I
would give this probably an eight
because I think that maybe with a few
more hours of this it might fall a
little bit more but it feels promising
it feels like I'm ready for battle
I feel like Kristen is a fun flipy style
I chose updos because I just think updos
are very lovely I think they're messy
and contained we're just sort of just
like how life is you're contained up
here but then down here you're messy
it's Punk
oh wow yeah this is the one
look at those wolf sleep really do I
love honestly photographs really nicely
- yeah it's good from all angles it's
definitely like this is in the front
some hell of a party in the back
Jen takes really well I would say this
is like definitely frames the face a
photographs well from all sides on a
scale of one to ten I would write this
hair a seven I think it only loses
points because I'm a little scared of
this swoop feel like I would need to be
perfect throughout the day and I just
don't think I'm gonna be that perfect on
my wedding day
okay this was really hard I really liked
all of these hairstyles everyone did a
really good job there can only be one
winner which makes me so sad the winner
is Freddie felt like very you know with
me but like amped up 250 it really makes
me feel good because it makes me feel
like okay what do I feel is most Kristyn
and I really feel like I tried to like
fuse in her personality with the hair
style I chose wedding hair lady tested
lay marry
a lady okay my next step
hey y'all click on that POTUS over there
see more videos from our channel some of
our favorites are in there and some we
like just okay but watch anyway because
he loves you yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
