volume or button this is not a test this
is not a drill even though it may sound
like we're in the same room okay and I
are on opposite sides of the country
right now can you hear me loud and clear
you know what it's it's a little fuzzy
but I just you know I assumed that from
Florida that's how it would be Wow are
we already thrown in Florida
just to get all of them in we have more
start early man see I didn't even hear
what Joe key just so bad what did you
say
I said to get all the jokes in we have
to start early guys this could be a
 disaster
don't know this is the first time we're
doing this so you're gonna have to bear
with us oh boy we're off to a great
start but Kate is in LA and I am down in
Boca baby hey friend
do you cancer is know I tried again a
little bit but I'm telling you I just I
go and then I just stop and then it well
I hate this walking through what
happened walk you through it this is
very uncomfortable for me we should also
mention because I'm not there in LA with
t we have that can you say hello camera
real quick is running sound for Kate
who's never heard any of this before so
he has no clue so you have out
coming you're like basically in a room
alone talking about coming yeah that's
exactly what's happening back in this
wing okay this wing okay anyway so talk
about your cone or lack thereof
yeah man just not you no not yet what
walk me through it what what did you do
this time differently or did you at all
do anything differently no I didn't do
anything differently I just figured you
know maybe if I just keep doing the same
thing something will change
in sanity I think what I need to do is
smoke some more weed to be quite honest
with you what know what yeah Oh makes
everything better okay I did just hear
about a weed Lube but it's not Lube
you just put weed on your vagina and
then you masturbate and it's supposed to
make everything like way more
sensitive I bought it for my friend for
her birthday once because I have my weed
card and I bought that for her and the
guy at the store was just like whoa who
are using this on a boyfriend and I was
like no and he was like oh oh by
yourself first of all that weed store
man should not be a clerk if that's what
he's behind acting or how do I know so
funny I always think when I go in I'd
like try to be a little bit cooler when
I go into weed stores I'm like a man
yeah lit up like weed source scare me
the same way that casinos scare me even
though I'm an adult and I'm allowed to
be there and I am a paying customer I am
terrified that I'm always gonna do
something wrong casinos shut up Kelsey
you know I love casinos okay III what
Kelsey and I Steven Kanter went to
Africa oh do you know in Vegas and I did
a really good job until I lost
everything we went to Vegas for 24 hours
was it even 24 hours 24 of the drunkest
hours of my life so we went to go shoot
a video in Vegas and my flight ended up
getting delayed because I took a
different flight out so I showed up
about like eight hours after them to
them completely plastered wasted and I
was like what happened to you guys and
then the trip just became about drinking
and not making a video but you loved
casinos anyway should we answer a fan
question yeah okay so this one came
through Instagram from someone that I
thought it was a really good question so
this is from fernanda junk
she said huge fan of the podcast I could
really some help
so I am from Brazil but I've been living
in Germany for some months now cuz I am
doing an exchange year here I just got
recently single so I decided to download
tinder here so see how it would go I
went on a date with a guy on Sunday
was really nice but he didn't kiss me at
the end but the next day he texted me we
went on again Tuesday it was really nice
again but he still didn't kiss me but he
talked the whole time about how amazing
I was and how I look he liked my smile
and these cheesy things you say on a
first date but after that I had another
date with a guy on Wednesday and so I
went to be him and it was going so well
he was gorgeous fun intelligent and then
who appears the guy from the
other date and so he even comes over to
the table to say hello I just felt so
bad I tried to make it look natural so
both wouldn't notice so today I texted
the guy who we bumped into saying that
the guy I was on a date with with just a
friend I didn't want to lie but I also
didn't want to ruin my chances with both
you know now I'm feeling like crap I am
super embarrassed and I don't even hang
out with one of them in a public space
what does she do she went on two dates
with a guy who didn't kiss her she went
on another date with a different guy on
that date she saw the first guy and now
she feels bad and also the other guy
like came up to the table which I think
is a really either ballsy or totally
 naive move because he solved
this girl out with another guy and
didn't think that maybe she was on a
date so he just went up to the table to
say hello like that's ballsy
unless he was doing it in the way where
he genuinely didn't know you were on
today and then I think you're okay also
I don't know why she lied like she felt
the need to text the guy and be like by
the way that wasn't a date which it was
I kind of do the same thing if I'm even
like talking to someone or kind of
interested in them I'm like oh I'm fully
committed to you like I'm just committed
to the idea of you she's recently single
so she's used to commitment so I feel
like unless you have the conversation
where it's like oh no we're not dating
other people in two dates you owe
nothing to anyone date around you don't
know anything to anybody
you don't have to lie you don't have to
worry about their feelings you're single
you will I mean worry about their
feelings of course but not like I think
yeah on the app you're dating multiple
people I guess if the guy likes you it
won't really matter if you were on
another date you know any mean like even
if
kiss you that doesn't mean he's not into
you he could be totally nervous I think
if he's into you and then he sees you
out on a date with another person who
that could actually be like hotter that
makes you more desirable it makes you
that you know the thing that they can't
have and what's that quote they say you
always want what you can't have or
figure out first why it was that you
felt uncomfortable having him see you
well you think you had it you hit it on
the head she yeah oh single newly single
that she probably feels like she's doing
something wrong because she's seeing
multiple men at once for sure and if
that is the is that is the case I don't
even think you need to talk to this
other guy about it yeah unless of course
you want to continue dating him and then
you talked to him and figure out what
you want but you don't have to be
committed to anybody and you don't have
to you're allowed to date multiple but I
get that there's a lot of shame in being
like like oh no I'm not I'm not dating
around and I'm a no I'm just I'm in a
tower
I'm unapproachable I think to like it
comes back down to the basic idea and
this is just like a blanket statement
for a situation like this but like women
don't owe you men like we don't owe
you a explanation we don't owe
you a text we don't owe you an
apology like we we don't owe you a
commitment I we don't we don't owe you
 like especially after two dates or
one date or whatever it was especially
if you did not make it a move which I
understand might say and make a move
test it out talk about it sounds like
there's a lack of communication in
general here but like you also don't
have to like after the second date be
like let's communicate like what's our
communication style like this is a time
where you really want to feel someone's
communication style out I would highly
recommend reading or taking the test
it's called your love language you can
figure out like how you like to be shown
emotions and how you emot-- to to
someone that you're in a sexual
relationship with there's like five
things you can be you can be like words
of affirmation physical touch acts of
service gifts and then there's another
one so basically like my love language
is I like words of affirmation so you
can show me you can touch me all you
want but if I don't hear from your mouth
that you like
I won't it just doesn't register so like
learning that about myself really helped
me learn how to communicate better with
my sexual partners because I would have
them also take it so that I could learn
like how to make them happier what do
you do that on Oh God
never a good time I don't know I've
always brought it up when I think I'm
drunk I'm like what's your love language
though and then they're like what and
like take this quiz on my phone what's
your love yeah I don't know I don't know
I'll take the quiz I'll figure it out I
do definitely think though that there's
like I feel like maybe she likes guy
number one a little bit more than guy
number two because she wasn't really
worried about guy number two seeing I
never won or anything like that yeah I
feel like if you like guy number one
maybe we could talk about different how
do you communicate can't all be up to
the other person like how do you
communicate and that's something Blee
Blee do I not know how to do I'll be
like I'll think it really hard and then
hopefully they'll pick up on it it
sounds by the way she wrote it talking
about the second guy she said he was
gorgeous he was fine he was intelligent
and so like it sounds like maybe this
other guy is also appealing and you
haven't it up with him yet see
there's still time you know if that
other guy asks what your deal is you can
be honest with him yeah why not the
other guy yeah yeah just juggle if you
don't once see what happens
learn from it yeah figure it out like
seven days you know in a week hey are
you trying to say you should have seven
different lovers no five because you
need two days for the weekend to go or
you just need Monday and Tuesday to get
yourself together okay I'm like hope for
the rest of the week I hope that
answered your question Fernanda if it
didn't we're really sorry
that's our advice for you girl yeah
should we also talk about last week what
the disaster the real disaster and then
the petty disaster that happened yeah so
a real disaster there are fires in
California there are a lot of people in
need
holiday season especially imagine losing
everything you own around the holidays
yeah also another bunch of firefighters
and first responders that are doing I
mean a job that is impossible to contain
and we should all appreciate them and
next time you see a fireman man next
time you see a fireman what I meant to
say was next time you see a fireman ,
man just me out of beer with them by oh
my or her a beer yep but then
because of the fires which are terrible
right which are terrible Oh guys it's
not gonna sound it's not gonna sound
good but ya talking about the holiday
party last week it just got moved so we
didn't have one they can't have the
holiday party because it was up in the
hills where the fires were happening so
it wasn't like it wasn't like we were
just gonna have a party in the middle of
Hollywood and they were like oh there's
too many but it was like really close to
where the fires were happening and the
scale and the air quality was really
shitty so they were like we don't want
to put a bunch of drunk people up trying
to get by so they moved it yeah so we
didn't have so it's fine but that's why
we don't have any holiday party updates
we did actually Keith one of the try
guys you guys know him he scrambled to
put together a backup unofficial holiday
party was what he called it where the
next day he spent all day calling venues
asking if we could if they could host
200 something plus people last minute
for free for a party and we found a club
and were three
yeah Boulevard 3 in Hollywood shout out
to them and we got a couple free bottles
of vodka
they had a booth set up they put a
 signage they were like they put
up a photo booth with like a little
Halle Cray logo they have light skate
you didn't go why not
I was tired man I was tired and I came
to the conclusion that most of the time
when I go out I'm like all right
tonight's the night I fall in love and I
find that one person who I could be with
forever and it'll never have to go out
again ever
so I was - I didn't want to go dance I
was tired I'm trying to save money
the lift is expensive I'd have to put on
a dress which I already had on it I was
actually drunk but
dressed you were fully dressed drinking
a glass of wine and your Instagram story
and then texted me I'm not coming I just
didn't want to deal with the hassle the
good news is is that wasn't the real
holiday party so I think you get a pass
if you just didn't it wasn't I wasn't
prepared yeah I was tired I was ready to
go home and go to sleep and then Keith
had to throw a party so selfish I went I
ran for like an hour it was fun
basically the end of moral of the
stories we help all those people who are
dealing with the fires get out safely
and that this car might need to be cut
we have a few other things to bring up
panties
Wow how do we segue into this I think we
just talked about it man boy I could use
some extra money hey this would be great
if you had like oh I don't know I
 me on these add to talk about
underwear so that we can easily segue
into this next topic and instead we hope
to say that we love underwear in general
okay so back when I was in college this
is for real
I looked up I was so broke I looked at
many ways to make extra money and one of
them that I really wanted to do was sell
my eggs but that is it's so invasive but
it pays baby does it pay but the thing
is that I just never went through with
it I was just like yeah I'm just gonna
get stoned and not do it and also the
fact that you would then have a child
out in the world Kate yeah but it
wouldn't be my kid yeah what it's your
egg yeah I didn't actually consider that
part thank God I didn't do it what I
love about meth was the other easier one
way less invasive felt like was selling
my underwear ah line that will explain
it you'll hear and they also did it they
did it in orange is the new black to
stop laughing oh they did do that so
basically like apparently there's some
website it's a real website that is just
exclusively for this purpose where girls
wear underwear and
men or women people buy it people buy it
after you worn it and you can like do
 in it you can go like play people
like what's the matter here it is
so what we're saying is Kate and I are
gonna do this but here's the thing
I've watched lied orders so many times
like SVU so many times to be like
they're gonna know it's mine and they're
gonna find out where I am and they're
gonna track me down what and then how
would they find you from your underwear
dude smelling dogs could find me and
leave a trail
you think someone in like the
Middle East let's say someone from like
the Middle East by the Middle East out
of this okay bye Middle East I'm one
from Asia fuzzier under what why are we
leaving the middle why can't I use the
Middle East as an example
wait Middle East see even the words the
triggers just a lot of going on
yeah and some people need some stress
relief they need to sniff some
there's my one from Kansas is my
underwear okay fine for purposes of your
 story you think someone from
Kansas is gonna then go buy one of those
Sherlock sniffing beetle dogs put your
dirty habit why you got it as I'm saying
people might have it so so it would have
to all the stars would all have to align
to where they buy your underwear they
have a beagle sniffing dog yeah then
they come in and then I'm like at my I'm
in my apartment I'm hanging out with
Pete and they break down the frickin
wall and they're just like you're
pushing spine and then I'm toast they
cut they cut me in half
and then they just literally drive away
with my I'm scared to do it oh my
god okay would it be nice to make a
couple an extra couple hundo a month yes
therapy's expensive and insurance is
dude if we could come in you back oh
yeah yeah if we could pay for our
therapy with our used panty sales I
would consider that a win so
basically this is the this is a
challenge cater and I are gonna do this
by the next podcast we'll have
Update we're gonna see who can sell
their underwear for the most money and
then we'll donate the other person's
underwear to charity or some
crazy person should we donate it to
charity
I don't know why I'm laughing zowie is
it dirty money if we donate dirty panty
I know we're no charity I feel like it's
like compost money at that point Wow
did you just call your a compost
yeah I guess it does need to be
fertilized is that I have like a wax I
really just have to figure a lot of
stuff out I have to figure out how I
feel about all the things we just talked
about but we're still gonna do this
right you're not back yeah yeah of
course I'm not backing out yes well no
now it sounds like I'm pressuring you
into doing this and people already think
I yell at you or something on the fogger
people people keep commenting that I
talk too loud and that I'm overpowering
Kate that's just how loud I talk
okay I just miss you I miss you
Justin's make for the heart go fart fart
farther fighters this is gibberish this
is nonsense we can't use any of this
this makes the heart grow fonder baby
alright you're in Boca you're
okay okay about that existence I am in
Boca doing a miniseries it's a
documentary on chronic pain we are
trying basically Lara and I both have
chronic pain someone reached out to us
said that they could cure us we both
have incurable illnesses that yeah could
we bring Laura and yeah Laura are you
ready oh you're right there so we just
brought Laura in hey girl hello how you
doing I'm good Laura if you don't know
her she is a writer at BuzzFeed and an
incredible writer at that he does a lot
of content based around for lack of a
better word my vision your vagina do you
want to tell everyone what the that
means yeah yeah so I have endometriosis
and over the years that's kind of
stemmed into a lot of pelvic floor
issues
vaginismus vulvodynia whatever whatever
basically my vagina hurts all the time
and I have a lot of stomach issues
especially around your period
it's like laboring yeah and so it's
actually something that affects a lot of
women if you don't know what and any of
those words were that she just looked it
up go read some of her articles
because I truly believe there's no
reason why men especially if you're
listening to this go read about
women's health issues because if you and
especially Laura writes so beautifully
in articulate so well what it's truly
like to live with a chronic illness you
should know about what this is and
they're like you were saying like it's
not uncommon it's not uncommon there's
so many people that don't know about
what this is and what's the harm and
just learning and just educate yourself
a little bit if you understand the
vagina better wouldn't that yeah yeah it
would be great also I'm sure you've
already talked about this and like your
articles and stuff like that but not me
yeah yeah you've even by like even when
I first like was learning about chronic
pain which I I don't know that much
about so I have a bunch of questions for
you guys but it's hard to believe that
it actually is constant because we're so
taught to be like oh she's being
dramatic or oh it's not that bad it's
for like which is truly horrible but
like when you complain about something
that's very common to sort of feel like
it can't be that bad only because it's
so almost impossible to fathom and I
can't imagine what it actually feels
like to have to deal with it and then
yeah especially because when all women
get their periods and for some women
they could be like oh she has cramps
like I have cramps but to
understand like that there are
differences in levels of pain and there
are women who like don't even understand
what the pain you go through is everyday
you know we knew each other as
co-workers but then when I started
reading our articles we became a lot
closer because I also have a chronic
pain called trigeminal neuralgia and
it's a neuropathic pain so that means it
stems from the nerves in my brain and it
goes into my face and I have anesthesia
Delarosa laura has been dealing with
hers for ten years coming up now and
mine just happened about three years ago
so there is a time where I remember
being pain-free very vividly so the past
four years has been like talk about a
life change holy I have
learned so much just a about the chronic
pain community B about health care and
surance and how up the healthcare
system is and see just about like my own
resilience and patience and it's not
something I talk a lot about and
although I did come out with a video a
couple months ago that kind of like
showed people for the first time about
this pain and so we thought we'd do an
episode about it because you guys write
to us a lot about it but we started
talking just on our company slack which
is like a G chatroom about our pain and
then we decided to start a support group
together so we host a chronic pain of
all kinds any kinds anybody with any
kind of pain doesn't matter what it is
and we do that once a month we basically
like sit around in a circle and cry and
drink wine after doing this for a while
we thought what the we should do
more content based around this so we
pitch an idea to our boss about going
and trying different things to cure our
illnesses because we both are at a point
in our pain where we're done and
we're over it anyways that's why we're
here in Boca oh I was just gonna say
this is like not comparable to what you
guys are dealing with but I know that
like I remember I would see you with
like a suction cup on your face and just
see you would just be bruised everywhere
else so like what are some ways that you
guys know both or try we both are very
quiet about our pain I think like even
as much as you write about it and like
as much as I make I'm starting to make
content around it like we both really
internalize a lot of I was me
that's always been taught though like
it's awkward you don't want to make
someone else uncomfortable you don't
wanna be like I'm having a really shitty
day yeah and I hate my life like you
just don't go up to people and say that
you constantly feel like what are you
gonna do we watched that Michelle wolf
special yeah and she has this joke about
if with a period like that's the only
time a person is bleeding and it's not
the topic of conversation and it's crazy
that you're in like full-blown agony and
yet you still have to be like carrying
on as though you're not which is crazy
that you'd even feel like like you have
you ever seen it this is I'm gonna get
 for this but have you ever seen
like a guy get hit in the ball right and
then everyone started leavin if it was
an accident even yeah you told him to
move and he didn't and you swung into it
and it
an accident it's still like world out
yeah like you're done you've done to
other people yeah and I'm not saying
that like Oh get over it like that hurts
that's just like how come one pain is
acknowledged and another pain is how
come one voice is understood and the
other one is just district also like we
we I get tired of having to explain all
the time like I emotional labor it's the
same story every time like the the
statistic I usually tell when people ask
about it is I tell them that it
trigeminal neuralgia was nicknamed the
suicide disease in the medical field
because the pain would is so brutal and
excruciating that people would kill
themselves because there is no cure for
it and so once I say that to someone
they're like oh like but you don't
look you don't act like it you don't
look like it yeah and then that goes
into a whole like it takes it takes so
much energy all the time to explain why
I don't feel good or why I don't feel
like doing something or why I have to
cancel a plan or why I need a break in
the middle of the shoot that like I
can't help but it brings your
mood down it brings the party
down it brings everybody down to
constantly have to be like even my
friends my closest friends who know
about it like I worry that if I if I
talk one more time about my pain they're
gonna just throw their hands up
and done and unfriended me on Facebook
or some I think cuz we're so tired
of dealing with it that we can't imagine
another person being willing to be like
I'll take this on I'll hear about it
every day cuz it's like I don't even
want to think about it yeah I don't like
I'm almost in denial at certain stages
and I'm like I can't go through this for
another 10 years I don't know how the
 I've done it for the last 10 years
so I just like pretend it's not there it
never works
I'm gonna try and we've both tried you
know when you do explain to someone that
you're in pain and then they offer
support even if it's coming from like a
good place like Oh have you tried yoga
or have you tried this thing and you
were talking earlier about things I do
like it's transferring pain I will
literally take a heating pad that has
been in the microwave for 5 minutes and
stick it on my raw skin and the burning
distracts me from the other pain that I
my stomach and I would rather that yeah
so this woman who were down here
visiting book I don't want to say too
much but obviously we're like in the
middle of making the documentary but she
uses lasers to treat chronic pain and
her daughter actually had what I have
which is incurable and she has been
pain-free for five years and I mean the
stories were so similar neuropathic pain
doesn't respond to opiates or
painkillers so there have been times
where I've been in the emergency room
for days of no sleep
 hallucinating because I'm so
tired and like just drained and crying
and they can pump morphine and
Demerol into my body and I will still
feel the pain and I was the biggest mind
 and like I get like angry even
thinking about it and I don't know why
but like the biggest mind I've ever
had in my life was being at the best
Hospital in the world with the best
neurosurgeon in the world screaming and
crying like begging them to knock me out
like I was like punch me in the
face
I don't care knock me out put me to
sleep I don't care and them telling me
we cannot do anything to help you there
is nothing we can give you that will
take away this pain and I was like if I
go to the police and I'm like this man
is murdering me and the police are like
we can't help you there's no one
else like that you can go to so I'm like
I'm at the one place in the world that's
supposed to be the place where you get
relief which is like those doctors and
them not being able to help me like I
just like my parents couldn't help me my
mom couldn't help me the guy who was
dating couldn't help me like yes it was
such a hopeless situation and it's scary
but like I genuinely went to a
dark place in my head and I was like is
this where people kill themselves like
is this where people are like this is
the brink of pain this is the edge I
have a reached it I don't know
and that was a year and a half ago that
that really bad attack happened after
that I just remember like we talked
about like we would try anything and its
really expensive I mean do you want to
talk about how much like oh yeah
money it costs well getting the surgery
in the first place I was in college my
parents helped me out I had to go to
Mayo Clinic in Minnesota which is
supposed to be the best doctor in the
hospital in the country yeah it I had to
go there to get diagnosed with
vulvodynia which is literally so easy to
diagnose all you do is take a q-tip yeah
to someone's vagina and if they have
excruciating pain then they probably
have vulvodynia and for some reason I
had to drive to Minnesota to do
that the bills were insane
insurance doesn't cover it insurance
doesn't see the endometriosis surgery as
you know necessary for life so it's just
like okay so it's not that's so
up it's just like and then you know
physical therapists aren't covered by
insurance so acupuncture isn't covered
by insurance
if I want to see a dietitian to like
fine food that I can eat it's not
covered by insurance like it's just it's
so much money and out-of-pocket
it's like pocket money that you weren't
good situations we both have very
blessed so I can't imagine I mean a
sickness yeah and we have access we're
in Los Angeles we have access to crazy
doctors yeah you don't get that in
Indiana I know because I was there yeah
we flew to Florida like yeah
yeah exactly it just you know it's
shocking altogether just to be like wait
really
it's that bad it's like and you know and
I believe you it's just sort of like wow
I can't imagine and then also like what
you guys were saying about with health
care and everything it imagine just some
like little girl in the middle of
nowhere who no one's listening to and no
one's taking seriously and she's crying
for help and then what do you do you
like if no one's listening and and you
feel fully hopeless like there are
plenty of other things you can turn to
that aren't helpful really and you know
pretty deadly drugs you could turn to
all of these other things like I just
feel like it's so important I'm just I'm
really proud that you guys are talking
about it because I feel like people need
to hear it and it's probably super
embarrassing because I feel like just
also as women in general we're sort of
not supposed to really it feels like
that we were kind of like raised to like
not really speak out about stuff that's
uncomfortable
my therapist one
something to me he was like Mapei in
therapy so this is what he does for a
living he was like if you're in pain why
wouldn't you want attention and I was
going well I don't want to come off as
like attention-seeking because look I'm
in the entertainment business for living
of course I love attention but I
wouldn't wish that on my worst
enemy I wouldn't wish this upon Isis
well maybe Isis Isis can have tried on
Kelsey but like he told me he was like
why wouldn't you want someone to help
you and I think it just comes back to a
it feels wrong to want to want help even
though I am here the same way someone
with like depression would feel like
embarrassed to want help even though
they're clearly hurting yeah yeah I
think also it might come from so many
doctors and I don't know if you had the
same experience but just constantly
making me feel like downplaying my pain
and making me feel bad for talking about
it to the point where like I question it
sometimes still 10 years later being
like oh maybe it's just I'm just being
dramatic when I'm like in bed and can
move and get out of bed I'm like oh I
could have gone to work today
no I couldn't no it affects every
 part of my life in our lives
like there is not a situation a minute
that goes by a thought goes by in my
head that this pain isn't attached to it
in some form shape or way yeah what was
it what was it like because I feel like
it's hard enough to it just getting your
period sucks you know what I mean like
what when it finally does happen you're
just like oh god so what was that like
Laura like growing unless you're tired
of talking about what was it like
growing up with that and like coming to
terms with being like oh this might
actually be worse than what's supposed
to be happening yeah for the longest
time I didn't have that thought I
honestly thought everyone must be going
through this and I am just weak as
for not being able to deal with it
because I would go see the doctors and
they would just be like yeah you're
having pain with your period duh and it
was just like insane I'm like I would go
to my friends and I'm like God like I'm
throwing up during class like during the
Pledge of Allegiance I have this vivid
memory of one and just puking in the
trashcan during the Pledge of Allegiance
I had my period
that day and like my mom had to leave
her job and like come get me at school
because of my period like it took me a
really long time and then when I got to
college it started getting really bad
and I started to realize this isn't
going away and that's when I just fell
into a very very dark depression that
sometimes I still fall into it's taken
me years to kind of be like okay this is
my life and it sucks but like it's my
life it's the one I have like I just got
it you know find a way yeah it's not
like we're here being like we've found a
way to cope with our pain and we're hat
like we're not in reach that there's
like there are definitely people I mean
this this woman that we're seeing her
daughter is pain-free like there
definitely is hope and I think that's
what keeps us like watching him up at
this point yeah we're not gonna give up
we mentioned that Pat is actually
running sound for Cait right now who is
your boyfriend yes and you guys have
been together a while and you've written
a lot about you guys's relationship just
especially like when your illness has
it's so intimate it's your
vagina you're already as a society
taught not to talk about that but god
forbid
oh that's wait could I do a side note
here okay I was just doing there's a
video coming out about the history of
the vagina right and they just fully
just for the longest time people
wouldn't recognize the vagina like they
wouldn't draw it like the clitoris is
not like in some sex ed books women were
considered to not have sexual feelings
towards people people like in the
Victorian era which is hilarious
because then they were prescribed
 vibrators for their hysteria
like it's bad enough like people don't
even recognize your vagina but then when
you're like oh I'm also in pain yeah
yeah like my vagina that you will only
recognize if it gives you pleasure yeah
is in pain so if you're not gonna
recognize it to begin with you're
definitely not gonna recognize it if
it's not something that you could write
you've talked a lot about your
relationship yeah and you've been
together almost three years now can you
just like talk about what the that
was like like finding some
that is as great like don't want to cry
but it really it took me a really long
time to believe like he makes me believe
everyday that like I am worth loving in
it I hate I hate that it has to come
from him but it got to a certain point
that like as much as I would tell myself
it doesn't matter like if you know you
you have to know your Worth and like
everybody has baggage like I didn't
believe it until he started telling me
oh my god you're gonna cry I
know I'm sorry I'm literally make me cry
it's a very awkward well we talked about
just like last night having someone
validate not just that but like just
tell you you're normal despite it yeah
you know that you are other you're more
than your pain your pain being able to
see both of you and still love it it's
like cuz it's hard for us to love
ourselves sometimes so having someone
there who's like giving me unconditional
love when I am like in the worst mood or
like not getting up off the couch like
it means more than I wish it did but it
means so much but why what like why
would you have that's a great thing to
have does all anybody wants I think that
it's really cool to be like yeah I could
do that for myself but humans aren't
supposed to you know exist and thrive in
an isolated environment of course that
feels yeah give yourself a break what I
love that you brought up last night was
like I've never really been in like a
long relationship with trigeminal
neuralgia it's just it's new territory
for me that I don't even know like when
do I tell them about it how do I tell
them about it what do I do if I get in a
situation where I have an attack like
that's the most embarrassing
thing ever and you were talking last
night about like when you and Pat first
started talking and he just like
wouldn't stop asking you questions but
not in a way that's like wait what your
verdict he was really concerned about my
well-being which was new for me like I
had a horrible experiences dating it's
not easy to date when your vagina
doesn't work like yeah obviously that's
a huge barrier but it got to the point
where with him I was just like very
upfront and honest about everything and
I was unapologetic at that point I was
like whatever this is it's not going
away like you either deal with it or you
don't like
you tired to care and he just was like
yeah it sucks that you have that but
like obviously it's not your fault like
what are we gonna do and it doesn't
affect like who you are is right and
like you know there are many ways to be
sexual and it's like Jesus I mean the
number one question I'm sure you get
asked is like well how do you yeah
it's so Nvidia right like the fact that
they just want to ask and they want you
to explain to them rather like Google if
it do you have fingers and a phone
listen I don't even have sex and I know
that there's more than one way that's
what does it what define sex right if
all it was was just penis and vagina
then that one time I did it makes me
feel like I never need to do it again so
the last two male listeners that we had
yeah can you talk about like how you
filled that question when it's asked
yeah like how do you respond
when people feel like they even deserve
that answer it should really depends on
who's I can totally come from a place of
like just genuinely a you know the same
way that you can like feel the gay
questions when people ask me gay
I'm like okay dude are you a
perv or you actually yeah yeah yeah if
it's a woman who's suffering with
similar conditions of course I'm gonna
be like you know not ever going into the
detail detail since I like to keep that
to myself but just you know that it is
very possible and I have a very
fulfilled sex life with or with that
thank you there without finishing this
looks like if it's someone like that if
it's someone else that's just like I if
it's on like in serum I'm just
immediately blog yeah yeah it's
hard in our salon and be like what's
wrong with you like see Jesus like and
in a weird way we talked about this
yesterday at the doctor's office like
the doctor was talking about how like
pain in a weird way can be a gift and
like we both rolled our eyes like
obviously as some kid in a jerk reaction
but like I do think like by having this
pain I have been forced to talk about it
therefore connecting other people
therefore establishing community ball of
law and for you I was like I'm a little
envious
because you you have been forced to
examine sex in a way that no one
gets to it like you have to be so
communicative with your partner and you
have to know your body and like in a
weird way yeah that is a gift I mean it
was like a good system for dating and it
gets all the bad guys out I mean because
if you know long-term like if they can't
even deal with it a month and it's like
what is the point of even continuing it
so mm-hmm in a sad way like you know
going through the dating I was like cool
I'm unlovable this sucks but then when
you find someone who's truly
understanding it's like all those other
guys cuz it's really like everyone has
baggage it's not like bigger or worse
like yeah my vagina doesn't work let's
move on like I just like I don't think
you guys realize like I hope anyone that
has chronic pain or is dating or in a
relationship like go read her stuff
because you talking about being
unlovable because you blame yourself
like we do that as women just without
you know what just inherit us people
yeah yeah and we anything that's like
not pretty yeah and and having and
knowing that it's possible to be in a
relationship with chronic pain and to
like be loved I think is you know
something we desperately need to hear
yeah for people that have chronic pain
also Kate we talked about last night
just like how we could relate this
podcast to more people because we both
have like such specific or a
chronic pains but just the idea that
like we sometimes feel like prisoners in
our own body and it's already hard to
love your body when it's working at full
capacity let alone when something is
lack of a better term broken
yeah I also just feel like we're all
part of a system that's kind of broken
and it you know we make money off of
people feeling bad so I think that it's
sort of like even if you if the the pain
like the physical pain isn't there for
some people there's probably a ton of
emotional pain that's there and it's
specifically for anyone who doesn't
necessarily
feels other din anyway I think that the
that there's a shame that comes along
with speaking out about anything that's
going on or like validating the feelings
or like even validating um like
emotional pain like I know it bothers me
when I would say to people like I'm sure
as it bothers you for someone to be like
yeah I have pretty bad cramp and you
like but then for like when you have
like depression or something like that
or for me with like an eating disorder
when people will be like oh god yeah I
eat my feelings sometimes too it's like
yeah but that are like told me I've been
sad before so it's but then you also
don't want it like let go of your
feelings are like over what's the word
yeah so I just feel like hopefully from
all of this people will just just be a
little like kinder to yourself and
listen to other people and and if
someone is doing something for attention
say someone really is say someone really
doesn't have yeah pain or whatever
they're talking about the fact that
they're speaking out for attention means
they're in some mortis pain yeah yeah
might be sort of people like
where's the empathy in this war right
why do we get so mad at people who are
who are asking to be helped I don't
 know Kate I don't know I've been
through this micro selfish budget every
day but yeah I think it just comes back
to like everyone has a relationship with
their body everything fluctuates there
are days when you feel really good there
can be more days that you feel shitty
but at the end of the day unless you get
robotic arms this is the one body or
given and do the best you can with it
and love yourself the best way you can
whatever the that means no matter
what stress yourself trust yourself
addressed each other and just try to be
a little bit nicer yeah Laura where can
