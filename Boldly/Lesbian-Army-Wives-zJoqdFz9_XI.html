the United States Army this is my lovely
wife so this would be me getting ready
for work our dog tags and our ID tags
are actually quite very beautiful we
actually met on Twitter the wonderful
world of Twitter back in to maybe
license 2000 the toil 12 we always argue
about who followed who first
I followed her first no I followed her
because I thought she was really pretty
I was different a lot of times that came
to visit her and I would have to stay in
the barracks you know come out incognito
yeah you know I would always think like
you know if something were to happen to
her I'd be the last person so now I know
that was really hard
yeah it was tough that was really hard
people before me before I joined like I
don't know how they did it
yeah
DOMA was revoked meaning we were able to
get married
military recognized it and now wherever
I go she can go with me and she gets
yeah pretty much the same you know this
equal equal people and that finally I
finally she actually got to get all the
benefits as like a heterosexual couple I
think we just got lucky you got lucky
because we actually have a two-bedroom
two-and-a-half-bath
house so then it's just her night so
this is US Army this over the left side
which is over the heart which is like
the heart you know the United States and
then we have our last name then we have
like our rank in the middle which I'm a
specialist and this is my unit patch
11th ACR honestly I feel like any other
couple like I feel like we came alone
wait yeah like this you know like the
the world it's good to be to be equal
yeah being able to be part of the
military family freely and openly and
feeling accepted I'm very happy with
that as a civilian as a military wife I
feel like you know they're taking me
serious you know they're really counting
me in I think allowing you know gays and
lesbians to express what they are freely
yeah I think of anything makes them want
to give it their all so now we wear the
painted rocks various order with all of
the units who come to join here they
leave their unit patch they come and
paint it when they're done kind of like
a hey I was here this is like all the
units who have been here to Train and a
lot of
reenlist they actually come and do their
ceremony here I'll probably do my new
when I read this see I feel proud
putting on this uniform every day to uh
I don't know this is good because I feel
like I'm doing something bigger than
myself you know
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
