with and the mood that were in at the
time a fairly big part sometimes I
wouldn't say that I need them to have a
good time but they're fun yeah I've done
that a few times I'm actually a gold
star when you've never been with the
opposite sex I did not really enjoy it
at all and then I slept with the woman
and I was like oh
I guess you kind of know where things
are generally but also everyone is
different I didn't feel like I was
better or more knowledgeable because I
have similar parts to the woman I was
sleeping with at the time and also there
are trans women out there who might
physically be different I think there's
always a little bit of fear just because
you want to make sure she's being
pleased they just do not think of me
they're just sort of like looking at an
elbow no I feel like I know enough about
penises I'm happy with a detachable one
no I don't think there is a enough
representation of climate women in the
media well good representation there's
also not enough Asian women Arab women
Aboriginal women I feel like when
there's a TV show or a movie and you see
like two girls who are dating there's
always a problem like one of them is
hasn't come out to their family or like
one of them is struggling with their
identity why can't we just have like a
happy like two girls who are dating and
everything is fine when you've got two
girls that are kind of falling in love
on-screen you feel it as well and you
get really excited and get the
butterflies
I've been called all sorts of things
well I have been called a doc before and
that happened when I had short hair and
I was on a train sir you're in the wrong
toilet probably the worst thing to ever
happen was when I was walking in the
city once with my girlfriend and we got
spat on by a man who said that he was
going to kill us and that we were gay
and he actually chased us down the
street for quite a few blocks so that
was terrifying I knew that I was gay I
knew that I was into women I think
before I even knew anything else
concrete about myself before I even knew
sort of that Myers were blue or green my
hair was black and when you know we'd be
getting told fairy tales and the prince
and the princess end up together I'd
always be asking but where's my princess
where's my princess being gay was always
just a part of me I had the biggest
crush on my preschool teacher I used to
like calculate my gayness and I'd be
like well maybe I'm you know 40% gay and
60% straight and then it eventually just
kept climbing up like pretty sure I'm
75% gay now guy was gay in the womb I
was I was sowing a rainbow flag together
in Mom's belly
ah there are so many parts that I love I
mean I love the whole thing but I could
literally write an essay about all the
things I love about being gay I honestly
feel really lucky every day yeah well I
mean there's there's so much but you
know we don't have much time do we I
don't feel like I would be the person I
am without having gone through all the
hard yards of being both a woman and a
gay woman that I'm just so happy being
myself being with a woman and being able
to connect on that level on a much
deeper level
I mean boobs are great as well they're
really cool there are definitely times
in my life where I didn't feel so lucky
and I kind of wish that I blended in but
um I'm past that now just keep you be
with whoever you want to be with you
smoochie ever you want to be with that's
the whole idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
