guns in America I just think that we
should have stricter rules on guns there
should definitely be harsher gun control
definitely maybe the right to bear arms
was something that was necessary at the
time it does is just an antiquated think
there's a national embarrassment and how
many people are killed by gun violence
but I want to shoot one I never shot a
gun before so I just have no idea what
its gonna be like I'm really excited
about it I'm also pretty nervous all
right so first of all let's talk about
the name of the metre beretta pretty
easy to use it's like the feeling that
you get when you're about to go on a
roller coaster I thought this is just
gonna be fun and I hate feeling deeply
deeply
there well you're gonna need your body
for it except okay Gerty hold it against
now get ready to shoot Oh notice 3d
hundred pop beep alright alright so you
hit the hangar right no not what you
want you you don't realize that in real
life when you shoot a gun just firing
once let's took a lot out of me I was
like I fired once and then I wanted to
take a nap go ahead
alright take the time take the Titan
will turn around there's another one in
there yes my hands are sweating I don't
know if you can see that oh my god I
can't my heart is like racing so fast
right now
you can feel it throughout your whole
body and I'm not as scared as I was but
I'm scared to talk guys definitely never
my whole life that I think I would shoot
a shotgun
I felt kind of bad what is it cocking
gun shotgun yeah that feels yeah it's a
badass gesture right there what
oh my god I don't think I could do that
oh sorry
smells like like firecrackers or
something
gunpowder my teeth are like
I'm okay I don't wanna do it anymore it
was kind of enjoyable but then I was
getting sickened at me feeling enjoyable
about it shooting a gun and this gun
range did not change my positions on gun
control I think if all guns were in this
controlled environment at La gun clubs
that would be fine
but that is not the real world even if
it's a code this is a fun thing but like
not every fun thing is legal I mean it's
a rush it's an adrenaline rush and even
though it's up and I feel
confused and conflicted about it all I
would probably come back and do it again
alright so first of all 870 shotgun very
popular basically you have to take the
good shotguns to see if it's loaded
you're gonna press this lever right here
press this and then of these just a pump
right there so you want pretty regularly
potable name forward
you're gonna shoot oh shoot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
