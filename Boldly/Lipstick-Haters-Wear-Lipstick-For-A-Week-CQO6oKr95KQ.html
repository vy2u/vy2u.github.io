or chapstick I never wear lipstick and
I'm going to wear lipstick for a week
I don't wear lipstick because whenever I
do I look like a serial killing clown
like I'm gonna snatch your kids off the
street I feel like when my face is at
rest I have a very small mouth
I feel like lipstick would make it look
smaller than it already is
I don't know it somehow got into my
brain that if I'm wearing a big bold lip
and trying to make a really strong
serious point maybe people won't take
that seriously which is so
maybe I'm totally wrong
I do wear makeup I tend to go heavier
with the eye makeup because I monolids
wearing lipstick in addition to that
seems a little much for me when I agreed
to do this I sort of imagined I'd be
wearing it in my apartment now I'm like
oh I have to wear this outside like in
public that's the point of new lipstick
quest look ghostly probably highlight my
moustache hairs
I already feel all the moisture just
like being sucked out I feel like this
makeup kind of highlights the huge flaw
with nudes like one nude color for
someone else is like the opposite skin
tone for someone
I don't feel cool yet this will be great
grade week someone just came up to me
and told me that I look so kylie which I
can guarantee has never ever happened to
me before in my entire life
it doesn't seem like you
yeah I felt so self-conscious the entire
day and I still feel self-conscious
I even have lips I just walked into the
bathroom and literally scared myself
because I forgot I was wearing this I
was like oh nope just my face
one of my co-workers told me that I
looked dead today so that happened well
that wasn't what I was expecting at all
this is pretty cute it gets weird to
even think of this lipstick because it's
super subtle I just think that these
lipstick colors weren't designed with my
skin tone in mind and I feel like that's
probably why I don't wear very many
lipsticks it looks pretty normal
looks cute you not like it I mean yeah
what's browny this is not as bad as
yesterday yeah yesterday was like this
really not that bad no one has
distracted themselves like yesterday
talking to me because I'm wearing it
still feel subtle and pretty I'm really
excited about today's lipstick because
it's red and I'm hoping that unlike the
other ones the red won't like my lips
look as ash it's not red it's like fawn
orange coral and if you like it look
like a clown I think red can be very
feminine but also pretty powerful and
I've never worn red lipstick before and
thought that I could pull it off but
today started changing my mind on that
I'm not gonna lie I think the lipstick
you may be growing on me a little bit
and feeling myself look so beautiful
oh I just met a cute guy we just made
plans to hang out on Saturday which
sounded great until I left and realized
that Saturday is black lipstick day
it's been 20 minutes since I put it on
it's definitely getting on my teeth
before the end of this hour I'm kind of
been looking forward to this purple so
here goes also I think I've discovered
my lip line it only took four days oh it
definitely is on my teeth hmm good oh
you have something on your chin and like
your lower lip and it's actually the
entire bottom half of your face you look
great wearing this lipstick makes me if
I'm more exciting human I already am so
today's the day that I've been dreading
the most it is black lipstick day it
happened it is by far my favorite it's a
ten looking at myself I'm like wow you
look stunning
I still don't love it also the lipstick
is really sick II kind of dry I will say
that my lips have never looked bigger
and my teeth have never looked whiter
Logan what happened when the girls just
passed by me on the street they were
brave Carly I am making the executive
decision to not wear it on the date that
I have tonight I just feel like if I
wear the black lipstick on the date I'm
going to end up more distracted by the
lipstick then I am going to be able to
focus on the conversation or just having
a good time
I didn't expect to fall in love with any
of the makeup I expected to just sort of
deal with it like put the lipstick on
and it'll be okay but I'm finding on the
last day that I actually kind of love it
I wore lipstick for one week and the
results were weirdly eye opening what I
think I learned this week was that him
very self-conscious I was absolutely
shocked by how good I looked and how
much I fell in love with it going out
weekend's fun social life I definitely
am going to be experimenting with more
lipstick but for work I think if
anything I went more into myself I do
not want to wear lipstick to work and
sort of in my professional day-to-day I
think the brown metallic one was my
favorite because it looked pretty
natural on me I think I have a new
appreciation
for that ring I think after this week I
would encourage other women and honestly
encourage myself to experiment more with
this stuff I think for me it reminded me
of little parts of myself that I had an
excess in a really long time I think
this challenge taught me to revisit any
insecurities I have because as I've aged
I've been like okay like I love my lips
I love my ass whatever whenever but I
still don't wear lipstick
I still don't wear jeans and only wear
Empire waisted dresses so I thought I
couldn't wear lipstick turns out not
only can I can but I look damn good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
