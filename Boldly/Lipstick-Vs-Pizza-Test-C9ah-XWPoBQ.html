long-lasting lipstick stand up to your
favorite pizza oh we're about to find
out and we're also gonna eat lunch yeah
star Chris I love lipstick I
love keep that but I don't like lipstick
on ISA it makes me wanna pee I feel like
every matte lipstick comes off when you
leave bring in the pizza bring in the
lipstick let's go it feels like nothing
is on my lips because it's that dry I
guess that's good because like pizzas
wet
alright pizza I'm gonna get real lippy
with the next bite no transfer oh oh oh
oh that little big feet on there it
looks like mold there's a full ring of
my mouth he's a great lipstick great
Macarena great let me see this hasn't
budged wow I would give this a 4 for me
it's almost perfect it's just this
bleeding down here it looks like I
didn't really eat you guys think I'd
give this like a 4.5 just because I
don't believe in perfection it is a
little dry but I think that's what helps
against greasy food
look at me I look like someone's Andy
this is like cemented on okay well I
personally like this one better than the
two face already
alright slice - here we go my lips look
glossy but it's from the beef look at it
I did not come for this I think overall
I would give this a 2 because it
obviously came off around like the
inside of my lips I was gonna give it a
3.5 transfer onto the pizza with almost
nothing for me which is wild
nothing came off that's insane so far
this one smells the bath oh this is not
Mela good on me to be an American yours
this solar bright it looks amazing
alien and I look like I'm a corpse we're
on our third slice No so this is my gray
lip on my feet
that's a purple pizza so I'm gonna rate
mix a - because it's bleeding a little
bit
it transferred a lot on to my pizza but
this is always a good place to start off
with weird color I would give the NYX
liquid suede a 3d when I looked on my
pits I literally had the most transfer
of any it actually looks great oh this
feels like butter
if Brown makes he looks like an antique
where's pick me feel looks like my uncle
who was a drag queen she hates this
color so much she can't get past and
actually for this experiment to test
nothing
what how that happened what I'm doing I
didn't even bite by now
all right maybe greasy food is not up to
see the standards we're gonna give it a
three it's very pigmented it feels great
on your lips but it came off on my pizza
I would give Stila three out of five
it's out all over the pizza and it
started bleeding in the sides of my
mouth it's like the lights on this was
the most moisturizing so far it's so
sticky I'm like afraid that the cheese
will get stuck to my mouth here we go
number five I have no transfer I mean
nothing's coming off well I'm not sure
if anything that's on am I even wearing
anything right now
Oh maybe that's the trick I am going to
give Revlon a - this isn't a liquid
lipstick it's more like a state I would
give the Revlon Colorstay ultimate
liquid lipstick a two out of five I
wouldn't suggest going for a sticky
mouth situation before you're about to
eat
oh yeah I look crazy this lipstick is
very smooth yours is bright as well wait
yours looks like something that you
would wear it's the last slice you can
see the pink on it this is like the end
of the marathon I give makeup revolution
London lipstick a one out of five this
one came off the easiest all over the
pizza I give this someone based on the
fact that it just didn't stay as long
you can definitely see like the inside
are a bonus right
since our highest-rated lipstick was the
melted Mac from Too Faced we're taking
it to the next level and we're gonna eat
some chicken Wayne oh look at this
transfer chicken wings are one of the
hardest and that's these things eat but
if you looked at my face this looks like
I ate something no you look fresh
as hell what do you think I think you
could tell yeah you can tell in the
middle there knowing how well this
two-faced lipstick lasts I would
definitely come back to this Brandon I
think I probably will
I would absolutely willing to give this
a shot I love it can hold up against
pizza but she can not sit you know what
I eat more pizza than I do chicken wings
anyway so two-faced I'm with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
