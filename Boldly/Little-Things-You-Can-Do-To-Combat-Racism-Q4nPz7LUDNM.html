receive is oh you're not like most black
people a lot of times people will be
like oh she's really pretty for an Asian
or you're really pretty for an Asian the
entire background of that statement is
extremely racist because it insinuates
that I do not think Asian people are
good-looking in general people tend to
want to shy away from talking about race
but it's actually healthy if we do even
if we disagree I feel like so much about
race is is just the perspective of
putting yourself in the other person's
shoes so if you decide to start a
sentence with I don't mean to be racist
or I'm not racist but don't ever do that
because you will look racist and you
will sound racist anytime you have to
qualify a statement with the explanation
of why it's not something it probably is
that something
I have before told my friends like hey
it makes me like kind of uncomfortable
when you say things like this and if
they're really your friends like they're
gonna take that into consideration it's
definitely more visible online and it's
more in-your-face because people are
able to hide behind a username on this
YouTube video there will be terrible
comments and I grow comments that you
either downvote them or you say
something like that's not cool you can
either ask if something offended
somebody or you can tell somebody that
some something that they said offended
you it would be great if everyone had
had the balls to go up to someone to say
hey you know I bet Kanna was like
uncalled for that was really offensive
we can't not talk about race that's the
worst thing that we could do being color
blind isn't gonna help anybody don't
treat it like it's something as sacred
just talk about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
