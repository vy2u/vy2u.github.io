heating pad also known as my best friend
I don't feel like getting out of bed I
don't see myself getting out of bed
anytime soon it's hard to stay positive
and it's hard to not be mad at my body
or at this situation when this is how I
feel you know my name is Laura and I
have endometriosis
I was first diagnosed with endometriosis
in the summer of 2012 when I was a
senior in college I have one distinct
memory of when I was on the basketball
team in high school and I was at
practice and I had such bad cramps and I
literally could not do anything I was
just laying there I was vomiting I was
sweating nothing helped so I went to
Urgent Care and they just told me I had
bad periods and that's basically what I
was told
up until I was 21 years old at many
points in my life I convinced myself
that maybe I was imagining that maybe I
was just crazy maybe everyone felt this
way on their period but there's a
certain kind of pain that comes with
endometriosis and it's not just around
the time of year period it's a pain that
lingers always and at some point in your
life you realize that it's not normal I
came home from work today I losted about
an hour before the pain was just
overwhelming I was nauseous I went into
the bathroom and I vomited because I had
such terrible cramps and working from
home which is something that I have to
do at least once a month sometimes more
often my job is to sit at a desk and
write and sometimes I can't even do that
when you have a flu you go to the doctor
and they give you medicine and you get
over it when you have endometriosis you
go to the doctor you have a surgery and
then it comes back a year later
realizing that this was something that I
was going to have to deal with the rest
of my life just I saw all my
relationships in the future just flashed
before my eyes it's very hard to date
and explain to someone hey I might not
be able to have sex with you and I also
might not be able to have your children
but what's day anyway I was letting
people treat me like dirt because I felt
like I had to make up for the fact that
I was broken today's one of those days
where I'm like I can do this like I can
absolutely live with this like I'm fine
and I just hope this lasts I have good
days and bad days usually more bad days
than good days but maybe this week will
be more good days than bad days I'm
tired of feeling like less than a woman
because I may not be able to have sex
and I may not be able to conceive
children I know that someday I'm going
to look in the mirror and I'm going to
forgive my body for what it has done to
me and I know that I'm going to look in
the mirror and love the person looking
back at me and accept every part of me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
