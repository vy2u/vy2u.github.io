- Hey Quinta.
- Hey Jordan, what's up?
- Can I get those
earrings I let you borrow
last week, I need them for dinner tonight.
- Yeah, for sure.
- Cool, great.
(Flight of the Bumblebee)
(pillows falling)
(scrambling)
(thumps)
- Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
Where the heck is the stupid...
- Hey, you get the earrings yet?
- Uh...
(whipped cream sprays)
- I'll get 'em later.
- I have whipped cream mouth.
(Flight of the Bumblebee)
Ah, where is it? Where is it?
(Flight of the Bumblebee)
Uh! Pitz, you're no help!
(slap)
Hey Brian, have you
seen these earrings? No?
You haven't seen them?
- Hey Quinta.
- Hey girl. (laughs)
Small triangle earrings.
Oh no, no, no, no.
No!
(Gasps) These are the earrings.
Okay, buy now, rush delivery.
- [Voiceover] Package for Quinta.
(whoosh)
- [Quinta] Thank you.
- It's good?
- It's okay.
- Jordan.
- Hello.
- I got your earrings.
- Thank you.
- Yep, and I'm a good friend.
- Oh wait, these don't have the
same nick my grandmother got on
them during the war.
(Flight of the Bumblebee)
- [Quinta] Move.
