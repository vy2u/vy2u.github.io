hi I'm Ryan and I'm lumbersexual
lumbersexual means guys just like to you
know fantasize that they're a lumberjack
in their mind being a limber sexual is
definitely about the aesthetic burly
rugged winds flannel grows a nice chic
sweater I didn't choose the beard gear
chose me I've used a chainsaw once I've
never used a chainsaw I've always had
that fear that like I'm gonna like drop
the chains on like chop off my arm or
something I think there's like a
definitely elevated masculinity you know
to use chainsaw I try to be a
professional man I'm teens like Casey
and this is the chainsaw academy
name is Kaycee makan some people know me
as chainsaw Casey being a lumbersexual
it's about living life I'm afraid to
just jump right in and get it done when
I saw these guys for the first time I
thought oh nice I really like that
lumbersexual look yeah
this powerful you feel the power great
so exciting it was like I was up there
on stage revving that guitar like here
surprising how articulate you can be
actually with the chainsaw I found out
that it was more lumbersexual than I was
originally I think I learned that lumber
sexuality knows no gender we're taught
to be men by a woman and that was great
I like that glorious victorious kind of
feeling and you do something incredible
that nobody thought you could do feels
good it's worth it you know
are you laughing the best time of my
life
we
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
