a little thing thing but I hope it's not
like damn girls beat your face hi I'm
Quinn sue Brunson and I hate makeup but
I love Rihanna so today I'm trying fin T
beauty products to see if they can
change my mind about makeup I'm a big
fan of Rihanna because she seems to just
always do what she wants she just seems
hey just chilling pad ass and I love it
so much I'm not the biggest makeup fan I
don't wear a lot at the most I wear
eyeliner I'll wear a little bit of
eyebrow enhancement tint because my
eyebrows are a little light but besides
that I'm not really a fan of foundation
I've never really had a good
relationship with the beading my face in
the morning it's just time I'd rather
spend doing something else but I think
more than anything I just don't know how
to do it as we all know hard for women
of color to find foundations that match
their skin tone fizzy has all inclusive
makeup they have 40 different shades
lighter shades to darker shades shades
for every shade of shade fenty sorry I'm
pretty sure I can find my shade in that
mix somewhere I know I can because I
tried to do it it was easy so I did not
trust myself to beat my face I think we
have examples in the past of what it
looks like when I beat my face I did the
best I could
what I was getting myself back and say
that you know Clinton did it's not a
good experience so I haven't listed one
of the many people here at BuzzFeed
who's really good at doing makeup nina
nina is gonna come down and beat my face
for me
Nina just gave me a beat face Becky that
might not be the right term but that's
what I call it so I'm about to go about
my dad I'm gonna have a lunch I'm gonna
have a meeting I'm gonna get this paper
so I'm gonna do it all with this makeup
line I'm not gonna go out tonight
so Charlotte what do you think about my
makeup today it's fresh that's crazy
so I'm really excited so far everyone
has liked it a lot
it hasn't been alarming to people but
they've given a little compliment right
wow that looks nice okay so I'm wearing
foundation I'm wearing a cool face that
foundation yeah it's a full face of
foundation that's my favorite part about
it she has all these ranges of shades
and I was actually able to find the
shade that works for nothing girl it
doesn't even look like they're wearing a
foundation thank you well it doesn't
look like you're right foundation your
face is not cakey and that highlight is
what do you think good mom you look so
glowy yeah natural actually think it's
kind like a glossy
people of color people come yeah that's
exactly what it feels literally your
skin look effervescent like the glow
that it's like cutted office so she NAND
so natural that I love it so much like
you could see your natural pigmentation
but you can also see how everything's
kind of just like all balanced out
together wherever light for the lot I
think that is really natural and subtle
it's kind of nice to feel like I'll be
able to be in their support and get
everything for that line but that's
where I had trouble so I'm happy that I
can use everything Finch heat all the
time everything so it's a six o'clock
and I've came to talk to Tristan and he
just said I love it do you know who it's
by bindi oh did you see when I saw the
tweet what do you think it actually
looks it looks good so it is the
nighttime and I'm gonna balcony so I
like what became of it the highlights so
there I'm really I really enjoyed
wearing thin tea I'm not a makeup
goddess or makeup guru but it felt like
I wasn't wearing too much makeup which
is all I've ever wanted final rundown I
would use this lip gloss every single
day I have it on right now it feels good
it looks good and it does its job but
when I do need to wear foundation and I
need it to look good I'm probably just
gonna put this on I'm not sure I love
makeup but I do like finchy beauty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
