what I want to do when I grow up

more exciting version yeah or uh this
could also become that more exciting
version I mean this office is actually
pretty exciting if you think about it
sometimes I asked for 10 copies on the
machine only nine come out right
was it at paper yeah usually oh okay
well what I mean is like my regular life
is so exhilarating that I need my work
life to be predictable so that's why I
work here that's I get that actually
like probably same exact thing with me
you know being an intern pretty crazy as
hell I mean what a whirlwind of a
weekend I had what'd you do okay so a
few weeks ago I thought my cat was eaten
by my neighbor's cat because it coughed
up a full animal skeleton it's naturally
I was devastated sure but it turns out
that it was just a raccoon skeleton mr.
Harris was safe and sound eating my
popcorn remanence under my bed I am
loved I always say that you're only your
true self when you're eating pop yes
thank you you're sharing an it's getting
everywhere down your shirt down your
pants care it's the best yeah oh I guess
when it comes down to is I live with
three people I don't really know they're
awful i binge watch a lot of TV that
rules and no the rest of time in
furniture sit man we're eating peanut
butter out of the jar but it's cool
because we don't share food it's only
been two weeks you should get a cat
they're much better roommates
