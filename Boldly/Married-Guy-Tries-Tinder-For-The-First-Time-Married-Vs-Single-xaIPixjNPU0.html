dehumanizes the dating experience a
thousand percent I'm like so picky and
so passive now if I don't like someone
I'm like well there's just 9,000 more
ways to choose from and anything to is
like it makes me bad at dating IRL

up to someone and talk to them because
I'm like too nervous I'm like why would
I do that I can do this on my phone it
gamma Phi's it like you do it on the
toilet

program yes Nega there's not the
opposite of the point of tinder you know
I'm taking it back to like a class of
and I'm just gonna be going based on
your right
okay so you think they look good or you
think I would be a good match man then
you have to read their profile okay but

to profiles is you want to show your
personality you still want to leave a
little bit of mystery and you also want
to be funny what are some things that
