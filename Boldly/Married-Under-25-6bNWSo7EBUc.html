but if I shave I'm gonna look
prepubescent that we're gonna wear
hey yes hey we look 16
well look at least 20 ish good a lot
less skeezy being married to a 20-ish
happy Anniversary University Oh
little kiss you you made a vow okay
game plan I will be starting with the
open-faced duck machaca ravioli and I'm
starting with the baby ahi tuna with a
cherry tomato brulee we talked about
this you will be starting with a chicken
fried sweetbreads with finger lime aioli
I can't do it I can't eat intestines
it's the signature dish at D'Ambrosio
I'm afraid why can't you order it
because I know how much you'll love it
the guy is amazing he had this hit
restaurant in New Orleans but he said
the Jazz was too distracting to his
craft
do you think they're staring because
we're both wearing Tom's what no oh
these are fancy Tom's can I help you yes
we have a reservation under Michael
rumberger I'm sorry Michael rumberger
like the booze in the sandwich I'm sorry
sir I don't see reservation under that
name really because I know I made a
reservation do you remember he spoke
with I don't but it was six and a half
weeks ago perhaps you made the
reservation for another night but
tonight's our one-year wedding
anniversary so give me a minute
don't worry
worst case scenario we'll grab a drink
at the bar if we have to wait for a
table she basically called you a liar
let's get you a Prosecco popsicle I bet
we're in the book flip stop stop stop
right this way
see there is no conspiracy about keeping
us out of the restaurant you do realize
they just er this table together right
it doesn't matter because we are about
to dine like kings you still have to
order the sweetbreads damn it gonna love
it
welcome to d ambrosio s-- my name is
Arthur I'll be your server this evening
may bring you any sparkling water or
still tap he hates us nobody here hates
us except maybe that couple that has
something against Tom's besides we are
about to make that guy's night by
ordering one of everything on the menu
quail egg shooters okay two of
everything but he doesn't know you're a
foodie he doesn't know we're not just
two broke kids who are going to sit here
all night playing with the sugar packets
when he's already in the weeds and
really needs to focus on his party of 10
because hello automatic gratuity it
isn't the summer of 2011 anymore you
never have to work at Bennigan's again
and yet I still have nightmares or they
have over sat my section and I can't
refill everyone's waters Basinger all
you have to worry about is eating so
much rich food the idea of having sex
later makes you physically sick oh I
will rally enjoy your meal
because we won't be able to afford to
eat like this until our next anniversary
excellent choice
thank you messy your IDs please
I guess
it was before I had the beard yeah thank
you I'll be back with your wine
you can't disagree with me anytime you
will reboot a franchisor I'm sorry we
ordered the 2008 Sevilla Nebbiolo yes we
ordered the Nebbiolo this is the cafe on
a barrel so this is an excellent bottle
of one oh yeah for sure you guys just
poached bon mot Somali a last week and
that guy knows his grapes there's no yes
and the Barolo and the Nebbiolo are from
the same varietal sapota Lee totally
absolutely
but the Barolo is so massive and tannic
and rich that it might weigh overwhelm
the roasted bone marrow flan which we
ordered and have been waiting for for
months okay he maybe hates us a little
you think you can smell every single
different ingredient how cool thank you
so are you still afraid of those
intestines
maybe okay I'm just gonna try outline
sweetbreads are all I want to eat for
the rest of my life don't antagonize the
unhappy couple they look like they're
about six months away from divorce she
be complaining about the hooligans at
their favorite restaurant is bringing
them closer together we are saving their
marriage where the doctor fill up this
restaurant I wish I could take my belt
off if this belt was removable I would
be taking it off we'll take this when
you're ready he didn't even ask us about
dessert
that's okay I'm pretty sure public
vomiting just frowned upon and ambrosia
no you wanted salted caramel ice cream
pearls Hey look at me happy one-year
anniversary happy one-year anniversary
how about you but I love how your rage
is always bubbling just below are you
 kidding me
he charged us for the first bottle of
wine and for a dessert we never even
ordered don't worry I'm gonna keep it
together we will figure this out dignity
and grace like adults
 that go get him I'm sorry deny
didn't go as planned
are you kidding me that was so much fun
did you see his face I made him cry yeah

just so much stuff okay you can be a
little proud of that the best
anniversary ever
