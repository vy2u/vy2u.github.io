the futon what's wrong with the futon
really rickety and lumpy well if you
know where the lumps are you can work
around them the cover is gross can you
cover besides we're saving up for
Sasquatch fest
I guess one it's Friday

something with British people

your spirits people otherwise why are
you awake why is anyone awake it's the
worst how do you feel about a road trip
right now mm-hmm
let's get you some pants where are we
road tripping to a lead on the
rolls-royce of used couches it's gonna
class up our whole apartment Oh Oh what
I just thought we were doing something
fun this could be fun sighs I just want
to get something comfortable for you to
pass out on after a beer and a half it
was two whole beers what are we gonna do
with a futon oh no move it toward the
dumpster and hope it doesn't become a
love nest for that pack of feral
polyamorous casts we're just throwing it
away Katie you've had that thing since
you were 14 exactly I just think it's
time our place be a little less college
dorm and a little more about comfortable
for us for everyone the last time your
parents visited your dad refused to sit
on that futon because of these
suspicious stains this is about
impressing my parents
are you mad at me no I'm not mad at you
is this about the wedding is what about
the wedding I know we made a few
compromise you I wanted converses and
food trucks and we had a sit-down dinner
and I wore it you looked amazing I know
we're here
fantastic I don't know where I'm going
our rolls-royce is supposed to be really
really nice you know I don't really know
cars but it has good bones boy is it
comfortable Carl might chew
how are you must be Michael yes okay
it's your girlfriend Katie my wife all
right well aren't you two adorable I
assume you're here to get this couch off
our lawn so fast here
well gotta do something about it soon
honey the grass is starting to die well
I'd like to ask you a few questions I'd
like to move this out to the curb now
would you guys say you eat or drink on
and around your furniture as opposed to
eating and drinking over the sink well I
mean a glass of water a cup of tea is
fine but tomato soup honey come on we're
very responsible with our things
satisfied yeah um listen you guys use
furniture for its intended purpose
sitting with your feet on the ground not
on the cushions occasionally our full
night's sleep is fine but thing is if
you guys treat this couch well it'll
treat you long for the love of God car
you know if you want to go inside I can
take care of this can you let me handle
this woman you said it was 150 right I
brought cash you were being so
melodramatic about this we just updated
all of our furniture in this piece no
longer matches our decor I no longer of
a place to sit what about the Stevenson
it's beautiful Stevenson is a torture
device my tailbone is bruised and
battered because you don't have an ass
is not the Stevenson's fault
he loves this sofa we cannot take it
away maybe he's just not giving this new
couch a chance so what just because we
make six figures now I can't afford a
comfortable place to sit I gotta sell my
favorite couch a couple of interns Hey
I'm on your side let me know
so I'm not supposed to want nice things
I'm not supposed to want any furniture
that my husband hasn't pissed all over
that was one time I was blackout drunk
oh really well I'm gonna try to tell me
that you're not drinking anymore you
know I got a scotchguard warranty on
that you lift that right up
be honest you guys really in the market
for a piece of furniture that my husband
has power wash with his man hose at
least twice probably more give us a
second I don't want to peek out maybe
with the Scotchguard Michael I'm sorry I
just spent a lot of time on Craigslist
and this was easily our best bet we
could try IKEA IKEA seriously what's
next we give up grilled cheese and
chicken fingers we figure out the whole
401k thingy we move into the burbs
because baby number three is on the way
is updating our furniture going to
become a thing whoa I don't care about
updating our furniture so you don't want
a Stevenson someday sweetie I don't even
know what that is
I just wanted to do something nice for
you our futon is starting to literally
hurt you look well you two please give
this couch a loving home before I murder
my harpy of a wife it's gonna try to
drown me with piss that guy definitely
peed on this thing more than twice it
reeks I don't think I can go on
Craigslist again I don't trust you to
grow on Craigslist again I'm driving
home right
I can't believe you thought a couch
meant I wanted to get you pregnant you
do want to get me pregnant
yeah but not soon true anymore practice
no way is satus on the pillow top or
nothing I am a lady pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
