always do this fighting hi I'm Ned and
I'm married I'm Kelsey and I'm very
single you've submitted relationship
questions we are not qualified to answer
them we're gonna try anyways fight how
do you fight fair I don't like it if you
keep things under your skin suddenly
you're just gonna boil up and explode
best way to handle a fight is to assert
your dominance come out on top make sure
you get in those good jobs that you've
been thinking about you just throw
something and leave and slam a door but
then again I'm a big fan of Taylor Swift
worst-case scenarios ghosts um I have to
respectfully disagree I think it's
important to talk about the issues use I
statements I feel frustrated when you go
every time I talk about me and my wife
having sex as opposed to yeah you don't
want a name call that just will hurt the
other person's feelings and it won't
actually resolve the issue unless they
deserve it you know I'm talking about
John I'm not gonna fight it because I go
through a rollercoaster of emotions I
played them baked them all the time I
always yell I'm Irish I have no patient
I know that if I yell let's one insult
them it's not gonna help the situation
it's Fighting's healthy Fighting's
healthy whenever me and my wife fight we
curl up on the bed and we talk really
softly if you love someone it's not
fighting
find a time when you're both well-rested
sometimes you need to go to bed angry
because being drunk and tired is not the
best time to resolve a disagreement by
the time you wake up you guys are both
just like over it you might discover
something about yourself that you didn't
even know mostly just come out the
bigger person come out on top just
always you know get give give up you
know what Kelsey every time we're trying
to make an episode you go off on the
rails giving people terrible advice with
you listen to me for lunch oh sorry not
sorry
haha well I'm sorry I'm an asshole
no the other one it's not I'm sorry you
feel that the best fights end where
you're safe yeah that's true I'm sorry
yeah me too and that's how you going to
fight
but seriously don't say that to me again
