means it's almost Thanksgiving which
means it's almost December which means
it's time to sort out the giant circus
that is what do you do when it's the
holidays hi I'm Ned and I'm married
Kelsey and I'm very single you've
submitted relationship questions we are
not qualified to answer them but we're
gonna anyways it's like joyful it's
happy but I actually think there are
more difficult things when you're in a
relationship I could not imagine if my
children said that they weren't coming
home for holidays one year I had to have
that conversation with my mom of like do
one year at your place and one year at
their place
nobody wants fucking Thanksgiving either
yeah yeah nobody wants Thanksgiving why
over holiday I love thanks girl I know
when you're single and you have to go
home for the holidays all you gotta say
is I'm dating it's always that one in me
how do you respond that question I'll be
your uncle here Kelsey you got a
boyfriend no I've got a girlfriend what
I just get on your cell phone
so when you're gonna get married
Hillary's gotta be impressed
hey and then you push them off on to
another time
I'll be yeah that's not a good idea
Oh lovely you can make it this year
actually my aunt doesn't ask my
fictional bed and so I see that vaginas
still behind tight over there what's the
deal with that you've had a little too
much blah we're just taking it one step
at a time subsonic sex
Oh bonuses oh what's the holdup we just
want to make sure that we have a really
strong relationship just the two of us
first well I'd better see a child by
next Thanksgiving or cutting you off
Holies are already stressful enough the
last thing you want to do is just
yourself how more worried about what
everyone else is gonna think I'm
stressed out now just talking about it
yeah you just got a nut up and do it in
your twin bed yeah I already know what
you're gonna say how are all
grandparents races they're all racism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
