feel that deep ache of loneliness it's
both irritating and disheartening
I seriously think it's weird that I can
feel so sad just by being lonely as a
guy it seems that most guys don't care
about the stuff I care about I make a
lot of money it really doesn't make me
happy I'm a lonely guy I'm pretty cheap
also I feel so alone I'm a man in a
sexless marriage I love her but I'm so
lonely and just crave being wanted just
because I'm a guy doesn't mean I'm
strong I sometimes cry myself to sleep
at night when I realize how lonely I am
I'm a guy and one-night-stands make me
feel more lonely than crowd being lonely
as a guy gets very little sympathy girls
can't talk to each other sometimes I
feel like as a guy I'm not supposed to
admit only when I really wish I had
someone to cuddle with right now as a
guy i often feel so lonely and nervous i
mask it with confidence and try to numb
it with sex i'm so lonely but
it's hard to admit it because I'm a guy
and when guys say stuff like that
they're pussies even though I'm so
lonely
no friends no one to talk to nothing I
refuse to cry I can't cry it's hard at
it's sad but I can't cry I'm a man I
just have to endure until I meet someone
who has time for me I'm so lonely I
could burst out in tears I'm a guy we
have feelings too
