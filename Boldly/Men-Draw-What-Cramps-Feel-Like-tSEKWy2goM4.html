like oh my god it hurts so bad like all
the time to everyone just anyone that I
listen I have three sisters and a mom
and a girlfriend and I had a female dog
growing up so I know what I'm doing red
markers very important for this next
step the red is gonna be my best friend
I'm going to use the red pen I hope this
isn't too gross lightning bolts just
attacking your body I feel like any time
a girl describes it it's just like
sounds like your stomach just gets like
from what I understand cramps
feel like a fist is squeezing your
vagina so I drew a penis it was pretty
much like someone ran like Olympic style
into the stomach area I imagine it feels
like a machine gun is shooting you from
the inside and it's just shooting pain
bullets to watch a lot of Gilmore Girls
so that's very important I don't know
why this guy has a hairy arm but he does
and of course you can't forget the back
let's just do somebody with a boxing
glove punching her back just really hard
this is what I think it feels like to
have menstrual cramps it's a penis and
then it was ripped in half I feel like
this is pretty accurate and I feel like
the woman in my life can get behind this
so I think I was pretty spot-on I mean I
know that it can be really grueling just
a big fist squeezing your lady parts
what I was going for here is kind of
like warrior type thing there's like a
lot of it's coming at you but you're
just handling it like a pro every month
statement is definitely involved this is
not a great thing you guys have to go
through I think I did all right I think
people are gonna relate to this if like
women saw this we'd be like that's
exactly it feels like you know my pain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
