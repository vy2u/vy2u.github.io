need both of my hands to piss women have
to deal with a lot of things men don't
make up catcalling periods the wage gap
and one thing that we don't really talk
about a lot is pockets men's pants all
have pockets but most women's donor if
they do they can't really hold anything
so why are pockets a thing that are left
out of most women's clothing today we're
gonna talk to some people in the office
see how they feel about pockets and then
I'm gonna challenge four of my male
colleagues to see if they can spend a
day pocketless can we see what sort of
pockets are on these I don't put
anything in my front pockets because
they're usually too shallow
whenever something has a pocket though
I'm like like a dress with pockets I get
annoyed with like Blazers like women's
Blazers there's no pockets we have more
things to carry why not give us more
pockets people also make fun of women
for always like putting their cell phone
in their boobs at clubs or whatever and
it's like we have no pockets what are
you gonna give us we're gonna use
nature's pocket which is removes this is
Elena with a research department and I
was wondering Elena if there's any
historical context to why women's pants
are either made without pockets or with
small pockets women didn't historically
wear pants for like a very long time the
1600s they were these large dresses that
had pouches underneath them that were
like pockets but at some point big heavy
skirts was no longer in fashion once
they had slimmer frames for dresses you
couldn't hold anything inside of them
anymore that's when people turned to
purses so it wasn't until the beginning
of women's suffrage around the turn of
the 20th century that pockets became
this thing that to some activists
represented freedom and mobility there
were notable suffragettes who would wear
coats with many pockets on them now that
we know a little bit more about pockets
let's meet the four guys who've agreed
to live one day without them I rely on
my pockets for a lot of stuff carrying
my cell phone my keys my wallet you know
right away if you're missing something
because you could feel it
have to apologize to every lady friend I
have I always made fun of them for
losing things
I love Puckett so much that I used to
only have cargo shorts in my wardrobe in
my pockets I keep essential things it's
actually I have my phone my wallet used
to have cigarettes in that pocket not
anymore so have my headphones now and I
have my chopsticks in the small pocket I
actually use it I will be sewing these
pockets up oh my god these pockets are
so big look at all this room you could
fit an iPad in here I just left my house
and I already forgot my wallet it's
gonna be a great day I have a lot of
confidence in myself at this point it
was really hard to get ready this
morning because I left my work bag hey
Frankie the back in my car and I wasn't
able to put my wallet my keys my phone
we worked bad I normally go in my
pockets I had to put of all this hat
because I've got a Dodger game tonight
even Craig the food bag during the Hat
nearly less than 30 minutes and I
already tried to put my wallet in my
back pocket at least five times this
isn't starting to stress me out a little
bit I'm going to lunch right now and I'm
carrying my wallet and my keys in one
hand and it's just so frustrating to
know that you might lose your things so
that's the office and forgot my wallet
on my desk because it's not in my back
pocket like normally would lunch break
there was an ice cream truck and after I
got my ice cream I realized I didn't
have hands to eat the ice cream while
holding my phone while walking home and
my ice cream - I've kind of discovered
an alternative to pockets which is my
armpit so I'm running around I'm not
using my pockets holding everything
people assume I'm like late for work I'm
looking for my car I keep running around
with keys my keys are so annoying and ro
I Dodger Stadium and my wallet in my hat
my phone in my hand I'm one of these
fine gentlemen for ladies gonna hold my
wallet one of them the real struggle is
that I have been constantly checking my
pockets making sure I have my keys my
phone my wallet and every time I check
there's nothing and I freaked out
there's dish
you do find pockets are like that deep
very seriously Wow
goddamn the amount of like sexism in
just the simplicity of pockets on pants
is crazy it's kind of like inventing
electricity but living in the dark
alright so today's over and glad take
these pants off yes yes pockets
pocket no I purposely avoid walking the
shorts been the chance
if you're at the gym you're changing
machines in your pocket I love so many
things at the gym like on the treadmill
because you forget it yeah why don't
they just make pockets for old pants
whether you're a girl today a guy with a
leggings and I understand the
functionality of like the person the
handbag and the inconvenience of it all
to but now it makes sense like when I'm
you know a little girl or with someone
don't like a key hold on to this we can
hold this for me okay now I won't say
I'm not your personal Sherpa I'm
sympathetic to the everything okay so
there you have it
life without pocket sucks for these four
dudes but most girls don't even realize
that they've been finding other
solutions for them this whole time this
is why girls love dresses and pockets so
guys I don't know hold your girlfriend's
purse sometimes or don't it doesn't you
don't have to you figure out what works
for your relationship you know also
don't why do people always make fun of
girls for freaking out over pockets it's
like no they're the best thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
