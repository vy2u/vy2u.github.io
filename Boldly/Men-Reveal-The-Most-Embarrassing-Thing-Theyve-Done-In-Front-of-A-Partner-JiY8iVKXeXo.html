sight of blood freaked me out a little
bit especially coming from my penis and
then I passed out
we were out actually camping everyone
was sort of trading stories or actually
telling everyone what it was like
growing up being a young guy and my
girlfriend was there and one of my mates
decided to tell everyone that I had once
tasted my own junk
my girlfriend turned to me and sort of
said why did you do that and I was like
I was 13 it's a normal part of
exploration of your own body and if
girls are gonna have to put it in their
mouth or guys
maybe you should taste your own it was
on her birthday I woke up happy birthday
and she just looks at me and says don't
you happy birthday me then begins to
tell me that I had slept war that night
and pissed all over her bedside table
and threw her clean clothes basket so
she had to clean up my piss at 3 o'clock
in the morning on her birthday one night
I'm out at a party with my girlfriend at
the time and there was pizza and I got
really bad food poisoning from it and
that night in in bed I was I was going
to and from the toilet every time -
spewing up and I had to do a sneaky fart
I never even fought in front of
girlfriends and we were fairly new in
our relationship at the time I do a
sneaky fight and then I shat like I
sharted not a big amount but it was I
it's enough to say that I myself in
front of my girlfriend I was going down
the girlfriend and grandmother walked in
I'm still still still obviously inside
and yeah managed to keep a full chub
whilst she was in the room me and an
ex-girlfriend were my parents house and
we were fooling around and as I entered
I saw that sharp pain and what happened
was my
frenulum Google that one which is the
skin that connects your foreskin to your
penis I'm broke and I started to bleed
and then the sight of blood freaked me
out a little bit especially coming from
my penis and then I passed out she
didn't know what the hell was going on
so she started screaming for help so my
parents came in the room and I was lying
on the bed for the towel and me
unconscious bleeding from my penis a
little hiccup in the road something we
all must go through at one stage it
happens to a lot of people I've spoken a
lot of people about this so those of you
who has never happened to look at be
careful use Lube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
