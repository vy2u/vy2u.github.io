was posed kind of weird so that it
looked like she had like a foot in
between her thighs and I commented kind
of hesitantly thigh gap for days and
then I got a bunch of like so it's like
okay I think I understand what this
trend is I do know what if I got this
eye gap is the desirable gap between a
thigh for women because your legs
supposed to be that skinny I'm still not
a hundred percent sure I don't know why
it's gender specific either like will
that then become a thing that men are
expected to have as well it seems like
it's definitely grown in popularity
thanks to social media celebrities
photoshopping a thigh gap I don't really
understand the huge like appeal and
obsession over it I honestly don't know
why they would I think the only thing
that would make a thigh gap like
desirable is that you don't get chafing
oh man I don't I don't that's a good
question I don't think I've ever really
looked for that if I had to tabulate how
many of my ex-girlfriends has thigh gaps
I'd have no idea you know I'm imagining
all all the women that I've had a
privilege of seeing naked I can't call
to mind a single thigh gap I don't know
I actually yeah I've never I'd I would
have to go back and check probably the
first thing I noticed is just a smile
smile or eyes their smile and their eyes
the face in the eyes probably smile feel
like you could tell a lot about a person
by their smile
the thigh gap is not something that's
like a make or break usually I'm looking
for what is there and not what is not
there you know what I mean is it like
right when you're about to have sex and
you a guy's gonna go oh wait there's no
thigh gap there nevermind no guy will
ever say that you're beautiful
whether your thighs are touching or not
just seems like it's gotten a lot a lot
more attention than it probably deserves
it's like I'm thinking if you put duct
tape here and then you pulled it around
and really pulled it and like attached
it here I guess you could form thigh gap
that way an artificial thigh gap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
