Tina was a very strange person and she
would stand on her playset in her yard
and scream little mermaid tunes at my
family I remembered her like chasing me
around this pine tree and she finally
caught up with me and pinned me down and
made me kiss her
so it wasn't a great first kiss Thank
You Tina I guess when I was at film camp
in high school everybody was just like
finding excuses to make out with
everybody I mean I sort of made friends
with this girl who is a ballet dancer
and went in for the kiss sort of
mid-conversation I think she was
actually still saying something and I
think my face looked about like this
then I pulled back and said that was
awkward
sorry during my sophomore year in
college
we watched Casablanca and then we
watched Forrest Gump and Forrest Gump is
a very emotional very sweet movie so
like I went in for a hug but he
interpreted it I think it was a peck
that turned into a make-out I had my
eyes open in the begin because I was
initially going in for a hug then I
closed my eyes but then I realized that
I don't have to follow that rule and I
can open my eyes because I wanted to see
how he's reacting to how I was doing
when I was in third grade and my grandma
saw like the graffiti she tagged on the
school walls it's like who the hell's
Amanda she would try to make me jealous
saying like whoa I'm dating this
eighteen year old and I hated her I
wasn't into girls so one day I'm walking
home from school and she runs up to me
and I look over it and she gives me a
kiss on the lips me like huh my eyes
were closed and I was scared and she
just runs away and I was so pissed so
the next day at recess I grabbed the
basketball and I chucked it at her but I
was paying for popcorn and for frizzy
pop ice cream and I took her up onto the
top of a parking structure and as the
fireworks are going I'm like oh hey
what's that what you got some crap right
here this is like what and then I go
boom whoa right in for the kiss it
started as a peck but it became a
passionate Meghan
she loved it my first kiss was a stolen
Peck from a young lady named Sybil if
your name is Sybil you're probably the
civil</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
