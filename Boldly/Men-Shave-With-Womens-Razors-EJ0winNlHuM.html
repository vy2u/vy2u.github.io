I'll wear that battle scar I think it's
going to be very like nice I mean what
could be so different right it just
gonna be pink
I know we're using it for a different
body part so on the face yeah we might
uh might have the edge they pivot that's
nice just about the same I guess
just less intimidate whoa save two
dollars like it I kind of feel like
they're gonna smell nice I'm really
feels like I like a man's razor just saw
no more purple I mean it's very gentle I
feel like I've shaved nothing their
radar working really well
yep yeah drew first blood if you were
Nicks and cuts and that's all I've been
feeling all day we've only done just my
chin and I'm think I'm gonna have to go
through all the razor's that no no I
understand why I take so long for women
to shit it's definitely not designed for
dentists yeah cuz I'm not even most of
the way down the peanut field with my
favorite and this is just saving my
fascia but I don't have to shame other
places with these relationships Joe
don't too bad thank you Gillette Venus
simply 3:20 two hours later we finally
did it you feel pretty that was actually
really really tough yeah that one wall
might just be a weird like placebo thing
I liked the colors I can die a happy man
now I bled I think the deciding factor
on if I would either use old mens razor
or a women's razor in the future is just
cost nice officially check that off your
bucket list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
