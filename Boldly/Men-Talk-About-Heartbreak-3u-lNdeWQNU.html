broken up with so many times I have yes
I have been broken up with man I
remember my high school girlfriend
dumped me oh I was so sad
finding out that she hooked up with
someone more successful than me ah my
girlfriend gave me a homemade quilt that
took her like six months to make and
then broke up with me like an hour later
that was a strange cuz I like I didn't
know what the hell to do with the quilt
after that we were at a cast party for a
musical that we were in and just like
halfway through because I said something
weird she goes we're thrilled and I
thought she was joking like Oh what then
what it when did that Evan worse way I
did it was via email and it was
definitely on some like childish stuff
because I was cheating I knew I was in
the wrong so I was kind of like how am I
gonna finagle my way out of this thing
it was throughout the entire evening of
the homecoming dance
both the dinner before during the dance
and then for an hour after the dance was
over I tried to convince someone that we
weren't dating in general just it was I
should have just waited one more day
just let let the girl have a fun
homecoming but I couldn't do that so I
was too much of a jerk the worst way
I've ever broken up with someone is
taking a vacation with another girl I
remember one time trying to go on a date
and be the most awful version of myself
for the person to try and break up with
me that's just that's not a good way to
do things I walked in after a ski trip
and handed her this little wooden frog
and then said I'm going to sleep on my
buddy Jon's couch it's over and that was
that we didn't really talk again for
like two years
I think when you when you stop
communicating if you feel like it would
be easier to just hang out with them
miserably than it would be to break up
with them that's a good time break up
with them I think it's time to break up
when you're trying to figure out how to
break up there's no one no it was like
oh this relationship is run its course
let's get out now while we're both still
happy with it it's like a relationship
has to get into this murky soggy gross
period before you both have the courage
to be like this is bad isn't it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
