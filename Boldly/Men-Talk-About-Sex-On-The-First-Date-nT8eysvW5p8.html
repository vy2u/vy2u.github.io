you had but you won't tell them how
awkward it is let's be honest I think
it's okay to have sex on the first date
put simply I'm actually very torn on
this subject I hate the idea of applying
like a math rule I think if you want to
have sex and they want to have sex
people should have sex I think it rarely
works out like you want it to cuz you
don't know that person yet I have I've
had sex on the first day yep
I have yeah no I had sex with my current
girlfriend on the first date I don't
really do that because I get too
emotionally attached it's a problem I
have but it was a thing where we had
context we had months of interaction
with each other we built the sexual
tension I think it was always after the
second date I think it's good to build
sexual tension I think it's like
something to look forward to no I did
not feel self-conscious about telling my
friends no I don't think I felt
self-conscious especially if you haven't
had sex in a while it mainly depends on
the friend whether or not I'm
comfortable talking to them about it I
don't think any guy ever feels
self-conscious about telling other guys
he had sex on my first date it's
interesting that you ask you know what I
think of women to have sex on the first
date cuz I got never had any
retrospective thoughts about what the
girl was thinking our society's kind of
decided that women shouldn't be sexually
promiscuous but it's okay for men which
is you know pretty up I would
never hold it against the woman she had
sex on the first date but yeah you can't
condemn somebody for something you just
did that's like the definition of being
hypocritical and hypocrites have no
place in the bedroom the only reason
imagining that a woman was for
doing this is because you secretly think
sex is bad and shameful and it's not it
shouldn't be
and then you're like yeah yeah like I
totally freak this chick you
don't even need our I can guarantee she
faked that orgasm I guarantee it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
