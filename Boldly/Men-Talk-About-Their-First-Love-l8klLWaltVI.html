how we felt was through AOL Instant
Messenger I caret 3u I was writing
Radiohead lyrics on my English that
someone was mysteriously completing them
so I left her my phone number and then
find out she was in my Orchestra class
yeah we just like go to her house and
like listen to records and I kissed her
and she's kind of like scurried to the
other side of the room yeah she thought
I was gay she's like oh well yeah I like
you yeah we dated for like three years
in high school I watched him go through
three relationships with with girls like
I had like this really twisted twisted
fantasy where he doesn't know that he
likes guys yet but he would like me so
much that he would like realize it I
went out of my way to do so many things
for him I had better friends than him
but I didn't buy anything for them I
bought stuff for him he always thought
it was just out of the goodness of my
heart even though it's because I wanted
I wanted him to to like me back our
parents had known that we've been
consorting on the Internet at the time
so we had to figure out how to prove to
them that it wasn't just some creepy
perverted 90 year old guy when we did
meet in person it was at Camp Snoopy her
mom was there and I remember at the end
of the date I had to shake her hands
when I was in fifth grade I had a huge
crush on this girl so I invented a whole
movie plot line and tried to cast her in
it by passing out a flyer to the entire
school my teacher figured it out and
told me I couldn't pass around the flyer
it was a beautiful beautiful summer of
terrible warped or early 2000 fans
I hated Simple Plan so I grabbed her
t-shirt and I burned it in her backyard
and as she watched me burn her simple
plan t-shirt and turned over and I said
because I love you and she couldn't help
the fight to the tears of her burntzilla
plant shirt and say I love you too
she was she went to go work at
Bennigan's I'm fine just like eating
strawberry pops and like playing music
you know probably because we broke up
that even went to college</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
