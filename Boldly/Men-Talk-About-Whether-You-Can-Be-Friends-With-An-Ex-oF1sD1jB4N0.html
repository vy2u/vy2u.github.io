there's probably not kind of yes
I think you can to a degree but there's
definitely rules in time after a breakup
I think you can be depending if say
someone's broken your heart or not I
actually don't think that you can form a
really close friendship up you've had a
really romantic relationship with
someone I've seen other people do it
before I have charted friends and ex
asked about two weeks she put up a photo
on Instagram of her and his boy was like
sounds like a love heart and I was like
now it's actually quite nice I'm gonna
like that to show that I'm happy for her
then she blocked me yeah I still think
he can be after a breakup but knowing my
exes it's never going to happen for me
they get like a new partner or you get a
new partner and spending time with them
then probably cause friction the next
person that you're with actually feels
really insecure about the ex who's now
your mate and I feel as though it's just
a little bit too hard
straight after I think it's very weird
because that person's going to be single
they're going to be going out with their
friends a lot more and they are going to
be meeting new people so you kind of
being friends with them going hey how's
your weekend being oh I'm going on a
date tonight if they're broken your
heart then it's - awkward - hey let's go
for coffee with the person who broke my
heart so I don't really think that exes
should be made if they can be like good
on you and I wish that I could really
decide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
