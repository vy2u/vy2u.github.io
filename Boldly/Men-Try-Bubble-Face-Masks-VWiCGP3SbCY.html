feather all around my nose oh my god it
tickles so bad
we're trying the the bubble face mask I
don't know what it is but I'm excited I
I have heard about the bubble face mask
I saw it on reddit I believe I saw the
picture on live the girl who tried into
her face turned into a cloud I think
it's all I think face masks are
just like a product with no need I have
done face mask me my friends will do
them all the time they're pretty fun
body wash on my leave I do I put the
body wash on my loofah loofah up my
whole body and then by the end just
scrub my face quick and well then you're
picking up your body dirt and I'm
putting on my face party a lot this
weekend and I'm starting to break out so
I'm hoping this face mask will nip it in
the bud carbonated bubble clay mask it's
very cute it's got a nice piglet here
with a face mask on whoa Wow it's like
yeah take proper amount of carbonated
bubble claim add proper amount the
applied parts on skin appeared the above
sit I'll it let's just do it now
there we go oh it's really cold
that's foaming I don't like being
tickled and I feel like I'm being
tickled the bubbling is getting louder I
said I know what a scratch it's so close
so bad oh I think I okay just be
strong just squeeze squeeze my hands oh
we could do this together it's really
silly is kind of funny
like oh wow there's a bubble up in the
past you look like the mask it kind of
looks now like the stuffing you'd pull
out of a teddy bear is just on your face
yeah I feel like a bubble goddess
and turn to burn oh yeah I don't think
it's a postal burn wait I'm so cloudy
now I I'm huge my face is so big just I
look absolutely ridiculous like a
jellyfish stung us in the face I get it
I don't get it it seems like a wasted
well I'm just copying you Coletta's
he'll say what you're suppose I'm the
pro here that's yeah that's right
oh it's popping on the bubble but I'm
sad my friends are all dying it's not
going away there's still like a clay
mask underneath baby yeah it's a pain in
the ass yes it looks is what people lose
I feel like I'm making a big mess I feel
like it's just smeared now I feel like
my skin looks prettier there's no way I
was ever going to be able to notice a
difference let's check it out
Wow okay you get you look good thank you
my face feels very tight right now it
smells lovely
I imagine this like a lighter version of
what Botox feels like but it I don't
like this tightness right now I've like
I don't want my skin you don't see I
think that's the whole point you do a
mess cuz you like sort of a tightness of
your face I feel like a new man I feel
like you know like my credit score went
up it feels nice the whole thing was
kind of an adventure the lengths we go
to to become beautiful as long as you're
doing it for yourself not for other
people that was delightful I kind of
miss it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
