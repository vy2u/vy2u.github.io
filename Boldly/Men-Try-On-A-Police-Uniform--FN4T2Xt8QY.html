the police officer all you see is a
uniform
my general impression of the police
growing up was that they were here to
protect us and serve us the police have
been ever present in my life both my
grandfather's were police officers
sometimes when a police officer will
drive by I'll take off my hat one time I
got pulled over
Mastan where they pulled me over they
wouldn't say anything he just started
going through my car I was detained by
some cops they was looking for some dude
and they found me they come in as if
you're you got three strikes and then
work their way down and nobody wants to
be put treated like they have three
strikes when they're like living their
life correctly when you see that black
and white car or that blue uniform or
that black uniform it's scary
oh god already feels weird like putting
this one that badge is real shiny and
like it's in the corner of your eye at
all times it's like a source of
confidence oh Jesus
can't do it putting on this belt I feel
already a sense of like Authority and I
feel a sense of like urgency like you
want to use these tools I get stressed
out when I have to think okay wallet
keys phone and to be a cop it's like you
have all these other added layers of
stress before you even step out on the
street ah this with the hard part all
right and then the final step
huh that's very weird
I see myself in a copying from Mike
cheese's I look like every cop
I am scaring myself watching the mirror
I look at myself and I can see all the
officers who's I've look in their eyes
and could tell they didn't want to
message me but had to honestly I see
jerk before I see hero and that sucks
this cop came up to me as civilian I
wouldn't take him seriously the fashion
sensibility of being a police officer
seems like it would be sort of a weird
burden to deal with you know how do you
carry yourself like a cop what is that
what does a cop stand like I see
somebody's action that can tell the
difference between good people and bad
people but have been trained to do a job
be nice if I could look at this police
officer and feel safer but I look at
myself now it makes me a little
uncomfortable and skittish if anything
especially because it's me seeing this
reflection of myself I want to turn away
from myself to see myself in this
uniform feels like a choke and you
realize that there's guys who get up and
look in a mirror like this every single
morning and it's not a joke
feel like I understand why people run
away from these guys we can't we solve
our problems without resorting to this
it is kind of shocking how much a
uniform effect affects you mentally why
are we afraid of the people that are
supposed to be there to protect us can I
take this off now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
