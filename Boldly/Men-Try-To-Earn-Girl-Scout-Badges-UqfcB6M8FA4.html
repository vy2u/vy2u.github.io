to you think outside the box you ready
for this yeah begin what is I like what
you're doing here can I just wrap this
in as much cloth as possible what about
this I don't know what to do with that
they were doubting the materials a
little too much and they were doubting
themselves this isn't working
don't give up don't give up you can do
it yet the Girl Scout way will you
copying me no I'm not I'm not I'm
looking at you how about this it's okay
to copy you're just supporting one
another that's what Girl Scouts know one
of us wants to win we're men this is how
we do things well today you're being
girl step oh oh you're so strong today
oh no someone's calling me at this time
the challenge is complete boom on three
we're gonna drop him one two three
doesn't look like any of them broke its
my phone didn't break but I could have I
don't know if my phone case was what
they were looking for I definitely
nailed the phone case page hi Juliet my
friend Sophia is a junior Girl Scout
she's gonna be taking you through a
piece of the detective badge this is a
Morse code you have to write down what
the code is you each get a key you have
five minutes to complete this task this
is really intense go
what are you doing what do they I'm
cheating oh man I'm messing this all up
I totally botched it Morse code I don't
know how I got the word that I got but
it isn't a real word
I think Edgar's got it Sophia whoa whoa
whoa Sofia what if I pre bought a
thousand dollars worth of Girl Scout
cookies ah so we have a problem
Girl Scout can't be bribed you're so
honest and remedy and helpful come the
Girl Scouts are very hard to bribe
really doubting my own moral compass
correct and the answer is are you man
enough to be a Girl Scout I nailed the
mystery challenge my how to do the fact
that it's on our shirt we have one more
challenge to complete my friend Julia
here is a senior Girl Scout she'll be
taking you through a piece of the cross
training badge you guys are gonna start
off back there doing ten jump ropes then
ten hula hoops then ten push-ups you
guys think you're ready for this oh yeah
oh yeah one on your mark get set go oh
no my rope is dangling backwards my jump
rope is tied and then I just forgot how
to jump rope in the middle of it oh I
feel like you have ten I have no hips
and that hula hoopers I got to me okay
that's enough what oh wow I know he said
he was that athletic one welcome ego I'm
a Girl Scout didn't expect win the
athletic thing but I think that just
reflects poorly on all of us encourage
others
Debra didn't oughta hula-hoop and my
push-ups were a little slow very
exhausting you did a great job today
what you're going to be getting today is
a fun patch because you only did one
step of each of the badges you haven't
yet earned a badge but our handbooks can
explain to you all the other steps
necessary for you to earn the rest of
the badges this is like a life guide
financing my future look that's so
helpful are you guys ready to find out
what fun patch you're receiving yes
Shane you earned this one at the
beginning you were a little bit unsure
of yourself you've definitely stepped
out of your comfort zone and you had a
bunch of fun and that's exactly what
Girl Scouts is all about so
congratulations the nicest thing
anyone's said to me Oh coming into this
I was pretty intimidated by the Girl
Scouts they really got it together in a
lot of ways that I don't Zack earned
Adventure patch because he solves his
resources right I came in here and I was
sure I was gonna dominate and I feel
like this day was just overwhelming
failure on my part I'm not a failure
thank you the detective fun pack goes to
Edgar because he was the fastest to
figure out the Morse code I came into
this very excited I learned that being
girl scout is not easy I don't know if
I'm a man enough for it you all
displayed courage confidence and
character today and we're very proud of
you now although you can't be Girl
Scouts I think you'd all be great Girl
Scout leaders thanks guys yeah I'm gonna
go read my manual give my last two girls
guess is all about fun and I think they
had a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
