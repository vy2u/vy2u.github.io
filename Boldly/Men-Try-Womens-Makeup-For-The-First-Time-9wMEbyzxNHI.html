Beyonce like this is what I woke up like
every single day I hope I look good
women are beautiful whereas men are kind
of like hairy and scraggly little
monster things it's just like a less
painful version of being at the genes--
it's almost like a massage don't take
this personally I never like getting
face paint when I was a kid it feels
like I'm getting gross
some girls will like come over look in a
certain way and then they'll go and take
a shower I'll be like wow who is this
person they like a blank coloring book
feels so beautiful right now
we're the most sensitive part of your
face it's like playing chicken in the
car top I see the brush in my eye I just
want to check it out and move out the
way
if someone waved a magic wand and guys
had to wear makeup to get laid they
probably wear makeup yeah that's
definitely weird that is Thor's so to
say for the record I am no longer
enjoying myself whenever I have to look
up I open my mouth I'm not sure what it
is feels like it's been ten minutes or
if she's just been poking at my eyeball
this is tough but it's gonna be worth it
when I look better than any of the women
we work with is it glue my eyelids are
lifting weights Susan's in this mini
rate can you give me like a like an
Asian kpop look always wondered what
these Clockwork Orange things do that's
terrifying
I wonder how many feels looks those
rushes touch the color palette here none
of these look like a normal person's
lips it's hard to imagine I'm gonna be a
good-looking woman you could do look
horrible it's time to man up
oh my god that's crazy
holy cow I think I look like my office I
kind of look like my mom it's not a
beautiful woman it's a cancer woman's
definitely interesting to see how easily
the face can became the art of doing
that is kind of beautiful I learned
that's a huge pain in the ass women and
just like the late she's both a little
put a face and the fact there's $6,000
of the makeup yeah
and it's just like a cost I never have
so the I hope thing it's like what
ladies and girls go through if I had to
do that on my own I blind myself men
should be allowed to wear makeup I mean
generally anyone should be allowed to do
anything
makeup is gendered I think beauty is
gendered too it's a window into women's
like daily routine or like you know what
people expect you're just laughing just
looking like it's know what I'm saying
it's funny it's cuz I the crazy
everybody have nightmares have
nightmares forever now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
