like her body react to those gloved
hands

ever get to debate oh wow oh no it just
shoots right out of there Oh
complication why is it already okay okay

to be that red feel like I'm watching
alien they're cutting the umbilical cord
and now another doctors looking at what
I assume is the placenta

that's not gonna help give her a series
of towels
it looks like the zombie baby from Dawn
of the Dead it's like I'm trying to feel
scared frightened amazed and that all
wants and just like my brain cannot pick
an emotion I'm just like fried I think
you're eating right after that oh I'm
still hungry but that's the majesty of
life we just witnessed a baby being born

of beautiful it was really nice we did
