putting swagger into animals but it
makes me uncomfortable
what really woke me up sexually as a
child we all know that Simba had it
going on and he gets off that log and
he's a man now and he starts singing and
he's like in me no worries I was like
don't what's happening to me right now
that's when I started feeling things
that I just had not felt before
obviously loved leo because I have a
heart and a vagina he's still sexually
awakening me and definitely Justin
Timberlake from in sync because I mean
hello I loved the Backstreet Boys I had
a whole Backstreet Boy wall in my room
which I regretted for years another
person that really did it for me was
Aaron Carter Bieber has nothing on Aaron
Carter
I loved Ryan Philippi when he played the
bad boy and cruel intentions even though
that that's a hole through mine of
incest as a kid there were a lot of like
indescribable feelings that I had when I
watched Jafar and Jasmine interact then
it was just like I don't want this to
stop but what is this and it felt wrong
I don't think I've ever met someone in
life as charming as the Fox and in the
animated Robin Hood so much swagger how
did they do that he would just like
cross his legs and then he's like throw
up his hat ha Walker in the skulls let's
talk he was just like rowing in the like
dimly lit like sin stir underground
world of power and sex I was really into
that I was in third grade at a super big
crush on Michael J Fox and everyone
would say Oh Michael J Fox like Marty
McFly like you saw Back to the Future
and I was like yup but in real life it
was Michael J Fox Circus Spin City jtt I
don't even need to say from what he was
everything I really liked Johnny Yong
Bosch and his Mighty Morphin Power
Ranger days when he played the black
Ranger he just seemed like one of those
everyday cool cute guys as opposed to
like the super testosterone leaders that
everybody else was I loved Dawson's
Creek not Dawson it was all about Pacey
love Jo hocus-pocus
the main guy was cute in it too and like
you spend the whole movie thinking he's
really cute and then the cat becomes
that boy
you're like done like I'm done where
that like that like shirt from the 1700s
that was like that white roughly like
just a little bit of chest hair and his
hair was that like like I'm about to be
burned at the stake chic
I got he's so handsome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
