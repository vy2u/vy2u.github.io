stereotypical Mexican I'm Chicana I am
Mexican where when I see someone dressed
up is enough and sombrero it's not nice
guys so you got the big eyes so metal
you got like the mustache you got to set
up a I have no idea
no I don't have amigos keen amigos that
dressed up like this this outfit is
quite elaborate to put on and I don't
get it so it comes with a moustache that
it really doesn't stick pop ring here
I'm actually very much enjoying this
donkey right now my donkey is dead look
it's right in there it looks horrible
these pants are going up my ass customs
are funny
customs that's the purpose I it I get it
that if you wear this we're gonna call
you out on your board I don't know what
I am
get the ribbons and you've got the top I
could see what you're trying to do here
I feel like I work at a Mexican
restaurant like can I take your order
you're missing the mark that I do like
this belt look at all these shots on
your waistband ready to go I've never
met a tequila girl I love tequila don't
get me wrong I love tequila I was
drinking a lot of tequila last night
with some friends don't do that on a
Thursday I don't like this at all take
this off immediately but like I would
not just up like this
I'm gonna keep it real with you this is
actually not that bad it's a taco I love
tacos you can see the salsa on to my
side on my left you can see my bra along
with the rest of the tortilla which I
think I'm rocking if you say this is
taco bell costume I would be fine this
isn't like a real choco hope it's not
tackled custom only ah there are many
things to be offended about this is not
one of them I look delicious I eat me
you can do all their costumes not this
Americanized ankle bag saccade I think
dressing up as a taco is fine dressing
up as a weird combination of stereotypes
is wrong I'm trying to make the culture
of costume for Halloween it's not gonna
work and just have fun being like a
character that you love and admire happy
Halloween
I hope you guys have a great one stay
safe and don't be offensive and
stereotypical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
