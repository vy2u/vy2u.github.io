specifically my grandmother so I never
felt the need to go to foil throw pig on
and buy the same thing
nothing beats grandma's cooking I'm
sorry
we have logon over the house I am
excited because you cannot go wrong with
plantains
if you fail black panels just don't make
a business I prefer mine with a little
more butter it's got a good flavor the
textures right yeah we're good with this
we don't need anything else we're good
are these like supposed to be the Cuban
version of tater tots they look like
little Egyptian pyramids I'm so used to
just being like giant chunks of fried
yucca and my my grandma being just like
have it
I mean she's nicer than that but I'm
really liking this you could taste like
chicken
you know it's like when you get a
chicken tender and it's like mostly
breading that's what it feels like the
yuca is just like a vehicle for the
sauce I would put this sauce on
everything I'm good with this like just
do I take it like shot I wouldn't take
it like a shot
this is the chicken we are this is what
we're here for
not the half of fast food I think this
is pretty how's the fly treating you
it's Miami this skin is actually
surprisingly kind of first feet I would
eat this again really tender it's really
juicy that's good
let's go to Scholarships that's good
I'm super excited for this cuz I love
shredded pork it looks crispy so that's
a good sign I like the flavor a lot
that's like you can taste like a hint of
Moho just like the cumin sour orange
sauce like it feels like they marinated
those I feel like the pork strands could
be a little thicker and I think that
might say something too
maybe the quality of the port hmm no
it's missing something
yeah yeah it's missing love we like the
chicken better get us more chicken
I didn't know they sold ribs at a place
that has chicken in the name I'm gonna
make a mess it's very tangy it doesn't
taste as guava ish as I expected if you
like barbecue and you're into this you
let me know cuz I just we could have a
conversation about that I think the
sauce is too overwhelming yeah it's very
sweet
they're soft they come off the bone
easily and I really like the sauce
that's because it looks like like oh
this looks finger licking but it's not
not as into it I'm just this is how I
clean myself it looks nice
I smell guava which is awesome oh my god
okay I'm feeling it
I am surprised I'm even talking before I
finish this because this is the best
thing ever it's buttery it's soft it's
got a good sweetness to it maybe a
little brittle but it's like it's right
there I think it's pretty good to have a
fast food out there that's keeping
inspired or Caribbean sparked in journal
because I think it's good to have
representation in our fast food really
like the chicken and I think that for a
restaurant called chicken tropical
that's the most important thing I mean
it has it's good things on the menu
pressure we now see why there's usually
a line outside on 8th Street in Miami</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
