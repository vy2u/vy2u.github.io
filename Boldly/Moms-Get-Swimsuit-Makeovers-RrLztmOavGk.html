fit half a vagina in there okay come out
I want to see you
everyone is generally thinking so much
about how they feel about themselves
they're not typically looking at other
people we're concentrating on things
that we don't like about ourselves that
other people might not ever even notice
about us my body is more utilitarian now
we tried to embrace your body and accept
yourself because you want to be a good
role model for your kids but you know
honestly I really don't I'm not very
happy with where it is I'm a young mom
so it's like I also have like those
friends who are like no babies yet like
pool parties or something it's like I
don't want to be around like a bunch of
people my boobs don't stay up like they
used to and like all things that you
used to be like super confident in like
favorite parts of yourself are so
different if it's in public I might
still keep the shorts on or keep a shirt
on over it when I'm trying things on I'm
purchasing the things that are a little
less my style just because they cover
what I feel needs to be covered okay so
which suits you want to try and say I
want to do those printed bottoms with
whatever the bottom okay with which top
what I guess what the best one I think I
think which is nerve-wracking because
it's a little see-through
I picked a two-piece for you but it's a
high waist so it's going to be really
flattering and comfortable I love
America but that might be a little too
patriotic for me I think we should start
with something like this and it has cups
inside that are gonna support jogging
jogging is a good sign yes girl and your
boobs look great too do they feel pretty
secure yeah you have to have that system
first like if you can't jump at least
like three times like you are not safe
you look so good it's just you know
what's hard for me is that I'm like well
what if this plays away and you see my
stretch marks I don't think there's
anyone out there who doesn't have
stretch marks is this something you
would ever put on I would not ever
choose this from the rack but I think I
look cute as but I can't run around with
my kids with pregnancy you really want
to be able to move
it will grow with you and you don't have
to worry about it being so tight and I'm
comfortable I have support up here why
do you like it it's just the way when
you're like I don't like that I'm not
gonna even try it on and then it's super
key oh my gosh I love it so much part of
finding the suit that you feel the most
confident in is trying on a lot of suits
like bathing suits have been so like
function over form for me in the past
that it's just like whatever as long as
it covers everything nobody look at me
like I just I'm going to take my kids to
the pool when I'm going to go so this is
like you know something I I think fits
more of my personal style it's funny
because like I saw it I was like ooh
this is awesome you know and then you're
always like kind of skeptical like will
this look good on me though you know let
me see the slimming I didn't want to be
noticed and yeah much more of a notice
yeah it's a standout suit yeah I'm done
hiding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
