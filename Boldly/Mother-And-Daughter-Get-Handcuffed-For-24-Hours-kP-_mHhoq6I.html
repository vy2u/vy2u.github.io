today we're gonna get handcuffed
together for 24 hours
I mean I love my mom very much but
obviously getting handcuffed to your mom
for 24 hours just like kind of a
nightmare we talked on the phone
Oh not enough we got tattoos together
how do you take yourself to a beautiful
island food and now we're gonna be
handcuffed together for 24 hours they're
not they are lamb wool I'm like I asked
for putting it on we just don't have to
do it tight why did I say we're
handcuffed and now we'll see how it goes
I guess all right so we're officially
handcuffed and we're heading to my
office I think some of my team knows
that this is happening but probably not
I love your new life um yeah we're hand
gifts to each other 24 hours
No well that's out sure that's for
something I don't want one you want to
wait I gotta put this stuff down
oh yeah don't even need my food either
so we're going back upstairs we've been
at my desk for a while and we're gonna
go to the bathroom you might be a little
weird okay we can do this wiping hands
and pulling up your pants love it I
can't have to go first it's really not
I'm just eating some snacks and working
away I guess I need some improvement on
this yeah I think she's getting pretty
bored which I don't blame her so we
might need to spice things up walking
down Hollywood so I'm just asked if
people think we're a couple I was where
I would be a cradle-robber
so we survived getting our nails done we
have these really cool shoes right now
we are heading back to the office I have
to go to a meeting sue does not know
that my mom will be joining me and got
so we are handcuffed together he's a
puppy in for the triggers were
handcuffed together completely forgotten
about me
throughout the museum right now
so we just got some food from the food
truck
yummy like how would you take it off
like you'd have to go like over my head
now there's no way it wasn't the best
night of sleep or a bad thing it wasn't
horrible it just impossible to turn and
then the other part of it is you get
these little marks all over your hands
you're literally not alone for one
second it was overwhelming it was cuz I
do like my alone time like I live alone
I like it that way there's so much
compromise involved in something like
this we were sitting at my desk in my
mom Glade do you have any Kleenex and
I'm like no but there's some in the
bathroom but she can't just so I do it
like I have to get up and we have to go
to it it wasn't that bad cuz it's me see
like I feel lucky that I have a kid that
would like want to get attached to me
for 24 hours punch it the time has come
the time is kasher thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
