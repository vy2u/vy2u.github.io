than I do I picked out a tattoo for my
mom and she doesn't know what it is and
she picked out one for me and I don't
know what it is and we're about to get
them put on our bodies forever this is
my first tattoo ever I'm actually kind
of nervous but I think it's gonna be
fine it's an opportunity to do something
with Candace that will be remembered
forever I trust her like she she's gonna
do something sweet yes I'm sure of it
and it's a really big trust exercise
so I feel like I will be able to trust
my mom forever after this so hopefully
you haven't seen it yeah this is my kiss
mark when my kids were little every
morning when I sent them off to school
they all had kiss marks on their cheek
so I want this rainbow and then I want
the font from this one just like just
the word somewhere going like over the
rainbow any time that we were driving
and that somewhere over the rainbow song
came on we'd both feel like belting the
song out so I just feel like any time I
hear that song I think of my mom and I
think of those memories I want to draw
this little gift I want to say be
present she's a big warrior so I want
her to have this permanent reminder I
wanted to get her something in my
grandmother's handwriting she used to
say goodnight sweet dreams I love you to
her every night and then my mom passed
that on to me my whole family says it so
I wanted to get that on her in my
grandmother's handwriting so hopefully
you can do that yeah no problem
cool I'm excited no no peeking
oh no it's not that bad
squeezing you so hard oh you know I'm
getting a tattoo and it hurts a little
bit I mean I just can't believe this is
actually happening
that felt like an ice pick right in
between two folder how do you take
yourself to a beautiful island who
doesn't look like a penis huh oh we're
done that was not that bad it was plenty
of pain so I'm ready for the game now
I'm so scared
can I see it okay let's do it oh my gosh
it is a rainbow oh my god a fish in the
Cassidy oh they love it oh yeah it is
least to sing that oh my gosh oh I
really liked it and those are my actual
lip that's so cool that's my snack I
love it I really do okay hold on because
so far it's just a word and uh oh my
gosh so that's her amber I know that's
so sweet so it now has double meaning
meaning between me and Candace and me
and my mom - I lost in 2011 I love it
listen good idea yeah oh that's cute he
liked it I do actually
oh good and that's that's my box in bo2
did you write I wrote that too
Wow now we got handwriting's from both
our moms oh that's right yeah oh my god
I think my gosh I hadn't thought about
that
oh god don't cry please okay love it oh
good to be on the other side of you on
the other side of the rainbow I didn't
do as I thought I know that amazes me
it really does cuz we had the exactly
the same spot it scared me a little bit
when she was like I'm a horrible drawer
and I drew something on you I'm kind of
proud of it actually ended up I like
this I love it I'm I'm very happy and I
love mine too I think it's so cute
everyone in there mom should do this I
think so too I think it's very much
having to be able to trust and just kind
of be in the moment there is it that's
