sound like a beauty youtuber well hello
there I'm Tyler Oakley nonot I'm Kelsey
Darragh I am a producer at BuzzFeed you
might know me from some videos where I'm
freaking alcohol or teaching people how
to avoid adulthood or trying on various
makeup product so I'm gonna show you my
beauty routine I'm also gonna answer
some of your questions that you
submitted so let's get started
okay well first thing is I always start
with a moisturizer so I'm going to use
tatcha the water cream the thing I love
about this product is that it's super
lightweight so I usually let that dry
one of the questions that I got was
what's like my playlist in the morning
and the answer is I just put on Spotify
daily hits my makeup routine is like the
one time where I get to just kind of
like to meditate and be with myself and
my thoughts so I try to make it really
lacks another product that I love to use
is charge Ready Set radiant this
 smells great I like to just spray
that it's almost like an essential oil
I'm gonna start with my eyes I'm going
to use the Anastasio Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance palette mixed with
the maybe the morphe 350 palette might
as well say this up front all my brushes
are dirty should I clean them yes am I
going to know someone asked about hooded
eyelids a lot of youtubers that I watch
online don't have like the same shape as
me so I kind of had to like mix and
match with what I learned to do with my
eye shape a style that I like to use is
going dark to light I'm taking golden
I'm gonna put it right under
the album someone asks what the best
palette was for the price this Anastacio
palette just the pigment and the like
amount of time it stays on my eyes is
worth everything I'm going to take a tan
it's called burnt orange and mix it with
a little bit of raw Sienna and just go
right underneath that yellow and just
kind of blend it then I'm gonna go
through with a dark brown color I'm
using Cypress umber now I'm gonna go in
with this orange e color this is also a
little bit more of a bolder look but I
like to wear both makeup everyday so
some people would be like oh my god
that's way too much makeup for the day
 you don't tell me how much
makeup I should put on you know what I'm
saying let me just do me now that I've
got this as a base I'm gonna go back in
with a little bit of a darker color and
blend it all together now that I've got
a lot of runoff around my face I'm gonna
go ahead and start to work on the face
I'm a huge fan of color correcting as
you can see like my skin is 70 different
colors I'm very have a very red
undertone I'm going to take my green
cover-up stick and I'm just gonna go
over those places where I'm seeing extra
red today I'm gonna probably blend this
with my dirty Beauty Blender that I
haven't cleaned in like two days
okay so now that I've colored some of
the more red areas so I'm gonna let all
that set because I used to be someone
who would just put all my makeup on so
fast in the morning and like it wouldn't
ever blend and it's because I never
would give it time to sit into my skin
so let me get in
questions are we letting with this fit
for a second do you believe in essential
oils
I love essential oils I put them
on every night I have a little diffuser
and a vaporizer that I put on every
night with like eucalyptus and lavender
now it's the fun time I'm gonna use this
silly blender that looks like it came
out of my bra and I am going to use the
aether realist skin illuminating
foundation it's liquid in the color
light because I am pale as and yes
commenters I see your comments about how
pale I am I don't give a okay so
I'm just gonna put a pump of that on
there and then I'm gonna dab it all
across my face now a lot of people don't
like the silly blender because they
don't think it pushes the product into
their skin as well as a beauty blender
does so what I'll do is I'll kind of
just use this to spread out the product
and then I'll go back in with a Beauty
Blender and really push it into the skin
now I look like a goose now I'm gonna go
back in with a Beauty Blender or
concealer I am obsessed with concealer
and this Tarte shape tape has changed my
effing light it stays all freakin day
I'm talking about through drinking
through sex
there's sleeping all night and waking up
hungover the next day what should we do
next
maybe bronzer I like to use a more
tapered brush I know some people like to
do big fluffy brushes but I like to
really get into my jawline in the areas
with something a little more contoured
I'm gonna use might artiest Pro glow
palette and I'm gonna go in with skulls
and just take a little bit and go
straight from the ear you kind of make a
line down to the outside of your lip and
you want to put the bronzer right in
that line but only about halfway down
that line
I learned that from jacqueline hill we
went to elementary school together but
then i'm gonna come in and just dust the
forehead
what's your eyebrows because that's my
favorite place I use Anastasia's brow
definer it took me years to figure out
how to do my eyebrows I didn't even do
my eyebrows for many years Taylor Cote
13 at what's my favorite primer again it
kind of depends on where my skin is that
if my skin's really dry I like to use
like Smashbox if it's a little Whaley
I'd like to use like the Laura Mercier
primer
hey it's a Liana how do you get your
eyeliner to be right on the lash line
mine ends up halfway up my eyelid I'm
using the Revlon Colorstay skinny liquid
liner so how do I get it so close to my
line well I get really fluffy and close
to the mirror so um I usually start on
my inner corner and just get as close as
I can now that I've got it just to the
corners I'm gonna go in that same kind
of angle where I'm going for my nostril
to the outside of my eye and just do a
tiny wing hey my right eye looks better
than my left but like we can't all be
winners all the time one of my favorite
blushes recently has been two-faced
heart when I saw this on Kylie's
snapchat once and I was like whatever
she is I want I'm gonna take a little
bit more of the OMG side because that's
like what the look I'm going for
pepto cup so I like you mean it and just
tap those apples then I got a little
color in my cheeks I look alive again
and I like to take a big fluffy brush to
put on my highlighter I'm gonna go in
with lit and mix a little bit of lit
with strobe and take it just above the
blush that I've already put on then I'm
gonna take it down my nose and go right
above my Cupid's well I was gonna try
and find a way to incorporate this kat
von d palette in there so I love it so
much so I'm gonna take the pink opal and
just dust a little tiny bit right in
those dark spots this
I use Diorshow blackout it's the only
mascara I've ever used I've used it
since I was a kid because my mom used it
and I just think it's nice and thick it
creates a really bold look Olivia Beals
asked when do you decide to go natural
it depends on the day
I mean people at work sometimes don't
even recognize me without makeup on so
you know I either serve full looks or
you get Bridge troll there's no really
like in-between for me it's really just
like whatever mood you're in don't don't
like just cater to what society thinks
you're supposed to look like and now we
get to do my favorite part which is the
lips I'm going to use this color pop
ultra matte lip in the shade Times
Square and I don't like to use liner
because it bleeds all over my face so
instead I like to use a really harsh
brush and just to draw the matte first
so now that I have that X I know like
the height I need to go and I can just
go in and arch around it
nailed it I'm letting that dry I'm gonna
go in with our FX in moonlight lightly
dust over my cheeks okay and boys and
girls we're going I finished this is the
look it's my mix of daytime slash
boldness so let's call this comfy bold
this is a little bit bolder of a look
then every day but it's not like a dark
smoky eye so this is a happy in between
in this video and one last question
someone asked if you had to choose
between wine and makeup what would it be
and my answer is you don't make me
do that
don't so leave a comment below of whose
beauty routine you want to see you do
next and we will make sure to have them
