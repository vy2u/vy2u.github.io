like my teenager here
Oh see there what up y'all
it's Jasmine I'm a video producer for
boldly and you might have seen me in
some of these videos roll it roll the
reel I believe it guys
I believe it everybody thinks that my
showering habits are very odd I'm like a
porn turn about this oh yeah what is it
I don't I'm here to show you some of my
favorite lipsticks and my favorite
outfits to pair with them and to answer
some of your questions you've submitted
on Instagram let's hop into my closet
come on now so we're gonna start off
with the question submitted from Manders
65 question do you just wake up in the
morning and think I'm a bad bitch now
let's go
yes that is truly how I start every
morning I pride myself on lipsticks and
you guys have asked me about some of my
favorite ones my first one is this
melted matte lipstick from Too Faced
it's kind of like a burgundy dark red
and it's called drop dead read it is
absolutely my favorite dark red to wear
because it's super creamy it's matte it
stays on for ever and it's very
vibrant the outfit that I'm pairing this
lipstick with is my favorite suit that I
got from Elle acquis I match my lipstick
with this suit because I feel like the
lipstick brings out the dark in these
petals this outfit to me is very
feminine yet very masculine makes me
feel bold and confident and like I would
catch anybody's attention alright
another question this one is submitted
from said plant murderer
when did you first realize that your
body was beautiful let me tell you that
body image and body confidence was a
long
long road for me I think I just slowly
realized that like this is me and this
is who I'm gonna be another favorite
lipstick of mine is Hatt Bundy's Roxy it
goes on very matte very velvety and very
vibrant
I love Kat Von D because all of these
products are very vibrant and that's
what I'm looking for
all right now about my lips are set
we're gonna go to another question
this question is from Lally tolls they
ask who and what are your fashion
inspirations my fashion inspirations
come from
Rihanna's and daya amber rose anybody
who's a little bit out of the cookie
cutter mold so the outfit I would pair
this beautiful purple left with is my
sequins jacket I got this from a sauce
and I bought it because I was like this
is a mother statement and you
know who else is a statement in this
outfit I feel the most confident because
this is me this look is me my next
question is from pocketful of paynton I
got a pocket got a pocketful of paint do
you ever miss your longer hair the
answer is no I never missed my longer
hair I love having short hair and
changing it up all the damn time
alright so my next lip is from Sephora
collection called always red this is my
 it is so smooth going on Ike
literally can put this on at 9 a.m. and
will not have to reapply all mother
 day so my next look is brought
to you by a sauce it is a bold color
block to jean jacket my favorite aspect
of this outfit is the nod to the 90s
like I love throwback Street style and
this to me is like perfect and this
outfit I feel very comfortable because
it's generally just a comfortable Street
styled outfit and like I should be
hanging out with The Fresh Prince of
bel-air so my next question comes from
PG Ella what
your skincare routine I don't have one
now it's time for my favorite lipstick
if you know me you know I swear by black
lipstick this is my favorite one it's
from Sephora collection it is called
Nightbird this black lipstick is my life
one because it's not that expensive and
two because it stays on all day if I
could live in one lipstick for the rest
of my life it would be this one next
question a bar for 1/3 asked what's a
fashion style or beauty choice you're
most proud of I think my most proud
moment in fashion style or beauty is one
I wore a bikini to the beach for the
first time I absolutely just embodied
all the confidence that I could I was so
scared but I did it and I hopefully
empowered a lot of people to do so as
well
so to pair with my absolute favorite
lipstick is my leather jacket that reads
girl power on the back I did it my mesh
and my beret okay so I got this jacket
from Target I got my mesh and my beret
both from forever 21 I love the very
edgy / modern look that it gives me it
reminds me of like DW from Arthur maybe
this is what she would wear today this
look makes me feel very bold and a
little bitchy but an inviting bitch so
still come talk to me I am so happy and
so thankful that you guys have watched
me and my closet tour I hope I have
inspired you guys to try out something a
little bit new and to just rock it and
be yourselves every day so I'm gonna end
it with one last question I don't have
the question out just this last question
was submitted from artsy Alex I don't
know how to pronounce your last name do
you have any advice for growing up
surrounded by crazy beauty standards my
advice to those who are surrounded by
crazy Beauty standards is to 100% just
stick to yourself and believe in
yourself honestly you are all that
matters at the end of the day and
whatever makes you feel good is what
matters the most if you want to see more

pointed to my vagina we shouldn't do
