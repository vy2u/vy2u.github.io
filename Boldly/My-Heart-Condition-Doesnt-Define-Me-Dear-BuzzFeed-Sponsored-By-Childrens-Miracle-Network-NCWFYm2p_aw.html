I'm 11 years old I have a congenital
heart defect to charge and follow a
fancy way of saying that I have four
major things wrong with my heart
I have a pacemaker and an artificial
pulmonary valve and adds up September
first I just finished my 11th surgery
averaging one per year it's weird
I found hard to seize my whole life so I
really don't know any different
it's really tough sometimes I fear not
waking up there's still so much I want
to do and now that we're getting older
it's hard but if I'm ever feeling down
you have a rule take a day or two to
feel really disappointed and then choose
the bright side I lean on God my family
and my friends want to need an extra
lift they remind me how blessed I am
with a full life I get to live my family
has never wavered in a love and support
they let me push myself as far as I can
and that must be hard as parents as kids
we don't talk a lot about how we feel
because we don't want to make her
parents sad so please find ways for it
to be okay to share this is why I work
as a junior ambassador for Children's
Hospital Los Angeles if there's any kids
out there like me they're listening to
this just know that the pain is
temporary pray trust in your doctors
lean on your family don't be scared of
the future early on my parents stopped
worrying about what I would be like
later on and they just focused on what I
am right now kids can do a lot and we
definitely live life in the present for
example despite my challenges I've been
able to do most things I like
such as acting playing baseball and golf
like a lot of kids in my position I
really don't know any different this
condition has just made me incredibly
competitive because from the beginning
I've just fought fought fought the
Survivor mode kicked in I don't mind
working hard to get good at something
but my goal is always to win above all
I'm thankful for my life thanks for
listening
