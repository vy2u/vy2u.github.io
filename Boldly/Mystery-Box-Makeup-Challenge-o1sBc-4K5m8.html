eyeshadow palette I'll get us out of
here disable the bomb and we can we're
doing the mystery makeup box challenge
Sunday loosen I don't know need some
mysteries
I fucking hate surprises I'm pretty
excited I'm a little nervous about like
what exactly is in here alright there
are 15 items in this air box and we are
picking out three each and have to make
a full face look out of those three
items all I need is a lipstick I'm all
about those lips so like a lipstick if
you give me a shadow palette I can make
magic happen if I get like three
lipsticks I'm gonna cry well I love
using makeup products for multiple
things eyeliner for lipstick lipstick
for blush makeup glory hall ooh this one
feels like a dildo
it's like ribbed for her pleasure and
this is squishy it's a squishy - we're
gonna pull out the first thing on here
oh I should not have done that
colorful gloss balm and it's yellow
alright I'm grabbing this oh this is the
eyeliner that I use feels cool so I'm
gonna pull it okay this is it hello Tara
all right rub chill it is a jumbo liner
oh that's a later all right I'll go for
this one what is it Oh
all right last Paul what are you going
for a week I don't know maybe not oh I
think this is a shadow
it's a blush I can still work with this
it feels like a bronzer which I also
need oh okay
I'm good with us is that a lipstick it's
a Kat Von D goddamn it at stake
no I feel another Fendi why I have to do
it do it oh it's a wee bit dark we each
chose three products the goal is a
going-out look you cannot swap and we
have to use all three of these so let's
fuck it up let's try this fin see this
is in the color chuckle let's see what
this looks like
Oh truffle on the eye so right now I'm
trying to put the blush on top of the
gloss I wish I had something with which
to highlight this contour is a little
bit light for me so I'm kind of using
anise on Dacian I'm taking this like
pointy brush and I'm dipping it in the
mascara tube and I'm making liner out of
it I'm gonna use this highlighter
you this yeah cuz I'm sure cuz you know
what this is Fenty and if Rihanna told
me to glow I'm gonna go out there oh
this is really pigmented see not so cool
let me know what I'm just to move around
my eyelashes line on it but I have an
idea
really yeah what's your idea I'm not
gonna tell the competition I can't do
the same thing I was like I am high
fashion pink eye conjunctivitis but make
it fashion no I have to fill in my whole
lip with eyeliner it's just like you
think matt is drying and then you put on
liquid liner then you're like this is
actually what drawing is but the
precision you know the feeling of like
when you've nailed something when you're
like yes I fucking nailed it yeah this
is not it okay
this look is taking a turn I'm making it
different you look like a Marc Jacobs
Fashion Show I call my look wanna be
runway I used basically the honest
Tashia lip gloss did the most I would
call this luck you thought I decided to
use this funky beauty as a highlight
that I use this liquid eyeliner to
create my cat eye and my lipstick I call
my luck brunch then disco on my eyes I
did the blush just like hey I shot a
liner look and then I use the gloss on
my lips that's highlighter I'm gonna
call this look harmonious discord I used
this like little colored liner as like a
shadow and then I use this mascara as
liner around my
and as actual mascara I feel like this
really expanded my definition of what
each piece of makeup can do for you and
if you are in a pinch fucking lip gloss
man it's all you need I say there are no
rules in makeup and fashion and beauty
like fuck it we've lived with so many
rules in our lives why limit ourselves
when it comes to our creativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
