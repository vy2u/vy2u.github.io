look like in here I love Thanksgiving
cuz I get to eat alone Jewish I was
never that critical of it until I think
I got older it's the story of
Thanksgiving the pilgrims built barns
from like all the resources that they
totally knew how to harvest were they
they were trying to plant wheat and they
didn't know how good internet I work the
land they get on it fertilizes three
Native Americans came to visit one named
Squanto stayed behind to help the
pilgrims abl withing like corn became a
slave what Squanto was sold in slavery
and that's how he learned to speak
English is he like hi I'm Squanto can I
show you how to cook everything and
they're like sure man I've never seen
him I don't think he's those were
written by Native American the first
Thanksgiving oh my god ha ha we've got a
brown and a pink bird here Oh Oh to a
land that's free pilgrims to land that's
free can free to you this land belong to
people regardless of what you think how
you constructed this idea of property to
fish and hunt to sew and plow they
taught them that's that's true Squanto
is not in this one eager that these are
the people they didn't even
they're not even naming them but natives
are always the supporting characters in
these but this is fall on the East Coast
you think they're running around naked
right now
their jewelry is on fleek though a
Thanksgiving story only representation
of natives is on the last page he always
starts with the pilgrims and their
journey apparently to this dinner to
native men were invited and the women
and children just had to stay at home
like he's wearing on that burger leopard
print
sorry leopards in North America
please show me them Incan mixed with a
caveman mix with like the Flintstones
you know everyone in that picture
eventually was going to war guys like oh
you poor bastard UN you have no idea
what I'm about to do to you
I have a lot of nieces and nephews and I
think about what are the conversations
that are being had in their classroom
about Thanksgiving kids never really
acknowledged that Native Americans are
real Native people are always stuck in
this trope and we don't get to change or
evolve I think it's okay for these books
to be somewhat simplistic they're for
kids but I would like older kids and
adults to have access to more accurate
versions of the story more complex
versions of the story we had slavery we
took native peoples land like you can't
forget that and so when you think about
holidays that celebrate America you have
to think critically about them a few
decades later there was a war between
the children of everyone in this picture
and the son of the chief was actually
beheaded his head was stopped hike and
placed in the middle of the town for 44
years yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
