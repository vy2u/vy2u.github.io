hear baby
you can hear the baby but Oh
hi I'm Nadia and I am a brand-new mom my
baby Evie is five and a half months old
he's five weeks today his day-to-day
routine of caring for a newborn is the
one thing that's really pulled me away
from being connected to my body
basically I always had just some body
issues you know feeling the pressure
it's very hard to carve out time for
yourself extremely hard to do something
for myself there's there's always going
to be guilt attached to that that means
you know not sacrificing an hour to do a
photo shoot so that I can feel better
about my body I'm really anxious and
excited to do this photo shoot
especially for my daughter hopefully she
can look at this years from now and see
you can be a mother you can be sexy you
can do everything we are a BuzzFeed
today I'm about to do a boudoir photo
shoot I'm very excited and terrified all
at the same time no I've never done
boudoir photography before I am
definitely sleep-deprived I'm really
curious to see how I'll feel there's
been a lot of physical changes in my
body my boobs are ginormous my breaths
are very different that makes me feel
sexy but then at the same time doesn't
is knowing what my body is capable of
doing of pushing out an eight and a half
pound baby naturally able to heal
quickly and safely and its really
majestic it's it's just incredible I
feel like society definitely puts a
pressure on young women to be fit and
have a tummy and there's not always time
for that when you're a new mom and have
a baby I'm really curious to see how the
pictures turned out still surprise me
however I think that they're a great
thing to have just to look back on see
like what my postpartum body look like
I'm gonna see the pictures in a couple
days I think they turned out really
really well
oh my gosh Oh
oh my god that's that's that's my bite
that's that's really oh I love that I
love that oh my god that's really pretty
yeah oh wow oh I actually I look like I
look a little bit different than my
daughter but what I love that I I have
no words it's there that feeling of yeah
I'm sexy it's down there it's just been
masked by being a mom and thinking about
a million other things that's why I say
that I'm really hot in that picture I've
you know seen myself in pictures like
wearing a bathing suit but the like yeah
the level of ownership has to be
connected to having had a child
I am surprised cuz I haven't felt like
this so it was it was nice that I got a
day to feel beautiful and that was
captured these photos are amazing yeah
you're a woman for you're always going
to be a woman first so don't forget that
about yourself express yourself in your
body it's just going to shine in all
other aspects of your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
