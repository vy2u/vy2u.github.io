to find out what kosher options we have
on site it's two pages long only animals
with split clubs who chew their cud can
be kosher
the pigs don't qualify because they have
split hoods that do not chew the cud
very interesting animal must not feel
any pain animal rights activist fish
must have fins and scales what fish
don't have been descale shellfish eel
shrimp and crab I love all of those
things meat and dairy products should be
consumed separately with a six hour
waiting period in between a totally
forgot that I had put milk and my coffee
this morning hi there do you have a
kosher menu I'm just gonna have to
settle for a milkshake utensils that
touch meat cannot also touch dairy
unless properly clean for kosher
cleaning Sanders find a clean pot has
not been used 24 hours this doesn't look
like it's been used drop utensils in the
pot of boiling water one at its height
Koecher one can only be handled by
Jewish people this wine is not kosher
one exception is that if the wine is
heated to almost boiling it can then be
handled by non-jewish people why mangies
love to boil this is intense I foresee
myself breaking this I managed to do
this and go back to my roots so I have
now officially stocked up for my week of
keeping kosher with these 12 bottles of
kosher red wine I bought all this food
before we start this video but I can't
eat any of it I didn't know what I was
gonna be able to eat your breakfast but
it turns out these waffles are so numb I
could really just drop to all the
waffles but these toaster waffles are
kosher I loved our boat hoppin out there
hi there do you all have a kosher menu
by chance do you think this food today
is a kosher I don't know it's like do
you have kosher options like dude is it
what are we looking for again
wants to take around indulge toss the
jello isn't kosher I don't
drinking it pushing
Kix are kosher kicks are kosher here's
where I'm struggling almond milk creamer
does not have an O you sign I woke up
really hungover this morning and I was
really craving a pulled pork sandwich I
completely forgot about the whole kosher
thing so here I am we're about to eat
the kosher chicken that Josh prepared so
I just got back from a camping trip
wasn't really anything kosher ice cream
is hard to find kosher so we actually
got Dole Whip little holiday challah
like the worst Jew in the world I just
got a tattoo my Jewish ancestors are
rolling in their graves I think if I
learned anything this week it was that I
do not deny myself was like anything
that I want I would just walk around the
kitchen good no can't eat that can I be
there by the end of it it was pretty
simple like it wasn't like you could go
to a restaurant and even though they
didn't even if they didn't know whether
or not the meal was kosher you could
kind of tell restaurants and stuff I
guess I would try to just eat whatever
seemed the most kosher instead of asking
I think it would have been easier if I
had like a community of people around me
I went to a Shabbat dinner which a lot
of my friends do and I don't always go I
thought it would be a perfect
opportunity a to hang out with friends
and be to keep very easy kosher aisle
props to people who do this I couldn't
do it and you do it every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
