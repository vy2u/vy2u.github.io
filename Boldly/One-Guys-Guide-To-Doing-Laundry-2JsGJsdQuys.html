apartment today I'm going to be teaching
you guys how to do laundry and quick
simple ways I got a few steps for you so
I'm going to teach you right now first
step you need some dirty laundry some
soap a washer a dryer and a good
attitude step 2 now that you got all
your supplies you don't want to have an
empty stomach so get some food in you
dummy
alright step 3 now that you got your
food you need to find a show you can
watch while you do your laundry I like
to browse through Netflix oh friends is
on Netflix now uh-oh we're in trouble
hmm now you're probably tired from
watching three hours of friends so you
need to take a quick power nap so you're
up to full strength when you do your
laundry so make sure arrange is from
like 45 minutes to two hours no longer
than two unless it's like you really
need it also I like to sleep on my dirty
clothes because it provides extra
cushion for me because my bed is not
that comfortable whoo hi I'm rested step
5 check social media because you don't
want to be out of the loop while you're
doing laundry so I'm going to look
through a couple tweets and then spend a
couple Facebook pages and it's weird my
ex-girlfriend Tonya just tweeted
listening to Drake makes me miss you I
mean that's obviously about me Oh Mike
this is so embarrassing step 7 try to
reconcile with someone that you might
have had a fight with because you don't
want to deal with any animosity when
you're doing laundry so right now I'm
going to see my ex-girlfriend Tonya
because he was obviously Stubb tweeting
about me step 7
make sure your breath is smelling nice
when you try to reconcile with that
special person perfect oh my god nervous
oh man uh Justin uh what say hey to my
best friend Justin everyone oh are you
here with Tonya oh yeah
what is this Tonya are you seriously
with Justin with Justin leave her alone
man dad over you know what you leave me
alone I thought you were my friend ha ha
step 8
cut out everyone in your life named
Justin because Justin is suck and
Justin's aren't loyal why would you do
that Justin you're my best friend
step 9 reflect on yourself look back to
the past and realize that no one's
perfect everyone makes mistakes and
friendship is something that shouldn't
be broken up by some girl hey Justin uh

studio apartment I have something to
tell you step 10 forgiveness Justin uh I

situation well I just want to apologize

fine said you weren't strong enough for
