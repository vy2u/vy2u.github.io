Yates who is one of the most well known
victims of postpartum mental illness she
murdered her five children in the
bathtub
I remember hearing about the story when
it happened yeah it was like early it
was like June of 2001 her suffering
really began two years before she
committed the murders it wasn't until
after the birth of her fourth child that
she attempted suicide and at that point
she was diagnosed with postpartum
depression and psychosis about a month
later July 1989 she attempt suicide with
a knife and at that point she's
prescribed Haldol which is an
anti-psychotic so it seems like she's
getting some help some in the beginning
here she comes off the Haldol and she
becomes pregnant with her fifth child
and very shortly thereafter her her
father dies and her psychosis returns in
full force and this time her doctor
prescribed her Haldol because it was the
same drug that worked in her cocktail
but after a few weeks he decides that
the side effects are too dangerous and
he takes her off two days before the
drowning her husband takes her back to
her doctor's office and he refuses to
try Haldol any longer or return her to
the hospital it was clear that her
husband didn't know what to do because
he did the one thing he should have
never done leave her leave her home when
were with
yeah and you know as she tells it now
she waited for him to leave her work
because she knew that he would prevent
her from harming the children and then
she just went one by one and she laid
them all out on the bed next to each
other and she called the police
immediately because she knows was gonna
be perceived as bad right
so Android psychosis was extreme visions
she heard voices when they asked her
during like a videotaped counseling
session with the state psychiatrist did
you think it was wrong before you did it
she said she did not and the reason she
did not think it was wrong was because
if she didn't do it they would be
tormented by saying and she called her
husband he told the crowd after the
first trial that his family was let down
by the mental health system which i
think is very telling in terms of how
sick she was this is the person who
first of all lost the most and should be
the most unforgiving she spends her days
now living her life just like in a
mental into mental institution
she has like full cognizance about what
happened what happened you know you look
at someone like Andrea and you think
she's a monster because she killed her
five kids and that is a pretty
horrendous monstrous thing to do ray
yeah obviously but I look at Andrea
gates and I have a great deal of
sympathy for her as a postpartum
depression survivor you know I think the
most important thing to realize about
what happened to the Yates family is
that it was entirely preventable yes
almost 20 percent of moms suffer from
some form of maternal mental illness
right and obviously 20 percent of moms
don't hurt their babies so you know by
comparison postpartum psychosis
this like incredibly rare conversion it
is 0.1 percent of births
you know I it's been six years since my
daughter was born I still want to have
more kids I'm still terrified and
understandably so you know the one thing
that that I know is that like I'm
putting my mental health first this time
yeah you have to you really you do you
have to you know we need to teach moms
that it's okay to ask for help yeah we
know young moms are the most selfless
people on the planet and like sometimes
you need to be a little bit selfish
there's no happy ending no tear is that
a story I mean you know the kids are
gone and nothing's gonna bring them back
but ultimately she she should be
released her ex-husband believes that
she should be free I think a lot of her
doctors probably believe that she should
be free but I don't know if the world is
ready for Andrea Yates to reenter it
