something that not everyone tells me
they're breastfed if they're breastfed
sometimes they will go I'm gonna say two
weeks between pooping and that is it not
an exaggeration but the thing is after
two weeks hold on to your hat cuz it is
like the idol wave of fecal matter like
an infinite play-doh factory it's like
Pompeii yeah he has a blanket that he
loves is loving and it was the only one
he had and we lost it
we lost it in our own we turned the
house upside down three times and and I
didn't know what to do he look he seems
pretty cool now but don't let it fool
you it was a disaster who's right at the
end of the night and he cannot sleep
without his blanket take it from us get
more than one get two three or more is
really safe I was gonna have to take two
different flights by myself with the
baby she was super tired
she just started falling asleep I had
heard that it was best for their ears to
make sure that they have a bottle or
something to suck on I'm like you know
plants her feet I'm like sticking my
finger out here and trying anything I
can do to get her to wake up I didn't
want her to have a meltdown
I might have meltdown there's this guy
sitting next to me takes off his
headphones music you need to use your
nail and just kind of run it along the
bottom of her foot and little tickle her
and wake her up it worked
it woke her up she starts jiggling and
she took the bottle she was in the
backseat of the car and she stuck a pea
up her nose it was up there and even if
I squished it or did anything it wasn't
happening and I was freaking out I'm
like what am I gonna do am I gonna go to
the hospital look so we pulled over to
the side of the road and I come back
over here gonna start doing this and she
did it and we practiced and the thing
came out and I was just so grateful
teacher trial for two blow their nose as
soon as possible not just because they
might get sick a lot but because they
stick things
there it is so painful you just were
crying and crying and sighing I think
somebody in our mom group had said oh
well you know you should try using
something with chamomile tea I'm really
yeah sure okay but we tried it we took a
washcloth we soaked it in chamomile tea
and we put it in the refrigerator so
that it was nice and cold on her gums
and she wasn't crying and fussing all
the time I'm telling you you gotta try
it you were so happy yeah it's true
what's the worst thing that could happen
how could this be the worst experience
of my entire life but now it's easy we
got this on lockdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
