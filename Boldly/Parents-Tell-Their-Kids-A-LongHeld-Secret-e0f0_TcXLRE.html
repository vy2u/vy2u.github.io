right okay
she's gonna think I'm super dorky or
it's super weird or she's not gonna want
to know anything about a relationship I
had it started before I had Alex but may
or may not have continued after Alex
she's probably gonna be really grossed
out well I hope she'll be a little bit
surprised it is maybe something a little
out of character from what you might
think about me your dad was my first
thought it was one of your boyfriend's
with like the cool name that you'd never
forget no no no no interesting no it no
it was your dad and we were in New York
and we were in a discotheque in the
disco in the discotheque everybody did
that oh okay well it was in yes it was
everybody met up in the women's bathroom
[Laughter]
we get that no it's not never gonna
forget that you know how after I had
your brother I was in a bad accident
skiing it was before you were born
yeah and I had to have a knee transplant
they had this huge screw in my knee and
so when I got pregnant with you for some
reason I should have known better the
screw started to come undone when I gave
birth to you it was either the screw
comes out first or you come out first
the screw came out first and I've kept
it all these years and I haven't looked
at it since so it's been many many years
so I brought it for you today it's to
see I don't know if I want to see this
way oh my god even in the same container
you fit in that container you know we're
gonna take it out I want to do it this
is the biggest that was in your bus was
in my body this is a nice size screw
here a touch it no thank you
no I'm good I love you still though good
just so you know I love you too okay I
once got fired
for using the computer the internet at
work actually to look for another job
that's a new bit of information good
look you know periodically at work on
the net for another job and he called me
one day and said you know if you don't
want to work here that's fine you're
fired
I never knew who was fired from anything
know that I was married before right I
married your dad you also know that my
ex had a daughter you did get to meet
her once okay um but what you didn't
know is I actually maintained a very
close relationship with her when she was
little I used to take her to Disneyland
yes every year on her birthday
and when when I was splitting up with
her father she said that she was very
upset she was young and she said does
this mean you won't take me to
Disneyland on my birthday and I said no
I I will keep taking you to Disneyland
what were you ever gonna tell me
probably not if this hadn't come up
this kind of makes me happy because I've
never been fired from anything before
and now I know that my dad has been and
I think it's really funny singular
emotion flabbergasted I think that
people should tell each other everything
I think that it creates a healthy
relationship how about if we call Kimmy
and the three of us go to Disneyland
yeah let's go all right I'm gonna take
you up on that okay if it has to be on a
weekday cuz I hate crimes and life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
