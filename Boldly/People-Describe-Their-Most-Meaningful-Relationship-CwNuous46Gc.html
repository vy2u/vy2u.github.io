for my niece for my sister my wife for
my kids my ex this is for my parents to
cheese balls with extra cheese he's my
role model overcame so many obstacles in
his life and really made something out
of himself it's okay to be 100% exactly
entirely who you are even at five months
she has personality traits that remind
me of me and my mother and my sisters
our childhood wasn't always easy and we
didn't have a lot of consistence in our
lives but we were always there for each
other which was really important I
always try to practice unconditional
love
give me a foundation of love upon which
to stand
I've told more things to him than I've
said to my parents
I always think before I speak and in
everything I do I try to make them proud
I love you so much I don't know how I
could get through a day without you and
I'm so glad that you were my sister I
miss her a lot and being away from her
my family just makes me realize how much
I love them and I love her I'm so lucky
to have married the most amazing woman
who complements me and makes me a better
person so thank you and everything I
just said not doesn't even come close to
how things really are
my sister is the one person I can 100%
effortlessly be myself around which is
so rare to find it in another person and
so hard to find another person family
over everything go I don't think you
guys enough for becoming increasingly
open-minded as time goes on and thereby
increasingly supportive my kids are my
reason for existing they're the reason I
get up in the morning they're the reason
I work hard to succeed and they're in
loves in my life I just think that your
first relationship is very special and
you will still take a lot from it even
if it doesn't last forever because the
time that we did spend with each other
was really really nice
