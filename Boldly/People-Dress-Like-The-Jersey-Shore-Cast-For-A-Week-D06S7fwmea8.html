week we are dressing like cast members
on Jersey Shore it was a guilty pleasure
of mine I've been rewatching Jersey
Shore as of late we all kind of dressed
similar to them they just took it up
like several notches and it just made me
think like man what if I wore that
clothing now I selected DJ Pauly D Laura
selected Snooki and normally I'm used to
wearing like just plain black t-shirts
that's what my closet is full about
black and gray usually I feel like I try
to dress in a way that I just blend in
it's definitely gonna be outside of my
comfort zone the Hat it's like why is it
sideways
I just cannot be a part of having my hat
to the side but I just cannot do it this
belt is like 10 pounds on its own I went
with one that's kind of in-between like
it's not the most outrageous one but
it's definitely outside of what I would
normally wear don't you lost the bet or
you're in between LA Bobby do I have to
vote in a city election today what is
gonna make me look the most professional
yet still Snooki yes oh yes on the days
when people didn't say something to me I
was like really hurt by it poor people
thought that I was just marrying
bedazzled glasses so at the same time I
didn't want them to notice have you like
tucked your ear into your head yes
why'd you do to make myself as incognito
as possible you're sure yeah it's a
thing it's a thing I think you're doing
I do want to say that I didn't hate that
sure you need to keep it it'll be back
in Thailand
yeah any guesses as to who I might have
stolen this outfit from or like someone
from the Jersey Shore hit three meetings
- I do think anyone's going to take me
seriously I guess we will see her shoes
what's wrong my shoes they look like
they're grown up ah feel my dog
legitimately thought that they were dog
she's not yet realized that it's not
alive when I took it off and it bounced
on the floor she barked at it so but
they also were like kind of cool like
I'll probably wear that I like the boots
I actually wore the cargo shorts this
weekend so like that makes me feel a
little bit better to know which is where
I was taking things yes so I was
actually worried initially about wearing
the black tank top just because it's so
like maybe too casual I know it doesn't
look great
and I'm not like a professional looking
individual right now I was super
comfortable that was actually probably
my favorite out and ahead when you were
coming inside
I was super comfortable - I was wearing
huge hoop earrings a big pouf and a
dress that barely covered my vagina
um not sure this is what it's supposed
to look like oh that's like I don't
normally so were there mm would you wear
this for Halloween dressing so freely
and kind of taking a page out of
Snooki's book was kind of fun like she
just doesn't give a and that is all I
aspire to be a lot of the time I'm I
question like wearing certain stuff
that's hardly as crazy as that was and
now I'm just gonna be like I'll just
give that a try I wanted to wear
bedazzle glasses and a leopard print
dress tomorrow I could I won't but I
could
