super excited to try Ethiopian food we
know somebody who said this is our
favorite genre of food I feel like it's
gonna be a lot of beans I'm surprised me
Ethiopia
like a quick plate smells good I love
the texture I feel like this could be a
can app Caen you got to unroll it like a
fruit roll-up this is it's also kind of
like the material of a mousepad from the
90s just tastes a lot like sourdough
bread it's sort of what I imagined a
whoopee cushion would taste like okay I
don't know what he's doing I'm rich were
like up that looks like sloppy joe so we
just grab it like this I was wondering
why there were no utensils yeah somebody
told me this was chili I wouldn't
question them oh that's my Z know what
spicy oh wow sneaky spices like I ate it
and I was like I'm fine I'm fine
whew that's war those are beans those
are fire ants can't take all the tinking
ah you can take all Hey Midwestern
throat is not doing so well some too
much um fit fit that's not all I mean
this just tastes like chopped up
tomatoes and peppers this just looks
like salsa so good took a more hearty
ceviche I dig it Jessica Ashiya that
sounds like a girl from Brooklyn put
your own nose in hey what oh there's a
bone in there yeah it's a little bit
more Vimy it wasn't as flavorful as I
thought it was gonna be kind of just
tastes like the I don't know like the
meat it's like a meat with a thin Demi
glaze of some kind of like apple sauce
consistency sauce can you lost me on
that one
now what if when you're done you just
roll this up like this little burrito
you know you can California s and Cali
let's make a burrito out of everything I
like that it's family style yeah it
seems like it's a good shareable
experience for more than one person this
would be like a fun hey let's go on a
second date
mmm let's grab let's get dirty with it
yeah I feel like if we all could just
carry like a roll of this around in our
purses I mean this is fun look at that
