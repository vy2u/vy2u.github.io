rose-colored glasses like all I'm seeing
is that she's attractive and I'm
forgetting like no she was a difficult
any
I'm you talk to your ex and they're with
someone new you always think wow that
could have been me and I could have been
in Florida playing rugby no I would not
be playing rugby just realise that
