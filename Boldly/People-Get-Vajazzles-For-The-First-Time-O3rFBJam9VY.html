really busy I just hope he hooks down
and takes mercy on my vagina so I'm here
today to get a vajazzle but I don't even
totally know what that means so can you
break it down for us yeah so first you
would have to start off with getting the
wax taking it all off or if you want to
leave a landing strip
so we clean up the whole entire area and
then we get our crystals and then we
just apply it to the skin let it dry you
have it so the crystals already come
with the glue so we just go in and we
just paste them onto your skin I'm about
to make an incredibly poor decision I've
never had wax near my vagina I've had
waxes before I've never had gems on my
vagina before am I afraid sure people do
this all the time so it can't be that
bad here we go I forgot to tell you that
I'm on my period which I've heard makes
waxing more difficult just a tad bit
sensitive great I'm definitely a little
self-conscious right now this can't be
worse than childbirth okay I'm gonna
lower my leg I've got wax on my labia
and now I don't know what I'd like to
feel anymore oh grandma extra sensitive
time of be a woman Candice Oh let's sing
some Disney butt skin is so sensitive
I'm a basket
I've been waxed and now it's time for
jazz Alang these are lips but jennifer
is going to take them and form them into
an arrow for me you know I might go for
the red heart that's cute I believe this
is a pair of lips I was told wait does
this involve more ripping no the artist
does that work oh that looks like it's
jazz length I mean I'm not an expert but
jazz with that look yeah that looks PIGE
as maybe it would be better if we just
stop down got this red line of gems
going down are we having landing strip
yeah a red gem landing the stripped it
doesn't feel like anything
it's really quite mild well that was
nice and your pajamas done and it looks
wonderful now I have a red line of gems
just going straight down oh I'm a little
secret going around people won't know
and my friends won't know until they see
this video and no I think it's
interesting I'll keep you posted on how
it feels in my pants later so I just
revealed myself to my significant other
and she was less than enthused thinking
about having a vajazzle is waking up
image as alike going to exercise and
really thing you have a vajazzle
so I'm sitting at work right now I found
a piece of my Jaisal on my leg don't
know where it came from don't know how
it got there but uh it's a gentle
reminder about the hellacious thing that
I went through a couple days ago I don't
know if it's something I do again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
