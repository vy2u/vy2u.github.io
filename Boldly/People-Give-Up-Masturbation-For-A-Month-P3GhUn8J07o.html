blue no that's just my balls I think
it's gonna be difficult to not
masturbate for him but I absolutely
mastery every day typically once when I
wake up and once after I work out I
think it will be really hard which is
when I usually start but I like
challenging myself I'm gonna completely
like dive into my work and it's always
interesting to see if you can actually
kind of change your habits like kind of
break it so here we are night one so far
so good no I'm gonna keep me down I hate
this here's my bed oh my vibrators from
right here oh my god the worst part was
going to see Magic Mike we just saw
Magic Mike
we had to mop it up gay 3:27 more to go
a little Ted stop it is important to a
pool party right now I feel like there's
other parts of my life where I feel like
I can have a little bit more like mental
strength a little bit more resilience
really stressed out feel like my mood is
a little bit more irritable lately sucks
I do feel better but I feel like I'm
quicker to be uncivilized right now it
really sucks because I am jonesing to go
alright so I don't know how many days
has been stopped keeping track I just
felt like I turned into like an animal
and I had to like fight these urges
workout a lot more getting in shape I'm
eating a lot more ice cream and pizza
this is the hardest thing I've ever done
miss you it's finally okay well I feel
accomplished
I am master of my domain if you want to
learn how to master your mind and body I
highly recommend giving up masturbation
for a month so no I would not do this
challenge to snow there's no reason I
mean if you really want to learn
something about yourself go live with
monks learn some in the mountains I
don't recommend doing this again I think
you should be able to masturbate
whenever you want unless it's in a
public place that's just weird
we should be in tune with our sexuality
and whether that that's like self
pleasure or pleasure to others you know
that's something that we should be in
tune with I a hundred percent have a
greater appreciation for it just because
I didn't realize what a role
masturbation played in like being a
healthier nicer person to other people I
want to challenge you Internet are you
master of your domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
