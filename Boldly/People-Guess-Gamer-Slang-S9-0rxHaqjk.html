know nothing about games I don't play
games
hiding or kidding glass cannon is my
first thought is dildo a bunch of
glasses like flying up someone's I had a
fragile yet dangerous character glass
cannon is a character that has high
attack power but low deep has no stamina
usually it's your magic users this is
like tanking up like when you drink a
bunch of joke Cola to stay awake all
night so you can keep playing if you
think someone's ship just one video
gamers the point tanking is an action
reformed by the tank a very strong
character with high stamina it purposely
takes the brunt of the attacks leaving
everyone else to do their own thing
sort of like Groot cross play I'm
playing you but I'm in Tennessee and
you're in Michigan so we have cross play
because we're playing across the country
like when you're really cross and you're
playing you play with somebody across
the world is that what it is
merry cross play is playing a character
opposite your gender it's a combination
of the words cross dress and cosplay so
I think a White Mage
is someone who is really old and white
and does white magic but they're just
like oh I do White Mage what you call
your mom when you want more Mountain Dew
or Cheetos this is the mage that heals
you because it's white and white means
good and that means you're an angel
White Mage probably the most standard it
most important character in a game their
job is to use magic to heal people
kiting is when you've been playing video
games for so long that you've got gnarly
pit stains and you've got to keep your
arms up like it's a kite when if you
like jump off a building and again I
would say this is when you take one of
your members you tie them to something
maybe fill them a little helium and then
go up so they could do like a scouting
kind of thing hiding is a hit-and-run
tactic you use the ticket enemies right
where you want them yep
reeling them in
the cake is a lie if something like the
other team you're playing is trying to
look cool faster on you something was
disguised as something and then led you
to die I think this is a reference to
the game portal the cake is a lie is a
reference to portal in this mega popular
game you are forced to solve puzzles
with the promise of a chocolate cake as
a reward you never get the cake it was
alive that's why when things don't go as
promised
gamers always say that cake is a lie my
mom would not let me play video games as
a child because she did not want her son
to become an Asian nerd so she told me
that video games would give me thumb
cancer so I was afraid to play video
games as I thought my thumbs would fall
off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
