from a bad day
you

hashtag pancakes for dinner you ask I'm
allowed because I also took my
multivitamin hashtag young-adult I'm
surprised that I publicized this shame
I sometimes wish I had a tail so I could
wave it around like a kitty or on
people's faces but then I realize how
creepy that would be you know god I'm so
lame but I do wish I still wish that I
did have a tail can't wait for my chin
to come back what does that even mean I
said dog I'm not even playing anymore I
will fight you for this corn dog hashtag
Disneyland in my defense the corn dogs
at Disneyland are really good and I
think I was just really hangry one
retweet though it was my sister but
still when I was eight I saw my friends
but and because of how pale it was I
realized she must be very very sick
turns out she was just white white
people have very pale butts that was not
something that I'd ever seen or
encountered before why is there two
dollar bill in my pocket a sincere
question I wish there was a two dollar
bill in my pocket you know what's good
with this cake Deez Nuts no idea when I
wrote those or why you used to be
beautiful and now you're ugly thanks
grandma oh that smell my grandma ha ha
ha you used to be beautiful now you're
ugly well my nose job was her idea so
you grandma
waiting for Kanye sucks this guy was
like all of these are just me
complaining like that's out like that's
the only stuff you add just me not
liking what's happening when you look
back on old tweets you just realize
you're stupid that's just what it is you
just realize you're an idiot dad did you
actually try to fight someone for a corn
dog in Disneyland and I'm gonna say yeah

fight someone for a corn dog
