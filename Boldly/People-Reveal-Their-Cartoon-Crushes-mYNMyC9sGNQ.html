Roxanne equally as much as max I kind of
just wanted to be a part of whatever was
happening there she was a cartoon
version of Topanga Peter Pan pissy Cole

home and handling his that's what we all
need in a man get it flush they're just
thinking about it Lola from Space Jam

on the toon squad behind Michael Jordan
who's the greatest basketball player of
all times people have often told me I
look like this character but I always
had a thing for Brock from Pokemon you
can cook for me any day Brock Trent Lane
he was probably a STONER but still
pretty intelligent Trent lion was a
musician you had piercings and Tad's

trying to tell you it's like you can't
be smart and smoke weed you totally can
troubles always sleep - so that's the
dude you call like late at night light

underwear outside of his pants

for some reason and he took off his
yellow shirt and I was like hallo
mammoth a yellow hats been a hot friend

in Sleeping Beauty where Prince Philip
is being captured by Maleficent and I
