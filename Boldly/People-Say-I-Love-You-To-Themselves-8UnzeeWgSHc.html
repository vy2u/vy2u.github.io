something might be in the ball
I got snatched from my desk and I have
absolutely no idea what's gonna happen
oh cool that's nice
so I love you don't usually say that to
myself I love you I love you I love you
ah thanks me I love you but weird I love
you I love you I love you that felt
pretty strange I don't think I've ever
said I love you to myself I've never
even thought it no I've never said that
to myself it's weird because you don't
often tell yourself that you love
yourself even though you probably should
that's just such a strange thing for me
to think of doing like telling them
telling myself that I love myself three
words I love you is a big kind of thing
when I first saw the paper I was really
uncomfortable to do it and I had to
force myself to do it but it was nice
it's confronting but it was kind of nice
it felt good it is something that
probably you know has a strong message
and we should be doing I think everyone
should love themselves and you know I've
kind of preached that to everyone else
so I should definitely start with myself
I think if we all did that more there
might just be a little bit more love in
the world because we maybe would have a
bit more value in ourselves if you don't
believe it then it's hard to imagine
someone else you say it to other people
all the time but not very often that you
look in the mirror and say it to
yourself I think it's something that we
should all probably do it more often
you're pretty good way to start the day
I think it's good to remind yourself
that you you just need yourself and you
can love yourself on your own and I do
love you okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
