you're like waiting they're like should
I move my face closer and look at your
mouth to indicate that I'm gonna kiss
you so I met this girl online on a
dating site and we decided to have a
meet up for a first date and it went
terrible she drove me back to my place
and I just wanted to leave but she was
like yeah I really got to use the
bathroom
you know use your bathroom so she goes
use my bathroom and I'm waiting there
for a while and homegirl comes out
butt-ass naked she's just like Oh Mike
get the hell out of my apartment you're
done that's it I'm not being nice
anymore and that was the end of that
when I was 15 I met a boy at a party and
we went on a date to the beach and we
ate pizza and we sat on the water it was
so romantic
and then he was driving me home and I
started to feel really sick like really
sick and I was like I can hold it I can
hold it in just get to your house you
can do it and he stopped at my gate to
like punch in the gate code and I was
like nope and I opened the car door and
just puked outside of the car just puked
and then closed the door and was like
hmm so anyway like he wasn't gonna
notice what just happened he very
politely dropped me off at my house and
did not I met this girl through a mutual
friend of ours and I asked her if she
just wanted to go out to eat and as soon
as the food got there I realized that
she was like the loudest eater on earth
to the point where I was not paying
attention to a single thing she was
saying and I snapped out of it for like
one second and I just like blurted out
yeah I agree
and apparently what she had said was I
need to lose weight so there weren't any
more dates after that one so I was on a
date with this guy and it was going
pretty well and then we got into like a
really intense conversation and he was
talking about how he had some issues
because at one point in time he had
broken his penis and it wasn't quite
fixed yet and I said to him you know
that's actually like a really big
problem you should probably get that
checked out and he just looked at me and
he said yeah you know maybe you can
remind
to do it you know tomorrow or the next
time that we meet and I was like I don't
think so and I never called him again so
I really like this girl and it took her
months to agree to go out with me on a
date and so the date goes really well
she invited me back to her house
beautiful house she bakes like cookies
and cakes I'm just like this is a dream
this is like the best date ever and out
walks her sister to go to the
refrigerator and we briefly make eye
contact and then I realized that we made
out at a party a few weeks earlier after
making eye contact with me they made eye
contact with each other it went to a
room they come out giggling and that was
the end of my stay at their house no
kiss for old pizza Bute breath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
