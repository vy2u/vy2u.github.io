picture before I was five I had snot
going down my face with a kool-aid
Mustang I remember seeing the sea
sickness bags on the way in and being
like not gonna need those wasn't
anywhere else for the vomit to go except
directly into her face when I was a
little kid I had strep throat and I told
my mom that I hated the medication and
then I wouldn't take it and she forced
me to chew it up and swallow because she
was like sort of holding me cuz I was a
tiny kid I didn't have anywhere to go
there was no escape so I just kind of
like open my mouth and flung out matters
and I remember very clearly that it was
like super red and chunky because the
medication was red and they've been
letting me drink kool-aid all day one
time we were watching movies at the skid
mark house and I don't know just like a
lot of candy and it's like roughhousing
away teen boys sometimes do and I don't
know how this happened but someone was
like I'm gonna just take off Henry and I
got tickled and just my response and I'm
ticklish person I was just to throw up
everywhere and the vomit was the vomit
was black one time in class I just I
just wanted to get out of class I was so
bored I get the idea that if I try to
swallow my tonsils that will cause my
body to induce vomiting he tried to
swallow your own consoles enough you
will vomit and I vomited a little pile
on the ground and they sent me home man
so I was about to do semester at sea
which is when you live on a ship for six
months and study abroad and you don't
know any of your classmates when you
start your shipmates and so we're
standing around and everyone's talking
about being worried about being seasick
and we're going to be on a boat for six
months and I
told everyone I never ever get seasick
I've been on a lot of cruises I never
throw up really really playing up the
fact that I never throw up and even to
the point that I was like when I need to
throw up I can't throw up so we're in
the beginning Assembly orientation and
there's like 700 people lined up and I'm
sitting in the middle of the middle and
all sudden I start to feel queasy and I
look around being like everyone west
confusion that's right like this isn't
normal
I'm the only person who looks even
remotely sick so I get up in the middle
of our first assembly start walking out
and I'm thinking maybe I'll make it
maybe I'll make it they'll make it I
reach the end of the row and like
projectile vomit all over the place and
like 700 faces turn towards me and it's
like you can't hide it there's nothing
you can do it was like yep and the girls
just pulled up in front of everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
