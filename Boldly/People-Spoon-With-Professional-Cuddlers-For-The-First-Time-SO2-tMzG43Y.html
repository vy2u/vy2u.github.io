to cuddle
I feel like cuddling is a very intimate
thing that I don't do with strangers
very often they told us that they were
gonna give us some professional cuddlers
to cuddle with and my body is ready I
love cuddling with people I try it
sometimes if I'm inebriated or I'm
feeling like confident like oh hey I'm
surprisingly fine I love cuddling
I love bodies right on I can be very
physically affectionate with people that
I have a platonic relationship with but
I have a hard time cuddling with people
that I have no relationship with at all
I think I'm pretty good at it
I've got like pretty firm thighs and
buttocks got some pretty good shoulder
action going
a good color is someone who is full of
unconditional love and affection towards
any human being I just think maybe it
would be somebody who is emotionally and
open most people when they think of this
they immediately go to like the Crete
like there's a creepy quality to it and
what I observe as somebody providing the
service are people hungry to receive
touch so as you can see here this is an
agreement that a typical client would
look at but first thing you'll notice is
that it's a non sexual experience which
is sort of different for people you know
like on a bed with a person you think oh
it has to be sexual but actually will
stay totally rated G I think I'm more
used to cuddling by the light of like a
TV or like a my bed with my boyfriend
you feel very exposed right yeah I do
I very much do would you like to thumb
wrestle um is that a type of cuddling
cuz I'm so down we call it companioning
this is called companion yeah this
position is called Fayed sitting next to
somebody okay so would you like to be on
your side okay all right you get comfy
get comfy and I'm gonna come around you
okay is it okay if I put my body against
yours okay so I'm gonna do that can I
put my head on your shoulder
like everyone has different needs and
for some people they just need like you
know someone to talk to and hang out
with I I feel like physical touch with
other men my age group is really
meaningful to me and I never touch men
of the generation older than me like it
never goes past a handshake it makes
sense to me because they just simply
might not be ready for it
I feel like a sister growing them and so
like I love it when people play with my
hair it feels like like it's like having
a sister feels like having a sister I'm
feeling okay at all very relaxing it was
yeah did take me a while to sink into it
just because I'm not like that
comfortable with touching strangers the
entire thing was I mean the cuddling was
a big part of it it felt like the
conversation and the sort of constant
communication and caring for one another
was more what it was about I feel so
happy that was so nice I feel like we
went from like strangers to best friends
like that I came in here as like a cocky
little thinking that it was so
confident like yeah these people can't
faze me but when I'm you're actually
being held by a stranger it's a it opens
you up to a lot of like truth
it's here it's here
what get it
there there's a very high I got it yeah
yeah you get it it's here quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
