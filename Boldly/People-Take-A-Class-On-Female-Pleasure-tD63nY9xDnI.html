video couldn't have come at a better
time come at a better time
yes is a team of researchers filmmakers
and educators who are passionate about
making an honest practical resource
about women's pleasure they conduct
research across the world on sexual
pleasure and publish their findings
online videos and learned everything I
know from friends who are like did you
know that guys come and that was like
the most shocking thing in the world I
grew up in like the you know everyone
had Instant Messenger so it was just
like it would be you know part of your
conversation online and like a chatroom
so weird I learned so much from porn we
had one of those TVs you have to like
physically turn the dial and change it
sometimes if you turn it in between the
dial you might pick up some pawn it was
like Yale for how not to have sex I
definitely think I said I had more learn
about sex whether it's with sex or
anything in life I have no shame
admitting that I have more to learn I
can be pleasure so many more ways and I
need I need to know so I think as a 27
year old open up all the books show me
all the videos like please let me learn
shall we watch this video sure if you
going and stopping is an important
ingredient for a good orgasm this is
well shot did cinematography this is
fantastic
I get that okay this one 0-200 real boy
just going into it the details are just
very specific she's talking first-person
and then all of a sudden right to click
I didn't know it's things like the
success I like this this is great have
you tried this
hey little self-care Saturday I've got
my clay mask first of all let's get over
the fact that like women masturbate it's
a thing some of us do it some of us
don't I do it often tonight was the
first night and I guess I practice
something called edging and it was a
thing like I honestly first of all feel
right now like I just had sex which is a
great feeling because no one else is in
my bed except me I thought it was really
cool how oh my god yes had you hold up
the term these cool terms to describe
certain techniques that we might have
already been trying but didn't even
realize it I'm about to try digits ro
inconsistency so she was telling me what
to do now
go slower I love how interactive
consistent thank you I think I won so I
just tried the pulsating with a
different rhythm and at first I was
really nervous and like freaked out and
scared because I was like in my head but
then once you get into it and you
realize like wow this is really exciting
and turning me on because it's something
different and new for my body that it
hasn't done yet I am surprised by how
even though this website provided
step-by-step instructions on how to try
something new it wasn't technical and if
something doesn't work they offer other
ways of trying right there are also some
things that we just like didn't like to
extras like okay fine with it that's
like what they kind of make clear the
old times like yeah not everything's
gonna work but you won't know until you
try it's not like homework that you hate
it's homework that you can that you
actually enjoy because you're having sex
when I figured out what I liked I just
stuck with it and I never thought to
like try anything new because I guess I
didn't know what anything new we've done
some of these things before but would
have no idea how to even discuss those
things
be like yeah it likes that thing you did
because you didn't know what the
terminology was for it for the most part
what I did really learn from this was
like how Sookie communication is in now
like as a guy don't be afraid to ask
questions I am definitely going to use
oMG yes again because it just opened my
mind so much it takes time I'd be happy
to use it with a partner I think it's
also a really nice resource to just have
by yourself I'm surprised that this
hasn't been around for longer I think
it's weird how
in our culture everyone's having sex but
is afraid to talk about it like if we're
having sex we shouldn't feel weird
talking about it I mean I think this is
like necessary for people this thing
costs forty dollars just to have better
sex sounds like a good tax write-off to
me personally
