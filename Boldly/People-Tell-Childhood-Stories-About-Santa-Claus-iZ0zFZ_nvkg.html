30 years old and I still believe in
Santa
the one thing that proved it beyond a
doubt for me there was I lived in a spot
with a lot of snow have a very big yard
and I remember one Christmas we woke up
and I don't know why we went outside but
we had to go outside for something in
the middle of my yard was a giant sleigh
track and in front of that reindeer
hoofprints and like three feet away from
any direction whatsoever so that you had
to like fly into the middle of the a the
only explanation is flying into the
middle of my yard and landing obviously
we would do the mall Santa Claus I would
go and tell Santa what we wanted for
Christmas and there was one time when
Santa called my dad by name and he said
Chris good to see ya and we were all
like dad how did he how did he know your
name and he was like the magic of
Christmas he remembers when I was a kid
I was really anxious and I was awake to
wait for Santa Claus so I went
downstairs to check at the Christmas
tree and it was nothing so what I did
next I went upstairs I went back to my
bed and you're like okay I need to go
back to sleep but of course as a kid I
couldn't so I would like 15 or 20
minutes like really really try like okay
you know what I'm gonna check again 20
minutes later of course I went
downstairs I'm riding there it was a
bike and some videogames from some stuff
for my sister's and it was the whole
couch and the whole Chris down the
Christmas tree was full of presents like
how did that happen when I was a kid we
did everything we could to try to always
catch or find Santa and when we did try
to stay up and we did try to catch Santa
every time without fail we'd always fall
asleep and then when I woke myself up
because I missed him again I would hear
sleigh bells outside my window when my
brother and I were really little
we were fighting like cats and dogs
right before Christmas time and I don't
remember what we were fighting about but
we were just old Lent less going at it
and my dad finally said that's it I'm
calling Santa and so he went to the
phone on the wall in the kitchen grabbed
it just dialed it up and he goes Santa
this is Randy Gordon here I have two
misbehaved children that I need you to
speak with and my brother and I jaws
dropped speechless
could not even believe that dad got
Stan's on the phone that quickly he
passed the phone to me and he called me
five years old scared little
five-year-old talking on the phone with
Santa and he's telling me I have to
behave me were angels the rest of the
year so I would wake up in the morning
and I would legit see like muddy
footprints all throughout the floor and
they were like these big footprints they
had like chunks of dirt like an actual
boot imprint so that's how I knew Santa
was there and I still believe that the
reindeer landed on the roof and
sometimes I would see actual prints like
hoof prints in the house as well so I
was always a little weirded out there
was a giant animal in my living room
Santa's definitely real he's a spirit
that brings joy and can be embodied in
everyone and anyone
Santa is what compels you to want to
spend time with family to want to give
back to the community to want to be and
share your life with people that you
love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
