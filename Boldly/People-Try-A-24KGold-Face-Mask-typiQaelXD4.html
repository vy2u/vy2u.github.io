it's it's avoiding eye contact like
don't look at yourself you're not gonna
like how you look avoid eye contact
don't do it in front of a mirror today
we're trying to 24 karat face masks
I've got a few face masks in my day done
some magnet stuff done some normal soap
stuff but certainly never put gold on my
face I love all things skincare also
love naturally occurring minerals so I
feel like this is gonna be a fantastic
combo I think it's gonna be pure gold
like in my mind it's just somehow like
hot liquid gold going on my face but
it's probably just like speckled gold in
a white I'm super excited I am the kind
of person that doesn't really spend
money so I'll probably never experienced
anything like this outside of this room
it's in a gold box I love the box me me
new zone I don't know if it's actually
French I just feel like when something's
this fancy have to say it with a French
accent I was told there were
instructions there right I don't know
what to do whoo it's been proven to
improve skin's elasticity texture and
tone and peptides whatever those are
this mask apparently helps with radiance
and anti-wrinkle inge and it renews
yourselves there's like five paragraphs
of information what this gold will do it
face who cares put it on my skin let's
get gorgeous apply the corrected anti
wrinkling mask and massaged into the
skin
it smells like hotel soap very soon
it smells like rose and like smoke or
something on top of the mask gently put
a gold leaf one for each cheek cut the
leaf with scissors put half over the
forehead half over the chin is leave the
gold on your face for 10 minutes
important do not touch with your hands
directly on the gold leaf touch only the
soap paper this is very
there's some weird reason I'm like okay
they're sheets of gold I can't touch
them not really sure how I'm supposed to
peel them off oh my god feels so weird
it's so war wouldn't feel like the
energy of the gold oh wow wow oh my god
okay that side very seamless don't know
what I did there you know I feel kind of
ridiculous but I think that's a pretty
common feeling here at BuzzFeed you
asked me like would I do this again I
would probably say no cuz I'm not quite
sure what's happening I'm gonna eat some
of this gold this girl is just gonna go
to waste
doesn't want to stick to my skin but you
can eat gold so now that it's been on my
face long enough it's time to say
goodbye to the gold take off the mask
wet your fingers and with a circulant
massage the gold into the skin I can
feel my skin getting tighter the longer
I wear it I feel like this is gonna like
de-age me when I take this off I'm gonna
be a 14 again just kidding that would be
awful
cut out a little gold bits oh wow it
just melts away feel so soft under the
water like I expected it to kind of like
feel really rough it's gonna make my
face like sparkle I feel like a golden
like zebra or something like my skin is
showing through the class well this
doesn't look as good as I imagined it
did it just kind of looks like this
dirty gold all over my face you tell me
who I liked hotter do I look more rich
they look more expensive I definitely
would say that I feel refreshed I also
feel like my skin feels more elastic
than it did when I came in here and also
has a nice shine feels like my face is
really soft and moisturized beauty is
all about making yourself feel good and
that gold made me feel great
sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
