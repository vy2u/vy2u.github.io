sleigh like this is what you would use
we're trying Caitlyn Jenner's Mac line
I'm expecting like maybe ma these maybe
like blush the colors are gonna be a
little bit more toned down because one
Caitlyn is a little bit older so you
know she's not like stepping out and
like blues and and two just for
this to go with everybody's skin tone
and to like vibe with everyone I feel
like there's not going to be anything
like really flashy
it's all gonna be really like subtle and
just like universal pretty it looks like
a gold medal maybe that was like the
idea behind it all the glow that
beautifully bear oh that's me like at
home I feel like nice a nice warm shower
you know and then it's like a good idea
but I feel like they're all Santa Claud
oh yeah that's good so I feel like it
should have an on button this sounds
compassion everyone's super cute we look
at the goal oh that's really pretty oh
yeah I just look like a little sunkissed
look oh this is pretty
Oh buddy oh it's a duo get it buddy
ha ha ha I'm not really a blush girl but
it's a pretty color
blowing gold mmm really really this
eyeshadow pop and honestly I love it
right now I'm using Malibu bronze and
I'm kind of liking it
I'm called Teddy that's like a teddy
bear I like the color like it looks like
oh no okay that's different I like this
I think it's amazing that yeah the
makeup industry is having this big right
it's including everybody I feel like
this is more than just like Caitlyn
Jenner makeup I feel like she can make
like an empire out of us like I feel
like this is a good one it's like The
Naked 1 palette like it has all your
stuff and then you need that 2/3 smoky
12 I just think it's important for for
the trans community to continue to have
barriers broken so I definitely think is
progression in the right direction with
everything is happening I think right
now so I just say thank you so much to
all those trans women who are really
surviving and inspiring them to the
offender glider thanks to Caitlyn for
really taking our message across the
world because that was hashtag
aggression in the right direction
hashtag bossy hashtag China makeup
hashtag we're so fly
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
