cuffs that was not me today we are gonna
try facial cupping my mom actually runs
an alternative wellness spa so I really
grew up getting cupping and acupuncture
I've never done popping in my life I
just know people get those weird bruises
on their back that are circles it slap
it onto your back and then it's just
like slowly just suck your skin into the
cup cupping is actually used to detoxify
the body and people traditionally get it
done on their backs I have a little bit
of attention so I hope the facial
suction will hopefully just kind of like
take all that bad energy out of my face
this is an at-home facial cupping set
lure beautiful skin doesn't come from a
jar
it comes from massage cupping good to go
targets fine lines wrinkles I care about
that I care about that deeply headaches
sinus congestion facial contour collagen
elasticity and reduces puffiness this
sounds like a facial mask like in
hyperdrive if a little plastic dildo
thing makes me look less old I'm here
for it there's two large cups for the
cheeks forehead chin and there's like
the cute little baby ones for the eyes
and the lips I'm gonna sexes kit start
with an antimicrobial facial brush to
gently cleanse and exfoliate the skin
for the face who are using the larger
cup you begin at the base of the ear and
then move down the side of the neck is
it working
my trip will be at you know those like
sushi that's like half alive and we put
the soy sauce in it and it just like
face I wouldn't field like place cup
glide glide it's not gliding is like
thoughtfully as I hoped
that way unicorns
then it says flash Cup I think that
means to it fast oh that feels weird on
the cheek
come on you got to work the job suck the
double chin out what are you doing just
like put this on your forehead oh yeah
this is nice
this is supposed to be for your sinuses
wow this feels kind of good well that
actually makes me feel really like
sleepy I do feel a little more relaxed
yeah it just feels weird it makes these
really weird sounds and I feel like it's
just draining do you feel that one yes I
do
there you go facial cupping was a wild
ride y'all that was quite easy quite
simple but we need to talk about that
cuz I don't know what's happening there
I think I got in a fight with my facial
cupping and obviously one it's like
getting on with blood rushing I'm sure
something is happening under the surface
I just don't know if that's my favorite
way to go about um
skincare we'll say I feel a little
relaxed I don't know maybe it's the
product maybe it's not but I'm feeling
way more calm than when I started my
face does feel looser and more relaxed
but that's also because I'm not sucking
the crap out of it currently but yeah
it's fun I like the noises I like that
it's a little little fart sea noise I'm
like patient zero of the zombie
apocalypse and they're like sure what's
wrong with your face but I'm like I know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
