fair or handsome I'm actually going to
be trying out three weeks of fair and
lovely
I see four bowls of God every day to get
whiter I remember seeing all the friend
lovely ads where like if a girl was you
know she got fair and she went for an
interview she'd get hired immediately I
never believed in fairness creams
because I didn't think that a shade card
would decide what kind of a person I am
if the cream has existed I suppose it
brings out some kind of a reaction if it
does work then I guess like I mean I'm
just making a lot of family members
happy when I went to buy this even the
shopkeeper looked at me as if to say hi
to model a banana through your chore
today daughter o face and neck and
massagin it is clearly not for people
with a beard kinda works like foundation
I just feel like I applied some makeup
this thing says for tough male skin as
far as I'm concerned my male skin isn't
even all that tough this cream won't
stay on my face because it is so hard
putting all the cream was a bit of a
pain because it kept rubbing off oh it's
nice yeah yeah and it makes me smile we
are in the process of two days or dog
has tried biting me and I've developed
fever so I can very safely vouch for the
fact that it does not contribute to good
luck in any way it leaves like this
white is ladder I think that's what
that's what people think is making and
fair and this one other time I thought
is looking fast when someone said hey
your face looks white and I said really
and they said no there's something white
on your face what I meant I don't they
have been using around my neck for these
days so does that mean that like my face
is gonna get really fair my next curvy
like super dark there is no change not
really on my first day before I put the
cream I took a photo of myself see you
look the same I think for a lot of
people is just a placebo effect where
you think you become fair but honestly
your
the same I didn't think these products
made sense before I use them I've used
them for a while now and I still don't
think they make any sense I think people
use this cream because this company
targets people with insecurities and
feeds on it Shahrukh Khan who used to be
one of India's finest actors endorses
this cream if you continue to endorse
such to people who really
believe it's true because they are your
fans of yours I think you're really
misleading them fair is not the only
thing that's lovely not can be lovely
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
