new makeup line at least six days a week
every day I wear some form of makeup
every single day
oh never I feel ecstatic about a
gender-neutral makeup line I think it's
something that has been long overdue I
think it's pretty cool what could this
mean for somebody like me I already
obviously subscribed to the idea that
like clothes and makeup and all these
different like Beauty things can already
be genderless to see a brand finally
embrace that and create something that
is gender non-descript i think is a huge
awesome step forward I feel like makeup
doesn't have any gender is like just
like a football doesn't really have a
gender makeup don't have a gender either
hi I'm Shari Davis I'm gonna be helping
Danielle create our makeup look today
using a thatha's Beauty line I'm down to
be a cool looking Prince a new love boat
i but a colorful boat and i want to look
like a unicorn like fresh out of the 90s
I would describe my style as polish
urban makeup it's fun with a confident
booster I would say my style is
eccentric out of the box I like to play
with gender norms and color I would just
describe my style as like androgynous
street wear so are you ready to see her
look yeah I'm ready to see myself Hey
look okay whoa oh my god I am just
glowing I would tell my younger self
don't be afraid to try new things and
step outside your comfort zone and be
your own beauty and style icon oh oh you
know what you're doing now it was how my
younger self to not let anyone judge you
for wanted to wear makeup and just do it
it isn't bisexual superhero I would just
tell myself to keep trying things I
figured out my style through just like
continuing to try different things
if you're a man and you're kind of like
thinking about dabbling in makeup I
would say you really should go for it
and if you're a man who's never thought
about trying makeup I would say you
should go for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
