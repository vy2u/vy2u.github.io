1995 so lush just released their
Halloween collection I honestly have
never tried a bath bomb I'm your typical
like Walgreens girl you're going to take
a right here I'm kind of excited to try
these yet I feel like this stuff is a
little overrated for me I haven't really
tried anything more than shower gel to
me if Heaven had bathtubs lush would be
everywhere everything they do is magical
every bath bomb I've ever tried is
magical I just feel like this is going
to be magical in the most Halloweeny way
lush here we come what coming for your
Halloween edition y'all oh gosh we're
coming for ya Oh
scrub-a-dub-dub y'all
we are about to try the ghost one which
is supposed to make the water like
completely white and creepy-looking
drop that just drop to the bottom
this is underwhelming and this ghost I
like not a thing I guess that makes
sense that you neither is this bath bomb
this smells good really be honest it
kind of feels like an old bad all right
after taking a few selfies on a scale of
one to instagram-worthy
a seven doesn't get a glass of wine nice
filter boom making bitches jealous dark
it's like I put my hand Minnesota the
smells are pretty consistent like that
dark spiciness on a scale from one to
instagram-worthy I probably give it a
seven whoa it looks like it's changing
colors like the seasons
oh wow if you think spring turning into
fall that's what it looks like but if
you think puke that's what it looks like
in person this looks really cool but in
camera kind of looks like pee so I have
to give it like three but everything
else is on point
everything else is maybe nine
all right so I'm going to try out two of
these lush products first one is bath
bomb
oh wow this is giving me Halloween let's
see what will happen if we have a little
pumpkin sparkle to this okay that's kind
of gross just kind of feels like
Halloween threw up and about no I'm
having like one jeez I didn't do that it
down if I'd rate this on a one to
Instagram where these scale do things
going will give it a nice our last
product is called monsters balls and
we're gonna have a ball take a bath
together whoa it smells so good
this is my favorite smell yeah I'm into
this is really relaxing this van is the
bomb
on a scale of one to instagram-worthy
what would you give this bath bomb I
would give this one a ten for sure
so we tried blushes back bombs I feel
like this is perfect if you're not one
of those people who like
trick-or-treating
blush I love you I'll always love you
blush we haven't known each other for
long but we're on a good start
lush I love a good theme and more
companies should be doing more Halloween
themed products blusher buzz whoa look
at you have a Santa on a way to lush
she's bright blush she's wearing blush
I'm adjusting lush yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
