I want to eat what he's eating so that's
why we're here just spitting falling I'm
gonna say it's a mix of Latin and
Mediterranean well you lived in Spain
for a while do you think it's similar to
Spanish I would guess I don't really
know what to expect
bring it on Portugal
what is it it's a pizza sandwich I made
like pepperoni pizza very meaty hmm I
don't know how many different kinds of
meat there are in there but there's
quite a lot every single type of meats I
have it your way
if I choose I love it this I would have
again I quite like
everything looks good on that except for
the fish all right ravely disagree yeah
it's so salty and good sardines where's
that I thought it looked really good
until I realized that there's a sardine
on top for Portugal it's not as bad as I
thought a lot of flavors that I wouldn't
normally think to put together I mean
I've had showers before with eggs I
haven't had styles that also have
potatoes and sardines in them but I get
fear into fish this is this is gonna be
tasty
I'm in love interesting that's like
breakfast lunch and dinner
it's our fish in there yeah there's fish
in there damn it not what I was
expecting
still delicious but now expecting I was
kind of expecting like an omelet II eggy
consistency yeah it's very fishy it's
like a quiche with fish oh it's hard
oh wow sorry no I've been dry okay mmm
that is really good it's like a doughnut
but better I'm gonna keep eating this
you go Portugal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
