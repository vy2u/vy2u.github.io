Fenty here trophy wife today we're gonna
be trying sephora's most popular
highlighters and excited to try
highlighters cuz they look fun I like to
wear it if I'm going out of it this one
like a little pop on my cheek I'm not
wearing calendar right now because we're
about to do this but normally I'm like
blinding people I'm really excited to
try on these highlighters
let's get sparkly hourglass ambient
strobe lighting powder I'm just excited
because the box is shiny which must mean
the highlight is shiny
it's silver but the package is bronze I
wish it was bronze bronzes kiddo this is
quality right here half an inch of
space here that could be more
highlighter it's a little messy there's
a lot of shimmer in this I feel like
it's really gonna pop it goes on pretty
easily I can't really tell okay I don't
hate it
I could live with this I don't know if
it's gonna look good on me looks a
little too it's a little female on a
scale of one to ten I think affair six
six six one she's like no stars this is
Becca holographic I have Becca's likes
an wood foundation and I lived by it
until since he came around so I am very
excited to see what their highlight does
I'm loving the packaging on there all
right Becca see you oh it's pink I look
like a mermaid I feel like a mermaid
okay no no no no no I'm looking like a
13 year old at a slumber party
I like Becca it's subtle but it pops
this isn't my bad necessarily going just
awful like the pinky purple one I would
say like eight out of ten packaging is
like cotton for sure I'd give this a
seven teen Becca and a stodgy yeah hello
kit shudder does it taste like sugar oh
my god this is beautiful like four
colors marshmallow gumdrop butterscotch
starter I really just kind of want candy
Sam I'm hungry thinking we're gonna try
starburst I think I'm gonna go for
butterscotch
I think I'm gonna do marshmallow I'll do
gumdrop the only thing that's missing
yeah this one is a lot better you can
actually see oh yeah that's like
whoa I actually really like this one
whoa yes I want to try marshmallow
that's bright
like Matthew J am i glowing like an
ornament right now I'd probably get
butterscotch like a good like eight if
it had a mirror nine out of ten eight
out of 10 all the way honest Asya all
the way yeah I don't know how much of a
fan I am about these specific powdered
highlighters they were cute
but they were like not colors that look
good on me
that hourglass one I feel I got on par
with the others definitely try before
you buy I would definitely buy the glow
kit you get four
what more can you ask for so I'm
obsessed with it and especially for the
holidays I think it's like such a great
look to just put on and like feel like
you're glowing or you can look like a
Christmas ornament yeah like me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
