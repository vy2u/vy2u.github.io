hold it I can drink it right now I used
to get a new kid this is the childhood
and I'm doing the same thing after 57
years no change my name is on shoe I was
born in M debod India
I came to America like 25 years ago the
passion from the very beginning was food
is food and must be foot right I'll be
putting them over there so this is
really cool the farm is beautiful yeah
very excited to be here pretty cool farm
got all these interesting animals mixed
together I'm a huge meat-eater
I love me I'm very excited to taste some
new things I raised them for meat right
but I love them too
this girl is so I got her for milk she
never gave me and she just maximum she
gave me this much let's go below she's
one of the most spoiled wanna hear the
very reason is the way it should be
raised there is enough food for
everybody enough fresh water for
everybody enough space for everybody
living like a king no I'm just learning
like a follower the bottom line is the
meat has to be here coming from a
healthy happy animal
I raised my animal I you know Florida
eat them sell them and have fun
I don't know exactly what we're gonna be
eating I actually asked the farm owner
and he wouldn't tell me he wants us to
guess after we eat it I saw some
peacocks over there I have no idea for
eating those but I don't know how I feel
about that
so yeah I guess we'll see just take any
piece that is a good piece this is a
good piece okay I can't actually say
I've eaten a piece of meat without
knowing what it is before so I don't
knock me like a penis or something on
hmm if a piece and just manages like
that nothing that bum okay yeah that's
incredible that's good it just falls off
the bone that's like the most tender
flavorful meat I've had in it in ages
this an animal that I would see here in
America yes it is unlike is any animal
yes I met today in your phone no no it's
like something small it is more but it's
not a burger no he's not at work is it
like a wolf all right you were talking
about the boat I'm gonna figure this out
I'm gonna crack this case he's a beaver
mysteries yeah he's so you loaded it was
really good thank you it was delicious

know like hold my hands it's a big
sausage I'm nervous

it's a very big sausage so it makes me
thinks it's like a big animal

squirrel did it once swim it's so juicy
my problems bratwurst is always so dry
this just it pops in your mouth
Oh God look like exploded the casing on
it's really good it's a strong casing

awards thank you thank you great go
