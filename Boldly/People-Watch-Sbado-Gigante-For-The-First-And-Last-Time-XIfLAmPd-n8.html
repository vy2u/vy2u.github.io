background at my grandma's house when I
was like a little kid but no
recollection of that
sabado kee huntin something big giant
Saturday I'm half Mexican and I have
never seen this show before Oh chocolate
de Letran picked that whoa ok so first
first glance they have some crazy
outfits on this dude is dressed up like
a Power Ranger this guy in the mask is
so scary
some kind of ninja ok now they're all
dancing she's just singing and dancing
oh my god a lion just came out of the
cave holy
what the lion comes and takes away the
bad singers and eats them this Power
Ranger dude is their version of the
Apollo broom guy that brooms your sorry
ass hostage when you're sucking it up
and then the entire crowd chants yes
it's just that it's gonna get what I
mean like it's you know it's
entertaining I get it this lady's like
Fran Drescher they're having some kind
of disagreement but they're all smiling
or maybe they're just speaking very
enthusiastic Spanish it's fun it's like
I interactive play along at home show
you never know what's gonna happen so
some dude and drag just came out posing
as a janitor for some odd reason and now
there's a stroller on stage it's just
like a lot going on I'm speechless why
are they all acting like this is so
normal no one in the audience everyone's
just like this
well that's a lot of kids the format is
like a round table but it's a bunch of
children so they're behaving like
they're in kindergarten and they're like
oh down for easy school like call on me
all these kids seem to be under ten
years old so that's pretty funny that
they're so serious this chick has some
hard opinions on love she also looks
like a miniature woman had motions and
everything she's like uh-oh he's just
been trying to get in for the last like
two minutes and she's just not having it
costumes in the show herself ahead look
it's the charm of it I guess they are
small it's a lot of young women and way
older guys I'm not sure what pills he
gave this guy he's an old guys so my
mind's immediately going that they may
be boner pills but I'm not sure
someone's having sex the next door the
time she's spent in the room with these
two men have her tired look super
Pacific they had some weird like
multi-generational threesome I have no
idea what just happened I guess admit
all my expectations now think about it I
thought I was gonna be loud I thought
it's gonna be exciting it was really
interesting it was really colorful
it was very over-the-top like it's a big
umbrella this show and you can kind of
just throw in whatever you want I mean
I'm really sad about it for for the span
of community especially if you grew up
watching the show or you know if it was
kind of like a way the family gather to
spend time together on Saturday night I
mean I know nothing will be able to
replace it but hopefully something can
sort of come about for the generations
to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
