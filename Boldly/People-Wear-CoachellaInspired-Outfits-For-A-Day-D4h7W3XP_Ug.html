stop sneezing it might be that I'm
allergic to this shirt from 1989 or that
I'm just severely allergic to Coachella
today we're trying to see if we can find
Coachella outfits that we can wear just
not at Coachella because we aren't going
jelly here bitch over there Coachella is
iconic for its fashion tons of friends
tons of flowy tons of flower crowns
it's like hippy meets gypsy meets naked
katella's not really my vibe I've never
been and I never will probably go but
I'm here to find a look that feels
different for what I normally wear I'm a
Cali boy born and raised so I love
Coachella I went three years in a row
usually when you wear something on
Coachella it's like a statement piece so
it's gonna be fun to wear something like
that around the office I feel like our
office just like a little high school so
everyone's like those new clothes I have
never been to Coachella I would go if I
could do it like a rich person the
essence of Coachella style is just like
being carefree and it's also about like
being a little naked which I'm not
against but I don't really do it work
and we have our special guest behind the
camera Lindsey to
I just like shopping that's why I'm here
so we're gonna visit three different
locations that people who go to
Coachella would probably go to Coachella
to get no challenge
I feel like with Coachella in the past
I've been a little too noisy with my
outfit choices so I kind of want to do a
little bit more like I'm gonna come wear
on the office look cool but also not be
a thirst trap
oh no no not that hey what's up okay
Sigma I like the colors I think it's
great very flowy very nice very dad very
good it's like hot dad you're gonna get
cold too so you're gonna want a jacket
later I love this this is the best
outfit ever I want this outfit I got my
looks and I'm feeling really good I'll
see you tomorrow for know chela I gotta
go back to work I'm heading over to hmmm
now hmmm has a line that's specifically
for Coachella see how it goes
you'll get really close to p√°gina de
territory
I don't know wearing a bra which is very
cute Ella day dreaming about when I
couldn't take this book off I think
my agent M trip went decently well I
have an outfit that has a little ass
cheek showing she's hot mostly now we
are going to go to Melrose which in LA
is that iconic Street where there's tons
of high-interest stores basically we're
going to spend a lot of money to look
like you didn't have spent a lot of
money let's go we're sitting in a
parking lot this is very uncomfortable
here beauty blogger now get used to it
oh my god oh my god
it looks so good it actually fit I
actually really do like this jacket it
just probably too hot I knew going in
that I would not be able to fit into a
lot of things I am very happy with what
I ended up with which is a really
 cool
Bon Jovi shirt from 1989 our shopping
day is over my feet are tired I'm gonna
be exposed tomorrow and I hope that
don't judges me too hard
we'll see
I've got my outfit on I'm naked
hello what do you think of me so what up
research check out my Coachella inspired
look today
I am weirdly surprised at how many
people love this look
it definitely holds on I think that you
don't look like you but I think it's a
great look I'm personally a big fan of
the knotted team I think the skirt makes
your hips look great this is like your
inner dive bar karaoke ladies the
responses I've gotten today have been
very positive I really like it and you
look really pretty it's really well put
together I'm too scared to face people
looking like this I'm taking the
elevator literally everywhere I go
someone would actually worry about to
work through I'm not gonna list the you
on camera other than myself be able
gorgeous this is something I can wear
around the office someone even said to
me sun's out guns out tasteful thirst
that was a rule okay except like my
original Bon Jovi 1989 shirt shirt alone
was $150 now what 80 bucks
130 130 dollars shut the hell up
it's from 1989 so am i you know what
it's your life it's now or ever
you're not gonna live forever we are
matching you're just overall maybe if I
told you I got this
good will why I love it you're one of
those people always has good luck in
thrift stores
tella looks are not for nine-to-five
jobs so I just went to the bathroom for
the first time the fringe fell into the
toilet water
this isn't made for a working woman the
CEO of our company is literally right
here
it's gonna I'm gonna no mind our hotel
outfit we did not mean to come to work
panelist please don't call HR I think as
the day is gone on I've become more
confident wearing this look at that
elevation is really something that's not
me at all I guess it was nice to step
out of my comfort zone for a day and
embrace the coachella by wearing Cotto
looks for a day was really fun
I found myself dancing a lot more than I
usually do the wild crazy Coachella look
should stay at Coachella but I am a fan
of having pieces that you can manipulate
and wear to Coachella but also wear in
everyday life it's a different look that
I've never tried but I appreciate all
the effort and time that goes into a
Coachella outfit I survived but I can't
wait to take this thing off
another guy tried to talk to me about
Bon Jovi because of my shirt which is
truly my worst fear but what happened
today and I was just like yeah living on
a prayer good good song ladylike is
