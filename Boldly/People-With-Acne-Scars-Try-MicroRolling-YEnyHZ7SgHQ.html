Duff was wrong over the next two weeks I
will be micro rolling my queer rolling
is a circular tool with lots of tiny
needles on it it's good for fine lines
or textured skin like pock marks and
hyperpigmentation I had pretty bad acne
in high school up until like the end of
college acne has always been a problem
for me almost any picture I see if my
self all I can see is these red marks I
feel like there's no hope for it at this
point if these pock marks go away and
I'll be interesting I just hope
this works first step is to wash your
face so I'm gonna go do that
my face is cleansed step 2 after cleanse
is apply a serum I'm not used to so many
accessories I'm just gonna concentrate
really on these areas here now it's time
to roll a bunch of tiny needles on here
so everything we're just gonna try it
you can definitely feel the needles
doesn't hurt feels kind of good
did you forget that you're punching a
million holes into your skin I think I'm
done in terms of the areas I wanted to
cover now for some more magic theorem
now I just feel like I'm doing an art
project alright I think I got all the
spots my pretty yet I feel very happy
and accomplished now that I've done it
once it's really excited to see if this
improves the condition of my skin over
the next two weeks seems like it's gonna
be worth it I know how insane it sounds
and it's only been like 36 hours but it
looks better to me it's probably just
because I really want it to look better
got everything ready serum first mainly
gonna concentrate on this part I think
I'm gonna try my nose this time what if
this really did clear up my face
completely what a game-changer so at
first I couldn't tell if the scarf
actually looked better or if it was just
psychosomatic but I think they've
actually gotten a little smoother my
wife Kate seems to think so
I just said that I thought your face
like this this side looks smoother you
think it looks smoother to be challenge
is almost done
this side has lightened up quite a lot
I'm gonna make roll roll this morning
mom what do you think of the condition
of my skin right now your acne scars are
paler they're lighter I noticed that
already today all right so I've done two
weeks of micro needling we can still see
the scar then this light is actually I
can't look a lot worse but I think it
looks better so after seeing the after
photos it actually looks a little better
than I thought it did particularly under
makeup it is way less noticeable so I
think that over time it would probably
lighten up even more my wife Kate
notices and she likes it so that works
for me I really feel like it's better
than before I'm glad I might paroled and
I think I'll continue micro rolling at
least for a few more weeks to see if it
could get even better my verdict thumbs
