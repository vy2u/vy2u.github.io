hatch
my main skin complaint that I have very
dry skin and it gets like flaky
especially around the nose and like chin
area so I have a combination to oily
skin and sometimes it gets dry in the
winter and then it gets really oily in
the summer I tend to get a lot of acne
specifically right here on my face when
I wear makeup I tend to break out I
don't get all the makeup off so then I
it gets you know it's a little dirty if
I'm not wearing a full face of makeup I
tend to cover up my acne with at least
concealer I have a feeling that the face
shield patch will be kind of a gimmick
no I'm an optimist so I'm gonna say it's
gonna work my skin will feel less
irritated and less itchy
it smells like disinfectant but not
strong and a nice plant it smells clean
it's nice and wet this feels like a
facemask so we tried it with a brush but
it ended up not working so we're just
gonna put it with our hand it feels like
when you got a cut and you put a nice
antibacterial thing on it goes on very
smoothly it does feel weird right now to
think that I'm gonna put makeup over
this very refreshing so I'm gonna put it
on not the whole half of my face but
rather just specific areas that get
especially dry I've heard it peels a lot
and I want to give it like the biggest
shot it can have Oh No
driving so fast it's very stiff it feels
like the hair is glue on my face it is
blending over it but it's weird because
it really does feel like there's
something separating it from my skin
like it's kind of gliding on it it's
going on pretty smooth like the
foundation is in plumping up it's like
making my skin look drier the colors
looking pretty normal still it even
gives it a nice glow now it's really
coming up I think I might be getting
just a little bit more coverage than
from usual it's kind of already coming
off not really happening for me I do
look a bit more yellow on this side I
think this would work if you had
blemishes in a place where you don't
really move your face a lot like if you
had a blemish on your mouth it'd be kind
of a little messy and and start to peel
but my blemish on my forehead is doing
just fine
maybe the moisturizer isn't like
interacting with the product well or my
skin is already too dry feels still a
little stiff like a face mask I think
this is all I'm gonna do
going into the world I just applied it
five minutes ago and it looks like I
have dry skin so I actually hadn't
realized that I was peeling this much so
I'm just gonna get that off right there
there's actually no pain whatsoever what
do you think of my luck who are you it's
not working so I'm just gonna try it in
the problem areas that I have like right
here and right here I have my acne crazy
it feels nice mmm that does feel so good
no I can't do it I haven't it you know
maybe you might get it to dry people are
like really staring at me I think it's
cuz my skin is peeling like a snake
so I just replied and so far so good
I'm out eating lunch and this is how I
look right now
so it looks like applying in I just has
been way more helpful I'm
and it looks like it's really not just
straight it worked for the first couple
of hours and then it ended up coming off
right here like on this spot where my
mouth isn't moving too much it's pretty
solid for me it was not great I think it
might be more my skin you know it's very
moisturizing it's coming off the color
of my foundation when I take this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
