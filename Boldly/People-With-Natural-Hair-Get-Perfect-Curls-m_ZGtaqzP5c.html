and I'm gonna get my curls diagnosed I
hope you better learn how to take care
of my hair at home so I don't need a
hairdresser I'm curious as to what hair
type I have because there is so much
online about like 4a 4b 4c I think I'm a
3c what's like the proper way to really
like diagnose your curl tight usually
when you don't have a lot of moisture in
your hair your crust shrinks a lot so
dehydrated equals tighter curls yes and
motorized rise means little girls Wow
so what kind of curl do I add now from
what I'm seeing I feel like you have
between a 4 C and a 4 D but in the same
head of hair you could have 5 different
types of girls use warmer water instead
of hot water using super hot water it
dries your hair more I guess my biggest
question is how can I maintain my
moisture without necessarily having to
wash it two or three times per week and
just refresh your curls with a spray
bottle okay condition of that okay the
first thing I like for curly hair do use
a sulfate-free shampoo so what is salty
is it urgent
what it does is taken away your natural
oils and is drying your hair more it's
the same thing as our skin when it gets
drier it gets more tighter I never
thought to compare hair to skin but that
makes sense like when your skin is dry
it's like tight I can't smile we're
gonna do the no fool okay
but every time you wash your scalp with
an awful and mobis massage your scar
okay
the Builder buster it's a deep cleansing
surgery remove
you're going to press back to life he
removes everything that shouldn't be
there now we're gonna talk to the
conditioner started from the ants and
you work your way up it's really easy
for you to detangle now because you d
tangled with the cleanser first yes
and when you work with the conditioner I
want you to work in small sections
mhm so instead of like just ripping your
hair through like this to detangle I
want you to start massaging it then you
could run your fingers to and start
detangling but make sure you start all
the way from your roots you don't need a
comb the best confer you hear is your
hands train yourself to do everything
with a shower especially when you do
wash and gos twist out it needs to be
out of the shower okay
good wash and gos do it everything in
the show when I'm conditioning it how
often should I be conditioning or deep
in this no my hair curly hair is always
thirsty for moisture so if you want to
condition it as much as you can please
do so and it takes really good care of
his hair so ladies take notes now here's
why what should I be doing to make sure
that that's what that looks good the one
I take it out you can use a comb just so
you can smooth them out a little bit but
it has to be super super gentle okay for
my opinion the last the better you don't
need so many products they embrace your
hair what is gonna help you is the
massaging in your hair and a lot of
water I just want to show you how
beautiful and to find your curls look
after all the massage mm-hmm you see how
there's no frizz all massaging the most
doing the twists are instead of like
using the comb too much because when
you're massage that you really get to
make those products it way better in the
cuticle and set up just on top of the
cuticle what I detangle I have quite a
bit of shedding a good amount of my hair
comes out in the shower which is like
alarming sometimes is that normal that's
kind of pretty much normal
so you see how your hair is pretty much
almost 90% right right so we're gonna
use a dryer you're gonna use it exactly
how it is you're gonna need to use a
diffuser because I want you to kind of
like focus on your root just right your
root out if I were doing my twist out at
home what I think is sit under the dryer
could I just do it at night and just let
it dry overnight most of the time when
the girls do this they do it overnight
or if you have a dryer like that you can
sit under the dryer some girls they
really like to use a boil I like the
miracle from if you wanna have a better
control of the baby hair on the side you
can use a little bit from eight oh my
god I'm always and I can show my baby
hairs so when you open the twist - make
sure you open them pretty gentle I'll
add I'm gonna place few clips in her
hair so we can get a little bit more
lift helps your roots to dry quicker I
Drive like this curly hair is like the
gem - you are with them the better
results you are going to get want to do
this at home and be a little bit more
quicker you can use a diffuser this is
the divider fuser you can just hold the
diffuser around the hair without
touching too much because you create
more frizz so halfway through drying do
that and then instead of like keep
touching it too much with your hands you
just flip your upside down and just give
a good shape
I love it I love how curly it is my
curls are way more defined than when I
came in here nice my transformation is
done oh my gosh you are clean so now you
can press start practicing this at home
I'll say I came in a little bit cocky
thinking like I'm probably not gonna
learn that many new things I mean I
learned a lot today before I came in we
didn't know what mine was what'd you say
it is now to me for sure it seems like a
for a start seeing the definition I
normally just never do a split out
because number one it takes a lot of
time and then when I take it out I'm not
always happy with the results but I love
that you show me that I need to twist
tighter I feel like my twists are always
so loose and they're even frizzy before
I even get to let it dry just making
sure to keep my hair moisturized I also
learned that like my hair can be silky I
never put the word silky plus my curls
together in one sentence thank you so
much oh thank you I feel like I learned
more in the last hour so that I've
learned in the five years that I've been
natural</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
