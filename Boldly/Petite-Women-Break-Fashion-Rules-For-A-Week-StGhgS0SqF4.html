look short no I make you
I do feel self-conscious about my height
just because everyone else around me is
giant I constantly feel like I'm
drowning in clothes which makes me hate
going shopping growing up my mom had a
lot of ideas of like what looked good on
my body because it was smaller I do
sometimes see like certain pieces of
clothes might overwhelm me because of my
like short stature these are the most
common things that petite people are not
supposed to wear tunics or shirt dresses
oversized style / layers maxi dresses
maxi skirts midi skirts calf length
oh that just sounds like a bad boy ankle
strap heels I am wearing an ankle strap
right now so I guess I am already
breaking a rule I feel like I'm not
allowed to wear anything my goal this
week is to give zero
and restricted because my knees
I don't think the skirt doesn't make you
look shorter yeah yeah it's longer but
it looks nice though I do actually feel
very short in this just because I'm just
not used to wearing skirts
length of this skirt it's very like that
it's like a tight skirt though because I
feel like if it was like a flowy
mid-calf skirt then it would look like
me I know that it looks cool I know that
people are into it I just feel a little
self-conscious for me
apparently baggy pants supposed to make
you look shorter but I wear these all
the time
I don't feel short I think I got more
compliments on my shirt and on my pants
so they're not really looking at how
tall I am that was looking at what I'm
wearing if I'm breaking the rules you
know like if this is what it feels like
to be bad I don't want to be good this
is so comfy this is definitely the
outfit I'm most uncomfortable which I
don't get because I can feel it amazing
do you think it makes me look sure none
of these outfits have made you look
short seriously yeah you look amazing so
this is one of it I definitely feel most
comfortable in I don't care if it makes
me look short the benefits
the minute I saw you I was like wow
Stacy never wears dresses but I love
that and so when you told me that this
was against the rules for short football
I was like who made up these antiquated
you know so I have another short person
hat if your dress is too long just tie
and knot at the bottom that is an easy
way to short your clothes without having
to go get them hem
I decided to throw on this long baggy
trench coat jacket I remember when I
went to buy this the lady at the store
in other words kind of told me it would
look better on someone who was taller
and I was like that I'm gonna buy
it I think it's really flattering who
the Cure than I do
this dress is making me feel really
small cute I mean I don't see a problem
with this I don't look like shorter than
I usually look I think you always look
short I don't mind that I'm a short
person and I don't think that fashion
rules can hold me back on it quite
honestly at Harley I don't really
believe in those it's no secret that
society puts these unrealistic standards
on us and the way that we should look
and I think the first step is being
nicer to yourself I think we all just
need to take a cue from Backstreet Boys
and say everybody yeah rock your body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
