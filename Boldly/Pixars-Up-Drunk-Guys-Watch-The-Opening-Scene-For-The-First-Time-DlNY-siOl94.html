was named after this character
specifically it looks like I think
married kind of surprised to like a kids
movie like this is going through
someone's entire life she just turned
the clouds into a thousand babies
because even though there's this non
sexualized take on romance there uh-oh I
spoke too soon oh wow this just got
really dark why does this exist
procreating was very important to the
two of them but there's adventures back
in their life and that's more important
they're saving up money to go to like to
build this house on the on a waterfall
that exists somewhere he just oh but she
got over it she's painting now that's
nice yeah he got hurt so they break the
penny jar to help with medical things
which is a lot oh and that was wife is
sick this is like three minutes into the
movie and his wife's sick and the hill
they're going up the hill but he's up
the hill just and she's having a hard
time with it so he's gonna help her out
oh yeah she's dead
she died oh they're just gonna start the
movie by watching a guy watch his wife
die well it's not funny I shouldn't
laugh Jesus now that I think about it he
did get to spin his life with this
amazing person who loved him dearly you
know that happens in people's lives some
people their dreams don't come true they
just want something and then
then I'll get that trip to Peru they
never go to Paradise Falls then their
wife died and so it did suck at me and
for him that they didn't get to do what
they should have done that's pretty
sweet that you got to kick it with this
girl that I was looking kick-ass the
whole time I was like yeah yeah we're
gonna we're gonna make it not only have
I been this guy we've all been this guy
you know what I'm saying like the loser
the putz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
