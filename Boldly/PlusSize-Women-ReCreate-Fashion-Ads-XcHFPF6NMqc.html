would wear a scarf and a pair of jeans
anywhere
fashion ads are like an adorable
make-believe place that I don't belong
in growing up I really struggled to feel
beautiful and feel like my body was okay
all the other girls were all pretty and
skinny so I just felt out of the box
there was also points of it where I
couldn't relate I kind of just saw
models who were very thin very light
skinned and I would look at them and
just say okay I'm supposed to look like
that because that's the only thing I see
represented I feel like so many people
compare themselves to what's in the
media I am very nervous I know this
isn't going to look the same and I know
it's not even gonna look close the same
but I just hope it looks okay
today I'm modeling a Gigi Hadid in a
Tommy Hilfiger ad she's sitting on a
coil rope like some sort of nautical
Disney Princess and wearing a coat which
I like cuz coats cover all sorts of
things um you know it's actually it's
hard to like lounge and also pose the
same time because you're like but also
like used to look like you don't care
honestly it was really nice to start
posing and have everyone crowd around
and be like what are you doing like it
felt good
I'm modeling the Burberry ad with
jasmine I personally wanted to be in
this photo because I saw this model with
a shaved head and I thought it was so
sick and so different I'm a little
nervous because I am literally topless
and there is a scarf that's gonna try to
like cover up my nipple so this should
be an exciting experience to try to make
sure I don't flash anyone and get sent
to HR I'm really excited to represent
like the plus-sized side of like that
type of love
not gonna lie there was just a lot of
boobs from both of us so it's very hard
to make huge boobs look like they're
just hang in there scarfs aren't meant
to cover your boobs I keep the smoker
I'm doing the Kate Spade ad and I
thought it looked really badass she's
really beautiful tall skinny yeah I'm
the complete opposite this is completely
out of my comfort zone
I'm usually behind the scenes so I think
this will be a really fun shoot I was
looking at all the other girls so I was
really really nervous when I came in
it's really really fun but all these
props is heavy and night right back is
hurting I'm modeling the Calvin Klein ad
a little nervous about it I think it's
provocative because you know plus-size
women aren't seen in the media and
fashion world as sexual beings hopefully
I can rock it
it's not easy even looking like you're
sleeping modeling is definitely hard
today I'm modeling the Agent Provocateur
I'm excited to showcase that you know
even if you have a bigger chest or some
curves you can still look awesome on an
awesome couch in an awesome corset I
feel sexy and you know when you look at
that picture me and the girl very
different body type so I think it goes
to show that no corsets are for everyone
it's unrealistic it's so unrealistic
we're sending this out for Christmas
your Christmas card I'm a little this I
mean it's the first time I've been like
topless really yeah me too I almost
don't want to look at it cuz I want to
like keep the feeling that it looks good
up until the last possible moment okay
this is our actual photos yeah hey now
it looks exactly like the picture it
looks so good I look badass in that
picture see that I don't look at myself
as sexy and I feel sexy in this photo
and that's a really awesome feeling oh
my god that looks awesome
honestly this feels as close to gigi
hadid as I could possibly get I can't
believe I got this close okay oh wow
look at us we look good we look good
look at your bedroom eyes on haw you see
love this is amazing like I feel like I
can't believe I'm so proud of
myself for doing it like I could have
never imagined that like a million years
I would have done something like this
this proves that we need to show more
body inclusivity on fashion ads because
it shows that you can be beautiful at
any size and that fashion is for
everybody pictures like ours that we've
taken during this shoot will help the
next generation to love themselves
better you know growing up I didn't
really see people who look like me in
magazines and campaigns and I just think
it's very important that no matter what
your age is you realize that your body
is beautiful because it is yours and you
need to take charge of that and feel
empowered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
