romantic considerate person 5 a.m. wake
up just go to work gonna come with me
can you serve a song you don't know how
to turn a kettle on nah I never thought
you could make me feel this
marriage is about pain and suffering and
enduring it happily but loads of wars so
I just proposed to NIC it didn't go down
as smoothly as I would have liked I'm
really nervous
will you marry me yes yes no why every
time the head magnets and magnet
ha one week let's do this the thing that
I'm dreading the most is sleeping next
to this guy for seven nights I just yuck
Wow oh wow huh it's okay I have like no
feelings it's completely cool you I
didn't mean it like that oh yeah yeah
getting married at an early age is like
leaving a party at 6 p.m. the fun hasn't
even begun yet so first date as husband
and wife
Nick left without me to do his own thing
and that's completely fine I respect
autonomy but in saying that I am about
to surprise him at his house I've done
so many cute little things for me
I took him over a flower what are you
doing here are you happy to see me took
me a long time to find that
flower I took you to dinner I paid for
your dinner and you didn't even have to
get out of the car the only meal he took
me out to was McDonald's which he made
me pay for and I'm a vegetarian he
bought me a bottle of water on my credit
card
well one day down wakey-wakey wifey do
you want gonna come to work with me
you're gonna have to come to work for me
one morning eventually I'm not your
property just because you married me
Nick and then what's the point of
marriage oh my god she is so
angry at me it is like looking into the
eyes of like a dragon yes all right I'll
see you at work
get his off so it's 6:30 and I'm on
my way to work by myself because Tanya
would rather stay in bed she'd moved by
u-turn I was just trying to remember
what I had to do today and then I
remembered that it was marriage so far
being married to Nick hasn't changed
very much he doesn't consider me in any
aspect of his life Nick has left work
without me again would be cool if he
atleast said by 5:00 a.m. wake up yeah
boy what gonna come with me last chance
come to work being married to Nick is
like being married to a younger annoying
brother who's had too many red lollies
and exists purely to make your life a
living organising hell I wish that he
would take it seriously and maybe like
be nice to me I'm gonna be a good wife
and ask Nick out to munch on a nice date
eyebrows
mix didn't even wait for my eyebrow
women to finish
I was a I five just like our
marriage things that have gone wrong in
the past few days everything he hasn't
taken me out for a single meal he wrote
one little lousy note which was good
morning wifey on my desk
he still has tinder one more swipe no
Nick
that's I'm right you super like
that I feel like the most insignificant
ants right now just look at her oh let's
look at the anger she has pure hatred
for me I find God sadness and
disappointment
this is like every breakup conversation
over a hat that's so funny
I'm glad you can find humor in this but
I am coming to work so we have a work
function on tonight and Nick left
without me didn't even say bye in offer
me a ride I'm just over it I feel really
sorry for any girl that's ever dated
this guy so we have a company-wide
meeting in Bondi this morning and tenure
is going to pick me up on the way
because she wants to be a good wife and
make my day more convenient so I should
probably put more effort into this
marriage
well fine you're right
well fine five doesn't actually buy it
I'm a idiot I don't know why I
expected anything from this guy we're
worlds apart this is just further
reinstated everything I already knew to
expect nothing from anyone to never get
married and that I'm gay as
the one thing I've taken from this
marriage is effort
now like from this marriage for when I
actually get married hopefully to do
everything opposite to what I did with
tenure that's a great we are now
officially divorced
sorry marriage but to me you are the
thing I want to do when I run out of
things to do with my life
you're like the last resort at least you
can get married legally in Australia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
