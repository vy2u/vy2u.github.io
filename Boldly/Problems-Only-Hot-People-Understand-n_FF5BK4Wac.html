understand sometimes you just don't want
to leave the house when you go out you
can't even physically consume all the
drinks people buy for you all the
attention that comes with being hot
makes you really uncomfortable we're
just trying to have a good night out
without being bothered sorry ladies
getting dressed every morning is a real
challenge I just can't decide on
anything I know I get it it's tough when
you look good in everything
it's tough walking down the street
everybody thinks you're a celebrity you
wonder if you get special treatment
because of your looks
I got it welcome it's so annoying
you're constantly distracted by your own
reflection it's hard for you to relate
to normal people problems that's a bad
angle we should take it again what's
that what's a bad angle but at the end
of the day the end of the day at the end
of the day I'm more than just a pretty
face where normal people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
