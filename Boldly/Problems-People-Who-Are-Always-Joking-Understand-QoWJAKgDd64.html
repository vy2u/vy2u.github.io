it's become a way of life for me to hear
things like your your joke I can never
tell if you're joking or not are you
joking and the answer is usually yes
and sure sometimes people think it's a
like imagine there's like a little mini
barista inside of there he's just
barista away and like one day he'll earn
his freedom and some people just don't
get it at all
did you just post a picture of Shaq and
hashtag man crush Monday but then you
find somebody who died right how's it
going hey you want to play how much
can we put on Prince back without him
noticing absolutely and you are friends
forever

long mm-hmm sorry I'll be serious but
honestly some of the most significant
relationships I have in my life started
because of a joke is this some shitty

spot okay great

difficult here and there kinda looks
like they're playing a banjo in this
picture oh yeah I don't really play
instruments it's just cool I
thought you were a banjo player it's
like this our work Wow

after jokes that I've got already print
them out oh oh oh and because I'm always
joking I always assume everybody else is
always joking so we have a small Board
of Directors was four of us but one of
us died of cancer sometimes I just don't
know when to stop just try it it works
like a door okay it's like a standoff
