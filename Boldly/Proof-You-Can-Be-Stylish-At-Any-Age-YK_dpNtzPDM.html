you sure that's something you want to
wear and I'll say of course I do because
I know my own mind I consider that
everything I wear has had its own life
prior to meeting me and so it's kind of
like introducing a bunch of people like
like having a party every day like that
you're gonna get along with this guy
okay yeah try it I know it doesn't look
like it would but just try it you know
my style I would say classy I like to
dress myself classy and look classy one
major misconception about motherhood is
that you become frumpy because you're
always really the last one you're going
to take care of but anything that's like
a mom Jean is out anything that doesn't
make me feel effing fantastic out
because I'm a mom and I'm cleaning food
off the floor and I'm you know running
around and driving a minivan I still
love the fact that I get to express Who
I am and be Who I am with this artistic
expression of clubs I want it to be a
good mother and that's that's where your
head is at so I think it's sometimes
easy to forget that you're a woman first
and you know it's okay to be pretty it's
okay to get up and maybe put on makeup
instead of making breakfast for
everybody right away because if you take
those five minutes and do things like
that for yourself you're such a
different person I just I don't think
rules should apply to fashion really I
mean they just don't I don't care if I
wear a black bra with a white tank top I
really don't and if someone else cares I
mean it's it's not my problem it's
theirs why can't I wear a sparkly party
dress when I'm pregnant
it stopped caring so much about what
other people think I felt a ton of
pressure I was like should I take my
nose rings out should I change my style
was also liked at the same time I was
entering the professional world so it
was like do I do I change or do I try to
go out jobs you know looking like I do
and I just decided to stick with it you
know I was determined to work twice as
hard as everybody else and kind of
challenge people's perceptions of what
someone you know is supposed to look
like I'm at the age where I kind of do
what I want to do hey we're here we've
been in a lot of places we have a lot of
stuff to say and you know we're not
disappearing into the work in like the a
business or whatever it is they want you
to where I am a mother I'm a mother I'm
a mother I am a mother I am a mother to
be a mother and a grandmother and I'm
bold I am fearless I'm Marc lamech I'm
rock n roll I am anti-establishment
hello I'm a diva I am classy I am a
hippie I'm a rebel
you don't need to be the best parent at
work but you need to be a happy parent
you need to be you fashions a very easy
way to keep that side of you a lot
I remember the style I have 36 feels
girl and now and we're still pretty much
you're saying because I like it the same
classy style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
