I did not know that I was gay so that's
probably why it wasn't on my radar I
just never went back and did my homework
I think spent about eleven years in the
Navy so I spent a lot of time internet
at sea well from what I've heard I'm
expecting it to be a little raunchy feel
like it might be like a gay friend
let's get queer let's watch some folk oh
man this hair is so 90s
the little blonde kid is very nervous
he's hydrating beforehand that's
important can get very dehydrated during
sex okay he just poured water all over
his face for no reason nobody does this
in real life
is this like flirting I like your
kitchen do you like Special K obviously
operating him drugs guys dare there's a
but there's something kind of creepy
about the dialogue coming and then go
nice pun on the word coming this makes
me curious what other people thought of
this at the time when I air this was the
pilot they just you know go big or go
home
I've also I've seen only white people so
far these issues are revealing like your
HIV status are still very relevant today
it was like frank and honest' talked
about HIV without all the like fear well
it's so important to show that you can
live a normal life with HIV bring up
AIDS and in a script like that I think
is pretty progressive and awesome
so he's stressful to me to watch
depictions of high school because it
reminds me of high school
I still hate how is still a thing
also these kids are definitely not in
high school in real life but that's okay
we'll let that slide I think that like
the authority like gets it right and
they don't and that's like the most
frustrating oh my god this teachers the
worst
he's like purposefully ignoring
homophobic slurs ballsy kids for sure
oh he just told the teacher where it's
at I just love all the all the faces I
was like oh you just said you
honestly I'm like super intrigued now
gives like a snapshot of where we were
as a culture in society which is
obviously clearly different than where
we are here in 2015 this makes me want
to go back and watch it all a little bit
like a trip down memory lane and I'm
glad it tackled some hard-hitting life
tough issues definitely go back to watch
the series because I like to stay
abreast on no gay culture and get
history for the time like the fact that
a show like this even existed is amazing
