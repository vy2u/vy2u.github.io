like they'll be like oh my god you're
the most beautiful trans woman I've ever
seen and I'm like hmm okay bitch do you
identify as trans or as a woman like do
you see a distinction in that being
trans is a part of my history but it
isn't Who I am it is such a footnote on
my experiences what was the moment where
you realize that like there was this
difference between masculine and
feminine and where you felt like I like
I like this thing a little bit more
since I was like maybe five or six I
knew I wanted to be a strong female I
always identified as you know Shira or
Wonder Woman and so to learn that I was
gonna grow up to be not that just kind
of was like wait what I know now is
trans since I found out what it was I
think I was maybe heaven or six and I
was just like oh no that sounds awful
the society is not nice to different
people you make this decision am I gonna
be miserable for everyone else or happy
with myself there's the idea of gaydar
is there like a trend
oh there totally is Accola clocking your
tea that means like you've been found
out by uh normy no kidding at this
Kristen when I was really growing up
cepting and embracing my transness there
was this ultimate goal is stealth want
to keep myself quieter I want to keep
myself smaller because I don't want to
draw attention to myself when you do
pass completely do you feel 100% good
and relieved about that I like when
people know I don't identify as this
woman identifies a transgender woman
we're not out to fool people we're not
out to be something we're not we're
trying to live in our most absolute
truth I tell them in right away because
they feel like their masculinity is
being threatened something terrible
could happen and I have a family I can't
just go disappearing
everyone thinks women are crazy but no
one knows crazy until you've rejected a
man if it goes from I love you to
threatening to kill you in one second oh
you come across men who are like looking
at you but they're not really looking at
you they're looking at you know you as
this trans black well yeah like for me I
had to deal with the intersection of
being black I've done the intersection
of being trans there's a lot of statuses
that I dealt with as a trans woman where
they want you to be this like dominant
woman
just really not in my nature let's just
take the trans aspect out of it
they start talking about I've never been
with a black girl it's crazy how many
people think that that's a compliment
it's like what about being black is so
like wow I had never experienced that I
mean have you never been with a woman
think I don't understand is there
something you would like to let
cisgendered woman know we're all very
similar and we all can relate in so many
ways I think we're all just exploring
our femininity as well as our
masculinity thank god there's now it's
also outside forth forcing everyone to
think about gender differently yeah I
think it's time for women everywhere
trans women included we need to start
flexing that muscle and taking up space
you know because we keep apologizing you
know feeling bad about it no I'm not
sorry actually I belong here and you're
gonna respect me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
