like over now
so you just don't like ever sleep you
know you can't return one of these right
so if your kid was ugly do you think you
could admit it why are we having a
birthday for this thing it has no idea
where it is
so if emily was an accident you tell me
right
so this thing will masturbate into a
soccer whatever little boys masturbate
into and you're just going to have to
clean it like it didn't happen but it
did happen what if he turns into an
asshole he could be he could be a total
douche already and there's not it's not
your fault he just is one of those
people who's a douche
so do you realize that your life is over
is that not sunk in yet what if he like
grows up and joins a fraternity do you
have any idea how much you're gonna cost
mommy and daddy so like in 10 years when
that thing is I don't know 12 and he
asks for money you just have to give it
to them just feeding money into this
thing it's like a slot machine that's
never gonna pay off so if you want to
buy something new you just don't ever I
was having one of these better than just
keeping all your money and spending it
on going to bars and restaurants
traveling so you guys just can watch sex
while you're on vacation ever again okay
so are you still attracted to your wife
after seeing that thing come out of her
vagina so Mario's vagina what do you
even do with that anymore did you poop
when you push that thing
so you really must love that kid huh I
don't see it Chucho son

you could go back in time and not do
this yeah he's good one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
