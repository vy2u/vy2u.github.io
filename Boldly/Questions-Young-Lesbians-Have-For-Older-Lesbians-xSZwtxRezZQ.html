think you're gonna ask who killed Jenny
Schecter I guess we all want to know so
being a young gay couple we're not as
represented in the media or even just in
older couples that we know it's hard to
imagine growing older as a couple and
imagining what our life will be like
when we don't have people around us that
represent us so we are talking to
strangers my name is Madonna my name is
Robyn and we've been in a relationship
now for 12 and 1/2 years do you mind if
I ask how old you were when you met late
40s what's the age difference between
the two of you I'm lying seven 70 years
yes I 70 recent I'm 61 she's 50 okay see
ours is five years and when we tell
people it sounds like a lot wait who's
older okay Wow as you get older the
better
it doesn't yeah well okay so I was going
through my hot flashes first I'm not out
of my hot flashes by any stretch of the
imagination but and I'm in but she's
fully in and I'm having cures so now I'm
throwing covers and cats so you do have
cat yes yeah we have four cats we're
fortunate enough today where we you know
there's a growing amount of
representation in media what was that
like for you guys I remember where I was
working in a corporate world and I had
to be a little bit closeted in the 80s
when Ellen came out I was able to say at
work okay I'm like Ellen I'm like her
and if you can like her if you can just
like me for who I am
you'll be fine so how did you meet other
gay people for me it was a different
trajectory it was more finding each
other in the bars playing softball
there's a reason we have stereotypes we
played softball you know I mean
happen I was a softball
yes you have your card you're good there
were the festivals the women's festivals
were great for lesbians these places
where you would find each other happen
to be those places where people were
trying to make change in the world too
you felt like you were part of the
underground in the of the movement do
you notice a different evolution for gay
men than gay women my brother died of
AIDS in 91 and this whole community of
friends died and lesbians were coming
forward to help are our friends the
names project and the quilt was huge in
the 80s and early 90s and I stood on the
quilt when it first existed some of the
younger men I feel like don't understand
that how tragic that was but none of us
who lived through that time and that
those seeing those people leave will
ever forget that do you have any advice
for younger k couples the one thing that
you always want to remember in this has
to do with any relationship if you don't
know how to be a friend you don't know
how to be in a relationship because
that's what the relationship is my
advice is to live in your truth turn off
the voices that will condemn you or
pretend that they know better than you
do you want to be in your happy place
your sad place I want to be in my happy
place and that's where we choose to live
you've been together three eight three
and a half okay what are you doing out
there we're like the only women that
we've dated and we're kind of recently
out so that's fun we came out and then
shortly after we moved to LA um and I
think that was really great for us to
kind of get out of arms ourselves bubble
and kind of be able to be like hey this
is who we are and have people be like
cool I don't care I think going through
that whole process together really
strengthens us as a couple like having
to fight for this relationship makes the
place that we're in now I'm so grateful
for it and you guys are only the next
generation yeah you're not two
generations down you're the Navy right
yo come on clear the road for people
behind you and I think part of the
reason that we can be so comfortable in
who we are now has a lot to do with the
work that both of you have put in
through your many different resources in
your many different years so very
appreciative of your time and your
wisdom and thank you so much you're
welcome
we now have lesbian friends so do we do
you know who killed Jenny Schecter you
know what I would have to think about
that I'd have to really like record big
mystery uh Celeste munity Jenny Schecter
