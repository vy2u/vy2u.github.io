seek out the less obvious things to
explore when you're on a road trip there
are a lot of strange and fascinating
places in the u.s. you just have to look
a little harder to find them
if you ever get super lost on the way to
Las Vegas and find yourself nari√±o stop
by Pyramid Lake a beautiful Oasis
located on an Indian Reservation with
some freaky ancient legends according to
one ancient Paiute a legend feet below
the surface are demon babies who eat
swimmers and fishermen there's also some
history with the Stone goddess and a
demon bear sounds like dating in your
20s motor on to you Todd take a drive on
the Bonneville Salt Flats nothing lives
here it's a desolate place for cars to
set land speed records which means drive
really fast
okay so what's in Albuquerque New Mexico
besides the filming location for
Breaking Bad strange homes like Earth
ships which are oddly shaped and made of
recycled cans and bottles and a series
of well spaceship houses weird speaking
of keeping it weird Austin Texas has
this bridge downtown where you can watch
millions of bats fly up at your face at
dusk
it's the largest urban bat colony in the
world y'all let's say you decide to
drive through the Midwest and stop by
Cleveland because you've heard it rocks
well it definitely rocks candy and
sweeties is the place to get this huge
candy warehouse posts over 400,000
pounds of sweets at any given time
since ghost towns are awesome you should
check out Centralia Pennsylvania smoke
comes out of the ground from this crazy
mine fire that's been burning for almost
50 years when someone says Buffalo New
York you probably don't think of
artistic elephants but they have that
they're a painting elephant and her name
is Sir Abba oh she's real unlike this
hand puppet let's end up in New England
at the 1930s air and matte barium in
Boston
it's a giant glowing stained glass globe
that you can actually walk through super
cool there are obviously so many places
we missed but that's part of the fun get
off the beaten path and turn it into a
bragging rights trip by finding some
eccentric special places of your own so
where will your next road trip take you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
