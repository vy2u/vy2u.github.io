I was born with rickets meaning my legs
and bones didn't develop properly due to
malnourishment humans came and went but
none of them wanted to adopt me I think
it was because of my legs but that's
okay because eventually these two
fostered me they fed me well made sure I
got lots of Sun and soon enough I felt
much better after a couple of weeks they
accidentally fell in love with me and
became my forever parents and so this is
me now
living my best life I'm pretty handsome
bit of a trendsetter some would see I
hear Mum and Dad sometimes say that I'm
spoiled rotten not really sure what that
means
but it must be a good thing because life
is good these days
my mum and dad foster other puppies
waiting for their long-term parents to
find them like these guys here they're
okay I mean it takes some of the
attention and my clothes but I get it
they look up to me
you need a role model to teach them how
to pose the quicker they know how to
give their best puppy eyes the quicker
they will be given peanut butter and
hamburgers who else can tell on this
sort of stuff but more importantly I
really want them to find their forever
homes like I did as much as I loved
having for shelter puppies bytom opposed
and stealing my fashion sense they
deserve the unconditional love that I
got in their age it's important it
builds a dog self-worth let's call a
bone a bone humans need us no law to
compare us the love that the dog
provides a human we see past all the
nonsense
the googling baby noises you make as we
stare through you the endless photos
they take of our stress in onesies and
love you for who you are we reduce your
stress levels we make you happier and we
occasionally distract you from your
phones and Netflix making you a
healthier more active human you can
thank us later but really we need you as
much as you need us
adopt a rescue part for your local
shelter and reap the rewards of saving
our life and improving yours also on the
Wardrobe map
you
