than my wedding day honestly Fashion
Week to me is honestly I think it's
gonna be some craziness some avant-garde
 I'm just like this girl from Texas
that has never been to a fashion show in
my life I just gonna like reject me
planned three weeks in advance what we
were gonna wear it's true like we got to
get this right we got to get this down I
bought a dress it was 111 dollars it was
supposed to be 84 but I clicked it at
midnight and the sale went away I still
bought the dress we can go back to LA
and be like actually wear this color you
know what okay let's just go let's do it
you said I did like she doesn't cause is
this in New York
yeah fashion here we call one Friday I
wanted to go for a chic high-fashion
look so I slicked back my hair I put it
in a low ponytail I wore a choker I wore
pastel pink pants that were kind of
flowy and then some strappy shoes that
were not the comfiest but fashion I
decided to wear like a floor-length gown
and it was all black and it had a cape
on it it wasn't easy
and then I wore these black shirts that
said economy fashion section we're
headed to Nicole Miller right now hoping
that it's like a free fun place then
that it's not like ritzy and like so
your bling Jess is that the noise
playing thanks yep so you're I've to
this show and it's already feeling super
chaotic or
I honestly was not expecting like what
it is five people have already like
looked me up and down critiquing my
outfit two bangs one and I saw one of my
favorite actresses reward is the new
black she's my favorite too I also saw a
rich kid with Beverly Hills that I've
also seen in Beverly Hills but that's
the update so far we're waiting in line
for the show for like a good hour they
finally let us through and the shows
about to start in literally one minute
literally and there's about 50 or so
people behind us still yet they just
closed the doors in front of that we
were the last like maybe 10 people to
get in and then they were just like can
you imagine waiting in line for like two
hours and then not getting in hole I
spent so much money on that dress
the first show had a lot of like
different really cool patterns it was
very colorful it's very preppy with cute
no Laura we did first Fashion Show - I
think the biggest thing we both realized
is that like so much goes into it for
literally a five minute show five
minutes it's chaos getting there you're
in traffic you're trying to find your
spot and then you sit down it starts is
five minutes long and then you leave
when you go to the back and that's it
we're at the Tadashi fashion show we
just realized that this was gonna be all
gals yeah it's gonna be cool maybe I
just took a picture of that what the
 okay when we got there we actually
had our own seed so I felt with the vfp
they also had a brochure of the show
that told you all the looks that we're
gonna be coming down the runway on the
runway
you know this is gonna be a good show
because the music is slightly scary when
it started there was this cool crazy
animation it was kind of trippy it was
like a tiger hanging on to like an
elephant it was saying something with
like interconnectivity and just like all
being sound and on the same level and
just like chilling it was really cool I
liked it I didn't get any of that from
that video exactly
then the gowns came out
the colors were so vibrant
all the gallons had just such a
beautiful structure to them these look
like just like little masterpieces
walking around but that fashion show
Tadashi you know you're so we just
got back from our first two fashion
shows Nicole Miller it was mainly the
same ethnicity which is white the
Tadashi show had at least like three to
four women of color so that was nice
something we were not used to all around
and both these shows was the fact of
just like seeing these models bodies in
real life these high high fashion models
their job is to sell the clothes and not
themselves just become literally a
walking mannequin outside of high
fashion I feel like our society is
trying to make these huge strives into
like curves blah blah blah love yourself
and then we go to these high fashion
shows and it's like whoa this is another
club now we're gonna eat Thai and sushi
and go to bed my seasoning good morning
and welcome to our second day of Fashion
Show we're at the BuzzFeed New York
office we're taking all their snacks
I personally was excited for Sunday
because this is my street style
weird concepts like Oh
I just cited after I went back to a
little Missy Elliott wicka wicka
literally a pink velvet jumpsuit with a
hat and some tennis shoes and I'm not
ashamed to say that I rocked the out of
that so I decided to stay with the whole
chic trend that I was going forward
through Fashion Week and I slipped my
hair back but I kept it down I am had a
really light blue blazer and I had black
trousers and then I just wore tennis
shoes because it was more like casual
street style and really comfortable
today we're going to the hood by our
fashion show which I'm so excited for
because this is like really cool street
style Rihanna just wore it I'm dyeing if
I see her I can't believe my life right
now yeah we didn't see Rihanna what was
different about these shows for us is
that we were going behind the scenes
instead of just attending the show
we got to meet the creative director
that basically explained the hair and
makeup looks they were literally like
smearing Vaseline and it was inspired by
like kids going and getting like messy
and their parents stuff and it was also
supposed to be like a little bit of like
we're back in the woods going on to
like the thought process like what is
going on the actual looks like it is all
absolutely frizzy and all the models are
so sweet and nice and like just want to
talk so that's really nice
we were just walking down the runway and
Whoopi Goldberg was next to me and all
of a sudden Jaden Smith walks in and
then it was not only camel yeah and I
was like hey girl do not say hey to her
I saw Teyana Taylor I was in the
background
picture that I didn't know about so when
the show started it was some trippy like
music that sounded like it was in her
first this is gonna be weird the
fashions in this show were so cool I
think knowing what we knew from the
creative director backstage and what
their vision was like and seeing it
going to the runway was like an amazing
experience because we could see how the
adolescent childhood theme transferred
into how they were walking one guy had
like a POW on his face as if he had just
gotten in trouble he was my favorite
literally looking and I liked it because
like even though we knew the background
story to everything that we were still
like watching I actually literally cried
and had to make sure that my eyeliner
was not running down my face it got to
the point where I was like this is
beyond fashion this is
in our piece I feel so honored to like
gotten to this it's amazing so we got in
there and it was cool because it was all
just like mix match of everything like
nothing was supposed to feel fluid not
the gender not the race not the hair and
not the colors everything was supposed
to be messy it was sick it was so cool
when the show started there was a
performance like a pre-show we realized
later that this is called like gypsy
Spore and it opened with like almost a
halftime performance work at every sport
instead of the models walking out to
just music they had these two presenters
that were basically commenting on the
styles as they walked by and there was
also this really cool mix of colors they
were all just color so you wouldn't be
like yeah those go together and they
still kind of all like flowed with each
other
gypsy sport was awesome it was really
cool to see so many people with like
different body types and skin type you
could connect with any of the models
there I'm like so sad it's over I know I
can't believe it I thought that I'd be
exhausted and like want it to end by the
end of the week but I actually had such
a good time my biggest takeaway from New
York Fashion Week I'm being like the
people that we are not 100% in the
industry is to like if you're gonna go
go and be you everyone that attended the
shows had their own style like there
wasn't this common style that we saw
everyone wearing like you are you
dressed for you dressed the best way you
can and like that's what's accepted
we'll be ready for you next year goodbye
or 2k 17
