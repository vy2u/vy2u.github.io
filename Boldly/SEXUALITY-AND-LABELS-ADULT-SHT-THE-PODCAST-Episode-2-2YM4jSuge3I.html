podcast thanks for joining in it I
realized in the last episode we didn't
sound very energetic in the intro we're
so excited
holy Wow see you gee willikers how are
you young Kate I'm doing alright I'm
doing I'm good I'm good
our theme for this week's episode yeah
we're just going out and say it's about
bisexuality well it's about sex well I
identify as bisexual slash queer I
identify as trying put that on a
t-shirt I identify us trying No very
good comments if you wanted I'd wear it
yeah I think that like that was has
always been a little bit of a weird
subject for me because I was right like
we've talked about this before I was
very super religious and there's a bunch
of stereotypes with um sexuality in
general and whatnot so I was always a
little bit apprehensive to admit that I
also liked women and when you say
there's a lot of stereotypes you mean
like with women that like other women
just the idea of like if you like other
women you're not feminine at all so like
by liking other women you forgo your
ability to be a woman yeah it is now I
understand not true and I have I've seen
that that's not true and whatnot but
it's still like if you're raised with
these sort of biases it's kind of hard
to shake no pun intended am i right
thank you
yeah I mean I totally understand what
you're saying it's interesting though
that I grew up with the idea of if you
like other women then you're just like
 or experimenting or like wanting
attention we're trying and I wrote about
this in my newsletter when I used to do
that about like my coming-out experience
been to that I just got busy okay my my
I did a whole article about like what my
coming out story looked like because I
never really had to come out
for me it was like from as long as I can
remember
I always was attracted to women or
people who identifies women and I
actually like did everything with women
before I did anything with a guy so like
I had to take group of friends where at
sleepovers we would be like making out
or practicing kissing or playing truth
or dare or whatever so it was like that
was already integrated into my like I
think sexuality as being able to like be
liberal and learn what I was into I
never had anyone go like oh you can't do
that or like no you can't do that
I think a because we were like all
really horny and because I mean
the women and so I wrote in my article
that you know I feel kind of cheated
because you know the LGBT community has
gone through so much we're like you
really do when when that moment does
happen and you are liberated it's like
really freeing feeling and I never got
that it was just kind of like everyone
accepted it and it was fine and nobody
actually gave a I mean that's from
all of those people going through all of
that right really exactly and so you
know once I got into high school and I
was dating and I was able to date women
it just no one liked all the guys around
me that you know all the other girls in
my age were so concerned about what kind
of like oh you make out with chicks
that's hot that was the thing
that would happen a lot I know that it
like a lot of girls remember girls in
high school would make out with each
other for guys right watch which is
always sort of like sex in my household
was just not really talked about we
covered her eyes and people kissed what
did your parents kiss in front of you
ever know I remember being young and
like kind of experimenting with girls
but like when I was really really young
and I just talked about this in therapy
recently and I remember it feeling like
we got I remember getting in trouble
about it and being like no feeling like
it was wrong and people saying like be
quiet about it or whatever so I remember
being super young and then getting in
trouble for experimenting when I was I
was young but I was old enough to know
right that it wasn't like an exploration
necessarily sort of thing you know when
you're like really really little it's
human nature for kids to like explore
and be like I have a vagina you
laughter yeah yeah but this wasn't that
this was like you were we were enjoy you
know what I mean and so when I was told
it was wrong I was like oh that's
wrong and it's over sexualized
and sex is wrong all this stuff is wrong
so it took like let alone just
identifying as I think it might even be
pansexual might be the yeah correct term
identifying is that it was hard because
it was took a really long time even
identified as a sexual person even as a
straight person realistically yeah you
know it just it's a lot for people that
I think labels are so good but are also
yes well it's interesting that you
brought up the pan thing because for so
long people would be like well why won't
you identify as pan like why do you have
something against like trans people
would you never trade a date a trans
person and I you know for a while it was
this word that I knew and felt safe
calling myself this that's so crazy is I
feel like we grew up in a time where I
don't think there was ever a time when
this stuff didn't exist right it just it
feels like because it's so fluid
sexuality and gender is fluid that it
feels like sometimes they're like
fleeting mmm like feelings and whatnot
and we never had the vocabulary right
and so now it's sort of like we went
from being I didn't even know that
bisexual was a thing when I was little
but I was like okay like I definitely am
attracted to girls but I'm also like
very much attracted to it right um men
and so I was like oh okay I guess I'll
just be attracted to men man yeah so
what has been your experience like once
you move because you come from a very
conservative upbringing you lived in
Philly East Coast kind of you were very
consistent conservative state a lot of
around a lot of Republicans I would say
what was your experience like when you
were able to move away from home away
from you know this this strict mold of
who you were supposed to be ah what was
that like yeah I think well no matter
how far you go you're still taking
yourself and all of your insecurities
with you so when I got here I was kind
of like oh right nice and far from all
of this I could be whatever oh no I have
to actually do it and II ends up it
instead I just went into like a bunch of
hiding it just wasn't do it like wasn't
exploring it at all even
College I was like barely hooking up a
whole lot and even like now it doesn't
really happen a whole lot it's just such
a hard thing for me to really I say that
I want it and wanna like go through and
then Phil's bisexual I feel like we
should say that like just because you've
never hooked up or had sex with a girl
doesn't mean you're not bisexual like I
think a lot of people confuse that like
oh yeah well have you ever had a
girlfriend and I'm like that are you
challenging other people would say all
the time I'll be like Oh bisexual so you
you guys and girls like I don't
 anyone first of all because I don't
want to is how I'm kind of just like you
know with therapy and everything I'm
like really trying to figure out what it
is that I like now it's such a fun it it
really does open so many doors like I go
back and I will say to that about the
whole feeling like you need to rep for
being bisexual when you do identify with
it because I constantly feel like we're
having to stand up for ourselves or like
explain ourselves to people and it's you
also don't have to rep for your
sexuality like I make an ass load of
mistakes like you know I really think
that you shouldn't rep for something
unless you if you have the ability to
choose don't have the ability to choose
no matter what I do I will still
technically rep for women because they
can't help but to to say I am the person
that you should go to to get all of your
information about my my gender my
sexuality and all these things that I
identify as I'm the one who's gonna be
the spokesperson it's like that that's
look what Rose McGowan's do it
yeah like the the idea that you can't
make mistakes
yeah is hard because we're already under
such a microscope for having such like a
marginalized sexuality then I mean even
on the first podcast I constantly would
say like boyfriend or a guy that I'm
data or when I go out to look for guys
like even I still find myself being like
wow I say boyfriend because it's been
what I'm used to saying or like was
conditioned to say for so many years
then when I go home I'm swiping on women
only on bumble and that is also the fun
part about being bisexual is like you
can like pick and choose in one
you're super attracted to the dick the
next day it's like vagina you just can't
get out of your head or your hands are
yeah interesting conversation is to
always have to tell people that like
you're dating or talking to about your
sexuality my joke is always like
whenever I drop a queer comment
especially in front of other queer
people is always like oh are you gay
and I'll say half the time which is also
not great because there's this trope
that you can only be 5050 when in
reality like I said every day it's
different every minute it's different
sometimes I'll see I'll be literally
having sex with a guy and then think
about a hot girl I know the gears are
shifted then what I like masturbate I'll
be like I'll start thinking of one
person and then halfway through a book
and now you buy porn is never there's no
such thing in the porn world by
porn because it always turns into a
three like it's a threesome situation
it's hard to see what else would you do
it like that's what I'm saying it's like
if it's ever it's never if it's two guys
and a girl then it's some sort of
gangbang or if it's two girls and a guy
it's like a sexy three honey
porn is sort of made for first straight
man yeah and the most and cue the idea
of being by like I'm sure the question
you always get asked which is you know
like would you be in a threesome with me
and my partner or like oh that's
constantly dating absolutely you and
then it's like you know just looking for
someone cool who's down to try something
with me and my boyfriend that I love and
like I'm kind of into that which is also
okay isn't that great for like
stereotypes of I know but like to me
sometimes it really turns me on
to be like the first person that a girl
will try stuff wit and we're like I
would always be the first person to
introduce the idea of a threesome in my
relationship that like that's not great
for bisexuals everywhere because we're
trying to beat these stereotypes also
it's okay to be into that
you're in the way you're in it ah yeah
speaking of being into what we're in
daddy just walked in the daddy is here
baby
you're gonna be sitting here talking
into this bat alright I'm so happy
Wow of all daddies are beautiful
beautiful style icon bro
makeup revolution you guys know I mean
you do a myriad of style videos but but
what do you do who are you what do you
do
style body-positive confidence leader
yeah like that's what I want
it's just everyone to be like confident
no matter why I remember like when you
first started Oh people were like you
came in with a force and
everyone like who knows buzz feeders
know that we're all very like individual
like there's no two of us that are the
same rep the same happens in point of
you have the same life experiences but
Jasmin came in like a wrecking
ball like I am Here I am doing it and
this is something I love to point out
about Jasmine Oh know that yeah there's
a podcast where we saw also was an
intern here and still working at Sephora
oh yeah the work ethic in this person
cuz I remember like talking about that
and being like yeah she's going to work
after work so rough yeah I did it and
then I eventually quit yeah full-time
yes
I quit once I got full-time because of
you listening who don't know it takes
about six months to get full-time yeah
when she was working two jobs
oh yeah well making a name for yourself
here it was a role model and you go out
a lot I go out a lot I know I go out a
lot people think I go out a lot and that
I'm a lot more fun than I am I'm just
capturing the best parts hmm one week
well I go out on Thursdays first days
are my day well we don't have to say
nope so today's theme of our episode
we're basically talking about the
sexuality spectrum hmm and so Kate and I
have been talking about our bisexual
experience and tropes and stereotypes
and situations we've been in what is
your relationship to labels and how do
you feel about them okay so I guess I
identify as a lesbian because I I think
I would identify as a bisexual because I
find I find men very attractive but but
there's a big boy I won't let them be in
me no I'm getting but there's there's
something in my head that's like I don't
want to be another name on their list
like I don't want to give them that
power and so I've never slept with a guy
really yeah Oh censored are we on here I
mean we can cut out anything you want
I'm such a dick though that's another
thing of which is sort of interesting
because what would we say if like a
straight guy who identifies as straight
was like oh except I sucked this other
guy's dick ones Ben are you bi yeah yeah
it's up to you I had a really hard time
we're talking about this I had a really
hard time like picking the word that was
best described yeah my sexuality
anyway what I was into and I still like
kind of have like a hard time with it
sometimes for sure because it feels like
it's so it's so important that like
girls growing up or not even just girls
like anyone growing up who's like I just
want to see I hope that I could be
different like I want someone to give me
their the language to use yeah and so I
think for that reason it's like really
important but I think that also when it
comes to figuring out your language it's
it's difficult to sometimes it means
well it doesn't mean I never want to be
yeah right exactly
that is like right that's uh ask how you
guys feel about this because I know my
opinion is that you can absolutely
change your label well yeah even though
yeah
know that I liked women sense this far
back as I can remember but I still am
like well one day that might be all that
I'm interested in and so she'll do it
like if I identify as bisexual is that
like life lock loaded tattooed on my
 ticket or how does this feel like
about changing your labels because a lot
of people you know the majority of smart
people believe you are born the way
you're born but I also think it's not
wrong to say that if you don't if you
can't identify with it or or or be out
with yourself first that it's okay to
change the way you identify as life goes
on so here's the thing about labels tell
me that labels are just to make other
people comfortable with who you are a
 so you don't have to
change anything you don't have to say it
doesn't matter what if you a girl
tomorrow and married a guy the next day
it doesn't matter what you are because
it's just to make everybody else feel
better about understanding you and
because when people don't understand
things they get uncomfortable and I'm
like guess what be uncomfortable yeah
okay it's for paperwork honestly I'm
having that time right now not with
sexuality but with relationships people
are trying to tell me on in a
relationship and I'm like you know why
I'm not because there's not a label on
it and if right and we have had the
conversation but it's just like my
friends are telling you that I'm in a
relationship and you're doing this like
a relationship Molalla a lot I'm like
you just want to know that so you're
more comfortable with me like I'm fine
with me yeah that's what's weird is that
I also know like I like to play a little
bit of the devil's advocate when I was
growing up I would have like I really
liked hearing that like women were
bisexual because I was like oh yeah God
that gives me the other thing too okay
so and and I had this like we were
talking about earlier this like
stereotype of in my head that was like
totally learned but really hard to shake
that like being attracted to women meant
that I didn't I wasn't a woman I wasn't
feminine and lame all of this stuff sort
of like went away and and I also like
I'm not great at like I never took a
huge liking to like really putting a lot
of effort into my appearance so I felt
like that meant that I was
feminine and all of that looks so
feminine that whole idea so to me they
were one of the same even though they're
not they're very much separate and you
could be like feminine and you could
just be whatever you want and it doesn't
have to be so labeled not picking a
label to make yourself comfortable as
cool but also to pick a label to make
other people feel better like hey you
can't be a lesbian you know that society
comes up to terms with like people not
wanting to label themselves or you know
learning new vocabulary that we didn't
even use 10 20 years ago it won't be a
 thing in a hundred years so I
feel like even though you know even
though you don't want to identify like
even though you don't want to put a
label on your relationship it's almost
like by not putting a label on it that's
a label that's what I'm able yep when it
comes to appearance and how you present
yourself there are a lot of stereotypes
about your sexuality based off of your
appearance and how you style it not like
we want to know about like how you
became so not only comfortable
but like empowering to other people
about your fashion and how that ties
into like your sexuality or how it
doesn't at all yeah I this is it's so
hard it's so so hard because I don't
know there are some days where I like
looking more I guess masculine she's
doing air quotes
yeah but then people tell me that like
no matter what I'm still not gonna look
masculine because you can clearly see
that I haven't asked some boobs and
that's not masculine to them but to me
I'm like yeah and then there are some
times where I'll be like in heels and
lipstick and I'm like full-out femme and
then I'm using the word fat man so that
means that I'm like a lipstick lesbian
lalalalala I don't know both face that
it does it really is I've heard people
say stuff like oh like I someone was
like oh she used to only like guys who
were like v-necks
you know she was gay the whole time and
it's like what because guys
because guys who wear v-necks this is
not this is my opinion but guys who wear
v-necks are gay and I'm just like who
are you on the schoolyard right now that
sort of stuff cuz then that it's like
okay so I can't even roll out of bed
right now and it's put on whatever
because then I'm like a butcher like I'm
identifying as like a butcher lesbian is
that a real thing like I don't even know
what I'm the law no okay so the
thing to me is that's hard being in the
community is that if I go out and I'm
dressed a certain way a lot of people
don't assume that I'm a lesbian
they either don't assume or they 100%
assume because I'm like bold and that's
rough for me because like I don't want I
don't want guys coming up and talking to
me when I'm trying to like find my next
girlfriend what you're saying about like
also like having curves and what that
means yeah I can't tell from the audio
and go to the video version on
youtube.com slash boldly I have no
titties whatsoever so sometimes I'll put
on a shirt and I'll be like oh wow this
is I am look incredibly gay and people
will be like oh you're gay and I'm like
look ha saying hi and then it leads into
our conversation and so sometimes I I
get a little scared about dressing
whatever like more masculine might look
like because what the then you have
gay men who are feminine so it's like
what the what did what makes
something feminine is it literally just
Anatomy I really just I I think it's
just what we're programmed to yeah
you're like pink is female yeah and I
thought about that like I've been
talking about this in therapy just so
much oh yeah much because I just it's
not even that that I don't want to like
shave my legs or that I'm taking us tea
I'm just sometimes I don't feel like it
feel like taking care of certain things
and I don't think that that should be
reserved I don't think that being
comfortable should be reserved for
people who identify as masculine mm-hmm
I feel like that's just yeah yeah I like
the attention with no makeup on nothing
pretty about the drakes on yeah the
Saints Drake uh jazz tell us some of
like your tips maybe for listener
who are so mad well I know I know what
like you probably asked us a lot of
times but you can't help it when
like you're as bold as you are less what
is what are your like confidence tips
because whether you're dressing
masculine feminine or in-between
whatever you identify as you still
 rock it
thank you Oh what how do you like what's
your how do you wake up in the morning
you know I guess what drives me is
honestly like getting more of a weird
reaction out of someone then like I oh
you look so pretty
like I've been wearing like weird
lately and like the past six months like
just random lines around my eyebrow you
know I don't know just like changing
people's perspective but I think where
it all starts is if I start out the day
feeling great about myself I don't care
what the anybody has to say for the
rest of the day like no one's gonna say
like oh that's a weird look all of a
sudden can be like Oh wipe it off no
like yes that's what I want and I don't
know it's not like getting ready process
in the morning cuz you also I stole get
ready with me from you on Instagram like
she does the best ones but like is that
process that idea of like you know
putting on your armor for the day
important to you or do you wake up some
days not giving a oh no no I give a
 every single day like I plan my
outfits nights ahead of time because
it's just like what I truly love to do
yeah like what do I want to be tomorrow
what do I want to wear tomorrow do I
want to wear no pants and fishnets what
the heck is wearing and you know I'm
just like it just gives me so much
excitement to put myself together and
have people look at me whether it's good
or bad like you're making them stop and
look yeah and so people you're the hella
they're on Instagram you how do you deal
with like comments of people who like
don't get what you do we we do we deal
with this
every day and I feel like we've maybe
developed a thicker skin but not
everyone you know people who aren't in
the entertainment in maybe don't get the
same luxury you're having thick skin no
we do there's also I mean there's a bit
of a thick skin but it I don't think
that there's a person alive who's able
to full meal it is not even called you
know terrible things on the internet and
it it it does it sticks with you yeah oh
it really does yeah delete comments to
you oh I black people regularly
that's a verb you know just because I'm
not like in the mental place to like let
that stay on my Instagram you know
I'm not there yeah I have to utilize
your energy right and granite right so
granite though if you leave a mean
comment up or something like the people
commenting will go and like tear their
asses apart yeah okay okay but yeah it
sucks it was really hard for me in the
beginning to to get used to people
tearing me down every video now I'm just
like we went to Cheesecake Factory and
then got invite guys I remember being
like just you just have this like
presents about you that's just so
confident and so when we were talking
about like different insecurities and
whatnot I was like oh damn like it
confidence is a state of mind but it
doesn't mean that it's a lack of
insecurities right it's just how you let
the insecurities affect that's another
March idea insecure confidence yeah yeah
I feel like that's the thing that we
should all practice because the second
you start being like I'm perfect then
you turn into an asshole yeah no
actually I don't know if anyone believes
that maybe Kanye but not even before you
we let you go we want to talk about this
secret Instagram you may
the handle is wait jasmine okay okay
