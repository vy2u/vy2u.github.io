definitely have had a lot of ups and
downs in terms of my body self-esteem
when you're in a relationship things
change a little bit things tend to hang
you a little bit more not like a
conversation that you said don't have
the very first time that like I saw her
with very little clothes on I was
horrified she's so small and I am so not
I would die to have like at least you
know full hair or no hair because it's
like it's just my stomach right now and
like three little chest hairs
obviously we express our gender very
differently still you know when the
clothes are off you still compare or I
still compare know I really don't
compare but we celebrate we don't come
here I've never thought about comparing
myself to you at all I don't know in my
mind I do are different a lot ya know
yeah there are a lot of assets about you
that I'm not gonna say exactly what yes
I like I really like your thighs and I
really like her calves her face is
adorable he has a really nice but I
don't feel like I have a but you know he
has a but I don't have a but I love I
love I love your eyes and making me
blush wait so what's right
we do like do little things you know
like to complement each other complement
each other and ask each other hey you
know this is look good on me giving me
compliments um and forcing me to receive
them it affected our relationship you
know when we didn't talk about it even
helped into the proof tea together you
know working now going for a hike in
terms I'm like oh I feel this way and
she'll say you know what are you talking
about you look gorgeous you look great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
