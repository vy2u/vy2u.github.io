I'm Andre and to be perfectly honest
raising kids has never been easy but
I've done a pretty good job so I wanted
to give some of you a little help I need
help teaching my kids what were you
looking at woman put a bowl of broccoli
in front of them and tell them they
can't play with their friends until it's
empty that's how you teach them about
nutrition over the weekend my daughter
went to a birthday party for a wealthy
girl and the girl got a pony and now all
my daughter wants is a pony you've got
to tell her to become really good
friends with that rich girl because one
day that rich girl's daddy is gonna buy
our convertible and you can rest assured
that my daughter ain't getting a
convertible from me she's gonna have to
get it on her own or walk or hitchhike
or hit the lotto hey Andre here's my
question do I really need to take my
kids to the dentist every six months
it's really expensive and I'm trying to
remodel my kitchen seriously you're
gonna ask that question
try remodeling your priorities Andre
guess what monster I wanna stop playing
cello I want him to play football what
shall I do
look here Scatman Crothers make the boy
play football or at least soccer because
nobody wants to date a cello player my
son wasn't invited to a birthday party I
know it's because the birthday boy his
mom doesn't like me what do I do
here's what you do invite that boy and
his mother to your birthday party only
make sure it's 45 minutes away and
there's no one there
my grandson's were in tight pants and
I'm concerned about him not getting
sufficient blood flow when I was his age
it didn't matter if my jeans were
painting off my blood is flowing my son
always wants to join
I am bad exactly you got to get in his
bed first beat him to the punch
he says he's scared you're the one who
has to figure out a way to pay for his
college hey Andre my son wants to pierce
his tongue should I let him he'll know
next time he asks just smack him on the
head he'll say ow
and you say now imagine how a hole in
your tongue is going to feel I'll be
working through problems like these
