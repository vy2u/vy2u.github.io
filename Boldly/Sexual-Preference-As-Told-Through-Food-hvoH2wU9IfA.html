exist and said there are just people who
like hotdogs and people who like tacos
meet Tom Tom likes tacos meet Jill
Joe likes hot dogs Tom has always known
he'd like tacos over hot dogs so I never
wanted to try a hot dog
Jill try to talk we're two in college
but they weren't to her taste so she
stuck with hot dogs now
meet Nick and Ally Nick prefers hot dogs
while Ally prefers tacos - Nick there
was something about hot dogs he always
liked he felt good and full and happy
when he had hot dogs while tacos on the
other hand didn't feel right and gave
him a stomachache when Ali was a kid she
wanted to try tacos she saw them on TV
and billboards and even though she had
never had one she knew she needed to try
and when she did it finally made sense
while she never enjoyed hot dogs this
whole time Rob and Casey like both hot
dogs and tacos it's not a matter of
greed or confusion they just happened to
like both dishes
sometimes Casey might be more in the
mood for one dish over the other but
she'll still enjoy both when Rob eats a
hot dog it doesn't mean he stops liking
tacos all it means is that he's eating a
hot dog
now all these tacos and all these hot
dogs are made up of different
ingredients and have different toppings
there are so many possibilities you can
even have a taco dog sometimes a hot dog
is better with taco toppings or a taco
is better with hot dog toppings it
doesn't matter so much what it's made of
if it's good Mayor Joe is open to it
Mayor Joe is open to hot dogs tacos and
everything in between
speaking of ingredients and toppings
these are the main qualities Shane looks
for in a dish
Shane needs to like the parts that make
up the whole before determining whether
or not they like the hot dog or a taco
or something in between
Jordan generally doesn't like to eat hot
dogs tacos or anything in between
Jordan is usually on a juice cleanse now
if Tommy likes tacos didn't like Nick
because he eats hot dogs I would seem a
bit silly and when Ali likes tacos it's
not because she just hasn't had the
right hot dog yet it's because she likes
tacos and if anyone tease someone else
because they didn't like the same food
or if they bullied them or worse that
would just seem ridiculous because
everyone has their own food preference
no one can change that it's simply a
part of a person just like sexual
preference because with all these
amazing tacos hot dogs and taco dogs but
their countless ingredients and toppings
we just accept Tom who likes tacos and
Jill who likes hot dogs they were not
only limiting ourselves that's just not
how the world is like a buffet there's
so much variety with so many different
preferences and you know what each one
is just as valid as the next no one is
better
no one is worse just different and
that's okay
