statistic because I maintain mom this
was my choice three weeks of being a mom
three of the hardest weeks of my life
I'm debating adoption I'm a teen mom I'm
alone adoption seems easier being a teen
mom isn't something I'm going to defend
I'm not going to go on and say have kids
early because you get to love them
longer I'll admit it wasn't intentional
but I wouldn't trade motherhood for
anything I never mentioned the fact that
I'm a mom when I meet people for the
sole reason that I don't want to be
judged about being a teen mom being a
teen mom sucks nobody wants to love you
except for your kid I'm a teen mother
sometimes I'm really proud of it other
times I hate myself for it I hate always
wondering if I'm a good mother
being a teen mom has only made me more
motivated to finish school and have a
successful future
I hate when guys assume that just
because I'm a teen mom I have sex with
everyone and anyone I'm a teen mom and I
still go to school sometimes I want to
drop out to have more time with my son
I'm a third generation teen mom and I've
made it a goal to finish school and go
to college instead of dropping out and
blaming my child like my mom and my
grandmother I am a teen mother and I
love my daughter but she is ruining all
else good in my life as a teen mom you
don't have to throw away your life yeah
you can't do as much but you learn
responsibility much faster besides it's
no one's business what you give
up now is it the worst thing about being
a teen mother is I'm too mature to hang
out with girls my age but too young to
hang out with older women I'm a teen
mother and I will never regret my son
but I regret how fast I had to grow up
I secretly hope that my daughter turns
out gay so I don't have to worry about
her being a teen mom like me I'm a teen
mother who will be graduating from
college with honors this fall major and
minor included it's possible I'm going
to love shoving my diploma in the face
of people who had zero faith yes I'm a
teen mom and yes the father has left us
but you know what he left me with this
angel and I thank him for that
