you know
Pam the first questions about this first
date who pays guy pays obviously guy
pays I always pay guy always pays unless
I'd say the only exception is that but
otherwise the guy pays I don't know I
don't I actually don't have a good
reason for that I want to say it's
instinct that makes no sense it's
just the way I was raised it's been
ingrained in us that we're supposed to
be the provider culture movies music
media I mean keep in mind those
traditional roles were kind of implanted
and set like in the 40s and 50s would I
ever let a woman pay for a first date if
she absolutely insisted like she held a
gun to my head I would feel
uncomfortable not so much uncomfortable
but-- be kind of like come on man what
are you doing like be a man pay the bill
you know if I go out to dinner with
someone I expect to pay for what I'm
going to eat I think it should always be
down the middle I don't mind paying like
to me it really doesn't matter at all I
think if I did offer to pay for the
entire bill the date would feel
emasculated you shouldn't but I
understand that I can't discredit all of
how society makes a man feel I sort of
like the rule that whoever asked the
person out like if you're the person
that suggested the date you should pay
at the very least split the bills
splitting a meal
totally fine I think it gets romantic
later when you're in a relationship
where like you don't even talk about it
and someone will be like I got this one
and you'll be like I got the next one
because you just know that you're in it
to win it
and like you'll pay each other back
later
50 years from now that will be a thing
we're like on a first date you won't
know if the man or woman is supposed to
pay you know better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
