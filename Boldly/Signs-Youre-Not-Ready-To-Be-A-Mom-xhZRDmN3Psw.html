responsibility my parents always like me
how you'd be so amazing at it but I
don't buy it
even if I'm one day late just one day
late I'm like you're the son of a mother
yet you what I mean too scary I'm not
pregnant
cheers to that it's like whenever I hold
a baby I flip the head could just like
wiggle off or I don't know where to put
my hands and then you're afraid that
you're gonna drop the baby I can't live
with breaking a baby but also you watch
videos on the internet and they're super
durable and they just get up right after
falling down toss them up catch them
they're like footballs sometimes I
forget that babies are actually people
they just seem like little drunk Goggins
I'm scared that I'm gonna lose myself in
a baby I don't want my identity to be
mom I don't want to change I guess
I'm worried I'm too selfish to do this
sometimes you know but maybe you're
never 100% ready
I don't know hey Minnie huh tell me get
thing on one year
thanks for listening I ramble but one
day I might have to listen to you so
it's a trade-off you'll get it and the
best thing never happened to me
how can a baby that is so cute be so
sweet like meeting the perfect person
and you're like I'm not ready you know
what I mean I'm flawed I'm not saying
you are you're great
my whole life I've resisted change and
there couldn't be a bigger change than
being responsible for another life it's
really scary
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
