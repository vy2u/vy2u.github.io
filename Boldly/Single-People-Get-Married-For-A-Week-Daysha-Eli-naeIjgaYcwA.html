he says that he used um to moisturize it
over I feel like it moisturize penises
but you know
hi I'm data anomaly and we're gonna need
when we're getting married
he's trying to just contain it all cuz
he doesn't want the whole world to know
how much he loves me and being near me
but he's excited welcome it's a studio
Janell our love I enjoy being single to
be honest unless you add to my life I
don't need you you you push the cart or
I push the cars really you have the cart
just push it I'm pretty much in a
simulation of my worst fear why is it so
hard for you to admit your mistakes why
I'm cornering me I hate communication
what can I do
um and how do I please you which is like
a key for any good relationship talk to
me I'll talk we already bicker like a
married couple like might as well just
move together put a ring on it you're
gonna put me in the closet I'm not I'm
your husband not a dog day well then I
hope you be ate this really knows how to
push my buttons so to me quite the
bootcamp I just hope that we can make it
out still friends
I'm not jealous on my leg Gerwin it's
been days when don't you and me one two
three
marriage gonna be great why is it touch
my face I have to like clean out a
drawer for him looks like a teenager's
bedroom enhance is really nice you can
sleep in here so think of like the
terrible moment right before you break
up with your girlfriend or boyfriend
that was me in deja the first two days
how much inspirational quotes everywhere
listen you really need inspirational
quotes while you're pooping is right
yeah I have inspirational quotes in my
house day one was a show I think
that Eli really wants a traditional kind
of wife why don't you tell me what you
like to eat and I'll figure out how to
make it healthy in some kind of way okay
if you can make chicken wings healthy
I'll actually marry bad I'm sorry
there's no other way to say it but he
eats pure trash oh we got a good one
okay I'm okay when we do I do why oh
hell yeah yeah first night was rough
monkey you do dishes or we can do dishes
together as a happy married couple or
you could just do dishes
I love the way you scrub I'll even sleep
it was so uncomfortable if you have a
problem with the size of the bed there's
a couch over there with your name on it
it was there was not good times
so I sent you a text message earlier the
first thing that he texted me back is
are you serious well she was like how
was your day and I it's been a while I
hate texting I couldn't take it
seriously I was just like busy it hasn't
been going the best but we're working on
it and
the key to a loving marriage I think
that our marriage was off to a great
start just by that so we went to salsa
class together we're on our way to salsa
he's so excited look at his a climate
whatever to make me happy it's fine
anyone think yeah sure that guy can
dance hell no I'm scared I look like a
drunk t-rex looking for a burrito
thank you actually that's a very
accurate conviction with you okay that
was probably the first lesson to the
Merrit situation having to do something
you don't want to do to make the other
person happy we have a week to get you
ready for Amy's party who's Amy she was
just in class with us we're going to a
birthday party this is a perfect
marriage cuz he doesn't listen to me so
Thursday I plotted out a surprise for
Eli it was such a good one hiding
somewhere in front of your eyes if you
get my question right you'll find your
surprise honestly at that point I was
like dead tired I knew she was doing
something nice but I was just like what
are we like what's when's my birthday
Oh July no June longest how do you suck
at this soul yeah he failed miserably on
the first two questions when's my
birthday I'm like I don't know any of
these things you have been married for
like years what do you use to do laundry
do my laundry no no this yes is that oh
honey how did you know the most like
Hispanic beer you could find you are and
I made plans this morning for him to
come with me to cardio bar this mofo is
already flaking out on me I feel like my
marriage is a sham
I think I'm destroying this husband
thing does bow flowers favorite colors
purple bow chocolates can't beat this
I'll crush in the game
I turned my eye and then all of a sudden
there's flowers and chocolate and a card
I guess he's an okay husband I feel like
that was actually when we had our
breakthrough and that was when like
everything just started to get a little
smoother I feel like I now have to step
my wifey game up because the gauntlet
has been thrown down I think that I'm
gonna try I'm like plan a little secret
picnic now it away yeah baby I'm
such a good way that was like amazing
I'm so used to just like battling with
her so I was like you know I'm gonna be
a little romantic you know I'm saying
I'm like yo girl out on the town got you
got UFC fights we got
so he wanted to bring me into the part
of his life that means a lot to him and
that's hooters I guess yeah cute moment
we ran over the fountain thing together
wrestling and fountains really proud
okay
Hooters oh good job duder hey where's
Briggs everybody okay I did what she
wanted to do with the salsa dancing to
make her happy and she went to Hooters
with me to you know make both of us
happy we went back to my house and we
played basically never have I ever
ela and I are really gonna get to know
each other yeah totes
she'll be awesome we were drinking he
drank the beer that I gave him any
wanted to complain about really got to
know each other on a deeper level which
was really cool when he and I had those
like cute downtime moments that's what I
valued the most from our time together
to one mega good job Saturday was soft
the night
homegirl says 7 o'clock right we got to
get there at 7 o'clock what time is it
it's like 7:45 I'll admit I was in the
wrong I was taking forever to get ready
late to our first gathering thanks to
the missus getting ready for a couple
more drinks as the night progressed it
felt real a little bit he was my caramel
passion salsa him feel so in touch with
my roots I told her one song and a beam
too
and there being three songs or songs
five songs it was it could have been
worse yeah fine salsa is fun okay salsa
boo-ki and flutter last night together
no no I mean I'm really gonna miss a lot
of things probably most of how close you
live to work I can't wait to get you out
my house Oh Lucy come on what you know
cook you a snoring super loud last night
well I was it's still last night I want
you to remember me there just requires a
lot of work a lot more work than I have
time to put into it right now am I gonna
miss it hell no I'm gonna miss it oh my
god no it's been wild cookie but you
gotta go I think marriage is having that
rider die homie that's always there for
you know no matter what he said that you
know I was probably the best wife he's
ever had and that was my goal I just
wanted to hear him say those words so
that I could make it into the video and
I could play it on repeat every time he
wants to start with me it taught me how
to communicate how to sacrifice my time
it's like a roller coaster ride there's
ups and downs but through the whole time
it's exciting but also you fear your own
life it showed me that I'm just not
ready to get married right now and I
think that that's okay because I'm
really young and there I have a lot of
living to do just let our guard down
this once and say just say yes yes
Stacia I will miss you okay I miss you
you are
