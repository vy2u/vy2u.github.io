hi I'm Jen hi I'm Kelsey and we're going
to get married for one week also we
barely know each other
I've been in relationships I've never
been in one that I would say is like
particularly serious didn't you say you
clean I am maybe the most single I've
ever been my face is really smooth
bright it's gonna be chaotic trying to
find a balance between work still being
able to take care of myself but also
putting someone above me all those two
things when I'm talking to someone new
if something goes wrong like my
immediate thought is abort like get all
the women and children firstly if it
it's a bear you can't tell it looks like
a shock that's been jism we're staying
at her place which I am so uncomfortable
with a lemon food I don't know what I'm
gonna do I had a burger it tonight even
it's awkward and even if something gets
weird with me and Kelsey it's like no we
have to spend time together at the very
worst I make like a better friend
best-case scenario we I'm trying to
think of like what to say
do you can't really look at you right
now she can't go to my house because
she's allergic to cats which this would
never work out anyways because I'm never
gonna marry someone who doesn't like
cats oh my gosh you can phone me down
what a lovely healthy my softness you
got cutter nails it's exactly how you
imagined she's like this in real life
it fell over I'm so excited what I meant
to say was are you okay I'm fine here's
the thing about Jay it was hard for me
to adjust to the lifestyle that genly's
didn't you say you're clean is it messy
I mean what are these this is the
cleanest this room has been in like
eight months your bed moves I know that
I have like books underneath it to keep
it from moving but they don't really
work you want next
yeah once we were alone on the first
night that's when it sort of sunk in
where it was like it like we have to get
along we have to find things to talk
about and we have to be willing to like
open up a little bit Jenna and I decided
to look at each other's tinder profiles
and decided to read to each other's
tinder profile we're in a weird 2016
relationship
we're very open yours just as in two
burritos yours just as former
professional football I feel like you
are so much more than just one line a
form I mean I feel the same but marriage
is about finding tinder matches for each
other in this case best part about being
married get you couple a day two we went
to work I brought our ice cream I don't
see anyone sitting here for a month
apparently I didn't know where my wife
said but I'm gonna go visit her now this
is here highway me what I might scream
that's so nice it kind of made me feel
like a pretty wife at that point I was
not in the head space of being like
what's a nice thing I could do to my
wife do for my wife well I guess uh yeah
you go again
my bed is on wheels and it constantly
moved some tarnish of a book underneath
the wheels so stop I'm not helping it on
like why don't you try a shoe or like
wine up pieces sugar packet wife number
two coming in you really expect you just
put another 2x perfect on another flat
surface hoping that it was gonna stop it
that works for me Wyatt Thursday night
we went to Shake Shack with Kelsey's
friends Jen this is my best friend
Jeffery never you be my wife Jen what do
you think he's ham ksham ski no no I
meant if you're dating someone are
married to someone you have to win their
friends over they have to like you it
was at this point that I started to
realize like as much as fun as I was
having I felt kind of drained we were
too afraid to like leave each other
alone even in silence for too long like
you good great okay I'm gonna go onto my
computer now okay great I'm gonna go on
my phone now and check snapchat I am as
big as your bed there's no
room for error in this bed do you just
scare yourself was there good yeah like
freaked me out Saturday night was Jen's
date we went to a paint and sip pottery
place I am done buddy thing is beautiful
I just really the kind of resembles a
vagina you're much better than painting
tonight I think don't think so I
appreciate the sentiment Kel Stacy you
said my name again does this week when
she says everyone's name after cocking
you're right Kelsey I did it and went
and saw the new divergent movie she had
not seen any of the divergent movies and
I am like obsessed with him and she went
just because I want me to see it what's
the movie going experience any different
from then going by yourself there was
more talking which was I wanted like to
see a movie that she wanted to see more
than I didn't want to see a movie that I
didn't want to see Sunday we got up
early trying to poop at Jenn's I can't
we went to a dessert tasting fair after
like the third dessert I felt like I was
gonna puke suddenly knocked all the
cream out of Kelsey's cookie onto the
tape
I have never met from one more country
right now the food was really just a
vehicle to like break the wall for us to
talk about other deep like we
talked about proving her pants yeah and
then we also talked about like race
relations yeah and then tonight we're
going to play Settlers okay which
neither of us have played before now
we're actually about to lose Settlers of
Catan you have any advice for a healthy
relationship Ally and don't live
together so we're we're definitely
getting divorced it was good having
Kelsey there because I kind of felt like
she was my anchor like if I felt a
little bit uncomfortable Fife a little
bit awkward she was someone that I could
lean on denial of it I'm very
comfortable with physical contact today
is Monday and it's our final day of
marriage and I wanted to do something
nice for Kelsey so to do that I'm gonna
make like a little stop-motion video I
had posted this thing on Instagram that
I thought said always seek the giant as
in like always go like seek your battles
and like be a boss has bit it didn't
actually say always seek the giant it
actually said always seek the light but
I think she just misread it and posted
it it wasn't cursive and like I kind of
dyslexic and so all weekend long we were
just talking about always take the giant
how like much cooler of a phrase that
was your last day of being married
she said hey guys show me something I
was like sure she opened up her computer
it was a beautiful stop-motion video and
it said always seeking a giant and she
had made that for me I just want to like
end on a high note I think it would be
cool to end on a high note I have never
had a friend do something that nicer me
was like really touching a really sweet
it was like the best ending I'm a
divorced woman at 22
honestly like I think I'm gonna miss her
I mean we would like laid bed at like
10:30 every night and then we'd start
talking and we literally like Lapera
phones it would be 2:30 in the morning
anytime I feel awkward or uncomfortable
like we had to fight through it so what
that sort of like reinforced for me is
just this idea that like I need to not
give up so easily
I can put other people first without
totally losing the things that make me
strong like being workaholic and being
into
just because you want to love somebody
else doesn't mean that you lose those
things about yourself go marry stranger
mm-hmm you'll make a background out of
it yeah that's it best man I be so good
no I feel crushed
