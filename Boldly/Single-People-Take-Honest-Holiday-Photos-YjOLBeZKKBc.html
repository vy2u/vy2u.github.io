name is Izzy and I'm single years Ben
okay it was a rough year majority of my
year I wasn't single and now I am it's
been a little lonely really busy with
work not a lot of time to be out and
about on the dating scene we try and
find solace and your friends and you do
the single girl thing it's hard to date
in LA I played that way just been
spending a lot of time at home alone
I've gotten a lot of help throughout
this year from a really unlikely source
the best part about it is that it's
there when I need it I don't have to
worry about it be cold or hot I don't
you know I just go home and it's there
for me the one thing that got me through
the year is of course chicken wings it
some wine my vibrator changed my life
her name is Leslie
wine has been the one thing that's
really just been there for me this year
it's been my only strength when you know
I've had a really hard day at work or
when another person has mysteriously
disappeared off of tinder this is like
totally normal for us we take Instagram
pictures all the time I rather so four
very photogenic
I would love everyone to know about my
love I've kind of been hiding it a
little bit but I think I'm ready to just
let everyone know you know without one
special thing in my life has been in the
world to know them I love you know I've
been really quiet about this for a while
but I'm ready to let it out okay I'm
gonna be proud of my chicken wing luck
so cuz when I was by myself that was the
one thing that was there for me you know
I go grocery store I called pizza place
always there
there's probably most intimate bow
should ever had everything Leslie has
helped me not only to feel less lonely
but to find pleasure in my life
I'm really looking forward to seeing as
tomorrow yeah you especially
me and Pino had kind of a crazy night
last night I am so very excited to see
how our card turned out I'm really
excited I really want to see this but we
are excited to see our holiday card we
look so domestic oh I do I love her so
much
look how happy I am Lesley really is my
better half oh I'm gonna send this to
everybody I know that would be such a
jerk if I didn't send this card to
everyone my co-workers my dentist my guy
out back there I'm a therapist I'm a
just like blasted on social media so
like my ex could see and see this and be
like he's doing so well my advice to
anyone who has a lovely Lesley in their
life is go for it I think if you have
something that you love this much it
should be included in your family
holiday card everyone has their thing
that makes them happy if it's chicken
wings make it know be proud of your love
of chicken wings because that's what
puts a smile on your face and you
shouldn't feel bad about that it's gonna
be great holiday season we're gonna
spend a lot of time together and it's
gonna be a great new year and I
just have no more of this in the new
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
