Zack hi I'm Kelsey what's up I'm Jen I'm
single as I'm I'm super
single I'm gonna wear a wedding ring for
one week where's my bling
never been married don't plan on it I
like myself a lot and so that's why I'm
not married yeah every time I log on to
Facebook there's somebody getting
married somebody getting engaged a lot
of people are gonna be like wow this
fifteen-year-old asian boy got married
so young all right
oh my own little blue box it's not the
real blue box whoa I feel like I'm in
Sweet Home Alabama
Kelsie said that it looked like a
ring and now I can't get that out of my
mind look at it I'm Reese Witherspoon
this is from Patrick Dempsey oh my god
how does this work why are there two
what do you mean it's the wrong hand
yeah I have big fingers it's already
lost bring out my tongue hmm
I get distracted easily so the sounds of
things tapping can really just drive me
crazy
like one of those girls on Facebook
who's like obviously I'm gonna marry a
woman someday but because this ring is
like so fake and big and kind of ugly
I'm picturing my fiance as a guy like
this is the ring my first husband gave
me before I leave him for our nanny so
you're quite almost married yeah do you
know can you tell me which one goes on
top and which one goes on bottom I'm
pretty sure the wedding ring goes on the
outside because
goes on you know after your wedding
injury oh I'm here with Rodney and we
just discovered that we got the same
wedding ring look at that boom
do you think I pull it off well you do
and I actually saw that in the meeting
yeah I was just like wait what someone
went to Vegas I just looked over there
and I was like hey can't a wedding ring
on isn't a weirdest sight of a receipt
I'm married girl well is what you got
now one person has noticed are not one I
saw before from you what did you think
it was it looks like a massive letter
and when you're weird you don't think I
would actually need gays anyway no I'm
at work like trying to finish my video
and this ring it's getting in
the way of my typing I hate it I really
hate it doesn't seem very natural you're
eating fries is this way
trying to make breakfast burritos here
having up the avocado and I can't do
anything with my hand that's a good
thought I'll give a wedding ring deviant
I can't do ring
that's like animate it's 2:00 a.m. and
I'm having my car towed because I lost
my key but luckily my engagement ring
which I had left inside the car not get
stolen I don't have anyone to come pick
me up but I do have my engagement ring
still I woke up and I've been cleaning
my room and I just realized I have no
idea where my wedding ring is oops I
forgot my ring at work because I took it
off because it was so hard to type go to
my car see if my ring is in here oh
thank how do people not lose their rings
all the time you take it off to wash
your hands take it off to go to sleep
take it off to go to the gym never let
it get away again oh
 I just dropped my wedding ring in
the toilet okay so I met a beer festival
right now where there's a ton of like
single hot people and no one's hitting
on me because I think
block on my head so I like to check my
fellow married Fred here
unexpected park of a wedding rings you
can get a ton of takeout and they
assume it's for you and your wife and
not just for you you need a lot of sushi
and where's your ring so Nick and I were
just talking about our wedding rings and
realized that I've lost my wedding band
clearly you're failing a marriage so I
have a date tonight and that is staying
here I'm just no wedding ring
oh wait that's all done well I think
this explains it but I still think
occurring got it got it
forgot it yeah wedding ring I will use
everything and I am amazed that I did
not lose this basically the experience
was fine mentally I realized that I have
a lot of people in my life who don't
believe that anyone could actually love
me like eventually whenever I do get
married the ring should probably be
cheap because I'm like losing it didn't
change the amount that people hit on me
because no one hits on me when you have
like a wedding ring your engagement ring
it's like you're showing the world like
hey like there I found someone that I
love and I'm committing myself to that
person and that in itself is like a very
cool thing overall I think a wedding
ring is a lot of responsibility and I
like not having responsibilities maybe
it's a sign that I'm just not ready to
be committed and that single looks best
on me also do you see the burn marks on
my toes accidentally with my toe on fire
