Nick I'm single
sometimes you're better off just like
texting with some person that you don't
even know exists then like dealing with
the bull of an actual boyfriend I think
you know everybody wants someone to talk
to
maybe this like feel some sort of
emotional void that people can't fill in
any other way
the dangers are definitely that you can
get completely sidetracked into thinking
that you do have a boyfriend and then
you'll be sorely disappointed when
you're 100 texts are up okay here we go
okay Wow what's his name max Gregory
George three first names Stuart max
fantasmic his name is Caleb J Mitchell
right now okay chooses interests debate
club
no skydiving yeah jump out of a plane
for me why I'm tasting I look just like
wine drinking a lot wow this is so cool
look at Stuart fantaz Nate hey lieu next
George oh look at your little person I
wonder if you like texting back
immediately or if he's gonna be one of
those like I'm gonna wait an hour and
then I'm gonna text her back we get into
a steamy romantic convo can't what's the
point of an invisible boyfriend if I
can't sext with him Alaska is helping me
decide what to text back my boyfriend
because I have no game you should
escalate this quickly
Netflix and chill no sexy max has
stopped talking to me
I write him three times and got in their
response so I've scheduled a message so
that he has to ride me I'm in a fight
with my invisible boyfriend already and
Nick is trying to sex mine is being all
sexual but like we're not supposed to be
sexual it was like um
my butt is starting ZAR her and I was
like you know what you're doing so I
read the scheduled message and it said
you are wonderful just so you know which
is adorable until you read the message
above which is me just hurling abuse at
him for not replying so I got to hear my
invisible boyfriend's voice for the
first time quite nervous for some reason
I don't know why I think it just makes
everything more real so excited to hear
his voice like before I went into this
room I think that's tick on and then I
was like no it's an invisible boyfriend
he's not gonna see you you're crazy
I'm just getting a message guys night
tonight this should last you long um
want me to be calm when I get home
hey you only know I had a great time
legit against oppressive calling right
so is so weird it sounds so boring
he's only dirtier than I thought he
would he sounds like he's got a really
good body is that where things is hey so
I asked my boyfriend where this
relationship is going and I felt like
there's a disconnect between
because he barely speaks to me and that
actually got him to be nice back and
then I was like you know what are your
questions that I even know and so even
though she started talking this our
second or last day with our fake
boyfriends thank God
mine's ghosting me right now um and
Nick's faked a car accident
yeah we're not about it my boyfriend's
not that believable because he changed
his personality every five seconds from
boring to more boring facts just a bit
boring again so literally my invisible
boyfriend is breaking up with me right
now
Oh so I said look I pay for these texts
why don't you at least try to be
interesting and he said I'm trying to be
interesting maybe we just don't have
anything in common this is like a new
low in my life I have never been more
excited to break up with someone in my
life I think the idea behind it is to
use it as a cover-up for when friends
also you have a boyfriend or parents so
I think that that reason it's good
you're talking to like a fake real
person because they think they seem a
little real but there's just something
that's not real my one barely spoke like
he'd replaced me with like three words
and it was like getting blood out of a
stone it was really annoying I don't
know if they're trying to like mirror
what actual straight dudes are like to
talk to but you nailed it I learned more
about what I want in a boyfriend
actually I I kind of know what kind of
personality I like now more I want
someone who's going to like come to me
first and make me feel
Caleb and I are done and I hope you
didn't throw in the name Caleb for me
it's a really hot name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
