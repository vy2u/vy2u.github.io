cookie said I have a chip on my shoulder
taking that one go for it yeah yes yes
that was a that was a funny funny laugh
with your explanation of cookie joke
okay a list of 49 cookie jokes
it's not here it's not here the cookie
patch on his shoulder a chip only shows
how good a cookie that's so stupid
ik chip okay shyffilis
the cookie had a chip on his shoulder
maybe the cookies in metaphor for the
relationship with Justin and I you know
like we look sweet and delicious on the
outside but once we hit adversity we
just crumble and we both have shoulders
and no it's just a stupid cookie joke
that I don't understand my friend at
work told this joke and everybody
laughed at it and I didn't understand it
it was about this stupid little cookie
and how the cut of the chip on the
shoulder ah that's a classic you
understand me what's wrong with me
what's wrong
there's a cookie with the shoulder
shoulder and cookies doesn't matter
just wait the HR what Zach what time is
it it's 3:45 in the morning Justin what
are you doing here
cookies do not have shoulders humans
babies even hamsters they all have
shoulders but cookies do not therefore
making your joke illogical it does not
make any sense
Zach that joke is a play on the
expression chip on your shoulder and
chocolate chip cookies Oh y'all that job
sucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
