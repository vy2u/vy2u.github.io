think your first picture should be you
with spider-man why not let's take a
photo okay right come on who's not
liking that
I understand making the first picture so
a picture cuz I hate when I'm like which
one are you
and then it's never the cute one Sofia I
trust you with this area I see Sofia
time like yes mmm wait your hair sorry
my hair is the exact same now what's
that say I feel like that's
representative of what you look like on
a day-to-day basis you get the whole
body shot too cuz you need the whole
body can't just be close-ups of your
face ladies what do you want out of this
app are you looking for love are you
just looking for a knight cute super
cute I also like that she looks a lot
like Britney he was like that's the one
you could say if you talk to her you hit
it off you say yo I got this date in
mind
take her to a lake bring her some pokey
BAM I feel like Chris is just looking at
women for him nope
yeah I got lost alright so we got a
message from oh she says so what
spider-man like in real life I'm gonna
put pretty clingy
everyone likes her prefecture this post
cute I texted do you like period jokes
ha not sure try me
our philosophy on texting is like
someone sends you a message and there
has to be something to go off otherwise
order yeah you have to build on what
they're giving you otherwise you're just
trying to end the conversation I've been
wearing tampons all week and it's not
even my period I just want to feel close
to something that's a great dating over
there how's your day today well I just
went for a run everyone likes to hear
like oh they run they must really have
their life together should be emoji I
was like you did this yeah no don't
think I like period jokes huh huh well
they're not a match
when you are in a smaller community it's
almost necessary to like find where
they're hiding
you know don't lesbians know the trolls
Wow a lot of the things that lesbians
run into on dating apps are a lot of
couples being like we're looking for a
third so it's good because this is a
lesbian so we're not gonna run into that
a lot of mainstream dating sites don't
have many options for your sexuality
they don't have that many options for
your gender
it's very binary on a lot of other
websites and I think this will
definitely be a lot less heteronormative
which is pretty cool
the thing that we learned after every
video is that lesbians and straight
people are totally both totally
different it's not like we're all human
and at the end of the day it's just love
no no no we're totally different just
kidding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
