is my girlfriend rose and then they'll
be like oh it's so cute
or they'll like make her motto you'll
see that face just fresh and were they
like oh homo he would ask me to meet him
from work and I was his friend it's
quite easy to hide I think because he
can just say I'm going to see my friend
he wasn't really allowed to meet my
family and it all had to be very
hush-hush on my side it's quite common
to be in a relationship where one person
is an owl or one person's family don't
know which can make it really difficult
you can still walk down the street and
feel uncomfortable holding your
partner's hand the kids you might get
your person the stairs there are both
definitely points where you're
subconsciously stopped holding hands
because you'll see somebody who you
think might be I don't know giving you a
weird look or something we call it lesbo
heckling and I had somebody want shout
that's disgusting after I kissed
somebody on a train station platform I
think we like snugged a few like blocks
down and now we get mistaken for
siblings all the time like it happens
every week I mean I don't know anyone
that would go to a street just ask two
random people if they're siblings and
we've done it that similar do we know
everyone thinks we do maybe if you put
your hair up like in a quiff like that
maybe that has been on one occasion
actually when we checked into a hotel
and the guy for we're all our business
trips you've got two separate bedrooms
there's an initial power struggle I
think between a lot of gay couples being
asked to the woman in a relationship is
it's like just because you know you
might be a bottom that instantly makes
you the female half of the relationship
it's not true at all
I think straight couples definitely
think oh well you know if you want sex
you can just go and do it it's not so it
takes some preparation on someone's
behalf
they will assume that you are friends
automatically I mean unless like you're
both like super gay looking but even
then straight people seem to be like
blind to that pressure I feel by some
people to make you feel that your life
has to be somehow different or your
relationship does not mean or is not
what the same equal merit is theirs and
that you don't have the same feelings
for each other sometimes you get so used
to like oh my god that's cute oh that's
nice for you that when people are like
totally normal with it you're like
what's wrong not good enough for you I
mean I want to be able to walk down the
street and hold my boyfriend's hand and
it not be stirred up what needs to be
more widely accepted is is feeling that
relationships are just as equal as well
when they don't you know they aren't
separate or different or less than
anything there's definitely still
struggles but yeah I think it will one
day no one will have to come out maybe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
