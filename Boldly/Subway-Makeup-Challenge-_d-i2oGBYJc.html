challenge New York versus LA challenge
accepted but scared of challenge we're
gonna be trying to do our eyeliner and
our lipstick without ruining everything
I am very nervous yeah I'm gonna poke an
eye out I have a really shaky hand I'm
not gonna lie I could not be a surgeon
honestly I think that New York's gonna
do better than uh probably I'm not a
regular subway makeup artist but I have
done it when I've been in a pinch before
so I'm excited to work on this skill all
right let's go do this all right fine
alright let's go for it I'm nervous mom
I have my mirror from 2007 with a
picture of me and the Jonas Brothers on
it so my heartbeat is like going really
fast I'm so nervous you guys
oh okay we have a little clumping your
office okay we are out of stop get sick
man oh yeah that's smart I am going to
sir my eyeliner now because it is softy
actually I don't think this one is not
bad the question is do I have vision
insurance because I might need it
rocky times ahead this is that very fast
trade yeah this is an exceptionally fast
rate
mine has like a wing growing out of my
wing like Who am I who's that bad
what do we think doing later even soft I
cannot even look at you right now I
think so this lighting is just like not
I need my other hand to like pull hold
it again I'm not Catholic but I keep
having the urge to cross my skin like
where everything's falling apart I'm
putting on my mascara now it's honestly
not that hard maybe because I just don't
give a fuck anymore
it looks like my grandma how do I go
from Britney Spears to any white house
in two seconds I don't know
thank you Kylie Jenner get at me I'm not
bad that's a good look
wow I'm impressed with myself I'm really
disappointed in myself okay I see myself
looking worse this is a straight left on
that side five four three two this is
that okay not happy with that but we're
living
feel great so that was a wild ride I
wasn't into it my heart was beating
really quickly I felt scared we look
good but I still believe in the New York
people more than us I feel ridiculous
it's my lip stain is all over my butt
you look good thank you
I used to do my makeup on the train in
high school but I definitely did not use
liquid eyeliner at that time I had to
like do one wing it was perfect do the
other wing okay was too big now we're at
where we're at I just still don't
understand how you did the eyeliner so
straight this is don't get a close-up we
have no more power to the women and the
men that put on their makeup on the
trains it's like go ahead I think you
look good thank you we did it
subway makeup challenge completed ha ha
ha do you smell that chicken somebody
has taken on this trick
