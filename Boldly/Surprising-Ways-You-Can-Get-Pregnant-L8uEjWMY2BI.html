true or false in Canada although a whole
lot I think it's bananas that women can
create life let's do this all right girl
number one or false you can get pregnant
from anal sex that is true true I think
it's true I think it's false true true
it is true what during intercourse the
semen doesn't always end up just in the
rear if it ends up in the vagina
pregnancy can occur after false get
pregnant when you're already pregnant I
know that this is true what no cats can
do it true this strange and extremely
rare phenomenon is called super super
light super cetaceans it occurs when
you're already pregnant and still
ovulating the second fertilized egg
implants in the lining of the womb
resulting in a second pregnancy that is
a great idea for a TV pirate or
something the human body is beautiful
true or false you can get pregnant using
oil-based loops of latex condoms yeah I
go with this all things true I'm gonna
say true it also sounds like you're
doing something wrong we have to break
right yeah I think that's show yeah it's
true
mokona true oil based lubes and
latex condoms don't mix I knew it how
many lubricants are completely safe to
use with condoms real based lubricants
like petroleum jelly are not these types
of lube can degrade the latex and cause
condoms to break increasing your chance
of getting myself look currently there
are gonna get all of these right
you can get pregnant after having
unprotected sex with a man who has had a
mastectomy well now that I'm
know nothing is real and everything is
alive I'm gonna say that's true yeah
should be a false you can't have the
baby like any other form of birth
control vasectomies aren't a hundred
percent effective it can take three
months for spring to completely clear
man's reproductive tracts after
procedure in addition it is possible for
the sniped area to grow back together
true or false you can get pregnant while
you're on your period true true
I think it's true true no you can't no
semen can live inside you for up to five
days I don't know that means if you have
sex toward the end of your bleeding and
you naturally have a short cycle and
ovulate soon after your period ends you
could eventually conduct a bunch of
squatters just squatting up in your
uterus oh you can get pregnant by dry
humping with underwear on real
experience here it's a big old false yes
oh yeah I'm gonna say false I'm gonna
say okay yeah I'm gonna say
follow-through
guess what rare it is possible for the
man's semen
if the man's semen weeks through
clothing and reaches the vagina
you would think underwear would be a
natural barrier if it happens you got
some crazy talent Encinas how Michael
folks was born true or false you get
pregnant after having you tubes tied I'm
gonna say false
yeah but not feigning - what oh no I'm
just gonna true nothing
surprises me anymore and I'm scared true
poop allegation is not 100% effective
still about a 1% chance of getting
pregnant that being said it is still
generally a great way to prevent
pregnancy I'm mad man all these
procedures promise you lies it's also
horribly complicated to do it you can do
what I thought you can hide when tying
my shoes for like 25 years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
