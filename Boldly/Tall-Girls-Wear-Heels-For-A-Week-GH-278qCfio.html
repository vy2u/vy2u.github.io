man but these fields are not dice
I'm pretty confident with my height
except when I'm around people who are
all sort of like in the five three five
four and you go shopping and you're just
like the Green Giant I am nervous about
wearing heels because I try and not seem
tall I do like where I heels
I feel super fly when I wear
heels I'll like walk around and be like
looks so good I get back to my car I
feel like my feet hurt so bad but I also
feel like if I wear heels it's really
aggressive so I don't do that I'm
basically the exact same height as my
boyfriend right now like I don't think
he really cares that if I were taller
than him in heels but I feel insecure
about it for some reason I feel powerful
I think I'm gonna get a lot more
attention I think you're gonna get like
the overt sort of like up and down stare
I'm definitely not getting drunk on
these this would be very bad I'm gonna
scare small children large children
adults I'm gonna scare adults I need to
learn how to stand up straight it's
clear cuz I'm already like know like
don't look at me I'm excited my feet are
not as excited but I'm excited I just
walk back and we were you're shooting to
the office and my feet are killing me
but I'm almost as tall as Garrett which
is a fun thing toilet
is really far away
you're so tall you make me feel shorter
than usual look a giant though look at
these legs I look like a giant so I just
finished being at an award show for the
Latino Student hi I definitely stood out
I was definitely the tallest person and
when I say person I mean man or woman
are beasts really but it was awesome
they put me in VIP and I wasn't VIP but
when you're tall and stand out
apparently it means you're something
okay so this is how tall I am next to
tie what do you think about me being
this much taller than you with my heel
Ellen oh no yeah it's kind of fun I'm
over the like people caring that I'm
taller than them cuz I'm 6-3 in details
but I really would just like my shoes
back so I can't rush the class because I
rebel a fun of my co-workers called me
the Statue of Liberty which I don't
really get Kisatchie of Liberty I think
stands for freedom and not tall women
when overall it's been a great
experience I feel like I will be wearing
heels more often it was a good look for
me I've stopped really noticing my
specific height difference like I'm not
nearly as self-conscious today as I was
the other day about being taller than my
boyfriend I am officially very sick of
work heels I don't want to wear them
anymore so it's been a week it's been a
very long week but an empowering week it
was amazing
I feel sexier more confident it was
interesting for me to have to face my
fear of being really tall a little like
if you put it higher I'm gone my
boyfriend didn't seem to mind at all
which I wonder if it would be different
if we had just started dating but since
we've been dating for a while he just
felt kind of like a baller do you feel
like a baller with the collar
oh yeah there were just so many things
that the 6-inch heels wouldn't let me do
I was like running late to class because
they make me walk walk slower
I had like low grave anxiety about
falling over being bumped into I got a
lot of phone number so that's always
good you know when you're the best dress
in the room like it's a different sort
of energy an energy I liked because
people paid more attention to me I think
I really did get over my fear of that
being the tall girl thing sometimes I
want to wear heels and now I actually
feel like I will yeah cuz no one gives a
 it's just like all in my head yeah
they come they're coming up oh my god
literally my toes are so numb it felt
good to be back on the ground</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
