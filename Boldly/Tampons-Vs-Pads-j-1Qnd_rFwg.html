gentlemen to the debate of this century
tampons versus pads the age-old question
which is better today we're here to find
out ladies let's talk about
comfortability which is more comfortable
pads you don't have to have up your
vagina
I think the perk is that you do get to
have something up your vagina all day
run around play in the pool
don't have any problems pads are like a
pillow for your vagina cuz they're
comfortable you can just slap it on you
don't have to like shove it up there's a
lot of dialogue about pads being awkward
or big or feeling like a diaper but the
truth is just like the tampons there are
different sizes while I'll admit that
shoving a tampon up your dry vagina is
never comfortable once it's up there
though you really can't feel it at all
would you feel comfortable mentally
wearing a tampon and thinking I could be
getting toxic shock syndrome right now
sanitation who is cleaner tampons have
had tampons are very sanitary because I
feel like they attack the source like a
dam you can forget about putting that
tampon up there and then you get toxic
shock syndrome you can't get that from a
pad with a pad you know when you need to
change it because you have a visual and
sometimes sensory cue in terms of the
risks to your body I'm gonna have to
yield this round of pads because tampons
can you know get lost not forever all
very interesting and valid points ladies
now let's get your final statements use
one or the other don't go don't go bear
or gobo wear whatever you want it
whatever makes you feel confident and
strong and beautiful might as well be
the happiest person you can be while
your uterus is being torn out let's get
some guys opinions on this it's time for
the guys round guys
Amba or pad we'll see you next month
tampons are meant to be discreet there's
just a tiny little string I mean even
you can be a stripper in just seven and
get back up on that pole and nobody
would ever know that you were bleeding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
