she's like the girl that I was too
afraid to approach in high school okay
man I don't know what to do I'm like
office of the minimalism so this is
where the challenge comes in do I just
say get she's gonna hate this
hello I'm Jasmine and last time you saw
me I was challenging a 17 year old in a
fashion face-off so I thought it would
be fun to challenge one of my 27 year
old friends to see if they could do the
same thing and style each other for a
going-out look let's bring in my best
bitch Kelsey Oh
hi I'm Kelsey I'm 27 and I am scared
about this so I have picked out a 17
year old Bree oh my god I've always
wanted a sister
have a sister yeah she's so different
from you and truly a team that I would
want to be oh my god I'm so scared
teenagers scare me okay maybe you should
be a little bit scared but let me go get
her okay love you bye do I look good
tell us I think how do you I'm sure I
said my name's Dalia I'm 17 years old
what do you do for fun I listen to
records I go out with my friends I like
to draw I'm just your typical teen
typical teen girl here's Jeremy you see
her she's so cool I feel so insecure
about her she listens to like jazz and
knows about art I don't know anything
what about you what are you interested
in um I like to work I feel like two
movies a week by myself well no I said
it out loud it sounds but I'm not sad
about it I drink wine this is what it's
like being an adult yeah yeah yeah but
like far far far less thing that I've
project we're shopping for each other
for going out looks how would you
describe your style I go by the rule it
needs to be old or look old I'm always
about vintage fashion the very old soul
anything ranging from the 1950s to the
1980s I'm like all about it so tell me
about your style oh okay I'm pretty
pleased I really like minimalistic yeah
like real character to my luck Kelsey's
a lot more into like what I would say is
like the typical fashion of the time now
I see like a lot of people like in like
fashion magazines and especially on like
TV shows who dress like her here's the
thing it's like I don't feel a hundred
percent confident in shop
for myself so there's no way I'm gonna
be able to be on your percent confident
shopping for somebody else are you
excited to do this I'm excited let's do
it all right ladies we are here at
forever 21
you got the whole damn store to yourself
you have 20 minutes I will be checking
in on you and leaving a little surprise
are you ready all right I'm ready okay
bye I feel like I need to play it safe
if I go a little too cray-cray see I
just had Craig pray that's how not cool
I am I'm not gonna lie I'm slightly
nervous for Kelsey to go shopping for
anybody including herself I'm a little
confused by how young she is and how old
she likes to dress my strategy is gonna
be like what would my grandma where
she's dead but like what would she wear
she were alive LC says that she likes
something minimalist I think what I'm
gonna probably do is go for like a cute
top like this my game plan is just to
like kind of work off what I know about
fashion and try then like to use what
she likes
there's no tabular of any of these
clothing that is fine I'm just gonna
pick something up I don't need to worry
about life I immediately went to outfits
with like different lace or embroidery
pattern I found this one skirt that was
sparkly she said she likes glitter and
sparkles this is like her in an outfit
piece but then I remembered she didn't
like skirts and she didn't like
miniskirts then lo and mother can behold
thank you forever 21 gods I go upstairs
and it's the skirt version in a dress we
need to get this thing what do I do
I peel it off the hanger and behind it
is a beautiful even better glittery
dress with more embroidery on it if I
see something I like I'll just pick it
up I have no peripheral vision I saw
something I liked immediately and I kind
of built the outfit around that I was
like oh this is cute and like it could
like work with a bunch of different
things I kind of want to go for
something darker cause when it's a night
on the town you want to be like darker
tones I do like this pant it's just this
is weird why would you put this on the
knees like you're at a soccer game and
put me in coach I swear can play I've
got like five minutes
laughter my challenge and Jazmin comes
out of nowhere with this envelope from
Gossip Girl GOG oh no what are you doing
here I'm flailing I feel like I'm
freaking out it is going as good as it
could be going in this moment right now
really impressed I have a little note
for you you have five minutes left so
you better get you going yeah hold it's
a love letter Kelsie while you're
nearing the finish line you still need
one more thing to meet your deadline an
outfit that features some shine well
that's perfect when jazz kata gave me
the envelope I felt it was a wrench in
my plans but it was a wrench in the
shape of a shooting star does this count
as shine if we is there a way to go
around this I'm on the right track take
that Jasmine you and your letter I don't
care what you got I'm gonna look for
something like a shiny bags you want to
be an expensive woman in these kind of
situations I also think I should add any
more to it we're trying to keep it
minimalistic that means the least amount
of interest as possible I think I'm done
before times up do I just say forget and
go bold she's gonna hate this she'd hate
this I'm a little worried about Kelsey
she's running around like crazy and she
has like eight shirts and no bottoms
what the is she gonna do I panicked
just because I want her to think I'm
cool I know what I'm doing hi don't look
at me for some reason I thought I had
more time than I actually did twenty
minutes seems like it would be a long
time but when you have the whole forever
21 to yourself I kept getting distracted
is exhausting me the most I've worked
out in six months okay shopping I'm
nervous it's as good as it's gonna get
oh boy well with that we're gonna go and
try on now I'm very interested to see
how this is gonna go I've seen both the
looks and I'm truly not sure we are here
and it is time Kelsey do you have any
last words I hope you like it if you
don't please don't tell me because I
will be sad
I just feel like I'm questioning
everything and probably made all the
wrong choices so it's like a typical
Tuesday yeah I think I did pick out a
good going outlook for her I think it
really is hard to pick out an outfit for
someone you can't see it on their body I
think our little baby dolls ready come
on out when I walked out for the first
time I was pretty shocked because it
fits so well and this is like totally
not something that I would pick out
myself in this store it was like a
pleasant surprise love the dress yeah
but you know see I feel like you came in
here with your little like skirt big
fuking sweater on and I knew there was a
hot tamale under there we just had to
open it up I'm very proud of you I had
no clue what I was doing but you came
you came through and you my wish I look
like you yeah I'm elated
Thalia you clearly look amazing but I'm
ready to see Kelsey here we go hope
I make you proud back in the closet if I
may seem calm cool and collected but
inside this noggin everything's
happening at once and it's chaos let's
hope everything works out I think
Kelsey's ready Hey
I actually picked this shirt up and
thought this is hideous
oh this maybe no what am I doing here I
feel like it's a bit of you like it's
yeah very doily grandma style yeah sexy
I was
so happy with the way my outfit turned
out by Dahlia again I this is something
I never would have picked on the hanger
so I guess I learned that from her you
kind of just have to like take a risk
and try something on you normally maybe
wouldn't see that she hate it and then
she put it on and she loves it I think I
did pretty well 27 year olds are all
right you're getting your life figured
out you're suspected to have a job at
this point maybe a stable relationship
but if you don't that's fine cuz you
work with BuzzFeed and you're shopping
for 17 year olds man wow what a what a
wild ride that was I really didn't know
how that was gonna end it just
reaffirmed everything I thought about 17
year olds of that they are so much
smarter and way too cool for me Kelsey
and Dalia are walking out of this
experience with so much more than they
intended
Kelsey never would have picked any of
those clothes for herself and with Dalia
hopefully this opens up dahlias eyes
that she could try a little bit tight
and fitting things too and she can still
be 100% her selves I love challenging my
friends it was so much fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
