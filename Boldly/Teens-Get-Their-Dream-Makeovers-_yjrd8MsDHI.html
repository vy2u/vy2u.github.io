always keeping me back from something
hi my name is Christina and I'm 13 years
old
I'm Skylar and I'm 17 I am obsessed with
the pinup era and like the 40s and 50s
in general I would just love to have
that that kind of makeover I don't
really know what to expect but I'm very
excited to get a makeover I want to
bring out like a style of male clothing
that would look good on me I'm excited
and they're probably gonna make me look
even more better I've always known that
I was different and that I identified
with very feminine things from a very
young age when I was going to the sixth
grade I transitioned I was known for
being the third girl to play a football
at my school and after a while I didn't
want to be the third girl to play I
wanted to be Skylar from there I
transitioned to be Who I am today I
always had insecurities about the way
that I looked because I wasn't really
being able to completely be myself and I
wasn't able to dress how I wanted to I
got bullied for not fitting in with
girls the clothes I wore my Anissa tee
and my weight once I was able to wear
the clothes that I wanted to wear it
definitely boosted my self-confidence
yeah after sophomore year I really
accepted myself as a person and that I
was transgender and my mom helped me out
a lot
we went out to buy all these clothes
from there I started building a style
that I liked and now I feel better about
myself clothes of course play such a
huge role in gender identity how are you
feeling um anxious it took a long time
so I'm really excited to see oh
oh my god I love it yeah who's good I'm
all shy I love it so much
if you are a trans person that is in the
beginning stages up for transition or is
just coming out to their family I want
to let you know that it's going to be
scary and then it's getting really
really hard it's okay to be scared but
once you are able to live is your joint
authentic self it is all going to be
worth it taking that chance to make that
decision
will change your life it feels so great
to be able to know and feel like you can
just be yourself than everyone else it's
recognizing me for that it believed just
the happiness
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
