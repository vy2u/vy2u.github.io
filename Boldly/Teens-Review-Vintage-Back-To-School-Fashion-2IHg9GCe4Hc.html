I just have really bad memories today we
are reviewing back to school fashion
throughout history
my favorite back-to-school arrow is
definitely the seventies because I
really love bell-bottoms I think they're
super flattering
I think definitely than Ivy's I'm
jealous of the people that could wear
like that clothes and they were cool
it's a toss-up between the 80s and the
90s that I really love the
experimentation bring on the trends Wow
plaid Wow oh it's plaid she's wearing a
plaid dress he's wearing plaid pants and
she's wearing a plaid skirt and they're
all the same type of plaid it's just
like very excessive amount of quad I
think lot is a little too clueless for
me I'm digging the kind of smock look
it's retro I'm gonna guess this is
probably 90s like it's so 90s to me I
wanted to say seventies know the sixties
I believe is where this is from it's
funny I've been looking for a pair of
plaid pants like this so if anyone knows
where I can find some oh my god whoa all
right first of all the first thing I
thought I was this girl looks like a
shoe Stinson here we have these
beautiful jeans the Lowell waistband the
stripe of skin above the hemline
and kind of horrified these are both
Abercrombie and Fitch I don't know who I
don't even know if Abercrombie and Fitch
is still a thing
maybe it is I think so funny how
everyone in ever crombie and Fitch ads
all look exactly the same like they all
have the same haircut the same bone
structure the same I just got finished
with rugby and then the leopard print
and the crazy hair crimping and curls
and Flatiron and oversized boots this
looks like early 2000s early 2000s I
knew it definitely early 2000s knew it
like that was the one era totally like
the most clear did like stand out and
like not in the best way I'm not sure
what trends are happening here I really
like the layering I like the heavier
jackets and the like black like
pantyhose stockings that are like
completely not even remotely see-through
just a lot of like flannel I think that
this is like the sixties era
I want to see 70s
I feel like I'm totally wrong 7d ok
seventies Wow my least favorite this
looks very 80 supermodel to me love it
these are two different kinds of denim
jackets one of them is like a really
nice boxy cut and then the other one is
kind of like a marching band style
jacket I like that the the brows are
really big and the hair was very fluffy
and almost kind of like an easygoing
relaxed vibe early 90s so close for the
eighties I think that this is the late
80s I think my favorite era was
definitely the 80s I like that natural
beauty was celebrated back then if I
could go back to any era I think that I
would pick the 90s for sure I was
definitely surprised by some of the
trends that I thought were from a
specific era and I was totally wrong so
it just kind of shows how fashion in a
way recycles itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
