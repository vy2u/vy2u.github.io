slept walked into the bathroom and took
in the garbage can next to the toilet
didn't wake me up and then also didn't
tell me about that until a couple of
years later so thanks mom
for keeping that under wraps I'm sure I
would not live that down with my with my
family I was about 13 or 14 and I had a
girl over and kind of you know it was
just kind of like a family hangout we
were watching a movie we're all in the
couch and I was reaching back for a
pillow and as I reached back
I grabbed my mother's breasts and she
looked at me and she went I I just
grabbed a pillow and enjoyed the rest of
the movie while quietly freaking out so
I got dumped by my girlfriend's friend
on an answering machine in front of my
mother
she knew she knew exactly how to treat
it and she didn't want to talk about it
which I appreciated I was home from
college made my parents so I felt like
in adults for the first time the topic
turns to sex and and so my parents asked
they were like what do you what do you
think about sex I said if you want me to
be truthful mom and dad I think I prefer
a good
and my mother without even hesitating
says oh you are just like your father
and she came and ran and jumped into the
fight and then she was like holding on
to him and swinging him around and it
got to the point where I was like man I
really I feel I started to feel sorry
for the guys who tried to fight me
though that y'all really walked up the
wrong tree cuz she's not gonna stop
think I want to thank my mother for
tolerating me I definitely want to thank
my mom for always having my back mom
thank you for keeping me out of jail I
want to thank my mother for being a good
sport I love her I think my mom for for
teaching me that women burp loudly MA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
