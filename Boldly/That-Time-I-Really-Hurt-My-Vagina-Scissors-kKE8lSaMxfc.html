before which um sounds horribly painful
but the labia is quite painful as well
so um there was one time where I was
down below with a pair of scissors
trimming in different places I think
there's a moment when you start and
you're very intimidated and then you
feel like you're conquering the bush and
you get a little more scissor happy I
guess trim happy
I just distinctly remember one time
where I just got some skin in the
scissor and just snipped it right off
just snipped it right off um that hurt a
lot there's a lot of blood I didn't know
what to do
because you can't really put a bandaid
on your labia but I just put a pad in my
underwear and had to go on with my day
and it's less of a shave it was more of
like a Knick that is still visible to
this day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
