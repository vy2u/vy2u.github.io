vagina and I just want to hit it
on everything I was about like 14 15
years old and this lake we would go to
had a competitive slalom skiing course
and I was super into competitive
waterskiing and like wakeboarding so you
have to go as quick as you can
across the wake of the boat so the
faster the boat is going the smaller the
wake the faster you can cut it's all the
math that makes it possible anyway we're
going fast as hell I'm cutting back and
forth getting it and I hit an edge I try
to save myself so I overcorrect lose my
balance and my back leg comes out of the
comes out of the sleeve and I just smack
into the water as fast and as hard as I
ever have in my life with my legs spread
wide open so many cubic meters of water
just jammed up my vagina and my butt
hole and it hurt so bad it was
literally paralyzed I could not swim I
was literally just floating there crying
I had literally just been raped by lake
water in both holes my mom circles back
around in the boat sees that I'm crying
and not moving in the water
oh no what's wrong what's wrong I
literally just was like just don't touch
me
just don't touch me and I literally just
bobbed in the water for like five
minutes as I prepared myself to try and
move finally I was in a dull enough pain
where I could move my legs and I got
back up on the boat and it hurt to sit
down but I sat down and like literally
it was just like I I felt like I was in
shock just like oh my god like I didn't
want to touch the water anymore and
let's just say going to the bathroom
that evening was very interesting
because it all came back out yeah so
that would be my vagina my painful
vagina stories
anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
