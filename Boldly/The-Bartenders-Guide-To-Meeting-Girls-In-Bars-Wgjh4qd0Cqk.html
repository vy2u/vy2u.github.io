are successful I pick an alumina bar or
don't really have pickup lines their
pickup lines aren't pickup lines
don't say line don't think of things to
say it's like hey can I buy you a drink
or hi my name is Sutton Tucker you know
hey I don't write anybody just be
yourself
yeah when you're at the bar then your
vineyards you're in pole position if you
got a spot at the bar everybody else
you've got the opportunity to judge who
it is you wanna language alright you're
out and you maybe don't know a lot of
people in the bar try to buddy up to
whoever serving you drink tea start with
the bartender and ask the bartender if
they're not too busy gives you a little
bit of credibility if the bartender
comes up to units treating you really
nicely whoever you're talking to is
gonna think you know you're you're a
good person if you're playing too cool
then you just kind of hang out by
yourself you know they're just gonna
hang up at apocalypse you know what go
up hi how you doing and then gauge the
participation we have a girl's reacting
to you
and way too cool for school doesn't
really plot to work out you know I've
been in places where they'll be a guy to
come in and spend an entire night she's
he'll this is only holy purpose for
being there
try me girl talk to everybody and
completely bomb and fail and not go home
with anybody and then come in another
night it was out that on his mind meet
someone start talking and leave with
them trying to to ask a question what
are you drinking Oh what should I try
I've never had anything here before it's
an original thing not an original
introduced again under original original
to do again do it but don't be creepy
about it set on the drink give him away
and toast to them and if they look over
they see all that ice cube and still to
oneself and it's
and always a nice gesture and you want
PP about yeah I get to people-watch and
he stops without my you know
professionally good to do it it's sort
of a part of a job because I'm
eavesdropping on everyone in poker faces
