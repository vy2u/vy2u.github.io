here to tell us a little bit about Cuban
food Dimitri and I I'm just an idiot I
am an idiot the BG's an idiot we have
never really experienced Cuban food we
don't know what the hell's going yeah
I'm gonna eat off all of your plates if
that's all right yeah Ali have you ever
been to Cuba I have not and you have
also not been to Cuba some of my family
members are planning a trip in the
not-too-distant future so it's possible
things are changing it's definitely
something I've wanted to do all my life
so that sort of brings us to why we're
here a couple of weeks ago Jenny and I
were on a shoot together for a video I
was making about meeting my neighbors
and while we were stuck in traffic and
dis chatting Jenny mentioned to me that
her grandfather used to be a painter and
that all of his paintings were somewhere
in Cuba and they had no idea where the
local movie theaters would hire him to
draw like Clark Gable and John Wayne and
all these like famous American stars
they had to leave every single one with
different neighbors and family members
scattered about Cuba and he's been gone
since 1959 58 yeah since you took that
Peter Pan flight and now he's 93 about
to be 93 in August yes so when he got to
America what happened that he gave up
painting they weren't in a good position
in Cuba so it was a much worse situation
in Miami one of my cousins from Cuba
she got a Facebook account and we just
started talking found out that one of
our neighbors kept probably the painting
that meant the most to my grandfather
Sano's hace que que tiene quadrants ooh
bo Derek en la casa por medio' seguida
yo y como fuga canossian pinto a lo hizo
vecino
yellow entonces cuando yo a CDN we
separate a sonido de vive la cual
a nosotros y lo más cercano en mano y

people say oh yeah we do equal Z wait
that's the Quinta and you eat at valium
it will work at all and they haven't
talked to him in years like the last
time they saw him he was like 26 like
our age you know you guys have any
questions at this part of like an Auburn
okay yeah it turns out that he drew this
apparently when he was 17 years old it
was one of his first paintings
he's 93 now so that's like late 30s we
have cousins that
moved to Miami from Cuba about five
years ago but they still travel
frequently to Cuba when we found out
that the painting was still in existence
we talked to him and he's like well I'm
going to a wedding he was very nervous
about still trying to take that through
the airport because it's still very
smugly yes yeah he rolled it up and put
it into a duffel bag but then some funny
things happen mm-hmm
yeah I'm good weird just that short trip
from Cuba to Miami it broke into pieces
it was a jigsaw puzzle my closest
closest my bestest friend I said can you
put this together like he did it like
about three days and there's that
painting like on the table and there was
still pieces missing like little scraps
or like oh that's the end of it or
nervous that's the end of the tail or
that's the corner of this my father is a
very keeps his emotions and he was you
know more quiet but you can just read it
off of him two three smile for me I love
it you were just more floored than
anything it's okay I'm like my heart is
pounding is that okay right now we're
hanging in my grandparents house for
your grandfather this is something that
has been his grandchild abut now like
another generation it's still connected
to Cuba and it's still connected to that
root I think that's really powerful hey
and if anything changes over the next
couple years people may be a place you
can go visit and see if you can find
some more of his paintings you guys
enjoy your food I'm not done Gavin yeah
