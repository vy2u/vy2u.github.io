I've never helped him bake once ever
that's really scary
don't ask question just keep going I
wanna know what I'm making so I'm
basically in a cage and I can't see
anything
and where are you Patrick I'm here in
the kitchen and then I'm going to be
telling Patrick how did make these
cookies so this is my recipe and it's
pretty easy to make for me and for
Patrick it's gonna be pretty difficult I
think oh my god first thing you have to
do is preheat the oven to 350 I mean
where it says baked yes just press three
five zero enter okay
okay yeah so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do our dry ingredients first
okay so measure 3/4 of a cup of the
flour now when you open it be careful
cuz it's to make a lot of mess cuz it's
a new bag so open it very carefully oh
okay what are you doing love it
open the baking soda okay there's like
four spoons get the one that's as 1/2
1/2 1/2 a teaspoon get the baking powder
and you're gonna measure 1/4 of a
teaspoon okay you're gonna do 1/4 of a
teaspoon of a salt
that's so weird ok mix the dry
ingredients together like with my hand
no with your hand that's disgusting go
just with the spoon is too much turn it
way too Wiz cuz I'm yeah you know it
yeah I know it was good yeah mix it can
I put that on the side do you see the
butter yeah to half a cup of butter that
whole stick so like Paula Deen now that
you see the peanut butter uh yeah okay
so we need 1/2 a cup of that that you're
gonna mix with the butter disgusting
I don't know what you're doing but it
doesn't sound right you see the brown
sugar and the white sugar yeah I use a
half a cup of what the sugar the white
sugar yes the white river okay then
where does that go it goes into the bowl
with the butter in the peanut butter
okay now you're gonna do the light brown
sugar
you're gonna put half a cup of that just
try to clean as I go a little the bottle
that like beautiful like looks like a
woman's body the vanilla yes you can add
one teaspoon of that and now you're
gonna mix the ingredients
liquid in there something don't ask
questions you keep going get whatever
you have in front of you that's clean
and put a cup of the oats where do I put
them the floor where are you gonna put
them did you put it on the floor I'm
just following your directions are you
gonna roll the dough on the floor bar
what you put on the floor oh you should
put okay one cup in the bowl you said
yes in the bowl with the orange spatula
mix it I'm not cleaning this kitchen
after that's all I know
it's exhausting fill up that teaspoon
drop it on to that to the baking you're
gonna do like three lines of four so now
what did you make 12 cookies already I
don't know I think so yeah the fork just
press it on top of the cookie dough so
put it in the oven while that's baking
for 10 minutes in the timer's on you're
gonna make the filling so let's try to
be a filling yeah so 3 tablespoons
butter there you need to do 1 cup of
powdered sugar you're gonna get half a
cup of that peanut butter okay so the
last ingredient hallelujah is the heavy
cream I kind of think it's good oh my
god it's hot yeah be careful
am i making like an Oreo yes I can or
I'll smash it yep oh my god that looks
really good it's cookie time
3 2 1 oh I am gonna be supportive let me
hire that mm-hmm this boss thing is good
so kind of hard yeah the cookies really
hard to use a little mean he was a
little unclear he would tell me to throw
things on the floor when he didn't want
me to really promote on the floor but in
spite of all that I think I follow
directions well and I think that this
was a success if I did it again I would
like to do one more time and I would
maybe not leave them in the oven Islam
there's not gonna be another time there
won't be part two
thank you all for coming here I'm gonna
ask you to leave because they're never
gonna do this dirty though but mm-hmm
mm-hmm
here so hey it's okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
