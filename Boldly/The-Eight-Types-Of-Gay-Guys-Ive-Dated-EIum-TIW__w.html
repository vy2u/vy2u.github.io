sure what types of guys I'd meet
breakfast of champions
the scenester where's his pride on his
sleeve even though his shirts never have
any where should we go next boom huh
where he goes every night what he lacks
in subtlety he makes up for by being
absolutely fabulous he was fun but
exhausted like dating a drunk
Stairmaster generalizing about the
LGBTQIA community meet the revolutionist
some of his other favorite catch phrases
include internalized homophobia he never
knew when to shut the hell oh the
strength of conviction was is great to
pass his heart that is the worst baby
I've ever seen when it felt ro had a
penis you'd have the sophistication for
Snoop Dogg has one of these two thousand
three hundred thirty four dollars and
fifty nine he wanted an NPH it's okay I
got it but I was just an extra on Glee I
do suffer my dodgeball team again the
manchild when gay nerds kind of grow up
his resume includes the jet sports
leagues video games influencing pop
culture oh my god to him life is one big
inside joke and I didn't get any of it I
want a Disney themed wedding look up the
word pining in the dictionary and you'll
see the romantic symptoms of this type
include wistful sighing at anything
and the occasional bout of self-pity
he's the perfect boyfriend in ten years
he knows what I like the competitor
fraternity president beer pong champion
and a snuggle monster
sometimes it's hard dating a guy who
thinks he has to be on top all the time
I gotta take the good bath right
sorry anyway I just came back from the
Swedish economics of a downtown that's
the alternative he's into some really
weird
his friends were all cooler than me his
parties were all underground and his
work for weiners I have no idea
and just when I thought there was no one
right for me hey what are you thinking
about
there's the one
he's the end of this list but the
beginning of something special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
