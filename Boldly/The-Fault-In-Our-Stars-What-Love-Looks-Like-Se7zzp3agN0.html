or off I am finished this is a drawing
of my family this is love to me in the
same way that it was when I was a little
kid because for me a lot of love is in
stability like those are the things that
really make me feel held or make me feel
okay and that's a lot of what love is
for me and I think like for me those
both of those are important kinds of
love too the ability to be with people
hold each other up and then they also
the ability to be with each other and
celebrate together and feel connected
when you're holding on to everything
that that's good and beautiful like both
of those are equally loving to me and
equally important to me when I think
about what what love is mine is pretty
simple love makes two people stronger
together but at the same time it doesn't
you know take over the other person's
life and it lets them be individuals
obviously stereotypical would be the
blue would be the boy everything people
be the girl but it's not about boy or
girl or anything it's just about people
who are very different but they can come
together and make something beautiful
but still be individuals I think is love
is things that just make me happy and
make me feel like the most at home
within my own soul which is trees in the
ocean and music sunshine and moonlight
and then when falling in love with
someone the first thing I notice is
their eyes and the word Aloha is how I
fall in love with people as well because
h a-ha means breath and when you say
aloha to somebody you are recognizing
the spirit in them and they're
recognizing the spirit in you and you're
exchanging breath it's not a high or a
goodbye or a hell
or whatnot it's a I see you I recognise
you I see your soul and I'm giving you
my soul and then I added a little
popcorn on the side because nothing
makes me love life more than a little
popcorn a dough one day come up and
bring your</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
