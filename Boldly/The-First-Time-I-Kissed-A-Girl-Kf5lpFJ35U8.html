completely in love with to the point
where I wasn't scared I was 19 when I
first kissed a girl we were best friends
at the time which was very cliche that I
was hanging out with like the popular
girls and I was not very popular I was
very like dorky and skinny I used to
like write poetry about her on my live
journal whatever guys it's fine I just
remember like my bed was like push
against the wall like long ways and we
were laying on it watching my TV there
was like kind of like a flirty
conversation going on and then I think
now mind you not a smooth one because we
were 15 no no we were just like talking
about how much we liked each other there
was this one girl who was like the
leader of the group and she's like well
I dare Kelsey to kiss Molly
we both ended up going to the bathroom
at the same time and she was like
sitting on the counter eating the
skittles still and I was like I want one
why like why still why won't you give me
a skittle still and she was like come
and get it and like put it in her mouth
and so I was like fine I remember like
almost daring her to kiss me I think I
said like you don't have the balls for
this or like something like that her
faces are just like really close
together and I literally like just
kissed her and then things went on from
there and then we were just making out
in the bathroom and it was like insane
when I'd kiss guys before I was like huh
all right cool we're kissing that's
great but like when I first kissed her I
was like I wasn't thinking it was just
happening and I just kept thinking like
oh I should we should do more of this
the rest of the night we all were just a
bunch of 13 year olds making out
in the jacuzzi together it was so
comfortable and it was so just like it
just nothing felt wrong
I wasn't even close to out like not even
close we started cracking up laughing
and lived happily ever after except not
really we didn't talk for like a good
probably like two days he was like I'm
gonna break up with the boyfriend like
is that okay and I was like no you guys
should stay together maybe she was like
okay and then they did and then I was
heart still heartbroken for all of high
school because I didn't I couldn't uh I
wasn't brave enough to like be like
don't don't hurt stay with him we dated
and then we did in and then we dated
again and then we didn't again and you
know you know women after that night
every time we'd have a sleepover I would
be the one that's like let's play truth
or dare
anyone wanna practice kissing and stuff
again yeah good good closeted times
we're actually still together and it's
been three years more than three years
and she will probably be the last girl I
kiss as well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
