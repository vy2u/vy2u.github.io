put entire I have never seen or eaten
Jewish food before I've been to delis
Oh cold mmm it's like a cold sausage
with sour paste on top a weird pickle
flavor to it I'm not quite sure what
meat it is it's like if they if tuna got
like pushed into like a yeah if you like
compressed it yeah like hundreds of
years maybe tastes like a grocery store
smells
I don't mind it though I don't know if
it's for me maybe it's a acquired taste
this is just gross
it's like an apple-pie pasta huh this is
what I call some white people food the
noodles are really weird delicious
absolutely delicious
not like especially bad it's written not
good I feel like it wants to be macaroni
and cheese and it also wants to be a
cake it just doesn't know which one it
is yet when do you think someone would
eat this when they realize that family
members are coming that day and all they
have is pasta and cinnamon in the pantry
hey
matzo ball soup I'm excited forever has
earth looks like a big ball of potatoes
that's insane so we just break off a
piece okay I would eat this all day I
would have sex with this and I'm
surprised that bread goes well with soup
though right right but this has like egg
and some other benefits like a bunch of
like noodles mashed together and like
put into a big ball yeah again with the
kingdom again with the condensed this is
like the gateway drug
that's it Jewish food just seems like a
weird thing to want the crave right I
want like a little bit of broth and a
giant sponge in a bowl
this is poker visca has to be proof I'd
seriously looks like the consistency is
exactly like Fancy Feast works that's
not bad I would classify that as a pate
I don't get it
I'm sure it's based in some like
beautiful tradition but just has a plate
in front of me it's a little gross
this looks like dessert he's all good
who were this one is like poppy seeds in
it or something yeah I was quite
oh my god I like the flaky pastry
outside and then it has a lot of fun on
the inside mission firm which will
packed in just like the what did we have
like a felt the fish or whatever oh yeah
yeah it's got the same consistency in a
weird way get it Jewish grandma's here
you go
cookies they got it right
Manischewitz Manischewitz manish rights
manish wits looks like we're getting a
turn it smells good it smells like white
wine vinegar very a little strong
lehayim lion oh that's delicious it's
like a sweet wine it's a sangria yeah
it's grape juice
this is incredible tastes like a
hangover I feel like I could drink it
like a whole bottle and I feel like you
drink so much of it that you wouldn't
realize how much I can get wasted up
this at a nice Passover Bar Mitzvah or
Rosh Hashanah or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
