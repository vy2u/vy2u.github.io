there's no other way to put it one day
you have the entire world and then the
next day it's all gone food loses its
taste you no longer feel the need to do
laundry and the shower turns into your
own personal cry chamber all those
seconds minutes hours days wasted on
something that only ended in bitter
disappointment and now you're alone with
no idea of what's next what do you even
do with your time now you go for a walk
you write a novel maybe you try your
hand at street art with sidewalk chalk
but come on that's a little ridiculous
your days used to be filled with hope
and excitement and now nothing you're
now back in the chase for the next best
thing you're sick of swiping through
these stupid apps no no maybe no you
just act are you seriously still sad
about finishing binge watching Breaking
Bad it was so good I'll never have
anything like that again okay get over
it come hang out with your girlfriend no
I'm good I'm just gonna sit here and
sulk okay just gonna go seriously
some people like your girlfriend will
never understand
in that week and a half you watched over
47 hours of quality television the
character's story and setting now a part
of you now will never change there will
never be another what is the people
versus a Simpson and just like that you
are swept off your feet by something new
you have a new outlook on your life food
is as rich as ever
laundry got a little easier in the
shower turned back into your recording
studio life is good again wait how is
there only 10 episodes wait what do you
mean this is a mini series of mini
series this isn't happening to me again
and it's the circle of life the quest
continues here's to binge watching I
hate you and I love you so so much
