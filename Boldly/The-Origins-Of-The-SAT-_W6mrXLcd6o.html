permanently over I'm not a big fan of
standardized tests I think it's a
necessary evil there's a very set way
that you can perform well on them I
don't know where the SAT came from I
think it came from a very small focus
group very narrow minded people
oh I'll use a eugenicist that's cute
science being used to back up racism
since forever that is so
interesting
the total score goes up as family income
goes up what a coincidence
have classes to learn how to take the
SAT but those classes are expensive it's
easy math way more to do with privilege
than it does about your actual
intelligence level and a black or
african-american of course the lowest
scores Asian and white are leading these
statistically white Americans and Asian
Americans have higher incomes people
love to be like oh like certain races
are just naturally smarter than others
but like that's not how it works
everyone is not on the equal playing
field now that I look at all these
statistics I'm like oh god I don't know
I wish I could say that this has escaped
permits oogenesis roots but a lot of
ways it hasn't changed that much because
it's just basically reinforcing the idea
that certain people are stupid I think
school should be better funded so that
they can provide tutoring and resources
for their students to perform better on
the SAT
the whole purpose of a tete hey hey he
hates the eighties look you think in the
eighties pesto</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
