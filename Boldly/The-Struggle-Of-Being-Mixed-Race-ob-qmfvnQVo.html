ethnically ambiguous
when people first glanced at me I mean
the first thing they see is a white guy
and usually I'll have to end up
explaining to people that I am half
Mexican and half white no one has ever
been able to correctly identify who I am
my entire life I've gotten Cuban Puerto
Rican Dominican half black half white
people think I'm Asian
Egyptian Polynesian Asian fully white or
fully Asian almost everyone miss reads
me in some way it's very hard to guess
Danish an Indian from a first glance
I've honestly heard everything sometimes
I wish I could walk in and just like be
recognized as like a Mexican American
sometimes people will come up to me on
the street and I start speaking Spanish
frantically and I can't respond because
I don't speak Spanish
I find that depending on where I am
people read me differently they tend to
think that I'm whatever they are people
of Hispanic backgrounds think I'm
Hispanic people who are Asian being
allocated an interesting part of my
journey as a young multiracial person
growing up was rejection from sort of
both sides of my ethnic identity just
something that I grew up with my whole
life like I don't fit in I don't belong
to any ethnic group 100% I never saw
myself as different from anybody else
until someone else pointed it out the
last thing you want to do is stand out
you want to blend in as much as possible
we talked about race like it's this like
built-in intrinsic thing but the reality
is we're mostly talking about looks
right if I'm going to be white well then
why can I have blonde hair and blue eyes
if I'm going to be Mexican and why kind
of have dark skin and speak perfect
Spanish people think I'm Asian why can't
I have you know be really tiny and
skinny and like fit into all these
stereotypes but I'm not a stereotype I'm
just like me and for mixed people who
sort of live in between the lines we
sort of just have to kind of be more
than our racial background you don't
need to fit a mold that other people
think you should fit it's difficult
learning that you don't have to decide
what race you are there's no textbook on
how to be multiracial and be okay with
it you just kind of have to forge ahead
and be your own person I am Who I am and
no one else is like me and that's pretty
cool
