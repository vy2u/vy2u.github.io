20s when I was about 21 years old I
would get the experience of other women
freaking out about me using the restroom
and that became very dangerous for me in
2005 I was involved in a hate crime and
I was shot in the face and I lost my
right eye I have a glass eye now that's
when the world changed for me the
bathroom
is often the start of trans people
experiencing violence out in the world
la LGBT Center implemented
gender-neutral restrooms about six years
ago so not that long of a time even
within you know this face which is very
inclusive of trans people there was some
pushback from gay lesbian individuals
who didn't understand what that would
mean I think over time people have
really understood that it's about safety
and inclusion it's about creating a
space that is safe to everyone
this is the City of West Hollywood the
epicenter for the LGBTQ community really
our home our safe space
you know we're ahead of the curve I
guess I'm trying to lead hopefully at no
time everyone's doing this and not only
in the city buddy
you know statewide nationwide everyone's
taking this stuff I'm one of the
fortunate ones you hear of trans women
who've been visually viciously beaten in
the women's restroom who have been
dragged out of the women's restroom some
times by other women when the show
transparent you know they have a scene
where the main character who's a trans
woman is harassed in the bathroom by a
family and seeing something like that is
so sad because it reminds me personally
of just how much fear people have of
trans people in reality trans people
just want to use the restroom like
anybody else and then leave end up died
because of the bathroom issue the
discussion became in Congress about you
know so should we have genital
verification before we allow people to
use the restroom isn't it dangerous to
use the restroom of the trans person my
biggest hope that will come out of all
of this that trans people will become a
part of the fabric of America</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
