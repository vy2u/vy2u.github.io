hip-hop isn't your favorite germs are
you how many baby mamas do you have that
is not who I am that is not who I am
that is not who I am tired of him black
metal lazy disrespectful violence absent
I think America's got this very
interesting history with black man
America used us one dimensionally and
for the most part it's in a negative way
comments I hate hearing about black men
are you go up a node you know she only
likes you because you're black we must
play basketball right vacillates between
extreme fare and extreme infatuation
everyone wants to be black but on the
other hand when it's time to be black no
one wants to be black because black men
black men black men are monkeys problems
thugs to me being a black man in America
means to be afraid you have to subject
yourself to being less than a human
being
in order for someone else to to feel
better about them so whenever I see a
white female on the street if I'm
walking behind her particularly if it's
late at night I actually go out of my
way to not only pass her but to pass her
as wide as I can so that she can see me
clearly and so that she can see that I
have nothing in my hands I'm tired of
hearing that we make up the hatred and
mistreatment that we receive from people
in power and the fact that if you're 15
years old and black and you're walking
down the street with with a hoodie on
you could be a target of some kind of a
harassment I feel like we have targets
on our backs lack men black men black
men are not just rappers athletes we're
not all great dancers black men are
intelligent multifaceted individuals
compassionate a person just like anybody
else yes yes this this is Who I am
