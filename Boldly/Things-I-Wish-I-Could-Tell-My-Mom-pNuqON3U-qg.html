angel my baby my star my world but if
this is true mama if this is fact then
why do you say such hurtful comments to
me how can you do me like that you look
like a in that dress those yoga
pants say that you want much more and if
you leave my house looking like that
everyone will think that you're just
another loose girl but why should I care
mama why should what they think matter
because nothing hurts me more than to
hear you point out that my thighs have
gotten fatter or that being a sexual
person makes me a bad daughter I'm
either your little good girl or that
 who likes it rough but when I plead
in opposition you say girl you need to
calm down and listen you're just a
little too tough you need to smile just
a tad bit more but not too much because
then you'll look like a whore I either
eat too much or not enough I'm too thin
or too thick too fat or too skinny
but mama why can't you hear me
I have a woman's body and I will not
apologize for that it's the body that
you passed down to me so how can you
shame me like that these thick thighs
these full lips these killer curves
these bodacious hips you're the one who
blessed these gifts upon me so how can
you say the ugly things that you do
about my body these questions are not
out of spite for you neither contempt or
disdain I just wish that you would take
the time to contemplate the words you're
always saying because I can't spend
another day listening to your
internalized hate for years and years
I've tried not to let it bother me but I
can't anymore because women need to
learn to live in harmony divide and
conquer
that's how they keep us down that's how
they hold us back they make you feel
shameful for the skin that you're in and
see to it that we pass it on to the next
of kin but that's got to stop mama we
can't be about that life anymore I just
want to love my body be a sexual being
and know that you won't see me as just
another whore that you'll still be able
to think of me positively that you'll be
able to see me for more than just my
body
mama you say I'm a pretty girl I'm your
angel your baby your star your world but
if this is true mama if this is fact I
need you to stop saying the hurtful
things you say to me
I need you to have my back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
