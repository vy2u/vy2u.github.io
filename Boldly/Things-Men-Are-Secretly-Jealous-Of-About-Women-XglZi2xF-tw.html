a woman like with all her curves and her
beautiful hair like the female is just
always gonna be the epitome of sexiness
their bathrooms as they're described to
me
they sound like country clubs where they
have like anti chambers and couches and
settee and the sense from four corners
of the globe just sort of billowing and
it's sort of like a social gathering
atmosphere I'm super jealous that girls
can go to the bathroom with someone all
the time I think it'd be pretty cool if
like on a double date I could just look
over to my buddy and be like yo dude
come to the bathroom with me in the
beginning of a relationship the woman is
not expected to pay for a thing you know
I'm walking down the street with my boys
ready to go to the club and we see this
long line and we can't get through and a
group of girls just easily walk by open
up the doors for them free nothing it's
called the penis tags I'm super jealous
of like the long flowy hair like how
they can flip it and like move it around
and it's just so luxurious and beautiful
and silky not that guys can't have long
hair but I tried it once and didn't work
out so well for me when it comes to
fashion those legging those look like
the most comfortable thing in the world
women can like turn almost anything into
clothes
there are things I'll just like look
like curtains that can be women's
clothes and I'm just like stuck with
like jeans
I'm also very jealous of women having a
bigger section in clothing stores
because that's basically telling men
that you don't have to look as well put
together and you don't have to care that
much about your appearance as women no
matter what gender you are what sex you
are that like everybody likes sales
women have to deal with a lot of crap
this constant pressure to look a certain
way a general idea that you don't feel
safe walking alone the inequality factor
and then also the whole period thing
women aren't allowed to be like oh I'm
bleeding and it hurts they don't get
enough credit there they're tough for
having to put up with all the stuff that
they do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
