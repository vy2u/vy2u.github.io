the soltero, and the cinco.
- Okay, how can I help
you narrow that down?
 
- Hi, welcome to Balcones.
How are you today?
- Coke please, no ice.
- Could I get the quinoa dulche
but can I get that without asparagus,
no choclo, I don't know what that is.
- All right guys, here
you are and here you are.
- Mmm, I bet it would taste
so much better in a booth.
- We'll make sure to do everything we can
to have it be the best
meal you've ever had.
- That would be so great
cause last time it was just terrible.
- Hi guys, how's everything going so far.
- Fine.
- Oh, did you guys move tables?
- Yeah, we just wanted
to sit by the window.
- Here we are and how will
we be paying for this?
- Yeah, and then we--
- All right you guys.
Here is your check.
- Oh, thanks.
I'll just sign this now.
- Okay, cool.
Hope you had a great time.
- Yep.
- Let's go with the seabass...
No, can I get the rib eye steak?
Extra well-done, please.
- Sure.
- No, I'm not supposed to eat red meat.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
