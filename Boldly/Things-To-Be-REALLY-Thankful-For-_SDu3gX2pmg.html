sound as if the turkeys the only thing
we had to be thankful for
what is there to be thankful for metal
and plastic box that runs on
continuously exploding ancient plants
and animals guy you here at superhuman
speeds there's another box that makes
food go from cold to hot in no time
I want the freezes stuff like ice cream
it remains pants you got to peel it down
deep before you can really be thankful
or anything there's a place it gives you
unlimited free books a clean free system
that whisks your poop away at the turn
of a lever we can fly
you thankful for the people you know
incredible think about it you personally
met someone who heals the sick who
fights for what's right who spends
countless hours making things beautiful
to look at and experience things the
pilgrims never even dreamed of be
thankful for magnifying glasses
hot showers in the winter gravity not
the movie that just a thing we thankful
for free samples at Costco the Pepsi
challenge puppies the cold side of the
pillow there's a place that just smells
like candles deodorant anesthesia the
movie Anastasia has okay down comforters
grilled cheese pigs different vegetables
into bacon the sound of a cello the
smell of breakfast the pain of Kanye be
thankful for your ability to dance but
sometimes to last so hard that it hurts
somebody loves you you're made of about
of a hundred trillion cells you're the
only one who made it out of about 500
million sperm your body is constantly
pumping blood breathing living blinking
and you're not even thinking about it
you made it so dude be thankful let's
