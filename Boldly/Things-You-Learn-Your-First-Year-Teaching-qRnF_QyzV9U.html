to be this amazing teacher and you kind
of have to come and realize that you're
not
you don't know the life of your students
so something at home could be really the
big problem
some kids reading on a twelfth grade
level some kids reading on a sixth grade
level and when you are faced with that
reality every single day you're making
up for a lot of lost time you have to be
counseled they're a best friend a father
figure a mother figure I just want to be
a person at the end of the day and bond
with students you know the first year
teaching I think is very much like a
marathon the lows are lower than the
highs are high last year I had a fight
break out in my classroom I had a
student that was so defined that you
know he was borderline threatening me
I feel like I had the mentality if I was
going to have some students who just
didn't want to learn teaching has really
actually showed me that there is no kid
who doesn't want to learn have students
stay with you to five o'clock when it's
getting dark really trying to learn the
material and then you see that smile
when they finally get it it makes every
single sacrifice you make as a teacher
worth it I think a lot of students here
they get trapped in a very kind of small
world and so in those moments where
you're able to open them open their eyes
and I guess put them in somebody else's
shoes and really have them understand
that it's it can be a powerful thing
advice I would give to a first-year
teacher is you're gonna have your ups
and downs but as long as your heart in
your soul is for your kids you'll never
let them down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
