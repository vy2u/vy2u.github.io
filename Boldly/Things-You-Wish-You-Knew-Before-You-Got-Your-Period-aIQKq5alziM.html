have two holes tampons don't actually
take your virginity I wish I'd known
that my mom would tell literally
everyone about how I had become a woman
and they would mention it to me in
casual conversation you can still swim
in there is absolutely no shame in the
chunks man the chunks is so grossly
satisfying before I got my period I
thought it was like pee you could hold
it in and then release it into the
toilet Oh was I wrong
you are continually bleeding through
tampons do not be afraid of super plus
you're not supposed to actually stick
the whole tampon applicator inside your
vagina nobody you can see your pad
cramps will be a legit excuse to get out
of everything someday you will absent
mindedly
use two tampons everything will be okay
when you discover set error the checkout
person at the drugstore does not give us
about the fact that you are buying
tampons I wish I knew to be careful when
buying cute underwear because eventually
they will be sacrificed to the period
goddesses even though getting your
period is really annoying it's actually
a good thing and means your body's
working
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
