job seems to be moving along pretty well
so far if I can just get through five
minutes that's 1% of the day then I just
have to do that 100 more times you've
got to be kidding me
you should get an internship summer oh
it'll look great on your resume summer
how in the world does this build
character mom how is it that I feel
completely ignored and you absolutely on
display at the same time horseback
riding now that builds character
why hire me I could just walk out this
door right now
they wouldn't even notice I'll just
replace my slowly decaying body with
that plant that one will be the wiser
only two minutes you've got to be
kidding me
so every other intern in the world is
having a meaningful experience except
for me no no no wow summer you're
learning a valuable lesson of how to
slowly become a husk of your former self
four years of college hundreds of
thousands of dollars in student loans to
sit at this desk like I'm an afternoon
detention being a grown-up is awesome
I can't wait
unbelievable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
