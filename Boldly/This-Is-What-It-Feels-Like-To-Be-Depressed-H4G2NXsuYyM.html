remember the first time I met you I was
seven years old a pigtailed lover of
books tease for the sneakers my mother
could barely afford the second time I
met you was at a house party where a
stranger packed himself into my mouth it
was the first time I understand the word
ugly we meant again when I learned I had
lupus and found out my body now belonged
to an incurable disease and again when I
was sad for the 49th day in a row I
begged you to go away but you would not
leave you depression are my childhood
friend
the midnight voices in my head a slick
tongue you pretend to have the answers
but loving you got me sick got me
suicide watched got me blue happy pills
find the nearest ledge you say walk out
you say suspend you say wouldn't I be
happier dead yesterday I cried enough to
name myself the sad girl again lonely
has developed an authority where my
thoughts are family always fussing about
the wrong I have done about the pretty
I've earned what I learn of sadness is
from you you tell me boys won't love me
but a fasting rope can you tell me lupus
is incurable can't have seven children
can't be hospitalized three times in one
year and called that healing you a
contradiction a House of Lies sickness
can do that it can lie it can claw my
sadness will not cease it will not quiet
and I am afraid to die I am afraid to
die depression as a howl
of teeth it will write you into a story
without rest
it will king you comb your mouth into a
beautiful haunting and name it a vacant
wilderness but dare your self
extraordinary human to run into joy
screaming you cannot have me you cannot
have me I am NOT my past I am worthy of
love I am worthy I am forgiving myself
for not being strong enough to believe
in myself I can tell you I do not know
who my father is
I can tell you a best friend's father
molested me I can tell you the number of
men I let crawl into my body but I would
rather tell you I am letting go I am
letting failure go I am letting
loneliness go I will not give up you
will not silence me sincerely Tanya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
