chief human and trainer for the amazing
acro cats they are a troupe of former
orphans rescues and strays and I travel
around the country to promote the
benefits of training show people to cats
can be trained and it ends with a cat
band called the Rocket
oz on guitar newly on piano and
synthesizer Dakota who's our main
drummer Sookie is on chimes tuna on
cowbell because every song needs more
cowbell and then pluck Norris is on
cymbal and tambourine and we do have a
groundhog that plays a gong 10 years ago
I realized I hadn't fulfilled my dream
of you know being an animal trainer for
film and television so I decided to
revisit the idea of training cats so I
thought oh I'll put a show together Oh
people started just showing up in droves
to see these cats so and even though
they sucked I mean like half the tricks
fail the cats are really distracted
people just thought it was phenomenal
these cats that we work at the circus
are all very affectionate and very
friendly and do a lot more to get your
attention than a normal cat where they
think oh they're definitely prima donnas
and they in the band especially they
have their little spat cats in general
are really unprofessional so they just
don't hold anything back
you know however they're feeling they go
with it dogs will work for love but cats
you don't really need to have a little
extra motivation people just are in our
thrilled no matter what the cats do but
sometimes the cats do great and other
times the cats are terrible but people
still love it because they see that the
cats really kind of control the show and
call the shop well it's funny to hear
the here the response in the crowd some
of they're like yeah just the best
Saturday night I've ever had and now I
can die because I've seen everything
you wonder I'm single</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
