he asked me that if I was given 10 grand
where I bleached my skin color
I never had a problem was how I look
until I came to the US and that's when I
started looking myself in the mirror and
I'm like wow I do look different that's
when I finally realized that my skin was
different I was bad because kid was
laughing at me okay we're making kind of
like go take a shower
kid was told me we can see you in the
dog I'm hearing all these comments and I
was just like what is happening but
something wrong with my skin like I
could shout with us and take this off
then literally scared of what I look
like
you know and that hurt I was so nervous
but I loved that I was like this is fun
I'm like just being on the stage and
then a week later I did a photo shoot
with a local photographer and I was like
hmm I should give this a shot to prove
those people to that thought I wasn't
beautiful that I'm gonna be out then
you're gonna see me on magazines and
you're gonna be the oldest ugh girl for
middle school I feel like modeling
industry is biased toward fair skin and
it has been for a long time but I also
feel like it's changing when I was
starting off modeling and I would see
this image of me looking lighter than
what I really am I always feel like this
is what they want me to look like
sometime they asked me to come back I'm
ready can you bring your own foundation
where all my other model friends don't
have to do that I have not found the
father to control my face that's Dogma
or I use a black eyeshadow to control my
face so my dream is that create products
that I can use and people that as my
complexion would not have hard time
finding I call it over an Aruba driver
pull up he asked me that if I was given
ten grand would I bleach my skin and
then I asked him why he said because so
if you can avoid all the dirty looks
okay guys will find you attractive he's
like don't you have hard time being as
black as you are and I just laughed and
I told him
I'm beautiful the way I am I don't need
life to be easy if being light is gonna
make my life easy then I'm fine how go
the heart run if you be bully
talk to someone but talk to people that
care about you talk to people that loved
you you know I wish there was somebody
when I was when I was growing up talking
about how my dad loved himself there's
being dog as they are I just need to
learn to love myself one I love myself
they will see that that does not affect
me and then they eventually stop I want
to be that person who is fired you know
people they don't have to be just dog
skin people you look at yourself and
there's so many thing that you don't
like about yourself
you know you could be like if that does
seem girl went through that what she
went through for being dusky
I could go through for having this type
of hair or acne or whatever the case is
cuz we are beautiful in whatever way God
paid us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
