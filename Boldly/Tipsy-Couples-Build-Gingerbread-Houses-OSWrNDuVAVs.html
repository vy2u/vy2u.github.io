my own bottle so and we're gonna make a
gingerbread house cocky maybe really the
box has a very elaborate and beautiful
gingerbread house if you live in a house
and it's shaped like this you're not a
real person do you want to go
instruction list yeah let's go with our
intuition yes mums those aren't mmm so a
little Bowl
this is Israeli couscous is supposed to
need this I'm gonna help this seems like
a random this seems like an extra I just
want like what's the shape of clothes to
take a house these hipsters in tiny
houses you're gonna squeeze white icing
out of a tube and the instructions are
telling us how to erect things useful
it's it's four walls really you think
it's four walls we can do this ditch
like hold it in till it dries you're
supposed to pop it up on all these
you're getting a chance started out
really fun and now it's just like no
it's just hurting my self-esteem we're
all on board the factory did not give us
the correct pieces we show like what
we're working with here there's nothing
to work with here it kind of stands a
nope it's fine it's fine
it's a metaphor for our relationship
oh my gosh we're all set
we're good we're good here I got ya this
is make a teepee so sad
we're just Houston was so fun when I was
five
we're not tipsy we're just drunk like
regular plain old rum straight-up drugs
so like everything is really simple
right now and like we're not
overthinking it yes maybe I take over
from here like you built it like let me
just make it look good weed out sighs
it's a mini sitting around this house is
on sale because bad things happen here
build this monument ooh I love two
people got shot in the front yard it's
surprising how often our gingerbread
houses turn into murder-mystery houses
she worked baby we did it together we
were accomplished that I felt a really
long time I felt a little defeated in a
moment and took it out on the house
someday we're gonna build a tiny little
house that we could actually live in
it's covered in frosting in handy 70
bucks you got yourself a deal
good job baby behold solid solid that's
how you build a home I feel like it's
cursed like it's a given like something
Bad's gonna happen to us
later in life because it's actually
coming together like I feel like we're
using up good karma right now I didn't
have this good luck when I did Habitat
for Humanity but there's a person comes
together on a gingerbread house so this
ruined our relationship I hope you're
happy yeah I don't know if we can ever
repair what happened here a night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
