willing to arm-wrestle him for $200 also
if he could film it and if he could have
no clothes on while that was happening
when I use OkCupid I have like disclosed
in the general information that I am
trans there's a lot of different options
and ways to do that it's easier for me
to disclose up front than I don't feel
worried about engaging conversation and
then dropping conversation once I
disclose I think that the like first
challenge is that question of disclosure
usually when the conversations just stop
the first place I go to is I assume that
because I was trans if they lost
interest people use the anonymity of
being online to be on their worst
behavior sometimes the comments may
extend back are like what question mark
question mark question mark how do you
have sex what is that like or I gotta go
a lot of times the best online dating
form would be OkCupid now at the present
moment because they have the options of
multiple gender identities as well as a
sexual orientation I think well web
sites are improving with trans
inclusiveness I don't know that there's
a best one you have to be pretty willing
to put yourself out there a lot so let
me know if you find something good
advice I would give for people who want
to date trans folks is just beyond their
to get a date don't try and ask about
their history and conversations about
their family when really you wouldn't be
asking that of anybody else like I don't
want to give a transit education like
right after we had sex
my advice to other trans people who are
trying to date online would be don't
give up I know that the longer I've
heard that the longer you have it open
the more likely you are to receive
responses you know you have to kiss a
lot of frogs to find your prince or
whatever okay I also communicate about
my online dating experiences a hell of a
lot more difficult than it's portrayed
in cisgendered communities not to say
it's not fruitful and I think for folks
who are looking to hook up with trans
people or date trans people just stay
open and don't be so awkward
