sisterhood I'm sis and Meredith was
trans and first I guess that makes me
the trans woman is Wahb trans and I'm
nan and I think even just that language
like that was language that TKE gave me
to do not always censor it as being like
sis and took Center trans experience to
be like it's another I'm just a not a
trans person we met online I believe it
was on BBS a computer computer bulletin
board system I messaged you first but we
were on a dating site where you needed
to pay in order to message hurry back ah
I did this nude photo shoot for National
Coming Out Day and I shared this on
Facebook and I talked about you know the
importance of creating safe space for
queer and trans young people to come out
and that immediately as I posted that
message mr. Milan sent me my very first
message when I'm feeling discouraged and
inclined to give up on something you
encouraged me without pressuring me I
think being with him
you have helped me be braver in a lot of
way it's made me more responsible
emotionally and willing to take on like
emotional labor in a relationship in a
lot of ways you know we are super
committed to each other and you know
she's just really she supports me and
everything that the challenges that we
have faced because what we've taught me
how to love and much deeper I think
fuller fashion I've also grown and
matured in terms of my analysis like I
definitely had an understanding of like
trans issues but I think having a
front-row seat a more intimate position
has really taught me a lot if like I've
grown as a person because a lot of
people already think were rather odd and
yeah sort of uh on the fridge already in
a way I guess we faced very big
challenges both as individuals and as a
couple and every single time we've
emerged stronger from that I think
that's a very surprised it might
surprise people babe there are two stars
honestly dealing with other people and
like other people misgendering him they
don't feel like we have that kind of
like trans-related struggle you know
like a lot of the time it's about kind
of like our relationship and our
communication I'm still on a journey of
like self-discovery self-love and just
getting completely comfortable with
myself one of the challenges that we had
associated the beginning were like other
people's perceptions of our relationship
or other people's telling us like not to
have a relationship that it was too soon
or that people feeling like I was
abandoning like lesbian community
because I was choosing to be with a
trans man it's hard
it's extremely difficult on the person
your heart on the issue
Jackie no we got to keep working on that
like anyone else and I think that people
maybe feel that you don't have to work
on those things so that comes really
easy for us but we got to work on it we
got it yeah
actually things out yeah we are
