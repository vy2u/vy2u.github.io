monkey I was a spoiled little asshole
there was more ballast about the fact
that they were making me do things that
I didn't find sensing I would be even
more determined to not listen to them if
they hit me or spanked me I was beaten
up by every single appliance around in
the house I wouldn't like to hit my
children I know you're a kid you're
stupid but hey we can work this out like
taking away his TV time in his
PlayStation he's just like yeah fine I'm
going to go jack off it shouldn't be
because I have a broom in my hand and
I'm like hey stop it right now if he
wants to follow certain religious
beliefs then go ahead it's pretty
important for for my child to know about
our roots the pooch is a huge thing and
it's very community oriented so that I
might probably want to show my kids
borrow as much as he can into a
day-to-day into his day-to-day morality
but I would never want him to be guided
by religion
I would encourage him to read more
outside school so if there's a math
problem and my kid can solve it even if
it's in his own head I'm good with it
his complete identity is not associated
just with his sexuality I would let her
as many people as she wants to as long
as she's having a good time where my
sketch sticks his genitals is none of my
business
drink but don't drink and drive don't be
an asshole no drugs ever absolutely Who
am I kidding they're going to do drugs
when my kid turns 18 I'm going to give
him two plane tickets and tell him these
are two tickets to Amsterdam let that
not be visible marks of debauchery on
your face I think I would share
everything of my life how much even if
it is embarrassing how my mom is done
because I think it helps a lot my kid is
as awkward as I am throughout his
teenage videos I'm going to be like
chill it gets better I was like this as
well don't get married honestly why
would you do that to yourself
it's their lives unless they're marrying
an escaped convict like the day I have
to compare my kid to someone else around
to get things done is the day I'm
setting very unreasonable standards for
his upbringing I don't ever want my kid
to think that I did not let him do
something that he wanted to do for no
reason the kids they're going to make
mistakes so I can't take everything to
heart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
