lay on your couch and stream the latest
Ironman movie directly to your iPad to
watch a movie at home you'd have to go
outside first and travel several miles
to get a physical copy of it now one of
these places called a video store and it
was actually pretty awesome instead of
cycling through a list of movies on
demand or typing movie into a search
engine you actually have to walk around
with your feet and use your eyeballs to
try to find it it could take a while
especially if you weren't back way to
the alphabet if someone had already
rented the movie that you wanted you
just couldn't watch it movies were a
finite resource like outlets at the
airport you could maybe go to the
register to see if someone had returned
the video on a long shot it was there it
was like you won the lottery more often
than not you just have to decide on a
different movie wandering the aisles
until you found a movie the whole family
could agree on this is before there is a
screen in everyone's pocket so movies
had to be washed together at the same
time as a family after you watch the
movie you had to go outside again and to
take it back within 40 hours otherwise
you've been fined you could also be
fined if the magnetic tape inside the
flimsy plastic cassette hadn't been
wound to one side of the cassette it was
a pretty big deal there were signs but
now video stores have gone the way of
the American Buffalo there's barely any
left you can't just walk to a strip mall
with friends and try to outdo each other
with the weirdest looking movie cover
there's no more chatting with the movie
you clerk about the uber violent
Japanese gangster movies he recommends
and no more Saturday afternoon trips
because the weather was too ugly to play
outside
somehow we decided it was just easier to
never leave the house ever and it's
definitely easier but maybe it's not
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
