own lipstick today we are at Smashbox
Studios and we are going to make Reedy
lipstick and I'm very excited because I
have no clue what that is
I have a fine art background so I think
of like Reedy printing maybe so I think
we're like creating our own lipstick
sculptures I original expectation was
that it was lipstick that literally
protruded from your face in an exciting
pattern I'm the ultimate makeup novice I
didn't actually start wearing lipstick
until this year within like three months
i think i've acquired like 30 lipsticks
i've quickly become an addict please
send town i don't wear a ton of makeup
but when i do i like to have a really
bold bright lip and kind of draw
attention to it i've no idea what's
gonna happen today but let's go 3d
prints and makeup
still to Mandal and I'm the vice
president of product development and
innovation for Smashbox today we're
going to 3d prints and lipstick the idea
came about from a chemist in the lab if
you can 3d print chocolate from a
chemical makeup you should probably be
able to 3d print lipstick you really can
print any color that you want we create
special cartridges out of that specific
color and then they're loaded into the
printer we walked in and they were
system machine which almost looks like a
sewing machine met like a 1990s inkjet
printer the printer actually prints the
designs with dots of Lipson you watch
that like we're around and heat up and
then you see little droplets melt and
like almost like one-by-one like little
snowflakes form the design what was also
really cool is how quick the design was
created I imagined in my head that it
would take like at least 5 minutes but
it's like 2017 and so it printed out
really quickly which I thought was
really rad once it's printed out then
you can actually use it you can apply it
with your finger you can apply it with a
brush part of it is that it's
customization design opportunity but
also it is a way to sample different
shades seeing how the printer does it
and the different layers it really is a
science this form of 3d printing is
really only the beginning we have so
many ideas for how we can evolve this
look forward soon on Smashbox
there's my design like it's a lot it's a
trending arrow I also love this color I
feel like the world has changed so much
from when I was a kid we're entering
into an era where beauty has like a bad
Miss frontier like you never know what's
next something I think is really cool
about this is that it combines
engineering because you have the 3d
printer beauty and product because you
have all the different types of shades
and lipstick and then you also have like
the science behind it like partnered
with chemists to make this I just think
it's really cool it's so exciting mom I
need my fuchsia shade the proms tonight
I'm like printing they're freaking 3d
lipstick
