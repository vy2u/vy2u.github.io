what are you talking about my style has
changed so much I lived in a super small
town and it's like athletics and people
dressing like that was cool when I got
into middle school was when that shift
took place and I started to
quote/unquote fem it up whatever was
just like popular at the time which was
like a lot of big brand shirts they
didn't have the word trans in a small
town and so they just assumed and put me
in the gate at aghori I had to kind of
dress more as a boy and keep my
femininity in the closet I knew that if
I presented in a certain way it would
not raise any questions about my
sexuality Oh God
whyyy it's like 80 degrees happens
there's times where I like feel my
masculine energy and I want to embrace
that so I do dress down this is an
actual Pokemon chair
I have even looked yet ah a pretty boy
you know what's funny I see me in a
costume someone that is very much from
the Midwest I see the little awkward kid
he was just trying to like figure out
what he's doing definitely brings up
childhood high school memories of being
bullied that time I weighed that it was
more important to feel safe than to feel
seen and I'm putting my sunglasses on
and like hoping no one looks to me a lot
of people were like oh I haven't seen
you look so simple I think they wanted
to say basic but they said simple well
what do you think I'm not used to seeing
you and something so muted hey MN nice
lace bro you recognize you recognize
sweet like a flower girl from the 1990s
I started overcompensating by using
humor and by being really outrageous I
think people are gonna look at me and
either think that you and I are dating
really or they are going to think that I
don't yet know I'm a lesbian or that I
am actively trying to go back in the
closet
I ran into a friend of mine and I was
like hey how are you and they had no
idea who I was they didn't recognize me
first off that's my shirt and those are
my pants
I haven't gotten any super strange
reactions today but I've noticed that I
feel lazy I wasn't put together and
therefore I feel like I wasn't putting
forth my best effort this I'm wearing
I'm wearing what I wore when I was in
the closet how do you feel when you're
dressed like this do you feel like
you're in high school
yeah like I feel myself like tugging at
my shirt and like just insecure I don't
know if I've ever been more envious of a
mannequin clothes really do impact me
and how I feel my friends want to go and
take like cute pictures while we were
out on our brunch and I was like really
self-conscious about what I was wearing
I am so grateful that like I face my
fear and I went against society in my
small town and I came out of the closet
I think I would tell my younger self
that it's okay to be different as long
as it's you you have to go to bed at
night and ask yourself are you happy I'm
just super gay and I'm really happy
about it which is gay and more than one
sense of the word both senses big happy
lesbian I would just tell that little
boy that he's gonna be okay and then it
gets better when you love yourself and
accept yourself other people will do the
same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
