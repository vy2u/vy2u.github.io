here in Los Angeles California I asked
my friend Sierra Amy deja and Becky to
do a photo shoot with me I would call it
a motivational shoot so first I asked
them to have the girls tell me a part of
themselves that they wanted to own more
then I was going to take photos of them
and that heightened image of himself I
can do fierce and sexy but sometimes I
struggle showing my sensitive side like
the sweet vulnerable part need to work
on that
I get so enveloped in my academics and I
often pigeonhole myself as this overly
studious person I want to work on
reminding myself that I can also be this
carefree social butterfly hey what do
you want to work so something I want to
work on
being conscious while I'm being bold
what do I want to work on I think
sometimes I box myself in in this cute
image and I want to work on more
confidently emulating my more serious
side without feeling silly about it the
Sierra she always goes for like a fierce
look so I wanted her to kind of feel
like she was having fun and laughing and
when she stepped in front of the camera
right at the beginning she went straight
into a fierce look then I started
coaxing her into smiling and she
definitely opened up and let her guard
down for Dasia
I just kept reminding her not to close
up her body it's okay to take up space
own the space so she would want to put
her arms down a lot kind of closed her
body off but I kept making her polar
arms up opening up her body instead of
dealing Timnath we made her feel bold
which was beautiful Amy does have a
carefree side of her she kind of pigeon
holds herself into a studious side when
we got in front of the camera I just
made her dance and that carefree side
definitely came out right off the bat
now if Rebecca first she kind of felt
silly about taking pictures and feeling
serious but I just kind of snapped her
back into it you know not think of
herself as cute I wanted her to think of
herself as powerful and a boss and there
was nothing silly about her trying to
embody that
you are no longer just a studious
student but instead you're also ready I
like the light okay I'll make Sheila to
them and don't just say I like the light
you freaking fool you look amazing this
is the first time you see in this photo
yeah
like the first time I've ever seen
myself kind of like take over a space
I'm not something I ever wanted
sweet I just look so good like this
looks like with a covergirl yeah sweet
and bubbly
that's my it was definitely a challenge
to not be conscious of how I was holding
my bodies I'm so used to like owning you
stare down the camera but once it's off
right I actually just started having fun
maybe like it really captured my inner
me like my acid
amazing woman you're about to go into
the office and kill people but save the
world same time yes yeah no I know like
I own something or like I had property
I'm like that a lot of us bill logged in
in a certain identity that we feel like
we can't escape and I know that taking
photos isn't a problem-solver of
everything but it does help them
visualize another side of themselves
that they don't see plus it makes them
honest about what they're trying to work
on we can't ask people to look at us
this way if we don't embody and believe
it ourselves so I think that's a very
important first step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
