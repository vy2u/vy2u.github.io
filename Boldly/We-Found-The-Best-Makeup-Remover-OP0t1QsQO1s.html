PD or Gwyneth Paltrow because I really
don't know who that is either I mean I
know who she is but I just I don't know
where I'm personal level
love makeup I love going the full nine
yards every morning and putting on a
full face between my waterproof mascara
my waterproof eyeliner and just like
baking my entire face of nothing moves I
always have a hard time just like
literally taking everything off so this
week I'm going to be trying beetle to
makeup remover challenge which is going
to consist of me trying five different
products and reading that one doesn't
take it a lot - how much time did that
really take Ansari any wild factors that
I might have there's so many different
makeup removers out there I feel like
this is the time for me to at least
branch out and see what's the ultimate
makeup one of my co-workers so where's
my coconut oil so I'm gonna talk to her
figure out what her techniques are and
like how she likes to use it I'm going
in blind and I don't know exactly how I
love oil I swear by you I'm trying the
Trader Joe's coconut oil it's been
really really hot so this just
completely melted I'm gonna set the
timer and you'll see how much this is
first night coconut oil I'm a fan but I
don't see what the hype is all about if
you wear heavy makeup I don't think
you'll be able to use just the coconut
oil because it leaves dirty oil on your
face like I feel like I need to cleanse
after this I don't feel completely clean
coconut oil I see you I tried you it's
the end of day 2 and I talked to Annie
today about how to use the Garnier
micellar water I like it because it's
cheap and I go through a bottle pretty
quickly so I'm not investing money on
something else you have to shake the
bottle and then wash your face so you
can wipe off the excess residue you want
to take off my makeup you just hold the
pad to your eye for like five seconds
and then it will
that took a lot of my makeup off that
took like all of my makeup off
definitely gets a 5 out of 5
taking off everything on my face that
was like easy like I didn't have to rub
I didn't have to like pole it was like
the Mulan moving around just like and it
was gone there was some hype to miss
Millar that I never really knew about
until today so far winning Factor like I
give it up to the Miss lot it's the end
of day three and I'm heading home to go
try the makeup eraser makeup towel Jaz
told me that it's fairly easy and simple
to use you need something else really
quick it'll get it off but you really
need to wash her face afterwards I don't
use it anymore because honestly like it
wasn't the best thing to use the ears
are on it's about to get serious
I'm still like have these little clumps
of mascara my face is really dry and it
feels really raw now wow factors there
the fact that you just have to use water
and it literally lasts up to a thousand
washes I feel like I still haven't found
that one makeup product that's gonna be
the end-all of makeup products where it
takes off everything until tomorrow
until I have my full face on we're gonna
try the lemare got it at Nordstrom it
was $90 I'm so scared to try this and
find out how much I actually really like
it
I don't have any leftover oil on my face
so it doesn't feel heavy at all it just
feels very clean it didn't take a long
time and I didn't feel like I had to
drag my my product all over my face for
the wow factor it's like extra of course
that's probably what I'm paying for this
natural pearl powder but I want to be
mad at it because it's $90 but it really
did work really well and my face feels
great if you're really gonna invest this
was a solid product it is the last day
of the ultimate makeup remover challenge
we gonna try the last product ooh I
really have high hopes for this because
this is one of the lures best of beauty
Award winners I take these things very
seriously let's get into this luminous
melting cleanser
that's really cute Meaghan will say hey
mom everything's gone my mascara is gone
my eyeliners gone my entire face is gone
I wish you're just faster like I wish
the process was faster for the wow
factor I love that it's literally made
with 79% organic content and honestly a
big fan tomorrow when I go to work I'm
going to calculate everything right down
the pros the cons of everything that I
like to have all the products that I
tried this week and we'll see I'm in the
office and I calculate all the amazing
results and actually is super super
surprised with fourth place came the
makeup eraser that I was the most
curious about and I was super surprised
because of all the crazy reviews online
third place actually went to coconut oil
and I totally thought it would have
either been first or second for second
place it was actually a shared tie
between goop and the Garnier micellar
water the mists Larwood had the
consistency of a toner while the goop by
Juice Beauty was like a full-on balm and
the prices were so different but
literally both the products worked and
felt the exact same at the end of the
day what came in first place was
actually the lemare cleansing oil how
quickly it broke down everything and how
easily it took off and then just like
the overall feeling of my face is really
what stood out overall looks like
lemare's kicked everyone's ass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
