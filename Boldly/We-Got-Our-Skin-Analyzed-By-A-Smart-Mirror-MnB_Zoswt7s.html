writer of BuzzFeed
I'm Trey and I am a skin care aficionado
and today we're gonna be trying a smart
mirror the smart mirror is supposed to
analyze your face and give you a smart
makeover we've become a society that has
like smart everything so it's only a
matter of time until we got a smart
mirror and there's a lot of hype around
that so I'm really interested in trying
it but I'm also low-key scared that it's
gonna be like how old are you 97 do you
even drink water oh this is cute I like
this it looks cool you can use your hand
to scroll up and down honestly like if
you're home doing this and someone walks
in they're gonna be like what's wrong
let's do it the skin I know I seen red
spot oh it's giving me all these numbers
but I'm not really sure if any of these
numbers are good or bad so I'm looking
at my wrinkle count
I've only guy six wrinkles that ain't
that crazy I have eight wrinkles
it's traumatized I'm just kidding I'm 29
and it's I'm doing some wrinkles my fine
lines I have 60 that sounds like a lot
775 pores 47 fine lines 148 dark spots
it's just my freckles 13 are red spots
which again none doesn't seem I mean
that is how Angola that's that's a lot
of risk buds
we're about to try the virtual makeover
I'm gonna do me right now oh my god it's
so bad I'm slightly triggered my
eyebrows are non-existent like how I
used to pluck them in like the early
2000s the lashes are popping oh pretty
pleased with the outcome so it was
interesting it's definitely not what I
expected the whole process me like it's
so specific and a little creepy it's
like we're getting my skin analyzed my
had the smear was I think was like a
really cool thing to do I feel like we
all know and we have things out either
you want to prove about your skin or
that you love about your skin wrinkles
and fine lines and dark circles happen
to everyone and I don't think seeing a
number or getting you know breakdown of
what it is
should make anyone feel worse or better
20 years from now I'm sure everybody
we're all gonna be feeding off our
skincare numbers I could tell you
looking like a 10% dark circle oh I got
that 25 percent dark circle it's
probably gonna be a competition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
