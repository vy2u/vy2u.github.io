like glitter it follows you everywhere
my BFF Sheila and I are switching our
morning routines I'm hella worried cuz
sissy comes into work like an hour late
I don't know what she does in the
morning that probably takes a lot of
time to look that good every day I'm
gonna miss the process of my morning
routine but if it means I'm staying in
bed for a little bit longer I'm not
gonna complain it's hard for me to wake
up in the morning so I have to have a
good playlist going on so you have to
listen to top 40 I put foundation on but
I like use my hand sometime cuz it's
cleaner than a brush and then I make
sure I have good eyeliner game lately
I've been making even Anna protein
pancakes I love watching the news I like
to stay informed I'll have my first full
glass of coffee before I leave for my
morning skin routine in the morning
cleanser owners ear and moisturizer
sunscreen eyeshadow eyeliner brows
obviously highlight contour setting
primer foundation concealer sometimes I
bake in the morning which is really
great like the under eye bags I like
baking I don't know what baking I put on
fake eyelashes this is gonna be tough I
like don't even know how to put fake
eyelashes on good luck that's what love
bestfriend think we're not gonna be best
it is day one of training Sheila's
morning routine so running off no coffee
I'm wearing no highlighter and I really
miss my skincare routine but we'll see
how this week goes I was like really
feeling my eyeliner cuz I never wear it
on the bottom half way through the day I
was like I regret everything about this
eyeliner every time I do my under eye my
eyes water up and then it just like
smudges even deeper and up at 6 a.m.
right now feeling really tired all of
this cost me like about $100
finally to putting foundation on my face
it took me about 45 minutes to just wash
my face and kind of get everything
situated I get why she's late now don't
get me started on the eyelashes this was
the death of me I put the glue on the
eyelashes and it wouldn't
stick on my eyes but a stick on my hair
and my hands and everywhere else and it
took me like 40 minutes to just put my
eyelashes on I immediately noticed your
lashes they look good feel proof yeah I
mean I couldn't do lashes that well I
have like breakout acne right now and
like I can't put any serums to treat it
my face feels so dry and I don't know
how Sheila doesn't and look at all the
products that I usually just use to get
ready and now I'm just restricted to
like one facial scrub this is way too
much effort to get up in the morning I'm
not trying to wake up at 6 a.m. just to
put my face on I could get a workout in
at 6 a.m. make my protein pancakes and
get my face done in my regular team but
with sissy's routine I just got my
eyelashes done in that 30 minutes you
look good you should you should adopt
some of this I feel like you look like a
sleeker and make your makeup look bolder
about to apply my foundation I like
chose the lightest coverage foundation I
have because applying with your fingers
does no justice for me and I'm wearing
no primer underneath this so on top of
everything I'm not even sure it's gonna
stick oh I don't like it I miss my
Beauty Blender I miss my brushes oh not
looking forward to two hours worth of
beauty needs I tried to bake and to be
honest I don't know if I did it
correctly at all finally got everything
it takes to me banana protein pancakes
to be honest this wasn't as hard as I
thought it would be but at the same time
it's taking a lot more of my morning
than I expected
here goes
this barely means arm bad banana
pancakes though yeah that made me feel
hella healthy it would be really great
with these pancakes
is coffee I'm going to listen to NPR
because I don't have cable and I can
listen to C's morning show I'm gonna put
on some current events and get informed
in the world that was really cool I like
being informed I didn't realize how much
I appreciated knowing about the world
you look so beautiful when you come into
work don't know how you pull it off
because I feel like I look like crap my
foundation doesn't look blended
I don't have a highlight going on I'm
usually come to work and I'm like a
light bulb of highlight and I'm just
like a dull bronze out version of my
usual self are you not wearing any
highlight do you notice anything
different about me no really I mean I
think your eyeliners bolder I'm using
highlight I don't even know what that
means get out of here you're fine you
look like an Eliza I feel like I'm
starting to get the hang of this and it
looks great in natural light it was cool
just to be like thinking if she lived in
the morning and how she's depriving me
of coffee they're giving me pancake I
think it's super important to take care
of her face and wake up early enough to
kind of like pamper yourself I think
it's good to be looking fresh and
confident I think we should definitely
do this again I like you and I like your
routines but I'm gonna go back to my
routine
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
