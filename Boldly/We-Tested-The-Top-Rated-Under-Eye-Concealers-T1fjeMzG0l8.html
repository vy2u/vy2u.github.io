the whole point was that we looked tired
but I know I look tired thank you this
is Clinique and I feel like I hear
nothing but like good things about Lemmy
Clinique was my first makeup I ever got
as a job Oh child that sounds weird but
he feels like some nice texture here oh
who is really the tax job that good I
can't coverage I actually gave it a one
does look like it's did anything I put a
big old glob under my eyes and really
smooths it in there and I see purple
stuff but it just kind of felt a lot
more stick easy I think I just need
something thicker cuz my under-eye is
real blue you're trying NYX photogenic
felt very smooth and light look at the
difference whoa this is incredible
it's a perfect amount of coverage where
it doesn't look cakey but it's also not
so sure that I have to do multiple coats
for coverage I gave it a four wives are
a big deal for me and I would just don't
throw around fives for blending I also
gave it a four for for coverage and then
a five for blending I know I big deal is
a commitment very natural and my act I'd
be interested to see if this one lasts
throughout the day or if it turns into
like those little canyons of cover-up so
this is Revlon Photoready I love Revlon
liquid concealer it feels a little
thicker poof I don't know about that
yeah this is a weird feeling I'm not
liking the texture of it I feel like
it's very dry there's not enough
moisture and I coverage I gave it a 3
I'm hoping for more maybe this isn't for
my skin maybe my skin is real weird so I
gave the coverage a three
felt like it was adequate I don't hate
it and it gets a lot of points in my
heart because it's cheap next we have is
NARS radiant creamy concealer so that
it's a very high expectations I'm gonna
be glowing up in this pan
NARS as soon as everyone is talking
about its really softly you can
immediately feel the DiMucci yeah yeah
it feels very creamy oh this is a
squishy brush so that was a matches your
skin day really well yeah it does yeah
that looks good yeah
maybe this might be worth of money after
all so the dinars is a little thicker
than the NYX I think it has incredible
coverage it's smooth it looks good the
only thing that I'm not feeling is it's
a little thick feel like the NARS is
more for someone who wears makeup like
full foundation it just went five seven
at all and I all really nice I like the
applicator I like the color my winner is
the NYX so my winner is B NARS
I'm gonna test it out NYX and why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
