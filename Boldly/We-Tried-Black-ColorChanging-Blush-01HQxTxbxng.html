blush black black no goth what dark no
blush what I need blush because I look
truly dead if I don't have it but also
if I go just too far I look like a dead
person when they got their makeup done I
do have a very difficult time finding
shades that work with my skin tone very
anti blush before for the exact same
reasons couldn't find the great color I
don't work well with pink Y but I don't
know oh come on Jimmy bliss how
zani you like is it actually a good
product is it black there's little
rabbits in the lace thank you that's a
black lace rabbit sorry allergic to
novelty so this is a cream blush which
already I'm into that because why not
I'm just like used to my things you know
yeah you're used to your things you do
it first tippity tap tap tap it's
different little anyway turns mmm fourth
day of your period red that's exactly a
lot more pigmented than I was expecting
that's actually great it's not crazy
either way it's not only just not
showing up but it's also not so bright
that you're like oh it's actually
kind of nice I think it's a little
plummy for you this is very oh I would
say consistency wise yeah it's like a I
look crazy I think it looks a little too
much like my actual like blood it's very
plummy and blood like and like not cute
enough lifted I'm not used to seeing you
in the
Kelly it's weirding me I know I feel the
same about you you look like a porcelain
doll literally don't smile like that
they'll go like this I don't mind the
formulation of it my face is pretty dry
I don't mind like a product like this
that has like a good event you look
younger and I look older you look like a
little kid like going to their recital I
won't like care your auntie it's already
color-changing lipstick and color Jenny
meals and a color-changing pramana hair
dye and then you just add your
color-changing blush when you're ready
to color change out in the world
maybe I'm just like a really typical
makeup type of person so I'm just like
let me see the color let me put it on
yeah I like a little drama in my makeup
collection so I might not be a perfect
color change for me but it might be for
you thanks mom thanks aunty did I do
