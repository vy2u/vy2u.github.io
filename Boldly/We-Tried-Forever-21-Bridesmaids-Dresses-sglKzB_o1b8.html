when I was in junior high school,
so to think that they're
like keeping on par
with their audience growing up
and getting into the marriage
age, makes me feel old.
(upbeat music)
- I don't think of Forever 21
and think like, oh elegant,
like I think of like casual and sporty.
- Anything with a wedding label
is just outrageously expensive.
- I hope they look good on
or at least photograph well cause I guess
that's what's important in a wedding.
- I'm just excited to
see what they look like.
(upbeat music)
- Yah!
It's really soft and flowy.
I've never worn this color
and I don't know why.
- Oh, I really like that color on you.
- It feels like it's perfect
for dancing and just having fun.
- I have a lot of feelings.
I really don't like these sleeves.
I don't love the idea of when
dresses get to a certain size,
kind of like adding more fabric,
there's no like my body is
something to be like hidden.
- Yah, oh my god, I
love this color on you.
- The back is my entire back,
right, cause the sleeves.
- Oh no, yeah, it's totally covered.
- And it's definitely a little warm.
- Oh I like it.
- So it's super comfortable.
I'm not wearing a bra because
the back is super low.
- Hello.
The fabric is very soft, like I feel
like I'm being like swaddled
in something delightful.
- I might need your help
cause I don't really know
what's going on behind here.
The moment I like lean
over to say hi to someone,
everyone's gonna see
what's going on underneath.
- So I was actually surprised
when how comfortable the dresses were,
I was specially a fan of the print.
- Also like the price isn't too bad.
I think the dresses I tried
on were like 78 dollars,
so if someone was like,
hey you're going to be in my wedding,
this is the dress you're going to wear,
I wouldn't mind paying for it.
- I love the idea of fast
action bridesmaids dresses,
I like the idea of there
being like some lower
price competition for these brands
like Anthropology and J Crew,
like these beautiful, beautiful,
wonderful dress lines,
but it's like 400 dollars,
you know, I gotta eat.
- They're on the cheaper side which
you can tell in the fabric,
but overall they were
great and I would wear them
and if I ever get married
I would make my bridesmaids
buy something cheap like that,
because it was cute and affordable.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
