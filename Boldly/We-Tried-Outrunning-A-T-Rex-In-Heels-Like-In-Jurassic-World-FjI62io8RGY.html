jawline but like do t-rexes have brows
not getting like nail art on this bad
boy
I definitely jealous guarantee rise
welcome to our laboratory I'm Chrissy
and I'm sissy
some people do crazy in the name of
beauty but most of the time is more
fiction than fact
and we're here to find out what's real
and what's bogus today we're going to
see if we can outrun a t-rex in heels
oh dude I was watching Jurassic world
last weekend I was holed up in my
tiniest apartment on my tiny little
couch and I was eating my nacho cheese
flavored tortilla chips watching this
beautiful film and there's a part in it
you know the really cute girl Claire I'm
like fashion e1 oh my goodness I love
her style okay okay the t-rex
comes out through those gates
and she's like oh dude I gotta run
and then instead of just like running
like a normal human she runs in three
and a half inch stilettos had leather
new heels not even round toe it's like a
slight point do you think that shit's
real it's not that the eyed girl gets
you you get your work done and you get
your heels done I don't know I'm still
shook by this and I think that we should
go to a paleontologist and figure it out
and see if it's real or not I don't if
you get this out - okay take that
palette it's cute
alright sissy so we got our dope ass
traffic Park beat our dope ass
clipboard we are on our way
answers my hypothesis is that this ain't
happening we did she probably started
her day not realizing that everything
was gonna hit the fan class broken glass
everywhere without heels she would have
died died I think we're doing that dude
a lot of credit
he is just big tiny hearts aren't like
runners all like all about the arms or
something I don't know I never run you
physically can't carry that much weight
back quickly to hippos those things have
that fast or maybe it was our first oh
 it now anyway let's go look at some
dinos let's look at some bone hello who
are you
I'm Nate Smith I'm an associate curator
here in the dinosaur instituted the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County so tell me more about the t-rex
like what's the deal why is its head so
big why is its arm so small t-rex lived
around 66 million years ago they're
growing throughout their life and like
us they had a kind of teenage years
where they're growing much more rapidly
geez most of us were pretty awkward at
17 but at 7,000 pounds it would have
been even worse some dinosaurs might
have lived in social groups and been
friendly with each other but certainly
there were also predator prey
interactions there was like Dino drama
how fast is a t-rex rocks well this has
been a question that's garnered a lot of
debate in the paleontological community
here X could probably run between 11 and
24 miles an hour evidence would suggest
that he's probably not a marathoner
that's how I run just for like five
seconds and then I stop and could you
like recreate what a run would look like
from a t-rex
we can't scientists can actually model
that type of motion can you do it can I
do it maybe just a little like you'd
have your
sup here yeah I can't actually bend my
legs in there no okay
so have you ever worn heels I look great
do you think I could outrun one
absolutely not oh the speeds that we
have from people like the same bolt are
faster than the upper boundaries of
what's been estimated 40 reps so they
would have no problem getting away do
you think I or anyone should try this
experiment I think you might want to
consult with your podiatrist first he's
sound I just have a little quickie
question when she went buys running in
three-and-a-half inch heels on a
treadmill from a t-rex I don't think you
need us out here to tell you then you're
gonna break your frickin ankle Chrissie
so you wouldn't recommend it hey love
you bye okay let's get this test started
treadmill that replicates running
through the jungle check nude patent
leather heels that are precisely
have inches check person that doesn't
want to get eaten
shucks big
check this treadmill gets up to 12 miles
per hour which means Chrissy you're able
to hit a consistent 11 miles per hour or
above you have outrun an t-rex
how you feel I am very stressed I'm like
sweating it haven't done anything yet
also what's my safe word hey it's Nate
let's get started yeah let's do this
shred male debate it this is casual
he hasn't even come out the gate yeah
just going about my day at work I'm
Claire oh my god to your ex hey girl
there's panic in Jurassic world all you
hear is people screaming there's
something coming
[Laughter]
well it's clear that I absolutely fail
so let's bring in someone who is a wee
bit more athletic vinaya welcome krishna
curry in elite track at seeds there you
go thanks for having me oh my god thanks
for coming do you think that you could
outrun a t-rex yes in those heels for
sure let's do this because if you can't
do no one can treadmill is like
a Childress ik world walk you're like
hanging out in the park it's a good
asset to build it - OH
faster lights that wasn't under
treadmill I can go faster hi - up why
did that look so easy when she did it
since Christian I killed it we're gonna
add in some extra hello
holy she didn't bash what heals
human t-rex gone our final final
conclusion is that yes a human can
outrun a t-rex in three and a half inch
heels there are the circumstances that
they are at like so if Claire was a good
runner
she absolutely could have outrun a t-rex
yeah yeah yeah do you guys think
something's bogus that you want us to
figure out for you leave it in the
comments below and we'll try those
figure it out because we're scientists
Hannah back to lab guys bye
