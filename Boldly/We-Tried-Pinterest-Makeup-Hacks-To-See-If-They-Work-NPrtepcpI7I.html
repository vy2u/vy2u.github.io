like if David Bowie had pinkeye
hi I'm Chelsea and I love makeup but I'm
kind of bad at it and I'm essence a
beauty editor and I'm pretty okay at it
she's great at it so today we're gonna
try four different beauty hacks and see
if any of them are worth it we're gonna
bust some hacks this heck is using eight
to make the perfect winged eye I've
never done a successful winged eye I
just feel like this is kind of a hassle
so I'm interested to see if it worked
here this in half just hope I don't lose
any lashes you also kind of have to have
like a skill set to know like where the
wing is supposed to be I can't talk and
do this also you can't blink this is the
ultimate test I'm kind of scared this is
gonna hurt
oh it works like there's definitely like
a very even line situation happening
I've messed this up really bad I don't
know how I managed to get eyeliner
underneath the tape it is fairly easy to
use but I feel like hacks are supposed
to keep me from like making this mess on
my face that I literally do not know how
this got on my cheek every day no but
like when you want to slay yes the way
it works is that you put one coat of
mascara on and then you put baby powder
on your lashes and then you put more
mascara on I don't know if it's going to
work I feel like it's probably not okay
maybe close your eyes I'll have my white
lashes look like I should be in frozen
no G there is a difference if they look
like more defined and thicker it's
definitely longer I give this like a 7
out of 10 you will get baby powder on
your nose and people might mistake that
as something else
so do your due diligence and clean that
up so now I'm trying the red lipstick as
a concealer for dark under eyes go right
in so I'm gonna also try this for like
other areas of my face it has like
blemishes or I look good now I'm going
to apply a little concealer over the red
and blend it what I just like keep
blending I don't think I can't see this
getting better I can't really tell a
difference guess you're right I can't
see the dark circle because it's just
pink no one's got time for this
I really bloggers actors that's their
job I'm gonna say this hack is a no for
me we're going to take broken eyeshadow
mix it with Vaseline and see if it can
wear like a lipstick or a lip tint like
I would do this to save something that
like I didn't want to throw out cuz I
felt bad that it was broken and mix this
like a little pace to me
I'm gonna take my finger luzina this
could make a good highlighter this is
the finished product I like it I really
like that idea for a highlighter with
the right color maybe the lips I don't
know if I would like do it all the time
but if I had a really pretty eye shadow
color then I might give it a go hats are
great if you're a beginner at makeup and
you don't really know what you're doing
but other than that they're really just
kind of pointless and a waste of time I
think a hack should always make your
life easier
most of these did not make my life
easier I don't know if I would use it
but like I don't know what my future
holds I think I'm getting beat
