videos here in New York for BuzzFeed so
I found this face mask by a company
called Hannah cure that people are
calling the zombie mask when you put it
on your face it dries up and tightens
your face and makes it look like a
zombie I think it'd be really funny to
make my co-workers try it on and see
what they look like my skincare routine
takes me about maybe like three to five
minutes I'm really bad with my skincare
I'm like that person that usually falls
asleep with their makeup on the entire
process takes about 15 minutes morning
and night it's like years off my life
but I don't care I think it's really
important I have heard of the zombie
face mask I don't know what it does for
your skin but I've seen a lot of people
on the internet trying it and they look
terrifying
so this looks really fancy it's called
the hana cure the all-in-one facial
immediate visible results will see BAM
anything with this punch instructions I
probably wouldn't do ever anti-aging
clarifying lifting I love lifting like
this is some real I'm ready to do
this I think I just know how to do it
I'm not - I'm not following this should
I break it smells like vodka get this
t-zone because honey I'm boilie team
oily skin all day if the death chamber
is the color of my hair it feels like a
treatment you would definitely get like
a spa like a good spot oh not no Groupon
Spa so I put it on my leg mustache a
legit feel like this is some Shin
Beyonce has y'all alright so we're done
and now I'm just going to wait have the
mask on I can already feel it tightening
and we're just going to hang out and see
what happens so it's been 30 minutes
I can barely open my mouth and now we're
about to wash it off okay so it was very
tight on my face I don't know if I look
like a zombie more like a reptilian
zombie this feels like some old-timey
shape okay I look like a walking dead
cast mate
it looks like my skin is actually
flaking off now I know what I'm gonna
look like when I turn 90 I feel like I'm
still be cute well my skin looks
actually like really good I think this
mess definitely delivers I would use
this as I'm hungover I feel like it's
just very relaxing I think the only time
I would ever use this as I was going on
a red carpet which I don't think I'm
ever going on the red carpet I wouldn't
necessarily recommend if you are like 20
because you have the skin of a baby
anyway I am gonna put a moisturizer on
after this though because I do notice
that it's it's not dry it's just tight
if you have the money like that to spin
on skin care then I totally think it's
worth it but until then I think I'll
just be sticking to
my drugstore products so after using the
zombie mask I put on a moisturizer
definitely use a moisturizer just so you
get the added benefit of that
moisturizer sinking into your face love
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
