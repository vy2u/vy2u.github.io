should make our friends fall in love
this is my best friend D she's a bomb
photographer DS definitely someone that
has a quiet confidence about her this is
my friend Mike the known him for about
10 years he's goofy energetic and smiley
if this doesn't work I don't believe in
love
we wanted to put it to the test there's
some pretty good questions like they get
a real deep real fast
yeah real fast so they're broken up into
three different sets they're gonna go
into three different locations and ask
each other these questions now we're
gonna see we can make some love and
happen and we're gonna trick them we're
gonna tell them that they're just
answering these questions to like figure
out what the best questions to make
friends are they think it's all about
friendship then we're hoping they'll all
of a sudden
I'm optimistic I am too I'm ready for
some lovin to happen my name is Mike
vermin's oh and I'm here to make an
instant friend my name is Dominic Smith
and I'm gonna try to make a friend in 24
hours I don't like I'm Dominique could
be you good to meet you too so you want
to go first or shrug off loose burka I
would say Eartha Kitt because I love her
music I just really loved her style and
the energy that she gave to the world my
perfect day is one where I don't have to
go on schedule I can just kind of go
with flow it's great day let's go paddle
or you know that is a really interesting
question um I feel like I would die
doing something really clumsy tripping
and like falling a little Street and in
context of partner
is that like
they just got through their first set of
questions they I felt very stiff by the
last question I definitely feel like you
could start to feel a little bit of a
connection I'm really curious to see how
they handle the next set I would want to
know who wins the 2020 World Series
when chill because in terms of my life I
would rather do not know what I value
most is trust I would probably be a
little bit more reckless perhaps go
skydiving more and be able to spend all
the money that I've ever made your
credit you don't want a giant spending
spree I'm probably the same I would go
and see my friends more often because
we're scattered kind of throughout the
United States internationally I like to
make stupid jokes what's a pirate's
favorite letter of the alphabet as it
are yeah but it's actually I see the
last time that I cried in front of
another person was a couple months ago
when my dad passed I'm trying to choose
whether I should pursue grad school or
stay where I currently am at my job
going to a job that's just like a daily
grind it's like it sucks I've already
tried the stables parts now I'm going
for the not stable and so I mean I guess
that the advice for both of us would
pretty much seem to be the same yeah the
last thing that you will do is stare
into each other's eyes
for two minutes yeah there's a long time
staring into each other's eyes for two
minutes one two three go
cool
it's difficult for me to focus on one
thing for two minutes apparently and
then each I I didn't really have any
thoughts on what to expect I didn't know
who I was supposed to be meeting or like
what they were like getting a friend
within 24 hours the deeper questions I
think are help to speed that up cool
this video is not about becoming friends
don't you see them like more in love now
I don't know how do you guys yeah I
think if anything
friendship is is a better word there is
love in friendships that makes sense now
these questions yeah we were wondering
oh my god this was initially like in
what context that's partner me in it so
I don't really feel in love but I could
say that like we have you've grown
closer you in love is like something
that takes time and I don't believe in
like instant love at first sight and
like boom starters just instantly
collide or out of me I haven't gotten
there yet I'd like to I could see us
hanging out again utilities go bungee
jumping together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
