and my swamp-ass turned into swamp leg
what's up guys my name is Hal I make
videos here at BuzzFeed in New York I
just got a link for my my coworker James
he sent me this link to the clear
plastic jeans that Topshop is making
these things are absolutely wild I think
I'm going to make my co-workers try them
on so I'm about to go to bathroom try
these clear pants on and see how it goes
it's good we sized up because I don't
think these are particularly forgiving
pants the plastic kind of felt cool when
I first put it on but now it's feel like
it's starting to trap my body heat I
feel like I could jump in a really big
puddle right now we're taking him
outside oh okay okay
look at me okay so I have them on as you
can see and we're gonna go see what
BuzzFeed has to say so let's go I just
want to know what you think of my pants
it feels like um a raincoat obviously a
woman who wears these pants has no
secrets
she is exposing her true self
hey Jeremy I'm wearing new pants and I
want to know what you think look good
Jeremy can you see this trend catching
on uh hi Kevin um I want to know what do
you think of my pants they're very
interesting how much do they cost
they cost $100 will you give me $100
I'll make you a couple pairs of those
okay to be honest they actually look
like kind of cool I'm worried about
athlete's foot you're getting like wet I
cannot believe how much moisture you
have accumulated why did you do this
honey he'll make me the logistics of
these pants are making me so
uncomfortable and I really hope that you
don't have your period all right so we
heard from people at BuzzFeed now we're
gonna go out on the streets of New York
and see what the people think let's go
what do you think I think they look kind
of different kind of cool wow that's
something else
that look like a passive bag I mean
they're very cute but it definitely
looks like it would make you a little
sweaty so you think this trend is gonna
catch on Oh some time to get adjusted to
maybe for Coachella or got fall or
something got party a lot so if you were
there like wear some colors underneath
it Wow so that means your legs is greasy
shiny is sweaty I guess that if you want
to show off the goodies or you just like
let me just go my grandmother couch and
rip them off and create my own design
they look good on you thank you so the
first 10 minutes of wearing the clear
pants was
amazing you wear them to a party
Coachella governor's fall wear them
somewhere where you want to get some
attention maybe you want to make a few
people laugh and then you should take
them all the sweat will drip down your
pants and eventually will create a
puddle underneath your other pants and I
here's hoping I didn't get a yeast
infection ladylike is moving to our own
