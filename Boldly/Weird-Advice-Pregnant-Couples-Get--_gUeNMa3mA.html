I can tell you're having a girl you're
carrying very high I can tell you're
having a boy because you're carrying so
high actually you shouldn't be eating
lemons yeah they make your baby hairy
this one came out looking like a Wookiee
what she did do you wear pee pads no
well you should because you're gonna be
peeing your pants a lot if you have a
c-section make sure that you close your
eyes because the doctor just scoops out
your organs and puts them on the table
next to you wait what
you take the placenta and you boil it
down into pills I did that after my
second was born it cured my anemia very
salty though you know what they say is
if you have like a glass and a half a
wine like a day it's actually okay now
you dip this thumb in iodine you might
get by without the orthodonture but
won't knock the thing off the university
are you pre registered for a preschool
are we well you got to do that you know
what's great as lip-balm nipple cream oh
it's so moisturizing oh oh I know what
that paint is someone give you all the
evil I give an egg with you we need to
rub an egg on your belly and say a
prayer gotta say it the baby
it's not a thing no that's a thing oh oh
no no no sweetheart don't lift your arms
too high over your head
yeah the umbilical cord or wrap around
the baby's neck and strangle it yes
you really shouldn't eat sugar it can
make the baby hyperactive should she be
eating sugar oh where did you get cake
oh and don't get an epidural because you
can't feel you're pushing too hard and
then you'll just tear your taint right
up to your asshole
cute and you're not still living with
your cats are you
oh no you've got to get rid of them the
cat litter is poison and they'll steal
the baby's breath oh no we don't want
kids dawn we're trying to reduce our
carbon footprint our baby has the carbon
footprint of 25 thousand plastic bags oh
[Laughter]
you're serious
you're not having sex while you're
pregnant are you private you'll hook the
baby right in the face
yep you'll poke the baby right in the
face and then for the rest of the life
they'll have a fear of penises oh my
gosh and there's only like one good
preschool and I don't even know what it
is have you done your research you know
what it is
oh no this kid is doomed you're gonna
screw this kid up no we're not yes we
are because everyone has something
different to say and the first person
contradicts the second person and I
don't know who to listen to that's the
point
what listen there's no one right way to
have a baby all we can do is listen to
our doctor and then decide what we think
is right you're right you're right you
guys expectant can we give you some
advice I had twins hmm ruined my body
I'll never take a bowel movement the
same way again
