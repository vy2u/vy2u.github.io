- Oh I know, I know!
Let's all go around the
table and talk about
what we're thankful for this year.
How about you guys start?
- Well...
I'm thankful that I always
have a ride from the airport.
- I'm thankful that I have someone who can
get me out of plans I don't want to make.
Oh your play!
Yeah I'd love to go but we...
have to visit her family
the next morning, yeah.
Sorry about that.
I'm also thankful that I have someone
who will listen to me
complain about my co-workers.
And then he just turns, and
takes credit for my idea!
- Ugh, you're kidding me.
I'm thank that I have someone who
will listen to me
complain about my family.
I mean I'm not really going to do that
because shes my sister and I love her
but I mean come on!
- I know right?
I'm thankful that I have someone
who will remind me what
I don't like on a menu.
What's &amp;quot;osso buco&amp;quot;?
- That's veal, you won't like it.
- Right.
- Do you want me to order for you?
- Please.
- I'm thankful that I have someone
who can act as my mirror.
Hey, do I have spinach in my teeth?
- Uhhh no, you're good.
I'm thankful that I have
someone who can reach
all those hard to reach spots.
- Oh, yup, that's it.
That's the spot, right there, right there.
- I'm thankful that I have someone who can
provide the other voice in conversations.
Emmet did you have a good day?
- (funny voice) It was pretty good.
- Yeah?
- (funny voice) Yeah, just kinda got up,
then I went to the litter box,
and then i took a little poop poop.
- I love it when you do that.
- Thanks.
But you know what I'm really thankful for?
That I have someone who will kill me,
before they let a zombie eat me.
- One bullet left.
(gunshot)
- Ok.
Um Grandpa, what are you
thankful for this year?
Thankful for.
Thankful.
It's Thanksgiving.
Don't say zombies.
- You can be thankful for
zombies Grandpa, it's ok,
but you know if you attack us
then we're gonna kill you.
- They're gonna kill you Grandpa.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
