when the baby gets here I don't have
time to work out I haven't seen you work
out in the last five years you're
certainly gonna get in shape now
oh come on isn't there something you're
gonna miss doing that for the baby
arrives yeah whoo
we've got anything going on this weekend
mm I don't think so
I'll take a road trip sure well that was
easy
hey you wanna watch a movie yeah but not
here isn't this better I'll have the
lobster
but isn't this great this place is
really nice
Oh fancy dinner just the two of us
something in now you hear that no what
exactly congratulations thank you this
was so great we have to do it again
really soon oh definitely you bet
we're never gonna see her again nope and
now we'll have a lobster and let's talk
about anything other than babies tonight
huh where's Ralph I mean we have such an
early morning tomorrow but you guys go
keep it going got a designated driver
designated Dede why are we watching this
because it's not frozen after the baby
it's gonna be all frozen and I'll have a
lobster why do you keep ordering the
lobster because I rare that if he
lobster around a baby it'll develop
allergies
where did you read that and don't say
the area what
all right let's go doors open at 8:00
what are you you're not even ready I'm
not gonna go what why because I'm tired
and pregnant but when the baby comes we
won't be able to go to concerts and
stuff so I'm okay with that
what why are you trying to cram all this
stuff into the last few months before
the baby gets here
are you having regrets oh no just I
don't know I just don't want us to
become boring parents at all yeah well I
think that might be inevitable but I
know that I would rather spend these
last few months just being here with you
then running around trying to complete
some dumb pre-baby bucket list you're
right you're right I saw are you that
I've been a little crazy lately it's
okay
you know you can still go in our concert
if you want to oh I don't even know what
the band's name is I just wanted to go
to go I think you're gonna be a really
cool dude yeah yeah yeah I got like the
cool leather jacket the dad stash I got
you and that
oh we're not going out what do you want
to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
