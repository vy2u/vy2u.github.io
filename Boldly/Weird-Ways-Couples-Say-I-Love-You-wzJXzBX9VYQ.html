give that a few minutes.
- Good to know.
- Did you have a good time?
- I had the best.
- Okay, hold on.
Let's drink some water so
you don't have a hangover.
You got to take your contacts out
and brush your teeth.
Brush it.
Hey, hey, you can't fall
asleep with your suit on.
- Oh I'm sorry, did you
have to be somewhere?
(cellphone buzz)
(camera clicks)
(flush)
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Forever.
(grunts)
You dead?
- I am.
- Good.
(making funny sounds)
(choked out)
(grunts)
What are you doing?
- Just keep watching TV.
- Oh God, it followed you.
It followed you.
- I tried.
- Did you unload the dishwasher?
- Mmhmm.
- Did you scooped the litter box?
- I did.
- Did you setup the coffee
so that it's ready to go in the morning?
- Oh you know.
- That is the sexiest thing
that I have heard all week.
- Oh yeah?
Well how about this.
I scrubbed the toilet.
- Ohhh, keep going, tell me more.
- I washed your car.
- Ohhh, give it to me more baby.
- I filled your car up with gas.
- Ohhh, there's the stuff.
Mwah.
- Wait, wait,
we're not just going to do it now?
- The moment kind of passed.
But thanks for doing all those things.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
