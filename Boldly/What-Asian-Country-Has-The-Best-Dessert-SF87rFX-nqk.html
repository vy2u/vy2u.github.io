I saw this on the web for the best agent
that's so desert what Asian country
makes the best dessert I'm afraid of
what the answer will be because I'm
Chinese and what if it's not Chinese
okay so my friend Nastasia has told me
that I must eat eBay which is a Filipino
ingredient it's a purple yam so we're
going to try to find a Filipino bakery
and eat some food a no red Li Lin bakery
and cafe my name's in it my name is Lin
not Li Oh baby hope yes they call this
help yeah oh yeah oh yeah yes like a
pastry hope yeah yeah oh they're hope
yeah yeah that's what I'm gonna get
still warm
yeah I like it more
it's 82 cents it's pretty - mmm purple
inside texture is starchy and like the
potato and very sweet doesn't taste
purple at all I don't know what purple
tastes like but doesn't taste purple
well-done Philippines well done
what dessert should I go get um Korea I
think do you think I should get the
shaved ice popping soup yeah yeah it is
very good
okay let's do it
okay let's do a one red bean shaved ice
pet being sued by saying that wrong but
not Koreans I'm allowed to I see TV I
see red bean I see mochi I see banana
I see mango ice is strawberry and I bet
they're shaved ice under there well look
Gabe there you are - hashtag Asian
dessert Heritage Month snow
so hope this is real
good and you think that you're just
eating fruit and ice oh so it's good for
you but the truth is it's covered in
sugar and this is totally deserved when
things are in bowls and they give you
spoons it's really hard to stop eating
so cold hopeful so comments are coming
in on my Facebook and my cousin who is
Chinese and suggested I go get them
which is a Chinese egg tart and I think
that's a brilliant idea
back to the motherland
Chinatown where I'm from we're from
China from China no and Ramayana and we
are in Chinatown
we are not yeah okay fuck that I am
Chinese American and we're going to get
Chinese American pastries one egg tart
okay so this is Python balls which is
like a sugar spongy thing and these are
sesame balls they're both delicious but
today I'm focused on one thing and that
is deafhope and egg tart I grew up
eating these quite regularly almost
every weekend in my life and my mom used
to actually toast them in the toaster
oven and would get quite the spoil to
get quite hot and then I would eat it
out with a spoon mmm mmm this cost 60
cents which i think is a pretty good
deal it actually cost more just sit at
this meter and eat this sunshine what's
up India
I don't care about this message to them
this TF of sweets boondi ladoo ladoo are
ball-shaped sweets popular in India
they're often served at very religious
and festive occasions
it's made of chickpea it's vegan and I'm
going to eat it very fragrant the word I
just said was free right
the texture is kind of like couscous
that's been packed together really tight
there's something perfumey about it do
you either like or you don't I think we
just have one more country left that my
stomach can handle and that will have to
be Thailand sticky rice with taro inside
this is the last dessert of the day is
sticky rice it's very similar to our
first treat the Philippines blue bag I
love it when a root vegetable is sweet
it feels like a meal because it's rice
and it's on a fork
okay I just need this
it's Korea Korea is
the patbingsoo just had all these
different elements it was cold and it
was sweet and it had fruit and it was
creamy and stop eating it growing up
when I thought of Asian food dessert was
definitely not the first thing I thought
of and it should be because it's frickin
delicious so in a way all the countries
wanted a yeah we all won because we all
got to eat dessert and we all learned a
valuable lesson that we should be eating
more dessert when we go into our Asian
restaurants
Asian desert she never helps when it's
important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
