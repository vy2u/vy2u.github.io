where the woman is looking forward and
the alien is in profile and just sort of
like a slimy ugly thing that's just like
at her ear
I feel like catcalling is like that but
everywhere you walk being catcalled
feels really scary I don't feel safe
it's so awkward it makes me feel
insecure because I wonder what I did to
invite it it's terrifying it does not
feel good I don't like it
I don't like it I don't like it what
scares me the most about it isn't the
fact that people are yelling out at you
it's the fact that it can escalate it's
a type of aggression that you feel like
you can't do anything about because you
don't know what else they're capable of
every interaction could be like a deadly
interaction I don't think that's an
exaggeration there's an undercurrent of
fear in every interaction borne out by
real news stories or you're like this
woman responded back to her cat collar
and they didn't take it well the thing
about catcalling is that it's never just
a compliment it's a guy saying that he
owns your body and that he's entitled to
speak to you because you're out in
public I'm just a pair of boobs walking
down the street that somebody needs to
like prove something to what makes you
think it's okay just to like call me out
and tell me what I'm wearing or tell me
how I look like I know how I look I know
what I'm wearing I don't need you to
tell me I really feel just like leave me
alone two people who are cat calling I
would say you scare me stop it you don't
have to do it give some thought to other
people's feelings know that you don't
have a right to my attention there are
definitely ways to approach people and
get to know strangers but screaming at
someone on the street about the way that
they look or the way that they're
dressed
doesn't seem like an effective way to
begin any sort of relationship would you
want somebody doing that to your sister
or your mother probably not this is
shitty we don't like it stop doing it
that's really all you need to know
it's so dope but all these women on the
internet and everywhere around the world
are like we won't take this anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
