BuzzFeed and when you're a producer at a
place like BuzzFeed you tend to get a
lot of followers on social media nice
now in the last several months I've
started seeing a new trend in comments
on my Instagram people keep calling me
dad but what is making them think I'm a
dad I mean I'm just hanging out with
this tree then I realize this isn't just
happening to me it's happening to Quinta
too so I got ahold of Quinta to ask her
what this all means do people call you
dead ya know like crazy and I didn't at
first I read it and I thought oh this is
this is when you think someone acts like
your dad right but then it's really like
senpai notice me more isn't it like yeah
but also I've taken as a compliment when
girls write it I think that's really
sweet they're like you're what I aspire
to be like it I think that's really nice
at first he did confuse me I was like no
tease little girls not calling me a mom
mm-hmm you know I mean I got a little
but then I put my pointer finger away
and just decided to accept it for what
was how did that start I don't know
where that came from
I think Lord had something to do with it
more like real Lord yeah what'd ya start
anything she doesn't seem like she's in
on the slang world I'm I think she
wanted to be like I want to start slang
today I think that she just started it
good lord
thank you that's a weird pun that you
literally make whoo with this
information I set out to see what role
Lorde actually had and propelling the
slang word now turns out she said it now
get out of here advertisement she said
it about Kim Kardashian when Kim
Kardashian showed her butt to the world
in an attempt to break the Internet she
should have said crack the Internet how
do you miss that joke anyway she
explains her reasoning and like Quinta
said it's a way of expressing that you
look up to someone but honestly to me
just because Lord does something doesn't
make it normal so I came out on the
streets of Hollywood to find out how
people react to me calling them mom and
dad let's find out Michael what do you
do for a living I'm a flight attendant
flight attendant wow so you're like
totally a dad in that sense
sure I'm an artist producer and also go
to the film school Los Angeles Film
School yeah so dad yeah it's pretty cool
pretty good dad for sure yeah yeah I've
been like I would have you as my dad um
I'm an audio engineer and a photographer
really dad stuff Dada Dada Dada Dada
sheep do you consider yourself like dad
I don't do you see yourself as mom no no
you're not but your mom I don't know
honestly maybe either so I get called
dad on my Instagram account you believe
that I'm dad but you wouldn't call me
dad nope do you think I'm a dad I think
you're dead yeah I'm obviously one of
the best sex objects on the Internet
why wouldn't they think of me as their
dad all right what do you have to say -
like the future generations you want to
be totally dad I think you need to
inspire the generations that are coming
up underneath of you just like me just
like him just like you just like you
I'll try what do you want to say
I try to be a dad more often nice we
should all be a little more dad even if
you don't think your dad to somebody you
might be dead sounds like a weird
paternity test result but at the same
time I'm concerned that my you know my
persona of this sexy sexy being is
distracting from what I really want to
be which is an artist
oh man they might have to stop calling
you dad then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
