like repeatedly for a whole day and like
maybe it's like breaks in between stabs
but you still get stabbed for like 24 to
48 hours if you ever felt that that's
what it feels like to have my menstrual
cramps I always had really bad cramps
since I started my period
they've been miserable I remember like
asking my mom is like a twelve-year-old
when am I gonna get menopause as a
twelve-year-old it was that bad
I need more red markers more red markers
it's not just like in your uterus where
everything is happening it's sort of
like starts here where your uterus is
but then they travels through your
intestines just imagine having had food
that upset your stomach really bad and
not being able to deal with it like at
least when you have a stomachache you
can poop like we're just gonna have this
pain for a week when I was diagnosed
with PCOS beyou cos like right before
that I didn't get my period for like
three months which was when like the
doctors were like oh something's wrong
those were the happiest three months of
my life it feels like my body's like at
war with itself for me at least a
menstrual cramps like are super similar
to the kind of pain I use to get for
kidney stones
it's broken guys I feel like I'm I feel
like I'm getting my period looking at
this picture right now
okay so starting inside my uterus here's
my little menstruation gremlin and you
can see all the claw marks from when he
was tearing up my uterus and right here
in the middle it's almost like that ring
sensation where I'm being like twisted
illustration of my cramps are these two
twin crabs they both have boxing gloves
and spiky shells and I guess because
they have to share this space they're
very angry at each other these were
supposed to be like stones because I
feel like your stomach feels kind of
heavy we got to share this with the
world this is what my period feels like
two guns shootout roseberry blood clots
what this is me and as you see I am
frightened and scared for my life will I
make it to tomorrow look at those eyes I
am scared for my life and then these are
the stab wounds from all the cramps
inside there is a blender going off and
those are my organs this is like a
boxing glove and this is like a school
bus what you see here is a huge mess and
a chaos because that is exactly what it
feels like you're inside or like going
like this and then you're like what do I
do people shouldn't underestimate the
way that women feel when they're going
through their menstrual cramp believe me
I was like someone who's like had them
her whole life it's not an exaggeration
when people kind of brush it off as just
a bodily function and you know that I
should pick myself up by the bootstraps
and keep going sometimes it's not that
easy you don't choose you get minstrel
grams they just happen to us periods are
nothing to be fought with that's for
sure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
