I definitely always wanted to have like
shorter hair and didn't think that I
could pull it off I didn't think that I
was attractive enough now I still kind
of hide behind my hair I wanted my hair
to look like how I feel bold and strong
and like I don't need it freedom is
really sexy if you can bring this
freedom to your body you see that people
recognize as a sexy thing felt like I
was reclaiming something it felt very
charged with ownership right before I
shaved my head it felt mushy and gross
and not like my hair and I had always
wanted the experience of shaving my head
and I was very curious as to what my
actual natural hair was because it had
been so long since I've seen it my life
was me trying to fit in to everybody in
my hometown so that was me straightening
my hair and a hot and humid town and it
would always be like bushy as but I
just wanted straight hair like everybody
else you see that you can be whatever
you want it doesn't need to be something
said or than satisfied or this or that
and I'm suffering you know cut my hair
it was just this moment of joy thank you
ladies for joining me in this journey
perhaps be prepared for people maybe
coming up to you and rubbing your head
or having it be a point of conversation
yeah definitely
and people like surprised that it looks
good on you yes oh you actually look
better with no hair most people look
terrible right vexing the word all right
let's go
I want to shave my head because it's
something that I've always wanted to do
I think women with shaved heads are
beautiful I'm curious to see how people
are going to treat me differently yeah
how people are gonna perceive me oh my
god I feel so good I feel so good it's
an awesome thing just for everyone like
we all know what it feels like to go
through this and it's just like a solid
like yet yeah
solidarity yeah I'm glad that I was able
to do this with people who know what
they're doing who have shaved their
heads and are able to give me advice
whether it be apply sunscreen to your
head cuz you might get a sunburn people
might pet you which I like think yeah so
thank you guys for you thank you
