and eyeliner and all that jab well today
I'm gonna break them down I'm gonna tell
you what each one means stay tuned
look what stop lemic this is a new blip
it's a good color to wear non-offensive
you're a normal person who has normal
lips doesn't really want to draw
attention to your lips you want people
to know that they're still there they're
still healthy they're still luscious
this is a very very kinky pink color
that you would wear one with young Loki
trying to talk to someone that may or
may not be younger than you you might
need to check my idea when I go to the
bar if I were this prepared this is a
brown color I look at least two years
older I'm mature I'm cool I'm serious
I'm ready to get down to business if you
find a woman wearing this lip color this
is a respected color you give her
respect next we got red good old classic
Jessica run here this is sexy and it's
classy it is timeless anyone can rock a
red this is my go-to color if I don't
know what else to wear this is a bold
lip like you see a woman walking down
with the dope lip like this she don't
give a what you think she don't
give a with society think they're
awesome
you should be their friends this is a
vamp color to be black could be brown
could be really really dark purple now a
woman who wears this back the off
is the same it's the same thing with the
spiked eyeliner don't talk to this
person I can see myself wearing this
color if I'm going to club my ladies I
want to look fierce I want to look dope
but I also don't want no man trying to
hit up on me try and talk to me now you
know how to express yourself using your
lips now choose a shape choose a color
choose a feeling and tell the world how
you feel because you know what you
deserve best you did for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
