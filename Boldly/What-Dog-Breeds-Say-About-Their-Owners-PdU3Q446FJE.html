owners resemble each other I like guys
with big dogs if I saw a girl with a
weird slash funky looking dog
I'm Attica Lee assuming she has a huge
heart guy with the pitbull is definitely
good in bed
my mom would want me to date any man who
owned a golden retriever girls with
golden retrievers have a lot of patience
have already been married for 15 years
since high school
happily your stable I feel like golden
retrievers are either family dogs or
sugar daddy dogs I would want to date a
man who had a lab that's good one
yeah he's catch keeper solid dependable
girl hands-down I've only known three
people in my entire life who have had
Australian Shepherd dogs they've all
ended up in prison
yeah a girl with a Australian Shepherd
is super cool when I see a girl with a
Dalmatian I'm definitely intriguing you
know that girl's got some bling he can
afford to take you to the exact girl
with the husky definitely has an awesome
apartment like and no kids I think she
drinks vodka he's an alpha male he's
really attractive I'm a little terrified
of you sweet and kind but they will take
care of you if there's danger
labradoodles you have to have a sense of
humor about yourself yeah to constantly
look at a pug face and clean the out of
its facebook anyone who has a pug I'm
like I don't know men that own pugs or
basset hounds are stoners girls with
corgis are kind of like Spacey
you know they'll forget that they even
have a dog and they're very smart and
querque and they're brilliant of music
so I assume you'd sleep around a lot not
filling it there's a girl with a basset
hound who's gonna be a little bit more
chill might be down a hand with you on
the weekend Rakesh yeah she's not
worried about what people think I think
if you a Boston Terrier you're very
clean you're a clean guy I definitely
want a man to build up yeah there's
stalwart you've been dependable mm-hmm
good ocean yeah they can wiggle
I think girls with really big dogs are
lonely a guy with a massive for Great
Dane is an absolute deal breaker for me
I'm expecting she's gonna be pretty
tough pretty strong because big dogs say
you're single but then too big of dogs
and I think your confidence
or something me too I think tiny dogs
are a really good replacement for dolls
if I see a girl with a Chihuahua I feel
like chances are she's gonna be hiding
it they just have the worst attitudes
and I assume that the owner also has a
she attitude when I see a girl with a
Pomeranian I automatically assume diva
if you just generally seem like a bad
person then the worst thing they can do
what the girl was carry around an
accessory that's a lion yeah she has a
brush like hidden somewhere that she
like brushes her dog's hair before she
gets out of the car just to meet you for
coffee
yeah I'm assuming you're taken it's like
absolutely wearing a ring on your finger
done deal
not going for it I think if pitbull is a
statement a straight up I don't trust
one woman's pitbulls it'll say we're
both friendly you've misjudged us or
it'll say I'm holding this to kill you
everyone on the internet right now is
gonna hate me for saying that but I
don't like guys that have nipples if a
girl has a pitbull she's most likely
sexy and if she wasn't sexy before the
pitbull now she is sexy she also most
likely has tattoos in bed yes it might
sound stereotypical but I think the
coolest girl would have the most
downtrodden looking dog I feel like when
you meet a girl with like a rescue dog
you're just kind of like you're just a
good solid chick they took a second to
get to know the dog and you're probably
kind of sexy in adventures deal yo the
ring on my finger yeah right now you
adopted from a rescue shelter you are a
good human yeah you're a nurturer world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
