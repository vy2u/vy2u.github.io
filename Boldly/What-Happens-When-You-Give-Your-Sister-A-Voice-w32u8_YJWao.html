Patel my name is
Aaron flack I am 9 years old and I live
in Needham Massachusetts
my low sister maid who's eight has some
palsy and uses an echo speaking device
we call her talker
my name is maze I am 8 years old me my
mom and my other sister Megan realized
that maze voice she has programmed in
her talker sounds nothing like the voice
of an eight-year-old but there are no
voices programmed on the talker that
sound like one we would love to get a
new voice for me and I would love to be
part of it Thank You Erin my gosh so
today we're driving to Vocaloid ease
headquarters Erin is going to be using
her voice to save a bunch of vocabulary
words May will be providing sounds a
software program from vocal ideas going
to combine those words and create
Maeve's unique voice I'm excited to meet
dr. Patel it will be cool to hear new
voice for my device that sounds like me
we're finally here I'm going to go and I
think like the sound booth studio and
just say like a bunch of words and
sentences that don't really make sense
and then use the sound that made me
they're gonna mix it together to make a
voice that sounds like her I think it's
gonna sound like a lot more like a
little kid
my name is ruku Patel I am the founder
of vocal ID book ID is a company that
builds personalized voices for people
who use computerized voices to
communicate the voice is such an
integral part of who you are having an
individualized voice is something very
important for someone who's going to use
this voice as a way for others to get to
know them today we are going to get and
to do some recording and then we're also
going to get you to make some sounds and
those recordings then we can use to make
a voice feed so what we're going to do
is report using lots of different words
and then we're going to take that speech
and chop it up into little bits so that
she can say not only the words you
recorded but other words that you never
recorded that's the magic word how are
you good morning
1 2 3
that was awesome okay take a break
today is the big day we've been waiting
for this moment for a long time made in
fact is our first Trailblazer who's
going to get for voice this year we've
been anticipating this really almost a
full year which is such a cool
experience not to see it but be part of
it I'm really excited because I think
I'll really get to hear from the voice
that sounds like maze I think she's
really excited for it and I think she's
gonna love it
but two things burn your voice and
I feel excited I want to say hi to
Taylor Swift with my new voice
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
