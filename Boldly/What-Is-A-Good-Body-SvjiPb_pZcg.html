perfect could you draw a good body for
me you want me to draw a good body but
you gotta have a head and then we have
his neck which is gonna be a little
bigger okay the most important part to
me is a good app good apps I don't know
like a dancer's body I'm trying to go
for like a pretty neutral body
I think curvy bodies can be pretty hot
or hips got a match her her body
yeah good body has a wonderful penis got
a third eye open I'm just gonna draw a
big smile a groovy person oh so we don't
need to draw it no need to dry the body
is like the surface is going on so it's
not really you know I see the whole
picture I can't draw a little a now I'm
gonna try and figure it out that so I'm
gonna talk to a few people and see what
they can tell me so I think a good body
or someone who's optimally healthy is
one that pays equal attention to all
aspects of self that being mind body
spirit what do you look at to determine
somebody's health so physically I would
say that one of the markers that we look
at is BMI body mass index so that is
essentially a ratio of your weight to
your height another thing we want to
know is your blood pressure and then of
course we would always want to do a
battery of tests to screen for basic
things like blood sugar cholesterol
vitamin panel hormones to make sure that
all of those things are intact can the
numbers be misleading or is it all
pretty clear the numbers can be
misleading and I would say as a
clinician you have to look at your
patient so that it's not just based upon
solely the number so certainly if
someone is more muscular build or
perhaps has denser bones that could skew
the BMI
I immediately think all bodies are good
bodies when you hear like I have a good
body I have a bad body it sort of bleeds
through the fabric of oh I'm a good or
bad person I have a good or bad life the
idea like waking up every day and being
frustrated or depressed or upset because
my body is in a good body it just seems
like such a waste for me a good body is
complicated and a good body is flawed a
good body is a strong healthy body and
what does that look like so a strong
good body has different shapes and sizes
it's not about the size jeans you are
it's not about the size waist you are
it's about being good and strong and
healthy on the inside which could look
different on the outside have you heard
this like everybody is beautiful thing
sure you believe it I do believe it I
think that's true definitely I
definitely agree
everybody's going our way I think
everybody it could be beautiful do you
think that everybody is beautiful I do
so these days there's a lot of talk
about everybody being beautiful and all
this body empowerment lingo that's going
around and I certainly believe that and
I think it's great but I have a hard
time reconciling that with as you
describe optimal health in terms of how
we are dealing emotionally and
spiritually that also will show up in
how you look physically you know when
you feel good you look good
that kind of premise if you can get to a
place where you know who you are where
you know you're worthy of your best life
where you know you have everything on
the inside of to be all you are intended
to be things change for you things shift
for you and so it's a mindset I think
having a healthy life and a healthy body
starts with a healthy mindset the best
thing you can do is just start loving
yourself and loving yourself now and
taking the steps to make sure that every
day is meaningful for you and every day
is beautiful being grateful for what you
have is the key to beginning to love
the body that you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
