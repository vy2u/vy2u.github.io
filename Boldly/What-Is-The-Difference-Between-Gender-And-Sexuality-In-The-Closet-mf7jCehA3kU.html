you're nicked all right entity welcome
to in the closet a show where we sack
welcome to in the closet a show where we
talk about things that matter to you
we bring people into this closet they
leave pretty much the exact same but
maybe a little bit hungrier today my
friend Rocco is here and he's gonna come
into the closet right about now and
we're gonna talk about gender identity
and sexuality
Kamiya Rocco get your little butt in
here back in the closet
how's it feeling these yeah if you want
introduce yourselves audiences Rocco I'm
Rocco my preferred pronouns are he and
him very cool what are yours mine are
she and her cool and also goddess so
today we're going to talk about
difference between gender identity and
sexuality which is an issue that people
conflate a lot I feel like people get
confused and they sort of assume okay
you're gay and your gender identity is
also gay yeah as a trans person often
I'm lumped into an experience of like oh
we're all gay here you know oh my gosh
and I'm not gay I'm trans though at one
point in my life I was gay gender and
sexuality you can have a gender identity
without a sexuality but you can't have a
sexuality without a gender identity so
foundational level we all have a gender
identity male or female or anything in
between
so that's your gender identity and then
from there you can be attracted to men
women or gender non-conforming people
for example this one's like I'm a woman
and I love women and this one's like
wait you shouldn't have the opposite
shouldn't you be the way I'll be the
Lisbon when okay lesbian I'm a woman and
now I love lesbians because I'm a
lesbian
I'm a man of trans experience and I love
women after they both love women so the
lesbian sheep is like we're all gay and
he's like no I'm not gay he's just a man
of trans experience and I'm straight so
I like women
which is
not day here comes this beautiful woman
look here she is in town and then he's
like ooh I love her because he's
straight and then what about her - she
does she have feeling she's like yeah
look at that good style I like her to
only touch if it's consensual right
right so you should have asked can I
pick you look at you can I bet you sure
well thanks but I actually prefer men oh
okay so then these two are like oh we
love each other they love each other
okay and they go off and they have like
a little life together but they're still
part of the queer community if they want
to be right cuz he identifies as queer
he's like queer she's like I'm not queer
but I love my trans husband and so
they're still like part of the queer
community though they're not gay yeah
well so can I have some yeah oh my god
do you want to knock oh it's really good
so I have this bottle and we're going to
play spin the boot oh but not in the way
that they play to sleepovers what it
really is is we take this bottle we spin
it whoever it lands on has to tell a
secret of the other person's choosing Oh
Rocco Rocco what is the weirdest place
you've ever felt oh man I've had sex in
a lot of interesting places at the
weirdest place like the Natural History
Museum and in New York Wow that's wait
where
what exhibit um it was like the plains
museums are a great place to have sex
because there's a lot of like quiet
areas whoa hey what about you Jay what
was the weirdest place I don't beach
it's not that weird like in the sand
yeah but like under like blank there's
like a tent oh so like nice and involved
though not in my Piccadilly hole you're
an airplane right that's your I didn't
