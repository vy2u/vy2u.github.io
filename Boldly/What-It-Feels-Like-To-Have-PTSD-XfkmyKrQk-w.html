I have PTSD from serving my country all
I want to do is go back to Iraq to feel
normal again
I have PTSD from sexual assault trauma
and I'm worried that because of it I
won't ever be able to have a normal
relationship I have PTSD and have
nightmares every night so I avoid
sleeping as much as possible today I was
diagnosed with PTSD now I'm feeling more
anxious and depressed about it I'm not
looking forward to the stigma that comes
along with it I live with PTSD from Iraq
every day nobody knows they just think
I'm antisocial boring and a bit strange
I can't keep a relationship going
because of my PTSD there's got to be a
girl out there who's willing to look
past it for me I have PTSD and when
people find out they asked where I
served when I tell them I wasn't in the
military they dismiss it like I'm lying
I have severe PTSD but I'm afraid to get
diagnoses I don't want to label a
handout or simply I just want help I
secretly live with post-traumatic stress
disorder I try to act carefree but I
live on alert I hate it when my PTSD
acts up and I'm suddenly afraid of
everyone my trust issues make everything
so hard and I wish I could just forget
my past my PTSD makes it impossible my
ex left me because I have PTSD and
wouldn't open up about my deployment my
PTSD makes me feel alone and I'm wanted
which makes me angry at people PTSD has
made me a prisoner in my
mine I thought my PTSD was getting
better but then the flashback started up
again I'm exhausted I have PTSD my
service dog saved my life
he gives me unconditional love and a
reason to live
