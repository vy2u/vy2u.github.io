like no one look at me like this is
horrible I am 100% a hairy girl I'm
constantly grooming my hair I think I
have like a very thin coat of hair all
over my body and my hair is blonde so
you think that like oh you can't see it
but it's so thick and there's so much of
it that it doesn't matter I just always
like double-checking little areas of my
body look at my arm I wish that I could
say I'm not self-conscious about it but
I am when I was in middle school I
shaved my arms just as frequently as I
shaved my legs until I ran into this
problem where I would shave to about
here but then my shoulders and back
would still be hairy so it just looked
like I was wearing hairy sleeves right
after I turned 12 my aunt bought me an
electric razor for Christmas and at
first my mom was like no you can't use
that yet and then I was like no mom my
legs are really hairy I want to use it I
was bullied because of being hairy the
boys started picking on me and came up
with a really clever name since my name
is Sam they called me Sam squash I
remember a lot of times going home
crying the height of my hairy and
security was when I was 14 I asked my
mom to get my hormones tested because I
was sure that I had an imbalance and
that's why I was so hairy but grudgingly
she let me get a blood test and I was
completely fine I was just hairy I
remember in eighth grade everyone's
starting to wear Penny's I noticed that
other girls didn't really have a lot of
back hair I decided to take a razor and
try to feel where I have back here later
my friend my very good friend came up to
me and she said hey you should try to do
you could just see the line on your back
you know it's like things like that
start to happen and you're like oh
that's weird like other people are
noticing how much hair I have on my body
I've spent a lot of money waxing shaving
threading plucking I usually just stick
to the razor method and book and eyebrow
wax once every 10 days or so when I go
get my eyebrows waxed I pretty much get
my faith waxed still like my big toe and
then on my leg trim my arm hair and
bleach it and I tweeze the dark hairs
under my bellybutton I'm one of those
people that has like a 5 o'clock shadow
under my arms the same day I shaved
when I get my mustache waxed off when I
leave that the line like you can't tell
me anything like I have a bear lips I'm
right you're wrong
regardless
having hairless skin does feel nice
under silky sheets but I wouldn't be
able to appreciate it if I didn't have
so much hair I would definitely say that
I've become less self-conscious about it
it's normal dude don't worry about it
like people are gonna say weird things
but even if you weren't hairy people are
gonna find something else to say weird
things about the hair on my arms is
probably like three inches long right
now and I'm doing great
there's like a part of you that when you
see it you feel like almost masculine
I'm like I'm a really feminine girl and
why why does God give us this but at the
same time it's just all about embracing
who you are yeah now now she's become
the thing we're like so just wear pants
winter is my favorite season ain't gotta
worry about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
