doing here what what are you doing
you're getting the sign now I would like
to say what we're doing here in general
Oh what are we doing here we are ready
for the tournament whatever touches
tournament Tetris World Championships
number five Tetris is always my favorite
game and I played all the time until I
was about 16 so I've been playing my
whole life and it took my whole life to
get to the floor I'm at now with it
being this good I like the fact that you
know Tetris is like kind of like life
you just whatever comes at you you just
got to keep going just got to keep
trying to make the best of what's in
front of you it's not like a bunch of
aliens running at you and all this like
we're just shooting people it's like a
like a pure mental exercise and I love
that so here we are at the retro gaming
classic see a lot of old video game
paraphernalia Castlevania I can't bleach
it what the hell is this thing
like Burning Man for video games
I agree man for normal video games right
hits the brain man for weird video games
okay so the number one strategy is you
want as many pieces to be accommodated
on the board as possible so like you
want to be able to put any piece down at
any time it doesn't matter how many
lines you get what level you get to or
how long you play for the person when
you go ahead and head to head the person
with the top score wins the match 13
right now Wow okay this is pretty this
is like way more competitive than ever
before
well I got 600 that boom yet has me at
13th place just not where I want to be
because you don't want to be like a 16
seat is you're gonna have to play like a
1c then second round so I'm gonna need
to stay around here and try to up my
score a little bit I just played Tetris
for like
five hours or so I played for an hour on
the rental station got a five hundred
forty thousand that was not enough so I
went through the lines and God taught my
score out to eight hundred forty
thousand which is very spectable so I
also learned that I don't practice every
day and I can elevate my game to a
pretty high level pretty quickly which
helps me in my relationship with my
fiance cuz then I don't have to play
like ninety minutes a day like I used to
I used to play ninety minutes a day
every day yeah and layman's terms
bulletproof coffee is like coffee on
steroids
tablespoon of butter tablespoon of
coconut oil tablespoon of MCT oil it's
taking a substrate that you usually
don't have access to and taking it
straight to your brain
they don't have it here so I really want
some so we're calling all over Portland
trying to find this stuff we're gonna go
there next right yeah got it
see this is sick I'm happy yeah this is
the morning of the tournament finals
we've got the copper from yesterday's
that's it oh that's the secret sauce
right there today is day two of the
tetris tournament it's a 32 seed best
two out of three match play tournament
Eli marjoram and patrick night ler
right
core update Patrick has a 65,000 UI
sitting with a 104
looks like Eli's advanced level 16 speed
he's got a 360 for it appears that
Patrick has just popped out and Eli's
ahead
Eli will advance good job Patrick but
okay man now I can relax I got passed my
first match I won't be embarrassment if
you lose the next rash I was doing
oh come on dude over here on the right
side it looks like gamer ear has popped
out with an amazing score of 640 - and
Eli is going to try to close quite a gap
of over 200 elf boy
that are that it
got it Eli Martin was a camera near game
quick update Eli with a 289 vs. camera
with a 322 close match place do I need
okay when you're playing and at them
after the guy cops out and you got
points make up this crazy adrenaline
goes over and it's like tunnel vision
and I can't calm myself down so it's
just like my heart is racing I'm just
like okay okay like this other zone that
you can't replicate any other at any
other time and it's it's really intense
any like loses the gap with a 475 oh I
feel like puking a little bit I just
finished the round of 16 so now I'm in
the Elite Eight against Alex Kerr who
I've always wanted to play but he's he's
super tough he's probably one of the
best players here so I'm surprised and
happy I made it this far and anything
could happen at this point so this is
great I'm gonna cut down four three two
one
you guys with me ready
first match I got a clean run I got out
to a big lead I was like doubling his
score and I was just rolling rolling
rolling he topped out I won second match
I believe was pretty tight three oh my
god I had a missed placement in level 24
that would have put me ahead it was a
Tetris it was like a bailout Tetris and
I missed it though I wasn't all through
the will if you get along these oh this
door by Eli okay so that was like
devastating and and I was like like now
I got to do the the sudden death and I
just composed myself the one
and I think we have this room is our
finalists is Eli feel good in Final Four
unbelievable
just beat Alex he's like probably third
best player ever in my opinion next up I
got Harry Hong he's one of the like
legends of Tetris I know he's pretty
aggressive so that can be good and bad
you know
let's call up to our station
Eli bar strum very long
transition happened at a very bad time
and Eli tops out at around 1 3 2 1 go
Harry Hong versus Eli hi a couple lines
it doesn't look
say hey
I was an epic choke I left it all on the
field I'm exhausted all right drink some
beers I blew that I absolutely and who
knows what would happen in the third
round but to go down like that is really
hard and even though like I wasn't
really expected to win or whatever I'm
like crushed right now I should have at
least taken that to the 3rd game you got
balls Eli
Thanks what do we learn here we learned
that you know you can just show up
having not played Tetris for two years
and make the semi-finals of the world
championships with Tetris when you got
mad skills and I do so it was awesome
bulletproof coffee work though I was
focused
a good game all the way to 29 is between
7 minutes and 30 seconds and 9 minutes
my dear
great is it great look across you thank
you hi in there oh he said hot
no I say are you hot is it hot
incredibly hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
