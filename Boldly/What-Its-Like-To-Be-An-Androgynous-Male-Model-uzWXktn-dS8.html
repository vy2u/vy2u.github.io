my head and pretend that I had hair I
think it's always something that I've
always wanted it's like they don't know
like are you a handsome guy I got you
like a pretty girl that my kind of in
the middle so they never know what to do
because everything is so black-and-white
pretty much when you're doing castings I
remember going to all of these voice
coaches and acting classes and to butch
up a little bit I met this girl that was
in high school hanging out with her and
seeing how she was just owned everything
she did kind of rubbed off on me
and then it created a monster and then
now I'm here around the age of 16 I
started growing it out and then the
longer it got the more confident I got I
kind of already knew what I looked like
already so I was pretty much just like
I'm gonna go with it that could be manly
sexy and I like the fact that it's a
confusion because people look at you and
they're like my agent now when he when
he's booking me he's like are you
booking him or her there's a whole realm
of models mountain people and
photographers and like people want that
now over the last year I've gone out for
some things as a woman and then you know
the next day even the same day I have to
go out you know as a man am I taking my
makeup off and in the car and the way to
the next meeting where my heart is down
I feel way more confident where my hair
is up for some reason I feel more like
me once it's down be true to yourself
and it's difficult but surround yourself
with with people that support you and
love you you can find that in many ways
