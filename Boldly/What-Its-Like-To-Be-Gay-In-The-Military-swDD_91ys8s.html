and people could get drafted and go to
Vietnam and I thought whew I can go to
the Naval Academy get a free education
don't have to get a summer job and I
don't have to worry about getting
drafted to go to Vietnam every guy in my
family since the Civil War has been in
military you know it wasn't a
requirement it was something that I
wanted to do it was a way that I thought
I could give back to my community was
partly to do with my my mother she did
20 years in the military as well as a
single parent and also for personal
reasons it was kind of looking for
something a little bit more above myself
say 25% of the reason I got into the
military was based on the fact that I
had grandfathers that were in the
military real bulk of it and this is
silly the sort of immature naive younger
version of myself joined because I
genuinely thought that if I joined this
seemingly hyper-masculine institution
that I would come out straight at the
end it was something I did and figure
out for a while in fact it was going to
go away as soon as I met the right girl
right I have to say that I did know that
I was gay but I hadn't fully come to
terms with it nobody knew I tried so
absolutely hard to to hide that fact
sort of knew I was gay but I definitely
not come out yet at all
for don't-ask don't-tell there were no
rules real rules were you didn't park
your car anywhere near a gay bar if you
wanted to go to a gay bar you got in
your car and you drove from San Diego to
LA so nobody else would see you there
nobody was asking and I didn't have to
tell what my feelings what my sexuality
was at the time so that worked really
well for me I may not be the most affair
or have all of the mannerisms associated
with being gay I certainly have enough
that people would question me but there
was no way to flirt to work together so
I created two people I mean I had Steve
Clark the gay guy Steve Hall the
straight guy as I matured and became
comfortable in my own skin and where I
was in life becoming an adult became
really difficult because I was in a
long-term relationship with somebody who
was also in military talking to someone
else in ROTC department and I remembered
speaking about my significant other at
the time and I believe I used the
pronoun he instead of she and they
definitely picked up on that pretty
quickly and like halted the whole
conversation even though I was in the
closet I was a vocal advocate for repeal
and a lot of people said that that was
wrong a lot of people actually took me
aside and told me that I was going to
get myself in trouble by advocating for
repeal because even the thought of
advocating for equality was evidence
enough that you were gay to some people
when it went away I felt so good for the
kids that I know who or in the military
that they no longer had to live under
this which had at this point really
become a joke of a law was definitely
refreshing to know that once it was
repealed that's one less thing I had to
worry about I could continue doing what
I love in serving my country without the
fear of being kicked out for something I
have no control over but truthfully like
I still put on the uniform the next day
and it was like a normal work day and I
still was scared that something would
happen even though it was signed into
law I think the day that it went away
people who were veterans were cheering
much more than the active-duty people
because the active-duty people like well
I go to work tomorrow just like I did
yesterday you absolutely adore the work
you're doing you're working with really
really good people and you have to make
a choice do I leave all of that because
I'm tired of my personal life sucking or
am I going to continue trying to build
myself into a more important position
that maybe someday I can do something
about this whatever you want to call it
there's a greater good that we should
all be striving for some people would
ask me why I joined the military in the
first place if I knew it was somewhere
that didn't accept people like me so to
me in this case doing what was right was
really just being myself and not being
afraid to be a part of an organization
which initially wouldn't accept me
because it would never accept people
like me if there weren't examples and
and people there at the beginning to
lead the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
