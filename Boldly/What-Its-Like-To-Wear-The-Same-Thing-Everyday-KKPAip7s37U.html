man for me like fashion and clothes are
a really important way of like showing
your personality and showing who you are
like when I'm feeling happier funny or
silly I'll wear like cats that when I'm
feeling like more like where I'll wear
like all-black I put a lot of work into
it
you're not supposed to say that I often
decide the night before and I hang it up
with its shoes and accessories and
everything put together like such a
basis I'm actually not too worried about
this I don't think anyone's gonna really
notice I'm wearing the same thing every
single day I'm excited but I also I'm
dreading it a little bit this is like
the one decision I enjoy making I'm
excited to just not care that actually
sounds wonderful to have that decision
removed for my life
what is the outfit you plan on wearing
for a week straight I was thinking just
like a maxi dress because then if I'm
hot I can tie it up and if I'm cold my
cover or I was thinking anything that
can look nice but is secretly a nice way
to hide wearing pajamas I'm think I'm
gonna wear black jeans and a white
t-shirt for seven days right
involves wear black maxi dress crewneck
white t-shirts I kind of feel like this
is how I normally dress anyway so it's
gonna be more just zeroing in on a
concept I think this is it you know it
moves well the first day was great got
to wear dress got to be bloated nobody
can heard I was relieved at first I
didn't have to worry about clothes he's
really easy getting dressed in the
morning because I knew exactly what I
was gonna wear so they kind of went
through like a little roller coaster of
emotion because at first I was excited
about it but that was like only the
first like 12 hours I'm really bored by
what I'm wearing started to like dread
it
I don't feel cute or interesting or fun
I feel like and then it was just like he
was Groundhog Day every single day was
wearing the same thing I really think I
have a stalker
there was one day over the weekend I
avoided putting on clothes just so I
wouldn't have to deal with this
experiment I found a loophole I just
haven't gotten dressed yet
that was walking on my underwear for
half the day like well I'm not cheating
technically I think wearing black got me
down the most I'm gonna have to do
something crazy to my hair or do some
weird makeup or something I just like
wanted more color
that wasn't so bleak maybe I think
choosing the print and the bright happy
color was a problem it was like
emotionally exhausting it was very
strange I'm going to burn this dress in
the morning I would get bummed about
having to put the clothes on again I
like mixing it up I like variety
then that feeling would go away pretty
quickly I know this outfit works so
let's get up my back and it kind of was
like a really like reinforced like some
self confidence in me they're like yeah
this is I figured out who I am and that
these clothes reflect that it's the last
day I'm really excited about but it's
actually pretty weird like knowing that
work has really recognized that I've
been wearing the same thing every day I
would get compliments every day on that
dress which was weird but also like was
cool and reaffirming in a way only you
care what you wear no one else gives a
if you're thinking about doing this I
would strongly recommend getting
something comfortable and that can
reflect you in any type of emotional
state you're in there's a little bit
more wiggle room of like hats and
accessories and jackets probably could
have gone for years that way actually
no wonder why cartoon characters are so
crazy it's because they have to wear the
same thing every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
