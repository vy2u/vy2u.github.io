full time I was living in my own
apartment with my two best friends and I
just kind of had a normal life priority
was all just kind of about work and
doing that early xx thing of trying to
move up and I was doing that I got a
call from a friend who was over at my
dad's house he's been sick since I was 7
years old but it kept going up and down
he had prostate cancer so I didn't
necessarily think it was a big deal I
thought she was just getting nervous
about the way he always was but
everything changed I left my job my
mother just was incapable of parenting
before he went into the hospital my dad
had asked me to take care of the twins
if he passed away
nobody that is being raised by their
sisters guess is pretty cool
I was definitely for lack of better
terms probably a little bit more on the
selfish side okay Charlotte had actually
moved home to save up money to travel
around the world and so now I'm sharing
a room with a 15 year old girl and it's
different so obviously in this day and
age if you're faced with a problem the
first thing you do is Google and there
was nothing there I think that's
actually white is he started doing the
blog also because she couldn't find
anything online just talk about what
we're doing so next time someone else
goes through this there's something to
reach out to and something to read about
at least the daily experience of it all
it's cool it's cool that it's actually
within a matter of months it's helping
people normally we're on the same page
about everything and we're really good
at when the twins ask for something big
that we know they're going to hold us to
we'll say oh I have to talk to I have to
talk to Charlotte first or she'll say oh
I have to talk to Isabel first and as
long as we do that we're fine I couldn't
imagine just not being part of this to
be honest like me and as we'll
definitely had like our moments where we
were like debating not living together
in this situation the question was never
am I going to leave the raising the kids
part it's just how do we make it work
where me and as well are in a situation
where we're getting along Charlotte and
I have had our ups and downs through
this but I don't know what I'd do
without her like we co-parent I legally
have guardianship but it's a lot of work
for one person I'm older by three
minutes he always does it's two but I'm
sure it's three it's probably sick it's
three I think that at the beginning it
was really you know learning how to make
sure that all the bills were paid on
time and like actually being like a head
of household rather than just like a
twenty three old girl with an apartment
that I pay like rent electricity and gas
you know it's like now there's budgeting
for food and like budgeting for like
making sure that they have clothes on
their backs
and random school projects that come up
and just like making sure that all of
your Ducks are in a row before you need
them to be in a row which is it's
daunting about this one sure that's the
one word is most upset that I was being
born do we have to keep but I was the
best dad you didn't love anyone in the
world more than he loved us no matter
where he was he was telling people about
his kids and what they were up to even
when they didn't want to listen at his
funeral everyone's telling stories and
one person was like I just remember this
one time that we had a party bus and
Harvey was like passing wine out to the
people on the street he knew how to walk
into the room and own it and how to talk
to everybody and how to make everyone
feel better about themselves it was just
he was a cool dude it was really fun I
miss em there's the thought of what life
should be first what life is but that's
not a way to live a life I just try to
do it was good a job as he did for us
with the twins which is pretty high bar
