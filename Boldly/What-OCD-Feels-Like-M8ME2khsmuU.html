know how to stop it my OCD is so bad
that minutes after getting a manicure I
ruin it because it's not 100% absolutely
perfect I feel like my OCD controls me
every time someone hugs me
I want to shower every time someone
touches me I have to hold myself from
hurting them I can't focus my OCD is
pretty bad I scratched my head so hard I
started bleeding because my head's dry
don't even notice I'm doing it sometimes
my hands are bleeding from compulsive
hand washing still think OCD is
something you want to claim to have for
being neat I have dermatillomania it's
an LCD where I can't stop picking my
skin I'm so ashamed I haven't been out
of the house in three days I have OCD
and sometimes it's a struggle just
leaving my apartment I have intrusive
thoughts a form of good old OCD every
day is a struggle but I come out on top
OCD makes it really hard to play with my
son it pisses me off when people say
they have OCD or ADHD when they really
don't it's not a cute little quirk you
can just think you have it's an actual
disorder and it's an insult to people
who actually have it last night was the
first time since I was 8 years old that
I forgot to set an alarm my OCD of
having everything perfectly done didn't
win last night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
