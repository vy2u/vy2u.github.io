we are like pretty fun to date scary
I'll give you a scare absolutely not
I would date an or hook up with one but
I don't see much more I know some people
will say they wouldn't date a Gemini
because we're flighty and we're don't
commit yeah I feel like I just be
continually insecure just like in a
perpetual state of insecurity they're
like a hipster Gemini oh yeah oh my god
that's hot my first crush was a Taurus I
don't think I could date them just
because I know how stubborn they are if
you're trying to date them and expect
compromise it's never gonna have their
great I think they're persistent and
like focused and really supportive
they're super down-to-earth I'm into it
this is a precursor I'm like get me more
tourists please yes I think it's like
the wife material right there very like
a balance probably good for dreamy signs
like our libras sound to me like the
kind of person that's like okay so we're
gonna split the check down exactly I
fall in love would leave us so easily
because they're just so charming
you said Beyonce's a Virgo right
absolutely
Virgo won't put up with your
they're really good conversationalist
they almost seem unattainable
I think Virgo would get tired of me real
quick I think they're the ideal persons
that like have a family look when you're
ready for that
mm-hm um but in terms of like having
like casual fun and like you know you're
just kind of dating and whatever I don't
think they're the ones for that I
imagine an Aquarius like opens their
bedside drawer and there's just like an
array of choice and they're like
whatever you want oh my god oh I think
they'd be good in bed too yeah I'm
attracted to them like just right off
the bat because they're so creative and
I'm like oh my god I love this but like
they're too aloof for me confident and
and know what they want that girl that
like you hook up with him and she flits
away and you're like man I really liked
her yeah but she was like always meant
to get away because she's kind of like a
figment of your imagination
I would love to date a Capricorn because
I think they would be very appreciative
of the affection I'm giving them because
I usually overlook Capricorn man seems
boring but Capricorn woman I would
definitely date because I bet that she's
like secretly in charge of everyone I
find capricorns to be hilarious they're
just too committed to a plan and I think
that life is a journey and I think every
day is different
I like schedules so if you're gonna plan
my day out and just say hey like this is
where we spend time together I'm all for
it because I like organization meeting
every new person is a challenge that's
about finding the qualities in each type
of person that are for you
they're really close to Christmas like
actually really close to Christmas a lot
of gifts um but they but like you said
they are very giving so maybe like you
know morning robbers they do buy me a
present for a system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
