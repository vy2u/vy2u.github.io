you know the top because they're super
passionate and intense I think you would
sleep with in areas but not Dayton area
because they're probably really
experienced and I would just be so
nervous but I just don't think I could
do it again I've had too many areas
heartbreaks in my life I would totally
see myself with another Aries Pisces
need a little bit more than most people
I could see myself being in like a
two-year relationship and then we part
amicably you have to become pretty
selfless to date a Pisces
that's like the longest relationship
I've been in is with a girl that was a
Pisces like sexually a Pisces is like
there for you I couldn't date a Pisces I
think because I see them and I like see
myself and see like maybe a friendship I
just don't see anything sexual and other
Pisces like I feel like sexually the
Pisces is just very genuine there in the
moment yes I would date a Leo thanks
like Leo's are very loyal they're so
good at sex
I've dated a Leo it was really fun Leo's
are addicting
like you fall in love with a Leo and
then you're like why am i yelling he was
wild you're like what are we even
fighting about I don't know oh now we're
having sex ha ha ha that's a Leo yes if
you are looking for a straightforward
boyfriend or girlfriend who will just be
good at being a boyfriend or girlfriend
you cannot go wrong with a cancer
cancers really are like hubby wifey
material
and he seemed just like steady like
caring confident people they want to
like have very romantic sex staring into
your eyes like staring like both your
eyes yeah - do with your eyes are open
love you lady cheering ow together and
with every thrust you feel love I would
love to date one except that I'd be
super nervous all the time because
everybody would want them serious
females seem like the kind of person
that I would end up with a verse there
you're like giver sexually I bet it'll
just put everything in perspective and
you're like the world isn't gonna end
you're so right
I think that they would like play your
favorite music during lovemaking
I think sesh tereus are very sweet
people but I do think it would take a
while to find out what they really want
I think they'll drive me crazy I'm gonna
be practical here and I don't think I
could date a Sagittarius because their
birthdays are too close to Christmas and
that's like a lot of presents to buy no
it's a tough tough person to date a
Scorpio man oh it sounds for like an
enlightening hook up but not ruin it
lighter look I have been in relationship
with Scorpios and it always ends in just
yeah I haven't had a long-term
relationship girl that's a Scorpio but I
will say that relationship and the times
that we had
well Scorpio Scorpio sounds like it
would elicit we're good in that way very
very great some of the best days of my
life do you want to play with fire
then date a Scorpio you wrong a Scorpio
they come to your house and slash your
tires</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
