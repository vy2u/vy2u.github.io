and who you are I'm like not even joking
it took me forever to start going to
therapy because I was like nothing
traumatic ever happened to me like that
doesn't matter if you're
depressed or depressed if you're just
generally unhappy like that's a problem
and you don't have to live that way
therapy allows you to find things out
about yourself that nothing else does
because it really forces you to examine
the whys you don't have to do anything
with it but it is such a release to know
that like sometimes that's where that
anger comes from sometimes it's not the
best listen to a friend because they're
too close to the situation
they're super involved and their
emotions are involved too because they
care about you a therapist will be
honest with you in a way that your
friends and family won't be because
they're not emotionally attached to you
they can tell you insights about
yourself that your friends and family
maybe don't want to it's like the one
time in your life where you can be
completely honest to another human who's
attentive and caring and it's not going
to affect anything of your world I'm
very open with the fact that I see a
therapist in part because I want people
to know that it's a good thing there
isn't a stigma and there shouldn't be a
stigma I think a lot of African
Americans will say like oh you know you
just need to pray no you need to go talk
to a therapist Bible's not going to help
you cope with severe to moderate
depression and it just won't its
chemical it's it's things that happen of
physical changes in your body they cause
your emotions to be out of whack there's
a science to emotions and I'm not an
expert so why not talk to someone who
can give me more insight into that good
therapy is about self-discovery it's not
about somebody sitting across from you
telling you this is what's wrong with
you this is what you need to fix it's
about you looking inward and finding the
things that you
the most important thing that you can do
for yourself is go to therapy because
that is a huge form of self-love I can't
think of a single person who has been
honest with themselves and gone to
counseling and not benefited from it it
took a lot of healing and to be I'm not
gonna say normal again but just to be
myself again therapy helped me get to be
myself again I go to therapy because I'm
worth it I'm worth putting in the work
to get better
