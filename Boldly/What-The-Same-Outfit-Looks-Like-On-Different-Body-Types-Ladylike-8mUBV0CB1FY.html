know how moms I like recently target
came out with a collaborative clothing
line available in sizes two to 26 that
got us thinking is it possible for the
same clothes to look good on different
body types its ladylike and today we're
all trying on the same outfit how will
they look only total two I would say I'm
generally like a trendy person like I do
follow like clothing trends and sort of
keep up with it there are totally trends
I look at I'm like oh please not with my
body not at all I'm also pretty tall
sometimes things might look a little
crazy on me that are supposed to be like
me length and they can end up being kind
of like a skirt I try to just do
what I feel best in and I end up looking
like a sorority mom retailers will often
say that like clothes can't be made for
bigger people because they look
different or the proportions are all
messed up and I'm curious to see if
that's actually the case
it makes me feel like I'm bigger than
what I am I feel like a Supreme Court
justice a little bit with the sleeves I
love the top I wish I could wear the top
of leggings I can see my mom wearing
this the pants are a little bit big I do
not hate them as much as I thought I
would especially because I usually don't
go for volume on the bottom sizes are
always inconsistent when it comes to
pants so it's kind of a crapshoot thanks
Kevin yo yeah now I know what I look
like when I'm 60 this is great it's a
problem when you're short is that like
culottes are just pants that are looked
a little too short I mean I have like
larger calf so it just looks like I have
cankles when I turn to the side though
there's something about it's just like a
power stance and like get it I feel like
a trendy lawyer like the antagonist and
drop dead diva I give this outfit
probably four stars out of 10 a 4.5 out
of 10 a 7 I kind of feel sharp I feel
really professional I would give this
outfit 3 out of 10 just like on my
particular body type if I'm standing to
the side
I'll give it like a 4.5
I feel like I need a shotgun in this
hand and a breast pump in the fanny I
actually really do like this like I
would wear this it's just like a lot of
loose the jeans are a little short which
is usually a problem for me when I'm
shopping for jeans I usually have to get
the long size but it's just one of those
things where like I cuff him a couple
times then they're kind of subtly capris
I feel like I am ready to slice up some
oranges and take my kids to a soccer
game in my minivan this how that makes
me feel like I'm gonna go sell some Girl
Scout cookies and I'm gonna win this
year all that gap it's going on back
there jeans are just they're not my
thing all right let's take a look yeah
if the fit was a little bit better this
would be definitely like one of my
favorite I'm very comfortable
I'm extremely comfortable in this I'm
actually kind of cute yeah just what my
booty to show a little bit okay I don't
have much this is more color than I've
worn in months I look like I'm gonna go
fishing I would give this outfit an
apologetic
5 point 5 out of 10 I give it a 7 I
would give this a 7 I would give this
outfit a 6 out of 10
7oj typical gagazet six stars out of 10
for practicality feels good I feel like
I could kick somebody's ass it's really
really comfortable but also badass as
well so it's like killing two birds with
one stone you know I'm a little bad but
not too bad like you want to find out
how bad I am kind of bad but I feel
pretty cool I feel like Michelle
Rodriguez in Fast and Furious so I think
that a lot of plus-size clothing they
assume that you're not only wider but
you're also taller and I am not taller
so while it fits nice here I have no
hands at its base level this is gonna be
my favorite outfit because it's closest
to my personal style I just like looking
scary oh it's one I like booty poppin
this I need to stop doing so comfy I
feel so mobile
I feel like Sofia in this I feel really
comfortable I feel confident
so I would give it a ten out of ten I
would give this out for the nine for
sure maybe Nate proof I'll give it an
eight point five if the proportions were
shorter I would definitely give this an
eight out of ten but because it's made
for someone much taller than me I'm
gonna have to give it a four ten for me
this is probably nine out of ten one
point away for just the fit of the jeans
not being that great and the sleeves
being slightly short but I'm a sucker
for a black moto jacket so how was that
it was good yeah seeing oh look at that
yes I'm surprised the main problem I had
is that I was too short I think that a
classic look like a classic moto jacket
usually looks good on everyone so that
was cool and the culottes what kind of a
walk you have to leave in your childhood
what I did like them I felt like a boss
lady a little bit you guys look like a
badass biker gang lady tested lady's
room kind of a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
