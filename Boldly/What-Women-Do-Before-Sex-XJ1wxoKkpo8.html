long enough nobody can tell cuz it's so
smooth they think the apartment is a
reflection of your body right so if your
apartments messy like what's going on
downstairs do like a little hoo-ha
inspection you know just I mean I'm not
really hairy in general anyways but I
just I shaved my legs everyday it's
always Smith like a baby's butt most of
all ensure that I am wearing cool
underwear you know it's about to go down
when a girl has matching bra and panty
he's just sick because I date both men
and women there have been times where
I've only been dating women for a while
and then a guy will come over and I'll
be like so I don't know condoms like I
still don't think it was like oh my god
like I gotta get everything all right
for this dude it's like we're
like you better get on my level really
the main concern is that no one gets dog
hair in any orifice like deal like a
Jewish mom like do I have snacks is it
warm enough in here does everyone is
there juice everything stays on fleek
for maybe about a month this modifies a
real gamble just make sure no
commercials are gonna pop up so it can't
be like Pandora with no subscription cuz
one minute it's like sexy stuff in the
next minute it's like Billy Joel you're
doing a lot of work but it can't look
like you're doing a lot of work it's
dumb kind of think that people who care
pair off together so people who are like
really anxious someone comes over and
they're like let me just use your
bathroom I like have a minute of like
what is my bathroom look like probably
find other people that are really
anxious and they have like anxious sex I
think that ultimately a lot of this
preparation you do won't matter because
I think you can prepare all you want and
if you're an ass or if you're selfish or
if you're totally self-involved you're
gonna be totally not worth it for the
other person
I should be able to like pop open my
sweater and be like let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
