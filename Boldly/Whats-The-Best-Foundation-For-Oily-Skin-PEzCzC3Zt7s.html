I am sure you are no stranger to that 3
p.m.
doughnut glaze halo let's sit on our
foreheads every day and wearing certain
types of foundations can make it even
worse so I'm on a mission to see which
foundation is finally going to stop my
forehead from looking like the inside of
a frying pan once and for all so the
three brands that I'm going to be
testing are L'Oreal for our cheaper
option NARS for our middle of the line
option and Giorgio Armani for our more
expensive option all three of these
brands have been listed on multiple
articles for best foundation for oily
skin so we're gonna put that to the test
so first up we have Lauri oh I would
love how like whenever it comes to the
brown girl colors always like cocoa
coffee like when have you ever seen like
spaghetti or like the lighter ones good
ol cocoa and it says that it's supposed
to have an airy like texture so I'm
walking to work and I feel pretty sweaty
right now do you see any glistening I
don't see any I really enjoyed that they
were not lying when they were talking
about it being super light doesn't feel
cakey or anything like that goes on
pretty smooth I don't wear foundation
super often because it feels very heavy
and it feels like I have paint on my
face and I hate that but the minute I
put this on I felt nothing Karl do I
look oily to you no no actually it looks
yeah ha ha
Crazy's shimmery yeah I mean it's almost
the end of the day
it looks more like a glow rather than
that's how I shop okay I went out
dancing in this and I'm a type of person
where I will dance for like five hours
straight it looks like I hadn't been
dancing at all and overall I have to say
like this is definitely a favorite of
mine if I had to rate it I would give it
4.5 out of 5 stars our next one is NARS
I hear nothing but great things about
NARS I hear that girls are willing to
sacrifice their rent paychecks for some
NARS so I obviously have extremely high
hopes for this I also like that this one
is sunscreen black people be trying to
act like they don't need SPF but we need
it
okay yes black don't crack but like
don't play with it this one immediately
already feels a lot thicker and paint
like so when I first put it on it
definitely felt like I was putting on
foundation when you have oily skin and
those oils come in you kind of just
always feel like there's some sort of
film on your face and right now it feels
like I have that film on my face even
though everything is fresh like SPF
makes things a little bit heavier a
little more creamier so I didn't like
that foundation you feelin however I
like step out of my bathroom and there's
all this natural light here my face and
I was like who is this I was so shocked
I've never seen my skin kind of it's not
glowing but it's like this softness
there's this softness to it that this
NARS is doing I like it really took me
aback for a second but like literally
around 3 p.m. I love like I had just
come out of a swimming pool man
so sad but it lasted for a while you
know all that listen okay but I will say
that the saving grace of it was that
when I did blot my face
the oils didn't melt the foundation off
of my face all I had to do is just do a
quick bla and then everything went back
to being that softbox closed so if I had
to rate it I would give NARS about 3.25
I've never had a foundation give me that
softbox glowy look before this was
Armani and I have to say my little
bougie ass was really excited to try
this because when else am I gonna get to
try $60.00 foundation right well this
one really blends into my skin really
well I think out of any foundation I've
ever tried this matched my complexion
seamlessly but Armani did not come
through for me for a foundation that's
$60 this foundation should have me being
matte for the rest of my life it
was the the earliest one to make me look
very greasy oh it's not even close to
free it's about one o'clock and I'm oily
as a mother I think I'm really really
let down by this as someone who grew up
and has had to deal with having oily
skin my whole life but then also coming
from a low-income background I think you
always think oh if I could just afford
that expensive thing I'd never have to
deal with it and it just goes to show
you sometimes like you're literally just
paying for the name so if I had to give
Armani a star rating I would have to
give it a 2 I mean like it just did
nothing for my oils but I give it credit
because the color match was amazing and
for a woman of color like that you know
you're up here so of course it should
come at no surprise that L'Oreal is our
winner it was the best at combating oils
I would say out of the three the other
two definitely had their perks but they
still left me out here looking like
Krispy Kreme donut at some point of the
day so doing this has shown me that I
can try all the products in the world
but there still might not be a perfect
solution for me it's just taught me to
not necessarily embrace it like I'm not
gonna be out here being like I'm only
and I'm proud like but you just got to
keep it moving you
like if I have to blot and I have to
blot and then I'm gonna keep going and
then I forget like I'm human
that's what it is I think that this
experiment has taught me to just embrace
the fact that I'm a human sometimes
there's not always a magical solution to
like getting rid of everything that you
find to be an imperfection and that's
okay I hope I'm not paying $65 so this
little glass thing I would rather get it
a little plastic tube better take some
pics Gloria</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
