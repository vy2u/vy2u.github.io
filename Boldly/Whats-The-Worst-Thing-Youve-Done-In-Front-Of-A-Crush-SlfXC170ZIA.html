like the most ugliest sight I've
probably I've never looked worse I'm 17
years old
it's the summer and I'm canoeing with my
family and some family friends I have a
crush on their son what's up will
we're about to get to shore to finish
and I think that it would be really cute
and clever to just be like I'm gonna
just hop on these rocks over its Shore
just watch me cuz I'm a stupid 17 year
old and I think this is like cute or
something but like he was into it he was
like really are you just gonna like
Becky you're crazy
and I was like oh god we are this is it
so I'm able to like balance on the canoe
he has this like paddle in the water
trying to hold the canoe he's like
holding my hand and I step out of the
canoe onto the first rock and it's like
a success and then I jump to the next
rock and these rocks are like covered in
 so you have to like be careful but
like I was really dangerous and cool
when I jump onto the third rock my leg
goes through the rock
you're probably wondering how the hell
does your leg go through a rock because
it wasn't a rock it was a dead deer it
was a dead deer carcass floating in the
canal covered in the same that
covers all of the rocks so from the
surface it looked the exact same and
then you're probably like how do you put
your foot through a dead deer that's how
old this thing was when my foot went
through and it broke the flesh this big
puff of like just horrific decomposing
gas bubbled up just decaying guddi's
stuff just plops up on me and it's like
so close to like my mouth then I want to
scream and I want to vomit but I just
keep my mouth closed because I'm so
scared I'm gonna like get some disease
like it kept me so stuck in there like I
wasn't going anywhere
like I wasn't tilting this way or this
way even though this other leg was
totally like out like I was like
the deer and then I'm like this we don't
have to come over with his little panel
thing and they had to put the one paddle
in to stable the canoe and give me the
other paddle and help pull me I'm kind
of start to drag this thing and that's
when its head like pops up on the water
looking my crush in the eye smelling so
rancid and the worst was that you could
see in his eyes how little he wanted to
let me on the boat had I made too sure
will you would have been my first
boyfriend you don't realize it because
you can't look at me without thinking of
that smell he's told me that before um
but
we crunched</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
