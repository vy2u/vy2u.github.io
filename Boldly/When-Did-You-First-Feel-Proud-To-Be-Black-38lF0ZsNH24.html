like yeah I'm black I'm different and I
don't give a first started to feel proud
to be black when I was about 13 or 14
years old 5 years old age of 4 high
school middle school 3 or 4 middle
school 13 was the age that I started
listening to Fox and he was the first
person that really inspired me to know
that black was cool
a lot of the kids thought I was cool and
they wanted to know what kind of music I
was listening to and they were
fascinated with black culture and black
people so that's when I realized there
was probably something special to it my
mother had always in grayned in me to
just be proud that I was black be a
proud strong black woman
my mom started taking me to the Howard
homecoming so my parents put me in a
program in school called the Hali which
means family in Swahili and there was
just this great feeling of sisterhood
and Brotherhood that's really when I
started to feel proud to be black this
program taught me a lot about heritage
my aunt took me out to this African
festival out in LA she bought me my
first like dashiki and she bought me a
goofy seeing people that looked african
and like people from Africa and African
American there was no judgement I
learned Pride and it wasn't pride
against discrimination it was just pride
period
to the young people of color learning to
appreciate your blackness is a journey I
know it's hard and it may feel like hell
but you're here for a purpose
we need you the world needs you America
needs you you have something to bring
that no one else does if you think of
all of your features and your skin color
and think of how many people literally
pay to look like you you know that you
have something that everyone else wants
there's so many different layers to us
and we're not a monolith we have history
rich history before slavery some of the
things that were invented and things
that created that make life easy for
everybody today was created by black
people
so my black man out there you guys are
kings don't let anybody tell you
different you're beautiful black is
beautiful because we are forever black
is beautiful cuz it's black that's it
ain't no way to explain it it's just
black and amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
