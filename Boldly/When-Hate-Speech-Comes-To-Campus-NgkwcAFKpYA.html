fraternity member yelled out the window
you Indian piece of s word and also
threw a beer can at her and then the
next text she wrote well now they're
trying to apologize because they
realized who I am my name is Rooney
Sampath and I am a student body
president at the University of Southern
California
I really did go into a state of shock as
to how that could even be said because I
though I experienced a certain degree of
that when I ran for this position I
hadn't really experienced it to that
level in person and I think it really
did affect me my dad it was he was
really concerned for my safety it's both
a woman on this campus but also a woman
of color and those words actually
reinforced for me that I wanted to go
public and and have this message heard
because I know there are so many other
people on our campus were made to feel
unsafe
it starts with words it starts with the
frame of mind and a mentality that other
people are lesser than you and it's okay
to call them out and treat them like
that and then it'll get to a point where
people's lives are at stake and people's
lives are endangered by this type of
mentality that we allow to continue I
used to get told that I can't play on
the playground with kids because I was
you know darker than that it's
definitely been on my mind I think since
I was a kid from from playground till
now I know if students that have been
stopped like from going into their dorm
rooms or their rooms by like the GPS
like the school that are in places like
for security that monitor around our
campus and they're questioned as to like
oh wait you go to USC or if it's a
person of color and particularly
laughing oh so you're an athlete that
must be why you got to us I come from a
small town in southern Virginia
Williamsburg and it's very conservative
and I had definitely faced some
adversity there for my sexual
orientation and you sort of think oh
we're going out to Southern California
everything's gonna be so accepting I'm
gonna be going to USC there's not gonna
be ignorant on this campus but I think
the fact that there are so many
instances of ignorance on this campus in
Southern California goes to show that
this happens everywhere we do love some
place so much we have to work to make it
better
our real goal right now is to gather
student voices figure out what the
students want and then move forward from
there
one thing that we are definitely doing
is moving forward with a list of
requests for our university
administration our cultural Resource
Center's are great but they're small and
they're understaffed when a research
senator doesn't have enough room to fit
the number of people that go to this
campus or that we are able to send to
them for having an event there and
people are sitting on the floor I don't
think that that's right there have been
people who come out and said why don't
you name this person why don't you call
them out and go public with them my
intention was never to publicly shame an
individual because especially when you
do that I think people will did will
dismiss it as a one-time incident and
the story will continue to become just
about me whereas these kinds of
individuals exist all around us the
individual is facing serious
consequences and that those consequences
there are still different investigation
pieces that are ongoing so I'm really
waiting for all of those to be completed
before I'm able to
you know share with students what could
potentially happen if they were to
report incidents like these because I do
want other students to be aware that the
university will take it seriously and
will address it in that way I believe as
much as we can to focus on the the
problem itself which is that
discrimination is prevalent within
institutions of higher education and we
need to find a way to address it and we
need to do that as soon as possible I
think that's really what I would like to
focus on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
