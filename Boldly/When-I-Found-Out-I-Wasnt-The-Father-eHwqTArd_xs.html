isn't mine when I found my girlfriend's
Journal I'm a stay-at-home dad if I
leave all three of us will be screwed I
know the baby isn't mine
just waiting on this income tax check
then I'm leaving her suka DNA test
proves the baby ain't mine but that
means it's his I can't let this little
girl have a drug-dealing father I will
never tell a soul just found out my wife
of four years has been cheating this
whole time and our daughter probably
isn't mine never have I wanted to cheat
ever until now I don't want to get a DNA
test done on my child because I'm scared
it'll tell me she's not really mine I've
made up my mind that I'm her daddy no
matter what I didn't find out my
daughter wasn't mine until she was an
adult I'm looking into getting all my
child support back I just found out my
19 year old daughter is in mine I'll
never stop loving her no matter what
after five years I found out the child
was not mine
her excuse was I just said I was
pregnant never said the baby was yours
I'm pretty sure my son isn't mine but
I'm too scared to rock the boat so I
don't say anything
my father tricked me into a DNA test
because he didn't think I was his son
turns out I wasn't and I haven't heard
from him since
