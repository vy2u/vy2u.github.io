of those people but I just keep getting
this pop-up
have you tried restarting the computer
um I sit down okay I've had a lot of
trouble restarting in my life recently
the baggage of my whole life I feel the
weight upon my shoulders I think that's
why my arms are so big because you know
our middle school is you have to learn
how to go to the bathroom by yourself
it's like having a child with fur this
thing called a spritzer and I thought it
was just for hydration purposes I've
been seeing Brian the checkout guy you
know for a year now just because I go to
that grocery store a lot some people
just call it customer service I call it
poetry he didn't ask me for my discount
card
it's me Brian you can't tell by the
sound of my voice it's over it's not the
phone call our relationship I'm going to
Vaughn I can't believe I'm finally ready
to start over I'm ready to restart all I
needed was it password the name of my
first pet right well it depends on
washing your husband oh sure sure the
dog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
