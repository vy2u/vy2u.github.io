what you what what's wrong
okay on a scale from one to Pharrell how
happy they look pretty burro god damn it
just got back from Kelsey's biannual
bisexual barbecue I thought that was
last week everything in the pansexual
potluck what the gay brunch rave anyways
okay just because you are a bartender
for a summer at TGI Fridays a bartender
you do not fuck off I'm brilliant
Oh looks like two of my Eskimo sisters
just became an igloo awesome oh yeah you
dated like everyone hmm no Petey so
super has a fund earning each other's
lives
two of my exes being so PDA on the same
deck I stand with my god damn bare hands
I can't imagine that's not really
straight ease don't really have to deal
with man I'd kill to go to a straight
party for once my buddy Paco throws this
really sick party every Sunday this
abandoned warehouse and second thought
I'm good you don't have to be straight
it's just like straight why are you here
Moe is here oh you guys I've actually
been meaning to ask you where do we put
the broken dishes Chris that's right you
got her you got a thing anyway so I was
working for Shawn today dude wait a
minute
what I wasn't finished telling my story
you always do this you always interrupt
me then while my stories don't get to
finish no let him finish this I love
Shawn yeah I mean so I was assisting him
on his weekly shopping trip have you way
bye
everybody dude you got a gap line yeah
twice
so that's it stop shuffles over I mean
unless you want to go to the baby swag
yeah let's go this one no take my car
take $2,000 okay give that's the max
because 3,000 say 3,000 take 200 Brezza
oh yeah my pen is my birth year thank
you
1992 I mean Shawn has millions of
dollars and hundreds of thousand
followers on clap chat and he's younger
than me
they do say followers are worth more
than money now okay so I'm at the
barbecue looking around suddenly feeling
very alone
they look actually happy together well
it might be hard to believe but women
are capable of finding happiness without
you cause you didn't want to be with
either of them yeah you're right
like Sydney was super weird when her
cousin Rebecca came in from Europe they
were like very flirty it was weird I
meant because of your flings and
short-lived disasters that's my
reputation you're like the John Mayer of
lesbians yeah so in your seat I got the
wrinkles dude
no foot look John I love your music I
will go to your concerts but I'm not
really like doing the whole I'm sad so I
fucking know I wasn't trying with his
friends girl no you're just friends like
we're just friends
are we really shopping your baby we
didn't it refers to I don't have a kid I
don't either
haven't got the way woman thought I did
but turned out to be a total bitch yeah
now you talking about the hypothetically
speaking what would you name your first
kid maybe like you like your name Eric
you look like a Gavin or Tyler maybe
even a Chris no offense
and they my first hungarians four or
five thousand something cool be married
by 28 to kids about 30 so my second
business by 31 divorce by 33 the city
has a five-year plan I don't know what
that means
am I crazy or does this look like a new
apartment to you yeah your boy has a new
job ah the job that gives in new money
it started together an expression of
resentment stupid commitment is its
social means do good Paco you guys want
to make a vision boards doesn't say up a
choreographed dance but yeah vision
boards work what are you doing again oh
yeah
so this is an anatomical heart that I
got out of a science journal to remind
myself to open myself up to the
possibility of truth the steak
yes but it's cooked medium-rare to is
like a metaphor to show me that I can't
overcook myself with emotionless sex
it's the stress emotion I'd rip this
down for these women they're just a
fucking happy imagine being that happy
and free that lettuce excites you I
don't know it's kind of more the feeling
I get then actually let us get excited
okay let us get excited I still don't
get it
what's yours okay look out it's the new
me are you standing on a landfill no I'm
overlooking my progress because here are
my past devices I've been focusing so
much I'm finding true love or focusing
on other people for now I've learned in
order to be a successful adult you have
to be wealthy right here with money ah
and on the Internet
hello casting now I'm excuse me hold
please
it's all business what kind of business
I'm gonna create apps and I'm gonna have
my own personal aesthetic I don't think
you just create apps work for Sean
yeah but Sean went to Stanford for
computer engineers there are plenty ways
to the top this is my vision board this
is me living in my van
and it's in your driveway that's real
life now actually no cuz in this life I
have a boombox so I get to fulfill all
my dreams okay do you realize you can be
anything on these vision boards yeah
like you could have like a happy bunch
of moans oh no I like being me and
honestly I think comparing our normal
lives to people's social media highlight
reels is really dangerous and unhealthy
