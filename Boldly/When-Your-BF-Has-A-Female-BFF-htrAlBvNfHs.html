those brie sandwiches in the petrol of
God what was the name of that driver who

right
memories we did a semester abroad
together in Prague our junior year that
sounds magical yeah it was I think it
was probably my favorite trip another

your life how is that going I'm single

be what up with this okay with this what
about your friend Charles why not
Charles keep Charles I wish transition

of life you're saying that you're living
with ally because she wants to bang you
yeah yeah no no bets on my dick chuseok
face I'm not gonna loud well I get what
you're saying but do you actually think
Bernie Sanders is a viable candidate
think Bernie is why do you think that
men and women can just be friends
of course think I was talking to Allie
you know there's actually an article
about this in the Atlantic that I read
recently a lot of times in male female
friendships the guys I think that the
girls are into them so they have a hard
time just being true friends did you
hear that the man always thinks that the
girl is enough oh if it's in an article
it must be true sorry well doesn't know
how to read Oh
articles are hard Bram this could have
been a great evening
but instead of showing me sympathy but
it's like to be a handsome man living in
2015 you ruined the evening
fighting over me what real writing or
fighting over you
what's this step no well I cannot
believe that he thought that I might be
into him I mean we've been friends for
10 12 years like I would rather you know
always my friend you're my girlfriend I
don't want to have sex with Allie Oh
what did you think was gonna happen here
some sort of three-way situation I'm not
a fortune-teller I don't know what's
gonna happen you would be lucky oh he is
lucky oh please please you're amazing I
know but that's he know how this is this
is ridiculous okay I have to drink to
sit table with him from 45-minute I was
drunk our entire semester you know

toothbrush kept them in a ziplock marked
