in the in the bathroom urinating and
such and I went to it before I wash my
hands I went to zip and my penis had
hurled itself onto the tracks of my
zipper and hence I mean many many people
have seen the major motion picture
there's something about Mary I learned a
few years back that going commando in
tight jeans bad idea
commando is when you're not wearing any
underwear so it's just the jeans and my
penis the zipper is too close to the tip
your penis and eyes if my penis up in my
tight jeans it got stuck pinched in the
zipper I imagine it was kind of like a
crab like a superhuman crab pinching
away at the small amount of flesh
surrounding the circumsized area of my
penis and you have that initial reaction
like what do I do
oh man this is just like that movie I
was kind of just like the the panic of
do i what do i do do I call for help do
I die unzip it do I yank it out and I
kind of just did a combo of both and
blood and had about a mmm
quarter inch incision right next to my
pee hole it was on the tip of my
three-throw it was extremely painful and
a shockingly low amount of blood like
not much blood not even really a scar
but given the amount of pain
but I compared the pain to like it
wasn't there's something about mary bad
but it was still graphic the injury
lasted about it was about two weeks good
you know three four days and i think i
was like with a girl kind of like
looking up with a girl at this point
this is like early college i had to
explain to her like why i was like very
sensitive down there like why we
couldn't really do anything crazy like
why it just really hurt if if you're
going commando and you're wearing tight
jeans just don't hurry when you're
taking a piss you got to do it very
slowly and methodically or else you will
suffer the consequences just gotta make
sure you stuff it and then you zip it
stuff it zip it
um but you know they say that the mouth
is the fastest healing part of the body
i got to imagine that the second fastest
healing part of the body is the penis
don't know there's a fixed enough
science to say that but given how fast
that healed i would assume it's up there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
