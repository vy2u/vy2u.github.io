what's funny about love the fact that I
love you hey how do you tell your best
friend of three years that you're in
love with her I mean it's probably a bad
idea right it feels like a bad idea
like tequila and milk bad unless she
feels the same way about me what if she
fell for me the first day we met and was
too scared to express her feelings and
dating Tim was her way of trying to hide
it
hey are you coming I mean I'm not
totally unfortunate like a six out of
ten on a good day we could start dating
and be one of those annoying couples who
always have to sit on the same side of
the booth constantly holding hands we
could move in together and be the
stereotypical lesbian couple with three
cats and two dogs we could get married
and start a family in the suburbs white
picket fence and all we could grow old
together and even on her worst days I
would never stop loving her all right or
she could not feel that way about me at
all she's probably never once thought of
me in a romantic kind of way and why
should she friends just friends and I'm
the asshole who has to screw it all up
by catching feelings worst case scenario
she jumps out of the window to avoid
talking to me
or she takes a cyanide pill as soon as I
say the word laughs like a spine at
James Bond movie or she never talks to
me again what if she never talks to
me again do I really want to risk our
friendship over these stupid feelings I
don't think I could live in a world
where we didn't talk every day where I
couldn't see her smile every time I want
sure if I wanted to just see her smile I
could Facebook stalk her but real life
is so much better maybe I shouldn't tell
her I'll just keep all these feelings
bottled up inside me
you know shipping away at me until I
eventually meltdown at her wedding get
too drunk and declare my love at the
reception during the chicken dance I
should be talking to girls who are
available not girls with boyfriends what
if I just want what I can't have what if
I'm that person no I'm not
and I deserve a chance to be happy think
of all the times I've had to watch her
kids to him and how every time it feels
like she's ripping out my heart with her
cold hands I'm tired of crying myself to
sleep when I know that she's with him I
can't keep pretending to be happy for
her when he does something nice
and listening to her talk about having
sex with him and smiling through the
pain hugging her when he up and
watching her cry over him and wanting to
kill him for hurting her but also
wanting to be the one that she feels
this deeply about I'm tired of feeling
hopeless and numb I can't do this
anymore I'm in love with you
