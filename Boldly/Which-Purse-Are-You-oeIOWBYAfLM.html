old receipts and that guy's number
you're never going to pull or is it more
is the handbag actually the deepest
darkest and sometimes dirtiest insight
into a person can we learn something by
looking into the crummy depths of a
purse
I think first up we have the hoarder a
complicated specimen indeed the hoarders
bag is filled with receipts they keep
free granola bars and sugar packets hens
old unused tea bags cell phone chargers
for cell phones and they no longer own
tampons that can no longer be used pen
tops bits of change and tobacco even
though they don't smoke because you
never know when you'll need well
anything next there's the planner the
planner switches bags about once a month
because cleanliness is key they're
well-equipped and wouldn't dare leave
the house without their daily planner
pen some sticky notes a cell phone
charger and a little bit of weed
surprised you shouldn't be the planner
thinks of everything the Night Out is a
different breed of planner because
they're not planning for life they're
just planning for one night the Night
Out has everything from a toothbrush to
a hand straightness and a smaller person
the actual Night Out because who says
just because you don't end up at home
means you have to look anything less
than fabulous for next morning then we
have the mom the moms bag is a beacon of
light in this dark thing we call life
got some in your teeth the mum has
floss have a headache the mom has Advil
rip in your stockings the mum has clear
nail polish that can patch that right up
messy fingers
she's got hand sanitizer having a rough
day she's got wine think of the moms
handbag like the Swiss Army knife of
purses and also she's got one of those
too if you needed the free spirit truly
marches to the beat of their own drum
their bag has a bit of everything a
joint for the Hard Day's a snack for
after the joint some chapstick and
coconut oil because for them that's all
their face needs for a day out a mason
jar for water on the go a multi-use tool
for camping
some essential oils for perfume and a
good old menstrual cup or when mother
nature calls the every woman is well
every woman she's got all the essentials
any woman needs in her bag her keys
front door car and mailbox which double
his weapons to ward off potential
attackers because every woman knows she
must always be aware of her surroundings
some headphones for music but they also
double as talk abou cos used to ward off
potential street harasses some pepper
spray one of the most necessary items in
the every woman's bag and the one she
hopes you will never have to use a cell
phone for catching up with friends and
family or using as a stand-in witness
when a stranger starts following her too
close and of course
wallet sunglasses and a valid form of ID</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
