alternatives to beauty blenders that
beauty bloggers have made popular try to
use a beauty blender but I don't wash
them and I usually like throwing them
away I normally put on my foundation
just with my hands like I put it on my
fingers so I usually use a beauty
blender just because I feel like it
gives it a nice sheer coverage this is
like a bra filler I actually always call
the chicken patty because I feel like it
looks like a raw chicken patty so much
surface area this just seems so crazy
so I'm most likely my tube of silicone
beauty blenders that are trending right
now I wonder if it's what worked with a
real boob there's feels like I'm taking
like a big pancake and just slapping
makeup around really surprised at how
well this is blending it feels really
funny and Julie this is awful boobs are
the shape I would have to use my fingers
to continue blending this correctly but
this isn't bad actually thought this was
so ridiculous at first but I really like
the application
um what the hell is this it's just like
maybe a step above fingers I don't see
the point we can play with sock puppets
are you ready to do my makeup so it's
actually going on my face but I already
feel like it ain't half the product
you're not careful you're just gonna
have a lot of like lime don't know if
I'd use it every day but it's cute it's
a cute look practicing safe makeup I'm
gonna be honest I feel weird putting a
condom on my face I guess this would be
a good idea if like your Beautyblender
was dirty and you didn't have time to
wash it you can tell it's kind of
playing someone but most of it is
staying on the condom no it's not bad I
would never do this
how much are you making to buy condoms
just for makeup this does not make any
sense
I love Chief there are two slices of
bread out there crying it's not great my
face is gonna smell like cheese all day
I don't see it here and I don't know if
it's because of the cheese color but I
also don't see it on my face so it's
kind of terrifying this is kind of
blendin decent guy I didn't want to like
the wrapped single cheese beats condom
and boob hands down there's actually no
makeup on the cheese it's good yeah it's
still good cheese not a fan of this idea
of using an egg one eggs smell to it is
a waste of food we're actually gonna
spend like 20 minutes hot rolling the
egg and wait like Oh without fake a bomb
just waiting around and then use it on
your face heard of egg as a
Beautyblender but I be honest I'd
imagined it was in the show I have to
get so close to my eye what if I get egg
in my oh I feel like little pieces of
egg are you face it is cold
which is nice if you have like under
eyes
Venus up I am here for this like glow
even though I know that's like egg juice
and moisture which is so gross it's just
like a waste of a nice egg big note of
the egg big no ranking them this is the
best one the texture is really nice it
gets into like every crease of your face
I like the rock the bed I recommend
first the inside-out sock using a piece
of cheese to put on your makeup works
surprisingly well we would draw the line
here I'm not going to do any bees again
guess what hands don't cost money and
they're attached to your body
what a waste like use protection for
better things in life than putting
makeup on God gave me these beauty
blenders right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
