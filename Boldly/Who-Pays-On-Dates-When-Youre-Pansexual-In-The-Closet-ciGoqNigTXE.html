once that's what Nikki did it ow
I can't man I didn't hi everybody
welcome in the closet I'm Jen
that's Nikki today we're going to talk
about some dope stuff specifically uh
rolls that you might take on when dating
a man are dating a woman our first guest
is my friend Karen Karen Karen Karen
Karen all right hey come on Karen
all right rollin from the side hi Karen
hey what's up my name is Karen I use she
and her know me too and one time in
college I swallowed a live goldfish what
why accidental no purpose Karen yes you
are pen sexual yes yes and you know so
you date men and women yeah I date men
and women and you know penny was anyone
else in between when you date men versus
when you date women you would say
there's kind of like noticeable
differences in your behavior uh yes
Society has kind of put upon this whole
thing of like you know men should act
like this and women should act like this
I feel like for me since I present as
more masculine
I almost feel obligated to you know act
more masculine and take on those more
masculine roles when I'm dating someone
when I'm dating another woman out at
least this is sort of like Oh like I'm
dating a woman so maybe I'll pick up the
tab a bit more maybe I'll be a little
more chivalrous yeah it's exactly that
it's really honorable fit stuff do you
feel like you kissed a woman like do you
usually initiate the kissing when I grew
up and expected to date men I just sort
of assumed that like they would ask me
out they would kiss me all that stuff
just sort of because of the way all the
media that tells me about relationships
told me that you know I'm not very
aggressive so but I feel like I have to
play that more masculine role so
sometimes sometimes nobody kisses
anybody do you think if you're in that
situation with a guy they'll just do it
I
you but I'm not I'm not proud of it you
know but the thing is like sometimes I
feel like it's almost like a fight for
that masculine role role as well I feel
guilty when I am like hey we can split
the tab or all take it like you think
guys generally want to like pay for
dates
maybe now want to but they feel like
they have to I feel like at some point
this will all change
you know when everyone's kind of just
like and everyone's kind of just
whatever you know and does whatever they
actually want to do
it's got told us to move my car gonna go
move my car we left the closet cuz you
have to move my car
I've Drive so now Nikki's going to feel
them where we move my car there's care
