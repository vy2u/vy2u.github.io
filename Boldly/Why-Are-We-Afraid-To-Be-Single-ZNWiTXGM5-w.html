plan any other part of my life so like
when I was going to go to college what
career path I was gonna take when I was
in have for breakfast but I couldn't
plan when I was gonna be in a
relationship I've been a boss bitch in
every other aspect of my life except for
the one area that everyone wants to be a
boss bitching and that's my love life my
senior year of high school in particular
I was the ultimate HBIC I was student
body president I had amazing grade I got
into college with amazing financial aid
I could keep going but I know all y'all
I think it is this humble bragging
heifer
that's why I milk amber and no boys to
the eye but to be real I did think that
it was my success that was keeping boys
away from me and so then I started to
resent it it's funny because I actually
didn't really feel like a boss bitch at
all back then I felt like a failure
one night my freshman year in college I
came back to my room and
i down on my knees and I prayed if I
could just have a boyfriend and that I
would give them any amount of success I
had ever had and even hearing myself say
that out loud right now sickens me
I had it ingrained so deeply ingrained
in my head that all of my hard work and
success meant nothing unless I had a
boyfriend two years later I entered into
my first relationship and it was hard I
think that I had a lot of unreal
expectations about what being in a
relationship was gonna be like there
were many many a time where I felt more
lonely when I was with him than when I
was by myself when things started to go
south with us
I fought day in and day out to keep us
together I didn't know how to let my
life have value outside of somebody else
the failure of our relationship wasn't
just a failed relationship it was that I
had failed and again as a boss bitch I
couldn't allow that so when we finally
broke up I had to face this question
that I had been running from my entire
life
which was why am I not enough for me why
isn't the greatest relationship that you
can be in one that you have with
yourself we put so much effort into
loving our partners unconditionally but
why don't we put that same effort into
loving ourselves in the same way I think
back to the earlier parts of my life I
was just so desperately trying to prove
that I could be so good to something
like I could do right by you boo but the
person that needed that love and
affection was me and so the fact that I
was trying to prove it to other people
but denying it of myself is just crazy
and probably a big reason why I couldn't
find someone to love me for the past
four years I have been single and I will
say that half of that time it was more
so because guys were ghosting me and me
 boys and all that crap
but in the last few years it's been of
my choosing and it showed me that I'm
not as alone as I thought I was like I'm
pretty fun to hang out with I have a
good time with myself I've also learned
that if boss bitches were to have a boss
bitch code point number one would be
never ever wish your success away for
anyone ever someday I really would like
to be in a relationship now I know that
when I do decide to do that it'll be
because I'm choosing that person and not
because I think that that person is
going to make me more worthy to the eyes
of society right now I could not give a
damn about what anybody thinks about my
single act like it is hot AF right now
like the idea of having to share a bed
or drink somebody else in this heat like
you can miss me with that I am okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
