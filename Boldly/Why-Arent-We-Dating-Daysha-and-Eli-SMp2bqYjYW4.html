that they're just friends
but I think that's a little bit more
romance going on underneath and they're
not being honest about it so today I'm
going to put them to the test and make
them answer the question why aren't we
dating cuz I think they should be dating
they seem perfect for each other their
two best friends I'm gonna make them
date what could possibly go wrong guys
thanks so much for being here you look
lovely thank you why don't we start out
why don't you introduce him and say
something nice about him and then you'll
introduce her and say something nice
better okay
this is Eli and he's um he's nice this
is deja and she really cares about her
hair
he was my intern one got pretty much
most of what I wanted so I always got
you what you wanted no no so we're gonna
move on to round 2 where we talk about
each other a little bit more what you
guys have in common I think that we have
in common that we love to bicker
he loves to start with me oh I'll say
this I like Daysha cuz she's like real
and upfront and she's very expressive
and passionate about what she does I
think I like that we're friends because
like I like that we have honest
conversations and like that probably
leads to the bickering but like I think
that if you can truly bicker with
someone you put all of your emotions out
there there on the table you're not
hiding anything like we are who we are
let's say in a world where you're dating
what would be good about the two of you
dating that wanna Steve I guess we
wouldn't really hide anything from each
other I'd like to help yeah I think
overall I would be upfront and I would
like to think she would be so that would
be the probably most endearing quality
yeah
what would be a bad aspect of the two of
you dating uh you would nag and just I
do not know break me down emotionally
there was equal nagging going on when I
try to be nice to him when I try to give
him a compliment or do anything he
starts something and I'm like why can't
you appreciate the fact that I was just
trying to be nice to you this is why I
got a slap in your face because we're
gonna be that terrible couple at the
Applebee's that just keeps fighting over
the like whoa
one is an appetizer like that's
essentially would be a let's say that
this moment right here
is the last time you can ever talk to
each other what's the one thing that you
would want the other person to know
before never seeing them again man like
oh this is deep oh man
well deja I think you're an amazing
woman
and you have inspired me to do a lot of
great things that I didn't think I was
capable of doing and I want thank you
for that
you guys Debbie yeah what's wrong with
you that was the sweetest thing I've
ever heard our interns clutching his
heart come on guys
let these emotions flow live really um I
think I would say you I I truly value
our friendship there's no one else but I
feel like I can be as like honest and
open with but I feel like we're
exchanging the house like because you're
such a shippable pair of people I'm not
the only producer making a video about
these two right now you're actually in a
video with Zack we're single people live
married for a week and tonight you're
going salsa dancing so we're gonna let
you go do salsa dancing we're gonna see
some of that footage and we're gonna
have you back tomorrow hear how it went
and then talk a bit more about you to
his friends sound good sounds great two
three let's all end with a nice Jimmy
work it what a shimmy okay so we're on
our way to salsa are you feeling I'm
hoping any ounce of my Puerto Rican s
will come out today cuz I suck but
whatever whatever to make me happy it's
fine you know whatever oh he's so sweet
Eli just asked me if he's gonna sweat
and I told him that I hope he gets
really big nasty sweaty hits damn
because he wants to check out other
women in front of me jealous I'm not
jealous I'm my like it's been days we
don't you and me my grandfather played
in a salsa band my dad like was a
championship dancer and now I'm gonna
look like a jackass
okay so Eli just finished his first
salsify how do you feel oh my god I feel
alive oh my god I'm I saw some
the cheese it was like one of the
hardest and like intense things I've
ever done
I was I was getting like so frustrated
that I just wanted to quit and it's just
like you didn't quit right and then she
added something else then she had
something it was I was literally like
like a fetus learning to walk you guys
went on a super romantic date obviously
and now we're here to find out how it
went so deja why don't you start out how
did the the night start so we had a nice
brisk walk to the dance studio together
oh look at his excitement class started
it was a salsa class mmm
ribbit no not necessarily right it was
very funny to see you I tried oh my gosh
because they're like a box that just
kind of was left in her hey how do you
feel that is just is just stressful I
mean yeah I know I knew I was gonna be
terrible at it you know I mean I
essentially looked like a drunk t-rex
you know that I really had a go P sounds
like you two had a wonderful time we
have a really fun way to end this high
steak suspenseful show that you guys are
created for us each of you get one sheet
of red want you to blue paper the red
has a heart blue has a smiley face I'm
going to spin
you away and I want you to pick and put
in front the one you want so it red
would mean like oh yeah maybe there's
some feelings here blue is sorry
everybody's going to feel blue because
we're just friends so I'm going to give
you five seconds to the side I'm going
to pull these chairs around and five
four three two one
so this ultimately doesn't cite anything
you guys are gonna have to watch Zach's
video single people get married for a
week to see if maybe the relationship
goes further than just today right now
you're just friends but there's still
time to change that I think the only
difference between today and the end of
the week will probably be you know what
either are why are we dancing with these
two we'll see you next time right here
in the same darn place bye good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
