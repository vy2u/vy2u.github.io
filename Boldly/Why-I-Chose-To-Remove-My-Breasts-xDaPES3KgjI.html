for you know over a hundred years it
kind of led to my sister and I to make
this life-changing decision I've always
been a happy healthy person I haven't
had a lot of medical issues my family
didn't really talk about all the women
that were affected by female cancers
until my sister and I got to be a little
bit older
my journey kind of started with my
mother she encouraged us to get the
genetic testing to know whether or not
we were at risk of female cancer in our
future this picture is of my great
grandmother on my father's side she was
a brocco carrier and passed the gene
down to my grandmother this is a picture
of my grandmother who I never got to
meet she passed away about Varian cancer
before I was born
her name was Sybil I really wish I had
gotten to meet her
honestly when my mom first encouraged us
to get genetic testing my younger sister
was initially really frightened and
upset but I didn't really see how it
could affect me and I didn't know that
much about it
at a 50% chance of getting breast cancer
right now at the age of 28 and it would
only increase as I got older I just
really forced me to think about my
future I had to make a decision I've
always heard about how amazing my dad's
mum was and just knowing that if his
test was available I would have been
able to meet her I made the decision to
have a prophylactic double mastectomy
with reconstruction my fears I think
were a lot like other women I was afraid
to not feel as feminine what if they
found breast cancer when they opened me
up there was just so many things going
through my mind um it was definitely
something that was hard to prepare for
from there once I got home I required
help from a lot of family and friends
I needed my mom to sponge made me for a
while I slept on a recliner for about a
month after that I could turn on my side
and I felt really weak but I gained my
strength back I decided to post on
Facebook about my decision to get the
surgery I got about 25 30 messages it
was amazing how many other women had
also made the decision that I found out
about or how many women were really
interested in getting genetic testing
and wanted to learn more about it I feel
empowered being able to share my story
with other women knowing that it could
save someone's life despite everything I
went through I still think that I made
the right decision as a take away I'd
really want to encourage women to know
their family history to start the
conversation about genetic testing
options with their doctors if this
testing was available years ago I would
be able to know my grandma Sybil I'd be
able to know my aunt's ID I'd get to
have a bigger family there's just such a
bright future ahead for both of us
because we were proactive and I really
do think what I went through is the last
couple months so
just a blip in what will be an
absolutely beautiful life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
