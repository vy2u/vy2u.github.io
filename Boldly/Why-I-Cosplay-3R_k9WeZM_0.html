self-confidence I never felt like I was
a good enough person in life I have low
self-esteem I don't really talk to
people I don't interact with people in
life I'm what you would say an outsider
through cosplay I could become these
characters I could live vicariously with
how cool they were it seems like a lot
of people feel the need to become
someone else to strengthen themselves
why am I doing this people are going to
judge me probably think I'm a loser or
something
I've been to every flea market every
goodwill every craft shop every fashion
district every corner of the Internet to
make this costume I feel fairly anxious
because sometimes you're really not sure
how it's going to turn out until you all
put it together and really part of what
makes possibly so beautiful is how
people can interpret curves and strange
clothing pieces that wouldn't even exist
in our world
as I walk down the halls of the
Convention Center
I felt very nervous people looked at me
but they didn't look at me in a
judgmental way in the cosplay community
there is just so much support and love
in such abundance it's really hard not
to feel moved it's a community where
you're where they create a safe space
for you to just be who you are
cosplay really can be for anybody if you
have a passion and a will to bring
something you love so dearly that there
really is no excuse to not try it out
you're there to just express what you
love what cosplay does is it gives you
that confidence and it makes it okay to
like things that nobody else does
opens you up to friendships the people
who love the same stuff that you love
and you don't have to be judged that's
the greatest thing about cosplay
this is why I cosplay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
