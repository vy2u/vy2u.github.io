really everything a woman has them I
started noticing my stretch marks when I
started cycling I was probably in high
school I was a freshman in high school I
was walking up the stairs in my house
and my sister was like something is
stomach it was like no those are stretch
marks when you're pregnant usually you
know everyone associate stretch marks
with their belly but my arms got bigger
because I gained 50 pounds I can't
remember the first time I realized I had
my stretch marks I've just always had
them I've never been ashamed or
embarrassed of my skin but it felt like
I had scars that I didn't want on me I
thought that only people who were
pregnant got stretch marks and only got
him in their stomach and so I thought
that something was honestly wrong with
me
well I was pregnant and I happened to
actually lose the baby and I didn't gain
a lot of weight from being pregnant but
I gained a lot of weight from the
depression after so the stretch marks
was like a reaction to losing the
pregnancy I've learned to love them just
because they're mine and it shows me
that I've grown up and they make me feel
kind of special they're a reminder that
I'm blessed with a butt that many people
would want and so it just shows that I
am a woman it's funny I look at them now
and I smile because they remind me of my
first pregnancy and having my first
daughter so it has like good memories
associated with them I really liked my
stretch marks mostly because it's a kind
of a fun fact about me and I love sort
of giving that 2-bit to other people I
feel like my stretch marks remind me of
how much that I have changed in the past
few years and how much stronger I've
gotten when I look at my stomach it
reminds me that there was one's life
here or the acad√©mie life here in the
future so I think it's just beautiful
because it's still the evidence of what
I could have been
