lazarev it's and I removed my healthy
breasts and ovaries
my story began seven years ago when my
father tested positive for the bracken
mutation I booked an appointment to get
tested immediately and I also tested
positive the doctors told me that in my
case this mutation gave me an 87% risk
of developing breast cancer and up to a
40% chance of developing ovarian cancer
I felt like a ticking time bomb I knew
that I could control my fate a month
later I underwent a full hysterectomy my
husband was very supportive as were my
family and friends but I lacked the
support from women who were going
through similar situations I searched
online and thankfully after a while I
found a handful of women who were also
Braca positive this group of ladies have
become some of my best friends a few
weeks later I got the call to schedule
my mastectomy I immediately got online
to let my broca's sisters know just
knowing that they were there and
checking in on me helped it was during
that time that Terry one of my Braca
sisters and I decided to start a
Facebook group the group started with
eleven women from all over the globe it
now has 5600 members and it's growing
daily over the next two years I suffered
complications and an additional four
surgeries I then had to find a new
surgeon and he had to start my
reconstruction over completely
that made five this was not only
physically exhausting but emotionally
draining The Sisterhood was so grateful
to hear the truth about the surgery to
be able to ask questions and talk with
someone who lived it it made all the
difference because there's a chance of
developing breast cancer in the milk
ducts I decided not to keep my nipples
and with all my complications I had no
desire to have more surgery to recreate
them so I have a large incision line
across both sides of my chest a few
months ago I decided to share what I
hope is the last step in this journey I
turned my mastectomy into a work of art
and I define beauty on my own
terms I covered my incision lines on my
left breast with a gorgeous floral
tattoo and it really transforms the way
I see myself I chose to keep the right
side uncovered because I like to see
both where I've been and where I've
gotten to
although it was not an easy decision I
decided to share my journey because so
many women feel ugly and scarred after
their mastectomy and there are so many
ways that women can feel beautiful again
I am so proud of what I've done and what
I've accomplished so far and through it
all I have the support and love from all
these women who understand me and where
I've been my passion will not end here I
will offer more support and create more
awareness for hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer and I'll continue until a
cure is found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
