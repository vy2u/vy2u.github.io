Howard University mr. Coppin State
University I went to Xavier University
in to our University in Washington DC I
grew up in a dominantly white
neighborhood my whole life I was always
like one out of three black people in
every class I didn't really love me
because I was comparing myself to the
girls around me my high school counselor
told me I wasn't smart enough to go to
college not even being told go to
Community College and I was straight
told to go to the military they were one
of the schools that gave me a chance I
took a trip to Howard when I was in
eighth grade and as soon as I stepped on
campus I was like this is the place that
I need to be my favorite thing about
going to an HBCU it was so many
beautiful black faces I've never seen
that many black faces that were all
beautiful and unique in their own right
you had sisters there you have brothers
there people who felt like your cousins
and you know teachers and professors who
felt like your mom and your dad there
are so many different nationalities and
so many different ethnicities that make
it what it is was just so nice to be
around other little black girls and we
were like this big black girl cohort of
like five hundred students just being
amazing and doing all these amazing
things and it was something that I had
never seen before I never thought that I
would be around different people from
different places and we would all still
connect in the same way I had a friend
who was a black gay conservative
Republican and I would have never had
that experience anywhere else it's all
just a big loving melting pot of people
the history in the foundation that you
learned not only as a person but as the
Africa
community itself you're so enriched with
knowledge I think I learned everything
about myself and about my history in my
past from going to HBCU and I don't
think I could have gotten that at a PWI
I think that if you can succeed in that
environment then you can succeed in any
environment I love my HBCU because we
hold each other down we are a big family
I love my HBCU strictly because of the
community I love my HBCU because of the
sisterhood there's no other place where
I can go and look around and see all of
these beautiful wonderful black women
doing all these amazing things I love my
HBCU because it is the mecca I love the
culture I love the history all of the
people I learned to love me
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
