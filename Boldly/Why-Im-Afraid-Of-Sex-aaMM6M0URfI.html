the concept of having sex is scary to me
I've had it before but I'm always so
afraid I don't know how I can improve my
self-esteem even though I love my
boyfriend I'm afraid of having sex with
him because that level of intimacy is
something I'm not ready for even though
I wanted I'm scared of sex because I
think it'll be awkward and I'll do it
wrong that whoever I'm with won't be
impressed the idea of actually having
sex scares me I'll talk about it all day
but when it comes down to it I'm afraid
it'll be painful I'm scared to have sex
with my fiance because I'm so loud I
don't want his landlord who lives
upstairs to hear us I'm scared to have
sex with this guy because I might catch
feelings I know all he wants is sex I'm
afraid of having sex again because the
last time I did I saw how gross I looked
in the mirror I wish I could get over
the fear of having sex I know I'm ready
for it
I just lacked the courage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
