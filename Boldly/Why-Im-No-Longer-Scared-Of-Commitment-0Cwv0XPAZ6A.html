loving the idea of long-term
relationships but for some like myself
it's a little more complicated part of
me has always known that I wanted to end
up in a relationship so there was
something so depressing about them in
fact there is a home video of me when
I'm five years old saying to my mom I
don't want to get very welding why is
that sweetie when I just get to marry
I'm moving it over Tina's story but the
thing is I kind of had a point it
actually it wasn't until just recently
that I developed my own personal
rationale for why I don't have to be so
depressing so here's my own number one
reason I am no longer scared of
commitment between the way people
discuss relationships and the way that
we see them in movies I don't know how
you could not have a hang-up about a
relationship first I can surrounded my
entire life with people who just tell me
that relationships just get dull and
boring and that's just how it is
secondly like I said when I was a kid
getting together is always the romantic
part of the movie it's always the
beginning the coming together everything
falling in place it's filled with all
the new experiences and the intrigue in
the excitement and then once they fully
get together the movie is always over
and then what fully solidified my
complete fear of can I stay in a
long-term relationship without going
completely insane was how bored of
people I got when I was dating I'm sure
there are people where it's after two
years after 10 months but six months was
the marker for when it would get dull
for me the beginning dating part was
always fun there was always this glow
this romantic movie part and I ran at
six-month marker the glow would fade and
I would get bored again but then I met
Cory my now current boyfriend and
something was just different there was
an initial movie glow in the beginning
but then at six months it was still
there and then at 12 months it was still
there this had been the first time ever
for me and so this is my very audience
but at the time not so obvious personal
discovery that I made and my weird
analogy to go with it without always
being fully aware of it a lot of times I
was only able to connect and see these
people that I was dating at a very
surface layer and so with this the only
way to keep it interesting is to
physically change that person so when I
met Cory I connected and saw him at a
deeper level and then realized not only
is there then so much more to keep you
interested but also he was changing
little ways all the time I mean we're
human it's just that on the surface you
may not always be able to see these
changes but I could
because I could really see him and so
he's always been interesting so for
natural relationship enthusiasts I'm
sure the beauty of commitment has always
been very obvious but for others like
myself not always and it never hurts to
have a little extra reassurance that
it's not the scariest thing in the world
and while I'm not naive and I know that
relationships can't always be a
honeymoon phase I don't think that part
of being matured for me at least is
accepting myself being unhappy in
something it's like in a weird way it
can feel like a bunch of first dates
because the guy that I went on a date
with last month is slightly different
than the guy that I'm going on a date
with this month except that with these
first dates every one of them is already
with someone that you love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
