so I think as long as I'm a thent ik and
set my intentions everything's going to
work out
I don't think jury duty works like that
everything works like that you just have
to center yourself okay
amazing um this has been so fun I will
be right back just put like it's bread
according to Yelp the wings are like
amazing we're vegan though so maybe you
could just like sub the carrots with the
sauce ik apparently that's what they're
known for
no why is she talking to
Oh it'll happen for you you just have to
love yourself first I do love myself
good for you keep saying until you
really believe this yeah I really do
believe it okay no one's gonna like you
if you're super stuck-up so tone it back
maybe
Hey
hi you should smile more okay okay I can
do 308 in a situation of I'm no
childhood
Kanye's called sharp out and it's like
by Jimmy Buffett and since I'm on a
deserted island
I guess I'll finally finish Moby Dick
yeah okay then you can only have three
things like a knife alright God about
the I'm taking the boat it's cheating
okay your turn all right you're on a
desert island and you can erase one
emotion I can get rid of an emotion it's
one um horniness
Dobby okay well goodbye
okay yeah but also warning this is
definitely not so it's gotta be sadness
right sorry the one emotion you'd want
to rais'd sadness okay yeah I was gonna
go with anxiety anxiety I can handle you
crazy no I think okay first night noises
alone I was gonna sing like stick
snapping in the dead of night howls in
the distance no but that feeling of
loneliness would just eat away at me I
think I guess I was hoping that maybe
after being alone for long enough I
wouldn't feel lonely let him have you
back to you on that I'm sorry I'm summer
Nona mister you minute thank you another
round Charlie's not on this island I
don't know about you cuz I'm not a lady
but it is an awful thing sometimes it's
like all you get into this place and you
just that's all you can like see I
totally forgot what drink you had and I
don't even know where I am anymore
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
