just how it's been for me my pronoun is
he and I present as a he some trans
people that might look like me and
present as a she recently I've come
across they and I like they so you can
refer to me either as she or they I like
to be referred to as many things it's
really about what sort of feels good to
our ears when we hear it
pronouns are important because they
indicate a degree of respect who doesn't
want to be respected for a long time a
lot of people have felt like that they
don't fit into the mold of primarily he
or primarily she or maybe they feel
they're a blend of both and that there's
not really a word for that I found out
about gender nonspecific pronouns Z and
here and I thought that was funny that
makes people trip up because really
technically I'm not as she not he either
there are some situations where we
really put way too much stock into
whether or not somebody is a man or a
woman um there's a lot of situations
that we just don't need to necessarily
have gendered language if you're unsure
about somebody's pronoun you pull them
aside and ask you know hey what are your
pronouns it's not even preferred pronoun
because it is their pronoun so some
people go by he some people go by she
some people actually use the pronoun
they you can avoid mistakes by just
saying them there's day their gender is
still valid regardless of whether or not
you understand it misgendering a person
by using an incorrect pronoun is an act
of disrespect everybody else in the
world out there can say I am and they
identify themselves and everybody
believes them but when I say I am
I don't know why people just don't
believe us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
