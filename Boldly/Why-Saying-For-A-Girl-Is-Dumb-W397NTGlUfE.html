time remember don't turn your drive
unless you have to get home
sorry buddy great so thank you having me
yeah
hey I just wanted to say killer said I
loved it so much oh thank you I'm glad
they're super funny for a girl Cheers
huh yeah now he that right up
frustrating thing is he thought he was
being nice yeah don't undercut a
compliment ello your expectations were
for me like the second that I see for a
girl leave someone's lips all I can hear
from that point is oh my god so cute
look at how she's trying like a dog who
stood up on my hind legs and someone's
like oh she think she's painful no what
the oh oh my god here we go should
have guessed this one got a got a little
girl driver right here I hope your dad's
got good car insurance we can pay for
this I just got this thing a new paint I
have my own insurance a little upset and
feisty right now
not my fault you're on your pillow whoa
wait a minute
okay you can't talk to her like that
women are very sensitive she could cry
I'm fine I just think that he shouldn't
talk to women like that you shouldn't be
talking to anyone like that listen let
me just give you my insurance and we can
video all right are you all right
sweetie
she hit me all right she's the one to
blame here I don't even know why women
are allowed to drive in the first place
that's a good rule right there cop no
more women driver I don't know where
you're from but in California under
state law she is considered equal to you
and she has all the same rights are you
okay I'm fine all I know is that when my
wife says she's fine
doesn't mean she's fine it means she's
kind of mad she wants to talk but I
gotta say considering the situation you
were being very calm for a girl listen I
know you're trying to help but you're
belittling me with nicknames and you're
acting like women are just frazzled
messes during any state of crises and
you're just furthering the problem by
passing down female stereotypes that
were probably put on you and you're just
a sexist asshole whose only interaction
with women is probably at strip clubs
how because your mom didn't love you
enough you know what I don't need this
you're not worth my time none of this is
worth my time
what do we got great cor mails on a park
bench oh they might be black okay I'll
be there duh I gotta go Oh what the hell
I'm sorry you're sorry that's a great
thing to say for a girl right for
someone that just hit my car
you better have insurance what do you do
for a living I'm a comedian a comedian
no I hear that's a very difficult job
and thus doesn't pay very well
especially for a girl right
no what for someone who's such a shitty
driver thank you so much
what I'm a person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
