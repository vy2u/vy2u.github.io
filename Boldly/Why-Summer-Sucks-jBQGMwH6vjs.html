still everything first of all any time
you wear a dress or skirt or shorts and
it's so hot and humid out by chafing so
I hate it when you're walking around and
your face gets all sweaty and your
sunglasses start to slide down your nose
and you just have to walk around pushing
them up the whole time I hate it when
you stand up from a plastic chair or
like a car seat and you've left behind
like a pool of butt shapes where oh and
you probably have like a wet patch on
the back of your shorts now too when
you're sitting on the grass and after it
feels like your legs have been ravaged
by ants it's so itchy
- tubs swimsuits summer shirts they're
just a hazard because my boobs will fall
out at any time your bras get sweaty or
quicker like really quick so you have to
wash them more often and sometimes you
can do that so you just have to wear
gross proud to shave all over all the
time because everything showing like how
does hair grow so fast when you wake up
from which should be a nice nap but your
hair is completely stuck to the back of
your neck because you're sweating
everywhere you're sweating and everybody
sees that under boob sweat
anytime you go out in the summer and
you're wearing like a cute halter top or
a bag across your body and you get home
and it's just the worst tan line when
you try to break in your new sandals and
you get blisters and cuts everywhere
from the loving thinking you've done a
great job of covering yourself in
sunscreen I need to realize that you
missed the patch and now like your knee
Pizza bun so make up it melts and don't
you hate it when you walk around all day
looking like you're crying because your
makeups sweating off and sometimes you
even sweat on your upper lip you look in
the mirror and you're like oh great I
have a liquid mustache what is something
I love about someone so one thing I do
love about summer are the cookouts the
outdoor parties the fun the games with
all my friends
I love how carefree I can be I just
throw in a dress and sandals and I go at
the door I love how the days are longer
it makes me feel like there are more
hours in the day even though it's a
total illusion cooling down a nice hot
day with a popsicle in my hand
