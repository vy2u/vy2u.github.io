have those weird cutouts all over them
so after a long day at the pool you get
back and you realize you got triangle
patterns all over your skin something
that always happens to me when I go to
the beach is there's like you go to the
bathroom and there's sand everywhere all
over your vagina all over your swimsuits
nightmare so I love shopping online but
the one thing you really can't buy
online is swimsuits you just don't know
how they're gonna fit at all until you
actually see them in person and try them
on swimsuit labels are also like really
notorious for lying about the size I
feel like you always have to buy two
sizes bigger than you actually are which
doesn't make any sense the most
frustrating thing about buying swimsuits
is that some suits only come in sets so
you can't buy different sizes on the top
and the bottom but my top and bottom are
definitely different sizes because I
have a bigger bust when I was living in
Turkey all the cute zucchinis were
smaller size and I always end up going
through the old ladies section and
buying those old lady boring suits if
you actually have boobs like good luck
buying a swimsuit any quicker I really
just like this part about bikinis where
they have all this extra padding for
support but after you come out of the
water it's like two diapers on your
boobs or something it just absorbs all
the water and you always just have to
discreetly like let all the water out
one of the worst things about wearing a
swimsuit is when you get out of the
water you think you're looking really
cute and you have saggy but the water is
just wave you down one pieces and
bikinis you know you always have to sort
of wiggle your way out of a wedgie all
the time just because of the material
and you're soaking wet and it's just you
know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
