sound of the TARDIS right now you
wouldn't run out there and be a
companion no I probably would I just
think that there's something more I've
been a Doctor Who fan for like ten years
now and I don't want to be a companion I
want to be the doctor you want to be a
British man am i benedict cumberbatch no
then no I just want there to be a female
doctor he hasn't even been a ginger yet
what is the point of having a fantasy
show that takes place in all of space
and time if you're just gonna adhere to
modern-day sexist standards
it's like Jane Espenson said the whole
reason you write fantasy is because
anything can happen but Doctor Who is
different it's a classic there hasn't
been a woman doctor in 13 regenerations
he's like the Pope that way you're
telling me that in a show starring an
alien could look millions of different
ways all 13 times just turned into a
different skinny white guy has the
doctor ever said the Time Lords can
change gender yeah it's canon when Matt
Smith regenerated he thought he was a
woman because of his long hair excuse me
to mark well as a straight woman I
personally don't want a female doctor I
want to be able to have a crush on
someone dashing like tenon or Smith if
you need hetero eye candy why not give
her a sexy male companion or two sexy
male companions plus the doctor was a
woman what new storylines with this
present you could finally hook up with
Captain Jack and supposing the world of
Doctor Who is fiction which it is okay
well that's your opinion but supposing
it's fiction what are the real-world
reasons there's never been a female
doctor the showrunners have always been
men in fact the entire writers room
right now is men but the fan base is
mostly women it would have meant so much
to me as a kid to see a female doctor to
know that I was more than just the
sidekick I know but like I think a lot
of guys see the doctor is the man they
want to be with a role model and men
can't have female role models that's
just sad and most importantly the show
has never been about having a crush on
the doctor yeah unlike Peter Capaldi
just said the doctor is not your
boyfriend
she's the doctor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
