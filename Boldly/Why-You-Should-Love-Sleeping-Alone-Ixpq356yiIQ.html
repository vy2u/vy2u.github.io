sleeping with someone is often seen as
better than sleeping alone but is that
really true let's look back at the
history of sharing a bed
the idea of couples sleeping together is
a relatively new one in ancient Rome the
bed was a place only for sex not
sleeping
according to dr. Neil Stanley of the
University of Surrey couples only began
sharing a bed in the industrial era when
people moved to cities had less space
and therefore had to share
Stanley argues that humans were never
meant to share a bed and so sleeping in
separate beds became something strange
we only saw on I Love Lucy reruns right
well according to a 2005 study by the
National Sleep Foundation one in four
American couples still sleep in separate
beds why an online poll from the Today
Show found that 60% of participants
slept better when alone and 75% of
adults wake up in the middle of the
night or snore
ruining a good night's sleep so how
destructive is bad sleep one study at
Central Queensland University saw over
4,000 participants call in sick to work
due to lost sleep from sharing a bed
gross and four men sharing a bed may
temporarily reduce the brains cognitive
power according to a study by the
University of Vienna men performed worse
on cognitive tests after sharing a bed
with a partner and a survey found that
women who got less than five hours of
sleep per night were more likely to gain
weight than women who got a deeper sleep
not convinced yet to go solo consider
this a study from the University of
Surrey found that while couples thought
they sleep better with their partner
brainwaves scans showed up to 30 minutes
more of deep sleep when sleeping apart
that's basically three extra hits on
this news button which we all know is
priceless so whether you're single
dating or married think twice when you
start to feel ashamed of your empty bed
and you can do this nothing beats this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
