was in the fourth grade the airbag hit
the seatbelt the edge of the seatbelt is
what sliced into my neck and I almost
died I was dating someone who had a dog
we were at her house one night eating
fast food he had gotten into the bag and
the food was all over the place there
was a wrapper just on the floor to my
right I bent over to pick it up the dog
attacked my face I was on a training
ride with my cycling team and we were
going pretty fast about 30 miles an hour
someone hit a pothole and they got
through it just fine and I hit it and I
crashed I have five surgical incisions
from when I tore my ACL and smashed my
meniscus when I was playing soccer six
years ago I have a long scar from about
between my shoulder blades down to right
at the top of my butt and the base of my
spine when I had spinal fusion surgery
it's also accompanied by four smaller
like three inch scars on my side for the
following six weeks I didn't have skin
on large portions of my arms it took a
long process of healing and learning to
like walk again with my surgery and
initially the scars felt really weird
and it's like foreign on my body it's
hard to explain how emotionally damaging
that is to suddenly have a scar on your
face and it was a very painful process
physically and mentally to recover from
when I was in middle school I was
uncomfortable with them I was
embarrassed by them there's not a lot in
middle school you want to make you feel
different from the other kids I couldn't
even look people in the eye for like
about two months afterward because I
knew that they were staring at my scar I
sometimes feel self-conscious about them
especially when I wear dresses I only
wanted to wear long sleeve shirts even
though it was the summer no I would
never feel self-conscious about my scars
it's a part of who I am to me my scars
it's an important reminder of how
precious life is and how lucky I am
because I came really close to dying at
a young age to me they're almost like
tattoos in that they they are moments in
life and you I can remember that
specific moment like what I was doing
and where I was by looking at that cigar
every morning when I put on my makeup
and I have to put on makeup over it to
cover it up it's a never-ending reminder
of having a scar on my face I accept
this as a part of my personality it's
Who I am
it's not a deformation they're a symbol
that I can tackle something and get past
it and they're a part of me they make me
different I like what scars
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah that you don't know the
half of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
