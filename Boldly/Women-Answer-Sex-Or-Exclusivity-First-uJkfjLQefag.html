you know you decide I do know I'm
actually like a huge proponent of like
having sex early in a relationship
because then you know right away you
don't buy the cow without milking it
first to see how it tastes
God Drive a car before you buy it wise
if you wait like until three months down
the line and you're like exclusive and
you have sex and you're off all together
like there's a waste of three months
that's heartbreaking a lot of times it's
like harder to even like come to that
conclusion of what you're doing in the
relationship than it is to just have sex
I would prefer to like be sad that
conversation of like okay I'm not
talking anyone else I want to be serious
about you I see the benefits of waiting
a little bit longer to you know build up
the passion with someone and build up
like the comfortability and you're
attracted to someone you end up having
sex with them earlier on this is great
and then you're just in a relationship
just to have sex with them and then it
fizzles out I just don't understand why
it has to be such a big deal like yeah
so what the only time I set the ground
rules I ended up getting married you
don't have to like stick to some plan I
guess and you just think about it's just
like putting your bodies next to each
other I mean you're putting stuff in
stuff but like nothing's really changing
there's no like mathematical problem to
like though I'd like to see one your
body your rules right when you feel like
you're emotionally ready that's probably
when you're like sexually ready to why
should we feel bad about feeling good oh
sure I know it's really like meat not
another thing I am
