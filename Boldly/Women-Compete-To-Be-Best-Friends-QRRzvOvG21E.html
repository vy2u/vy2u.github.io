since moving across the country a year
ago I realized that it's way harder to
make friends as an adult
scheduling anxiety and just having
higher standards for who you want in
your life
I'll get in the way so today I'm going
to try to make a new BFF there's three
candidates here and they're going to
compete in two different activities that
put their friendship skills to the test
after meeting each friends I'll be
forced to make a decision which one of
these will be my new BFF my name is
Allie and I am here to make friends for
me what's really important to someone
who's funny I want to have someone with
a great sense of humor someone who's
trustworthy someone who's there for you
when you need them someone who's open
and honest and willing to talk through
things hi I'm Matt again nice to meet
you I'm Madigan I am from st. Paul
Minnesota I am an ex figure skater in my
free time I enjoy playing board games
and crocheting I feel like it's so hard
to make friends as an adult because
everybody's schedules are so different
everybody is getting involved in their
careers and they're just kind of
scattered what was good to meet you and
I'm excited to start the day with you
too okay thanks hi
good how are you Holly I'm Chanelle oh
my god hi I'm Chanelle I really love
music I love self-help books
I am a personal growth advocate
I grew up in a military family so I
moved around a lot which I think
actually might be part of the reason why
I have a hard time meeting friends and
maintaining friendships okay cool it was
so nice to meet you excited to hang out
with you yeah oh
hi nice to meet you Oh Maureen they meet
you hi I'm Lauren I'm from Texas I enjoy
reading books logic plastics and
watching movies and I just want to find
someone to hang out during the day like
go to museums or just talk and have
down-to-earth conversations yeah well it
was really good to meet you yeah
all right go dilating okay thank you all
so much for coming making friends is
hard and I'm excited to hang out with
everybody so let's get started I was
really banking on hating one person
immediately but everyone was so nice and
it'll be really cool to see what
everybody brings to the table
so I go to my friends a lot for advice I
can be really indecisive especially when
it comes to what to wear or what I think
looks good on me so I definitely go to
my friends a lot to ask for their
opinions so we have a bunch of clothes
here and you guys can go through them
and select what you think I should wear
on a first date I'm really excited to
see what everybody picks let's get
started I just met I don't know like I
don't want to put her in something that
she would hate yeah right okay
oh okay turn in um yes I'm very
indecisive as well so hope you have an
hour are you going on this date I don't
know what it's a surprise he hasn't told
her no I totally come up with on your
own yeah well I think that this date
would be like we're just getting a drink
somewhere you know at a bar you want I'm
gonna show up like I'm so cute I didn't
really try too hard to be that exactly
that is exactly the look I'm going for
it what would your ideal first date so
first we go to dinner and then then we
go dancing like then break it down yeah
burgers are short it's a skirt it's a
skirt breezy so you're not getting hot
sweaty in the bar you know I will show
up in this outfit and you wear this and
then just be matching and then we can
take a picture after okay okay I feel
like I'm like dressing you like I'm
wearing today but if you were like a
black dress and then you wore just like
that right interesting these I could be
this could be terrible
Oh with the yellow with the jeans with
um these shoes here cool so I will go
put this on wonder Chloe I love it and
take these okay cool cool
oh you hear oh yeah
the way she accessorized it was really
inventive but it just wasn't me it
wasn't my style I would never wear that
on a first date I put her in like the
black like tank top dress I did that too
yeah I like it thank you
I really like Lauren's outfit I thought
it was really classy really nice but it
was a little too much for a first date
for me it's like oh shoot I'm the friend
that's inside why would I pick out super
oh my gosh I was like nervous ah here we
go
finally pants this is like my ideal date
outfit I like the pants I thought the
whole outfit was too cute sexy I like
the boots the shirt was a little
see-through but that was my only
complaint like jeans and the yellow top
so that's a single one because you know
functional exactly acrobats know right
for this next challenge I've asked each
of the women to plan their perfect
Friday night in and I'm very excited to
see what each person has in store hello
welcome in you too hey thank you for
having yes of course come in hello we
have some lovely pizza here and some
wine oh love you has wine a night is not
complete without a glass of wine I agree
I chose some red wine and pizza and
watching Dance Moms
I always order pizza with my friends
because I can't cook at all I yes I love
not cooking I'm allergic to Pisa No so I
have some mac and cheese for you awesome
if you would like any it's got a little
green decoration on
yes you just scrape off looks amazing
I'm actually allergic to but it because
the activity yesterday was a little bit
of a bust with the mac and cheese and
cookies I almost killed her so I really
like to have themed parties
I see the good stuff right so I love
having themed party so I figured we
would watch Beyonce's lemonade because
that's like super cool right now that's
like all the business right now so we
had a nice little get-together with
lemonade watching Beyonce's lemonade
well have you ever seen ever after no
what we're gonna watch some Dance Moms
oh cool have you ever watched it I never
have how many times have you seen this
Oh probably too many I loved period
pieces like anything that's doesn't say
food okay yes me too I love Lauren she's
so funny and silly and cute I could
totally see us being friends she did
pick mac and cheese and hot chocolate
which I thought was adorable but like
what I would do in middle school I feel
like now on a Friday night and I'm
exhausted from the week and I'd rather
just have a bottle of wine I wish I had
an awesome talent like that like I wish
I had an amazing voice or just could
like do ballet right exactly Madigan is
also super cool I could totally see us
being friends I love the wine and the
pizza but reality TV is just never
really going to be my thing publican
favorite cocktail liquor with liquor
yeah I really liked what she Nell had
planned for us she made us gin and
lemonade cocktails and we watched
lemonade I thought it was really cute
she made a themed evening yeah I was
really happy with her so how did that go
her everybody I think yeah my few
choices were not the best yeah mine
we watched lemony oh yeah
that actually it's great what you have I
like all of these women a lot and it's
gonna be a really hard choice hey guys I
had so much fun with you guys today and
I wish I didn't have to but
unfortunately I can only pick one of you
Lauren I thought that the outfit you
picked for me was great it was classy
and simple and I would totally wear it
but I do think on a Friday man I
probably won't be drinking alcohol
madigan I had a great time with you I
thought we totally clicked from the
beginning and we had a lot in common and
I love drinking wine with you I do think
that reality TV isn't totally for me
though chanel our fiance date was like
perfect
I loved the lemonade cocktails I loved
watching lemonade is so much fun with
you
the outfit you pick was really nice but
this this shirt was pretty see-through
and so I don't think I would have worn
it on a date okay
decision time
ladies check your phones well I expected
to win today so I don't have a speech
prepared and yeah and now I can eat all
the mac and cheese and cookies by myself
so I worked really hard today to do the
best little dates that I could been here
all day and all I got was this sunburn
making friends as an adult is really
tough and I'm so happy that today I had
the experience to hang out with these
awesome women and I'm really psyched
that Chanel and I connected you know if
you don't like you don't click if you do
you do and that's that's the beauty of
it cool do you want to go finish the gin
and watch lemonade I thought you'd never
let us do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
