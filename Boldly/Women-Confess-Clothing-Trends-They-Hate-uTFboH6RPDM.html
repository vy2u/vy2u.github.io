- Rompers are the worst.
- Super dark jeans are awful.
(upbeat music)
- So I love high-waisted
denim shorts, they're so cute,
but your butt's always
hanging out, no one wants that
and when you sit down, it's not stretchy,
so it just like digs into your skin
and it's so uncomfortable.
- Flowy short skirts, every
time I go out and it's windy,
it's like &amp;quot;whoo&amp;quot; and I'm not trying to be
Marilyn Monroe right now.
- Body suits, not only
does it make going to
the bathroom difficult,
you also have to make sure
those two little dangly bits don't fall
into the toilet while you're peeing.
Don't forget to clip those
little bits back together,
cause otherwise you're gonna have a tail
dragging behind you.
- Fabric that wrinkles really
easily is absolute trash
and I' not about to start bringing an iron
with me everywhere I go.
- Dry clean clothes only,
why do they make those?
Why can't I just throw it in the washer?
Such a hassle having to
go to the dry cleaners.
- Rompers are the worst.
Sure they look really cute in the summer,
but then you have to go to the bathroom
and you end up stripping naked and then
just sitting there feeling
very, very exposed.
- Super dark jeans are awful.
By the end of the day
your hands and your purse
are blue from all the
ink coming off of it.
- Sheer tops, what bra are
you supposed to wear under it?
Bralettes, not everyone
can wear bralettes.
- I hate wearing strapless tops.
You constantly have to pull them up,
why won't they just stay in place?
- Backless tops are the worst.
Like, you know, you go into a store
and you see a dress or
a top and then you turn
it around and all of a
sudden, it has no back.
It's not like everyone can
just casually go braless.
- Low-cut running socks.
While you're walking,
they slip into your shoe,
which is super uncomfortable
and they also leave your
foot exposed for blisters.
- Just-a-little-too-short crop tops.
Every time you raise your
hand up, you can see your bra.
- A good clothing moment
that happened to me
was that I found a strappy
dress that I can go
braless in because it has enough
support in the chest area.
- So recently I got these
high-waisted denim shorts,
but these are actually really
comfortable and really cute.
- I love thrift shopping,
you can always find
cute, original stuff, but for a good deal.
