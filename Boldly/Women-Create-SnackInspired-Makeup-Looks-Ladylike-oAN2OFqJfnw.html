let's do this today we are doing makeup
inspired snack looks nice today we're
doing snack inspired makeup look people
always make fun of me and also slightly
gag when I tell them that my favorite
food is kind of sour cream
goldfish means everything to me cookies
and cream ice cream I just have a big
ice-cream fan I'm kind of like Joe Biden
in that sense I think chips ins also do
it for me because you've got the salt
and then you've got a little like kick
with a salsa I bite ice cream I don't
lick it so I just don't a lot of
patience where you bite ice cream like
if it's in a cone I don't like it I just
bite it because I'm compiled also cheese
is my favorite thing so like two of my
favorite booths in the same bag made
into a chip I went to school in London
and they didn't sell goldfish crackers
there at the time that my parents would
send me like cases of goldfish Oh once I
got like a huge mr. Potato Head that was
just filled with goldfish crackers my
fiance was got me like a personalized
goldfish cracker box for our anniversary
I haven't a really deep intense mr. cool
I don't know why were just finding us
out right now my boyfriend recently said
that I just come oh so gross that when
you get Devin she just comes with a side
of chips and salsa I can get started no
it's like a creamy brown
I like the idea dream like a chocolate
and vanilla inspired look
I'm gonna really lean into the blue here
I think I might do a yellow lip got
yellow got orange like a little bit of
brown I love snacks I love makeup I
don't know why we haven't done this
before I'm gonna make my eyes into the
little logo right here so this will be
on my eyelid and then I'm gonna make
this come out happening you can't stop
me I'm doing it now a little bit too
dark I really want to make my eyes look
like a little bowl of salsa to make it
batch the ice cream I have to put like
specks of like a darker Brown I saw a
guy on the Internet
do his fingers neck he did a funny book
and it was incredible really
yeah its snack inspired so I'm gonna use
the packaging so I'm gonna put some blue
on my mouth
speaking of sour cream when I was in
Middle School I used to dip grapes and
sour cream
it was delicious that is wild yeah oh
wow well we're not there yet it's really
funny cuz your body language it was sort
of like you are a mechanic that just
comes up from the hood of a car
well the transmission show it's not
fixed yet
I think people hate on pretzels way too
much oh yeah I agree pretzels are
delicious I did my makeup before I came
to work this morning and I was like I
did a nice job and you enjoyed it for
approximately one minute yet I know that
my snack has no purple in it but I'm
putting my own twist on I definitely
thought we were gonna be following
tutorials
oh cool I was like wow so cool tutorials
like no Krista the tutorial is coming
from you
you know what I think is a really
overrated Sam what Thomas I agree
really I agree I don't like it it's like
got a such a basic taste and if you eat
a lot of it it kind of feels like you're
eating vomit I feel like most the things
I do can be described as not bad yet
take my trip and I'll let it
trace my cat I this is unrelated to this
video but I did pick a few stray hairs
so I just need to tweeze a little bit
actually you know what though so Ben and
Jerry's has very precise thought and my
eyebrows are not very precise right now
so I need to take care of that I
remember once reading a tip when I was
like 13 about Kelly Clarkson and how she
used like 16 different mascaras and like
layered them
I still do that now I really listen love
Kelly Clarkson oh me too
so the eyeliner is reflective of the
drop shadow on the ruffles text I
thought stretch at all
snack let's let up right there on the
bag you know you look like you come from
like a Japanese music video I'm having
so much trouble with the ombre lip the
dryness of the liquid lipstick is making
this really difficult I think we're done
here
yeah me too do we bitch I'm amazed that
this came together you can look at this
color palette now it's like my ombre lip
is a little off but everything else I
feel is pretty pretty accurate yeah like
if I did it subtly it would look better
but it wouldn't be clear what I'm trying
to do so it's like if you have a purpose
hit your purpose I know I'm gay our
looks may not be next level but our love
for snacks is major-league this is fun I
think anyone can create their own makeup
tutorial if you want to you don't just
sit around and wait for someone to come
up with the tutorial for like I don't
know chucky cheese or goldfish or Hilary
Duff movies yeah what snack makeup lady
tested lady yummy yeah lady yummy oh my
god we need to be on Chicopee oh my god
and hire us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
