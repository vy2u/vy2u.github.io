know the best nutritionist in the world
or the best way to diet and lose weight
it's got to be the Kardashians I am
definitely the kind of person that comes
home after a long day of work and has a
glass of wine that's gonna be a great
habit to break both financially and
calorically I want to feel like I felt
before I had kids Kim and Kourtney have
children and they look amazing what are
they doing how do they look like that
food is such an important part of being
an athlete and it's like I work out and
I know how to do that but I really want
to get the nutrition right in college I
developed body dysmorphia I look at
myself and I see things that I wish were
different
I want throughout this challenge to
develop confidence with stepping on the
scale I'm ready to walk the runway like
Kendall well in a month
I'm Kevin Libby with ph2 nutrition that
worked with many celebrities getting
ready for films I was with PFC nutrition
during the taping of Khloe Kardashian's
revenge body also work with Vanessa
Hudgens
she's just shot for the cover for
Women's Health magazine for the next 30
days and be working with individuals and
putting them through a nutritional
protocols like you would see with a lot
of celebrities including the Kardashians
good morning ladies nice to meet
everybody ones y'all here and you know
all the celebrities including the
Kardashians they do it the right way
they do it consistent energy patterning
of foods that suit their metabolism
until they get the end results we're
gonna figure out what works for each
individual okay guys get this over with
one 45.4 okay eat it so much okay I was
fine
125 point six one thirty five point
eight one thirty nine point eight is
that a shocker
do you know cuz I weighed myself this
morning before I left
oh so face bug face there's something so
brutal about the numbers so you carry on
your frame 41.3 six pounds of fat oh my
god it was kind of like getting
information that you knew was there but
you never wanted to like really look
hard at it I really was like not happy
with the numbers that I pulled that day
I was just very
ready to listen to Kevin and trust in
him and Trust the process I want to get
as close to a six-pack as I can you can
just go to the store right now and buy
one
now an interesting you think variable
here is you have Hashimoto's
hypothyroidism please help me I do have
an autoimmune disease I have Hashimoto's
which affects a lot of women it's very
manageable it's very livable but it does
affect my weight and it does affect my
energy there was a time in my life when
my autoimmune condition took that
completely out of my control
and so I hadn't weighed myself in a long
time leading up to that day I wasn't
really expecting stress to be such a big
factor in my diet I want you to meditate
and meditate can be anything part of my
diet is meditating every night is
meditation for reducing stress all of
the Kardashians each have individual
body goals having an individualized and
highly specific diet plan is really
important and really crucial
I'm at the grocery store and I'm just
now realizing that I don't know what
chard looks like I'm pretty sure it's a
leafy green but I can't find it anywhere
I just spent a hundred and forty five
dollars on this week grocery run just
for a week and that doesn't count
any of the other foods I need for my
family
hour-by-hour exact measurements exact
ounces of every single thing you need to
eat and when and it is very restrictive
this little piece of salmon is $7.00 hi
guys it made me realize how much I eat
out and how much money goes towards
eating out because I had to prepare
everything myself I'm at lunch with og
right now and we're being so good we got
our our salad here oh she's amazing meal
prep here I just got to work
I've already had a protein shake and a
banana and now I'm supposed to eat this
Kevin gave me such a huge breakfast it's
crazy like eat more we all are allowed
to eat more Saul my food for tomorrow
and it only took me almost all of the
Oscars
at protein powder its chocolate I had an
egg you just went on kind of a binge of
food porn videos on Facebook now so
hungry and I have to eat this really
crappy chicken for lives to really
commit and really do this you have to
prepare everything yourself and I did
not know how to do that measure about
1/2 cup gluten-free pasta using a stuff
in the kitchen I haven't in a while you
kind of like prepare yourself for this
constant hunger you know but I actually
was struggling to eat all the food that
I was supposed to be eating I'm supposed
to eat a tablespoon of honey and 2
tablespoons of almond butter before I go
to the gym but I normally don't eat
anything before just because it's so
early everyone keeps asking if I have
more energy on this diet and I'm just
like no I'm not having caffeine I'm not
having sugar
I'm not having carbs why would I have
more energy on this diet I think it's
also important to recognize the amount
of privilege the Kardashians have when
it comes to controlling their diets
watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians
and Kim just said that she hadn't been
to a grocery store in four years and
that is the real difference between me
and the Kardashians on this diet because
I'm going to the grocery store at least
four times a week I'm really really
nervous about the weigh-in I can't
believe we're only halfway there you had
a backfire and now you're up one
pointing positive scale I was hungry
all of us yeah that's not that's not
good it really really sucked being
around all these other women who had
lost weight and I step on the scale and
I appear to have gone in the opposite
direction
so much of socializing is tied to food
and I think that's part of the reason
being healthy is so hard I want to like
spend time with my friends and sometimes
the way we do that is over a meal I'm
ordering off the menu called skinny
licious it's kind of embarrassing I
would say also on the family front it's
weird being the only person at the table
who's on a diet like who wants to be
that person telling everyone I'm dieting
everyone is having cookies except for me
this is so painful I'm drinking my water
out of the wineglass and kind of nice
actually I mean I still wish this were
wine but yeah I'll take what I can get I
know I'm not supposed to be drinking but
I've had a really rough day so happy
always happening
Cheers I've been on set for 12 hours I'm
eating a pizza pizza I don't give a fuck
I was trying my best to stick to the
plan but there were nights when I was
just like I'm tired like I don't care
right now like I'm just not going to eat
dinner I was very surprised that I was
making progress every week because this
has been a struggle since I was
diagnosed this is the first time I've
worn these jeans to work in like eight
or nine months and they fit and they
feel good and I'm officially in the 120s
right on track it's all worth it guys
fourth week staying strong
nothing's gonna veer me from this diet
by week four I knew myself better I knew
my triggers I knew different methods to
calm my anxiety like walking and those
little moments really make a difference
on the diet I've noticed that my skin
has never been this clear before I guess
it's because I cut out a lot of sugar
and dairy this is one side effect that I
wasn't expecting that has been quite
pleasant I'm at the point with this diet
where a round of sweet potato and cashew
butter is like the most amazing delicacy
who have I become I have officially
become the person that I always hated
names I usually feel really exhausted
like after lunch and now I guess because
we're cutting all these carbs and
everything I don't feel as tired all the
time which is great I just fit into a
pair of shorts that I haven't fit into
you in two years
I don't have those sugar cravings
Pinterest happy you feel angry and more
peaceful there we go
I'm very nervous
you lost a total in one month of 10.6
pounds is not bad she lost three pounds
total
- your total was scale weight loss of
7.4 pounds she lost 5.4 percent on the
page I have a last minute business trip
to New York so unfortunately I couldn't
be there for the final land so this is
my final weigh in holy Sh the 10 pound
was I think you guys all did awesome
numbers tell a part of the story if you
can get over your fear of getting on the
scale that to me is immeasurable even
though what the scale says now is
lighter this month for me was so much
more about being healthy it was so
inspiring and empowering to know that I
can take control of my health and I can
take control of my body when I started
this month physically unhappy with where
I was and now that it's over and I have
lost 10 pounds and I'm back to a place
where I feel good and I feel comfortable
I'm feeling a lot better I lost fat I
put on muscle I've never really seen my
abs come out like that I've never really
seen my back or my arms feel that
defined it's really cool to know that I
don't have to hit a number on a scale to
look a certain way as a mother how could
I do this with the kids and it's intense
and it is intense and I think that the
way to do it is like reach out to a
professional and to support I had
Michelle and Jordan and Alex all going
through it at the same time this is a
very personal journey for everyone and I
really think the scale shouldn't be
involved and Kevin was great about
reminding us of that we all had crazy
improvements and it just goes to show
like how important nutrition is I am
learning new healthier habits but at the
same time I want to spend them having a
good time with my family and not worried
about how much I weigh oh let's go eat
