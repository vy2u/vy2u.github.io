don't get deep about it just right out
the top of your head the first thing
that you think of okay okay why do you
wear makeup selfies because I felt like
I had to I had horrible acne as a kid I
think makeups fun that's why I wear it I
think that I started getting into makeup
in high school because I like to feel
grown-up you know here's my makeup bag
I'm an adult when I was younger I just
wanted to not have any reason for
attention to be drawn to me which if
you're in high school and your skin is
like patchy and acne that's something
that might cause attention to you I wore
makeup in college because a lot of the
girls were wearing makeup so I was like
okay I kind of have to keep up I almost
wear it more is just like if I want to
in an empowering way
to me make up just about expressing
myself my makeup takes ten minutes to
apply and already that's like 9 minutes
too long trains are forever changing so
I'm trying to keep up I guess it's fun
seeing the most ideal best version of
yourself I do think we live in a society
that really does value your looks and it
really does value all these things you
can do to enhance your looks people are
constantly questioning what it means to
be a woman what is being feminine
actually mean I think it's definitely
more about the fun element and also the
therapeutic element just doing my makeup
it's sort of like a time of reflection
it's a choice that you personally make
if you decide that you don't want to
show people what your under-eye bags
look like you don't have to I think like
when people don't wear makeup it's often
unfairly seen as like overly political
choice when it should just be seen as
someone deciding not to wear makeup go
ahead is weak I would say that I'm
mostly just insecure about going bare
skin I think day to day is gonna be okay
might be too cocky but time will tell
I am excited I can spend all week doing
strange skincare treatments I'm excited
if I can actually do it nervous then I'm
gonna cheat all right it's off
here we go it's morning one of no makeup
I am actually pretty nervous about this
I really expect to feel so
self-conscious the nice thing is though
because I'm not wearing any makeup I've
shaved like 15 minutes off my ready time
so I was able to sleep in a little bit
now I can go to work and I'm not going
to be late I am too comfortable at work
right now I don't have any makeup on my
face so I'm just in a full blanket
basically acting like the office is my
bedroom I am headed to go get my
eyebrows done and my mustache waxed just
so I can feel you know well put together
for this next week I went to a museum
today I went out to dinner I met someone
new and all without makeup and I didn't
even think twice about it so I suppose
well for the rest of my week it's a
little bit awkward because I feel like
just being at the office and being
barefaced makes me feel like I'm in high
school good and I'm really young but I'm
trying to be confident in sassy I didn't
wash my hair today that's okay because
there's no illusion to be kept up we're
just having a good time me and my dirty
hair and my bare face and you know I got
a pimple over here but hey so I'm going
to my friend's hourlies party and it's a
night event it's at a bar trying to
dress cute I'm realizing it's not as bad
during the day but at night I really do
what there's a makeup on I just posted a
picture on Instagram without makeup from
the event last night I took me a second
to really kind of muster up the courage
to post it I'd never post pictures about
makeup I'm out shopping right now
and I actually had to go to Sephora and
get a lot of makeup or a different shoe
and I was a little intimidated going in
there because I went in there it just
has like such amazing makeup looks I was
walking in there with a completely bare
face we're at a restaurant with no
makeup on it's pretty okay today I was
like very on the go yeah I was like
upstairs downstairs turning in paperwork
scanning things organizing my desk and I
was just like you know what I'm on the
go I'm sweating a little bit and it's
good that I have a coffee I'm getting
bored I'm someone wearing one of my
favorite jerseys which is bright purple
and so I feel like I do have a little
bit of like revival with my look and
just like a boring ass face I've been
sweating the entire day and so I guess
I'm kind of glad that I'm not wearing
makeup today
I just didn't even have to deal with
like trying to dab you know today we're
going on our teen outing to a Warren
Safari and of course it would be a day
where I would throw on some makeup
especially some concealer because I'd
look into my eyes I spend my time before
our outing using Chantelle's
real scissors yeah her real scissors to
trim the top of my brows which is a good
use of my time since I don't need to be
putting makeup on we are about to embark
on the Malibu wine Safari no makeup had
I got my chakram a chapstick I gotta
tell you we were in the presence of some
handsome little cutie Pie's driving
truck and I think all of us felt very
comfortable yeah we're really thinking
about it none of us are wearing makeup
and I think we look pretty cute I didn't
think I'd feel self-conscious but I do
feel a little bit uncomfortable everyday
just being like yeah this is my face
I don't know guys I don't know this is I
didn't expect it to be hard more props
to Alicia Keys and just women who go out
to these big events and truly don't care
about what people are gonna say I
thought I would be able to do that no
problem and it's proving a lot harder
than I thought I am about to venture
into a ladylike video with no makeup on
alright let's do it man face a face on
set through this experience I think I've
learned to sort of cut myself some slack
if I'm having an awesome experience
somewhere or doing something really dope
what I've learned is to just catch
myself in that moment and post it on
social media don't say oh I don't have
my makeup bag with me oh this isn't the
right lip color for the selfie that I
would like to post because I'm missing
out on capturing something really really
dope this week I expected someone to
tell me that I looked tired instead I
had two people tell me that my face just
looks so clean and so fresh overall this
week wasn't actually filled with
emotional hurdles it was more of a
homecoming it was more like you would
prefer to sleep in because that's who
you are
but I also loved makeup so I don't think
I'm giving it up after this week sadly
truthfully I think people do judge it
other people in their appearance I don't
give a if you see my face without
makeup I think slowly but surely we're
getting towards the point where women
aren't expected to look or act a certain
way people are being allowed to live out
their truth so it's been a week of no
makeup no makeup at all and we're about
to celebrate by posting on Instagram
using the hashtag fresh-faced Friday so
we're challenging all of you guys to do
the same so so selfies BAE wit post this
friday on instagram using the hashtag
fresh face friday they all click on that
post over there see more videos from our
channel some of our favorites are in
there and some we like just okay
but watch anyway because we love you
yeah yeah sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
