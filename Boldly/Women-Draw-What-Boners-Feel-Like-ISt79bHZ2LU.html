he's not that much I guess I've never
asked what it feels like I feel like I
can understand it although I've never
felt it coming in hot
I guess boner like kindergarten and my
sexual awakening just like mashed up I'm
these colors is like a heat indicator
first let's get this flame going this is
like an exciting boner not like oh I'm
in the library where I just woke up next
to my roommate like what I imagine some
drugs to be like the blood rushes from
his head because then he can't think
straight
like nothing zero happening I'm gonna
draw a little mountain oh I just robbed
Venus I just a mountain in Venus look
the same but they're like I'm at the top
here now what do I do
how do I get down it's probably hard and
exciting and sparkly lots of like happy
faces it's like oh my god yes who looks
I can take has it to you that is this
parabola of feeling going on oh my god
this is a parabola here I'm tied any
times it just penises everywhere just so
phallic
nothing here everything here all
pointing going down but I think that
dictates a lot of the emotions happening
as well I drew a Christmas tree and a
menorah cause it's kinda like when
you're a little kid and you're like that
holiday where I get presents and good
some have this coming I think that's
what it feels like I imagine an erect
penis to be like there's a farm coming
out of your pelvis but with the nerve
endings of a clitoris the penis is
speaking to you almost it's like I have
to have sex but then your head is like
oh you have to tell her she's pretty to
look at how excited he is like stuffs
about to go down and I feel like men are
just like always ready for it I think I
did well simplicity sometimes is the
best answer you're like oh this is so
weird and there's so much attention here
I'm what do I do with it now I'm gonna
ask guys though so when I make my next
took up really awkward they could take
fuzzy I don't know guys I don't have a
penis I'm not sure we're</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
