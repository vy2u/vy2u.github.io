testosterone boys have it it gets you
like pumped up it helps with muscle tone
makes you horny makes men manly in the
traditional sense that you are more
aggressive so the sperm isn't in the
testicles and it comes up through I'm
guess these little tubes and down the
thing and somehow it gets shot out of
the penis out of the penis tubes into
various parts of wherever that penis may
be the balls tip that little like veiny
thing right below the head behind the
penis oh the head I know that one maybe
the Gooch is also sensitive or maybe
it's just like psychologically sensitive
I'm clear circumcision I think is when
there's like an extra flap of skin I
don't know what the scientific term for
it is and it's removed with a scalpel
and they cut off from like here to right
here then this is all nice and taut I
learned in Australia that mostly only
Americans do circumcision is it on here
if I spoke Latin I feel like I would
know up here maybe this it's like the
fallopian tubes of the man I think it's
the tube that goes through the penis
where the sperm travels but now yeah I'm
gonna go with that I assume it feels
like all of your thoughts become like
vessels on the blood that drains down to
your penis
maybe it's similar to like if you really
had to sneeze a clitoris that's just
working really hard yeah I don't know
what an erection feels like I don't
think even they really know
oh boy am i biology just would be really
sad right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
