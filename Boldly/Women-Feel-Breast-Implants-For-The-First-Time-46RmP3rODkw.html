like breast implants
it's a woman's discretion if she wants
them get them if she doesn't don't get I
think that breast implants are
unnecessary unless you're a cancer
survivor and you want that form back I
have a friend who got breast implants in
one pot oh god I don't think it's any
different than you know putting on
makeup or you know changing the way you
do your hair
I imagine that they feel either like
jellyfish or balloons filled with
pudding well I'm excited to feel them
yeah the bigger the better right whoa I
didn't expect it to be like watery yeah
doesn't have any give the way a booth
and a normal boob does it's more like
tension I feel like I need to like
compare I'm not gonna touch my boobs now
this doesn't feel like a Bluebell what
does this whole thing go in there it's
like a complete built-in stressful and
like I do not have ass all the way
you're sure yeah having a bad day this
is like a waterbed boob it's a little
water but for a mouse but let's see if
it rested on me it's like that doesn't
really have skin on top so you have to
think of like this like here put it over
do you think it floats oh look she's
super buoyant and water right this could
beYOU could save life
hahahaha cute that is this is a silky
breast one thing I like to do a lot is
to like squeeze through really tight
doors right I'm like what if like I had
a titty and like I could flatten with me
and I could just shimmy this looks like
Purell in a plastic bag the best part
about that it's like it snaps right back
fake boobs are often just like floating
but if this feels like it would be more
natural cuz it's like slumpy what this
feels like an 80 year old woman's bro
you know when they say like pancake
nipples they all just feel like cool
toys and I can't imagine just putting
that in your body if you just like cut
the skin yes like a little like a titty
tuck I think like it would be better
this today is so flat it's like pizza
I'm not super far off with balloon full
of pudding I don't even know what I
would do and jogging wait wait that
actually feels it real in your body this
would probably be like a seed if you had
nothing else they were fairly soft and
realistic they're heavy
yeah I would be nervous you'd have to
get like an extra sports bra for that
and I was also surprised that all three
were so different I'd like to know you
know why you would gravitate towards one
over the other don't let society
pressure you to change who you are
because you know who you are is pretty
pretty cool oh my god what happens if
you get snapping the grass that could
actually save you though if it pops the
boob before it reaches your heart
now I want breast implants okay like it
kicks I get fat safety precaution it
really is and then like what it's like
they stab you and like and then just
project out oh my god can we fill them
with like pepper spray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
