hufflepuff and Slytherin maybe
Hufflepuff by day Slytherin if you if
you cross me if you wronged me
today we're getting Harry Potter
inspired makeup looks I love Harry
Potter very much I don't claim to be a
Potter lover because I know that I can't
assume that name I haven't earned that
but I'm just I'm around the pot Ernest I
I've been known to write some fanfiction
Sirius Black had a daughter and I named
her scarlet black and I would often
roleplay a scarlet black chunks can
basically just magic makeup onto her
face right I can only assume that you
had the makeup product but you didn't
have to worry about a perfect
application because you just be like lip
Lyda cos I feel like I've lived with
this book series for a really long time
and I think it's time for me to fully
lose myself to complete in total nerd
dumb weight powerhouse to baby ravenclaw
as I get older I'm a lot more Slytherin
I think I'm like a little Slytherin I
think my general nature tends to be more
Hufflepuff their courageous right there
know for being courageous
that's sweater I have never been
diagnosed by a Harry Potter professional
before so I guess it's probably time for
me to really get myself in line we all
know that the only true definitive
sorting is given by the sorting hat so
whatever happens here is really just
secondary one of your housemates has
cheated in a hogwarts exam by using a
self spelling quill I actually did this
once in real life where I found out
someone was cheating on a test and I
told on them oh if you could have any
power which would you choose
power speak to animals hands down
forests or river don't most forests have
a little bit of a river which of the
following would you most hate people to
call you ordinary ignorant cowardly
selfish not gonna say which one oh okay
I got it I am apparently a ravenclaw yes
Oh in a turn of events
are you ready to see this yeah I'm
Gryffindor these days I do I feel like
my recessive trait is more Slytherin so
I think I'm gonna get a Griffin a
slither door look something reddish and
greenish and goldish silver ish I'm just
gonna look like a Christmas tree it's
office 100% Raven claw she's very
analytical assesses the situation
doesn't go into anything blind and knows
all the details obviously through our
ladylike videos you can tell that Soph
is very smart but she's intelligent in
like a oh I didn't even think of that
kind of with I think Chantal is like
warm and loyal but I think you have to
earn it
well she's take no prisoners she gets
stuff done but like for the people who
she loves it's like all hugs all day
24/7 hug machines I know that Chantal is
kind of a fan of the story so I feel
like whatever she gets her makeup will
be kind of like a classic reflection of
the book I think Devon is primary
Gryffindor devon has interests in like
sort of like mystical and supernatural
knowledge but I think that Devon is also
very interested in like what is good and
right which is a Gryffindor trait I
think Kristen is very witty and she's
got the right amount of cynicism but I
think Kristen's got some slurring in her
as well she's a ravenclaw wears glasses
I feel like that has to be some sort of
requirement for a ravenclaw I'm really
excited to see what I look like so we're
gonna see how this glitterin this
Gryffindor Slytherin look panned out I
feel like Krystal did a really great job
she kept making noises and I think they
were positive noises I am so ready to
see I feel like a Gryffindor oh my
goodness
it's so dramatic I like that like it has
the bronze from ravenclaw and not the
blue I feel like the Blues kind of
expected but the bronze is like one of
their colors that we don't think about
that much Oh
I would have never thought to be like
put dramatic red and gold under my eyes
but it looks so good oh my eyes are
about to take flight wow I've never had
such a golden eye before I love it I
feel like the crest itself I feel like
the crest of Ravenclaw
came to life on my face this makeup
actually makes me feel magical oh it's
nice it kind of takes like a thing that
I kind of felt like was really nerdy in
high school and gives it a very adult
edge
it looks strong in fierce but it's not
too overstated Harry Potter makeup lady
tested Lady a broom I had a great time I
sat here and got my makeup done and
talked about Harry Potter for about 45
minutes and that's really all that I
needed to do today hey click on that
post over there see more videos from our
channel some of our favorites are in
there and some we like just okay but
watch anyway because he loves me
yeah yeah sleeping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
