don't know today we're getting
photoshopped into our ideal body type
I've always been battling this idea that
if I was skinnier if I looked exactly
the way I wanted to look then so many of
my problems would go away and I would
just be happier I don't think that's the
way it works but it'd be nice to test it
out I think I'm really nervous to get
photoshopped I think it'll be scary to
kind of see a direct representation of
my own body insecurities so back in the
day when I would scroll through
Instagram when I just started looking at
fitness models and getting into that
lifestyle I would constantly think why
can't I look like that I've always
wondered how I would look with the
six-pack I feel like I have so much
extra fats covering everything I love I
work with food I would love to see
myself generally just smaller smaller
arms I don't have really big boobs and
then like everything down kind of goes
outward and I would like for it to be
more like this I want to take on this
challenge because when you have
insecurities about your body they kind
of take over every facet of your life
and the sooner I'm able to kind of face
those insecurities and work through them
the student will be able to live happily
and I love my body I feel like I carry
more fat and so that's always been
something that I've struggled with and
so when I think about photoshopping
myself I would be skinnier it feels so
weird to pose I would definitely love to
gain closure by doing this I would just
I would just love to see what it would
look like but there is a chance that I
look at anything
 why can't they look like that
I'm really nervous I'm really afraid
that I'm gonna see this and say yes I
want to look like this snapchat filter I
think I'm most scared of really liking
the photo and then feeling bad about
myself excited at the same time it's
almost like seeing everything I ever
wanted to see in myself at one point oh
wow
I like it yeah I do feel a little shame
for liking it I don't think it's
unhealthy to prefer an image of yourself
that's different than what you currently
are I had a nose job I didn't like the
way that my nose looked and why should I
feel ashamed that I would like to be a
little thinner crazy
I think these images are so damaging
because right away you feel like is this
what I should look like and the more I
look at it the more I realized like this
isn't how people are proportioned I need
to take that and be happy with who I am
and love my body for what it is this is
crazy a couple inches added to my calves
and then like a lift to my delts you're
like looking at this it's actually
really awesome this is cool if it could
be like this but even if it can't be
like this I will work really hard to be
my best self whatever that may be it's
important to never compare yourself to
other girls who you see because they're
not you and you're not them with
technology Photoshop has become so
common and so normalized and I think
those images are really toxic they make
people feel bad about themselves and
they make people feel like they should
be striving for this kind of body type
that isn't actually real at all I used
to cut out those Victoria's Secret Angel
magazines I would constantly look at
them and think why can't I look that
like that and I was miserable and I was
always hungry and I was so weak and I've
never never
myself poke down that path yet seeing
this picture has reminded me I do like
eating healthy and working out neither
of which I've been doing lately and to a
certain extent this is possible it just
requires some more attention and healthy
eating and that's not a bad thing I want
to like myself when I look in the mirror
and I do right now
and after you hate yourself for that
long it's so important to shift into
actually loving yourself
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
