for our own suits where ladies so if I
kind of border on this weird line
between tomboy and femme I mean I still
have curves they still exist and it's
actually really hard to find masculine
suits that fit women's bodies it's hard
out here I have an eye ass at a lot of
stuff there was probably a time maybe
like a year or two ago where I felt
totally comfortable and like myself in a
dress but I don't know if that's the
case anymore so we're here at sharp so
dang Antonian Leon are going to help us
get fitted for our suits hi my name is
Leon Wu I'm the founder and CEO of
sharpshooting and here we do suits and
luxury wear for people no matter how you
identify I am really excited to work
with the four people they seem to
identify diversely and we're gonna put
together a look that's gonna match their
personality in their style tell me a
little bit about what you're looking for
in a suit I'm not looking for such a
butch look that I could shop in like a
men's section say but I have a lot of
issues in like women's sections what it
sounds like is important to you is that
it looks feminine but not currently yeah
as a bisexual woman in a heterosexual
relationship like I still want to be
able to go out and like have my
boyfriend think I'm hot I would dress
really feminine cuz I had to pass cuz I
was like closeted figuring out not
having to pass now is really interesting
also a big thing for me is like I don't
like being uncomfortable I think I've
always been self-conscious of my hips
that's always been a thing where I've
tried to make myself seem a little more
but straight hah I think I'm looking for
a state toilet okay Oh BAM a long jacket
almost like trench-coated okay I think
I'm preferring it to be like red
especially since we are going along
something that's one button that button
is pretty low or accentuate that long
line because you already have a long
jacket I think today was a perfect
example of everyone's individual style
and that's exactly what we do here is we
fit you okay so it's been a few weeks
our suits have been tailored and now
they're here I feel like all of us have
in our minds what
think we look like in suits and I'm
worried that that's just going to be
shattered today these bitches better
bring confidence because that's what
we're here for
I'm ready for them to work it and they
need to be ready to work it to like a
model
so it can see we went with a navy blue
color the cut that we chose is a very
straight cut so when we descent the
round areas that's how we can get a more
masculine look when it's not hugging the
curves but more just draping easily on
the body all right I feel like I look
like Tegan and Sara right now but in a
really really awesome suit and kind of
like a Superman suit this suit is
perfect for me
every time I've searched for a suit I've
always felt a little intimidated
especially at department stores they're
never my size so this is kind of a dream
come true I feel so good right now
Jordan said that she wanted something
not only feminine but sexy so we went
with a wine colored fabric we went above
the ankle emphasized the feminine and
really show off heel the jackets a
little bit looser so we wanted to make
sure that it draped really well oh
oh man I wasn't expecting to look this
good oh my gosh I love it I had this
image in my head and I think we nailed
it
so I'm really happy I think I achieved a
happy medium today because I was always
nervous about trying to wear a suit and
looking like a little boy I don't think
I look like a little boy today it's nice
to know that I can wear a suit and still
feel like myself and feel feminine and
look good
for Nikki we went with a simple style
that she could roll up her pants roll up
her sleeves detail that were very simple
a notch lapel wasn't too constricting so
that she could be a boss walk around but
still feel really comfortable oh my gosh
the suit is really comfortable really
perfect casual but like nice I feel
really good I feel like me I really love
like the casual comfortable look that we
could get even with like more formal
pieces this isn't what I expected I
would look like in a suit but I feel
like it's better because I look like me
and I feel like me and I feel
comfortable
for Jazmin we wanted to do a suit that
was as loud as a personality long jacket
with the peak lapel the red that we
chose is a bright red so it's not subtle
at all and I think it's a perfect color
for her personality oh this looks way
way better than I thought it was gonna
look I'm not gonna lie and the pants and
they go down past my ankles and I really
love the length I love this color I love
it all
I feel great for the body type that I
have you just learned that some clothes
are gonna work out for you most of them
are gonna work out for you and the fact
that I am putting this on and everything
fits perfectly is incredible this is
better than how I saw myself which is a
lot because I never think that way this
whole process was really cool being able
to be here with sharp and feeling
comfortable with myself just made this
experience really amazing Tony was
really great about listening to us and I
think each style is so tailored towards
each person's personality so it really
brings out the best in each of us I
think it's hard as a woman to try and
find a suit that you feel comfortable in
so being able to find something that
fits my body type is like a gift this
whole process was really exciting having
something work the first time was just
insane to me it's such a great feeling
it's what I've hoped every shopping trip
would be all in one Oh
do the crazy again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
