- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- Daisun's had a beard on and off.
- Yeah, never seen him without it though.
- Sexy to look at.
- You know you're kissing a
man when you feel their beard.
- But sometimes, it gets a little itchy.
- You get a red mustache on your face
because of your boyfriend's beard.
- Like if we're kissing
really close for a while,
I end up getting chafed.
- Those little hairs that
go inside, that bothers me.
- I want him to go through
the pain that I go through.
- Ohhh
- Oh my god, it feels
like a dog or something.
- That itches.
- How do I look so far? Do I look hot?
I got like four brothers
and I have my dad,
so when they got their facial
hair, I was like where's mine?
- It's pretty itchy.
- All I want to do is this.
- I've never had scissors
so close to my mouth.
- The mustache I feel
looks really badass, right?
- Oh my god!
- I look like Bret Michaels.
- Oh your mustache is coming off again.
(upbeat music)
- The main reason I stopped shaving is
just cuz it's such a pain in the ass.
- It's been about two
months since I've shaved.
So I've gotten kind of accustomed
to having clothing on my face.
- I feel like I look like
I'm in high school again.
- Ahhhh!
- Oh my god, this is horrible.
This is I don't!
And it hurts when I laugh.
- Okay, so I look like my little brother.
- If I only look like
this, it's really hot.
- I look hot, I feel
like if I shave my head.
- Yeah, I could go like a man bun.
- I am the Lorax and
I speak for the trees.
You promise you won't break up with me?
Give me your hand.
- Okay.
- Sup?
- What?
- Oh my god!
- No!
Oh I hate it!
Oh my god.
- Okay this is strange.
Yeah, that's weird.
- You look like my uncle.
- This is very strange.
Can you speak with a low voice?
No, don't do that.
- You almost look like a lion.
- Your eyes are still really pretty.
- Isn't that nice?
That's nice, right?
- Just like pet it gently.
- Look at that!
- We should kiss now.
- So who's supposed to
lead in this situation?
- Where are your lips at?
- Way down here.
- Oh okay.
- Kiss me!
- Oh that's weird.
Ohhh.
- It is really hard to find the lips
with the mustache in the way.
Yeah, it just tickles right
there, I don't like it.
- Careful.
How's it taste?
- I've got hair in my mouth.
It's interesting, cuz like do
you get hair in your mouth?
- Yeah, sometimes, yeah.
- That must suck.
- When you are like this and
then somebody goes like this.
How does it feel, awful right?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.
- It was all in my lips and it got in my
mouth while I was trying to kiss her.
- Maybe I'll trim mine,
I'll trim mine yeah.
- I will definitely start
conditioning my beard.
- You wanna kiss me again?
(upbeat music)
- What do you think about boobs and beard?
- I don't know, I'm just really confused.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
