brows I'm super excited to makeover the
girls today and show them some beauty
tricks on how to fill in the brows the
right way
peeling hair and possibly skin kind of
scares me one of my favorite Pretty
Little Liars stars Jay Mitchell goes to
Kelly to get in her brows dad why today
well I heard she's the best so why am I
gonna let some other person do it when
cheek is the Queen everyone at work was
making fun of me they're like are you
gonna start crying right now out of
happiness I totally trust Kelly 100%
this is my first time ever doing
anything to my eyebrows well they are
beautiful eyebrows we're just gonna
clean them up a tiny bit and I'm gonna
be even more pretty so it looks like
they're kind of shaped a little bit
already yeah the last time I went was
like a few weeks ago I'm away back check
out your brows and let's see what we
need to do to you
well it's like going to the dentist so
I'm gonna go ahead and start off by
trimming them trimming is definitely
something you should leave to a
professional trimming is very hard to do
on yourself the waxing just feels you
know obviously it's a little warm and
then it's just gonna feel like a
band-aid how hot is like snot hocks okay
don't be scared yeah I run a little cold
so it's nice to have it my form how's
that oh it radiates a bit of heat one
two three oh okay
my sunburn hurts more than that there
garlic so good a lot happening guys I
can already feel it so I always wax
first because it gets any of the baby
hairs and then the tweezing we go in and
find two and after so I'm gonna go ahead
and put some makeup on you we're going
to use the highlighter right underneath
the brow all the way across and this is
going to brighten and lift your brow
proper tools definitely make a big
difference in filling in your brows and
make them look natural it really just
gives it such a nice polished look my
clients love it they've nicknamed it's a
magic stick it's very very soft and easy
to do we're going to fill right inside
of that little spot and all along the
line of the highlighter we just drew
again we want to make them look like
they're your brows and we're just
enhancing your brow shape for the key to
filling in your brows is just
remembering less is more
hey ready are you ready already yes oh
my gosh whoa you look even cool huh
yes oh my god they look amazing whoa I
looking at different person that's a
happy face we'd love to have a face I
feel like I'm a woman now because I love
them thank you so much gorgeous so I
just got my brows done and I'm a plus
with them it was awesome it was relaxing
it was nice I feel like I look like an
adult woman definitely as warm as I
thought it was gonna be but I mean it
just it felt really nice I've had so
many different things done to my brows
by so many different people throughout
my life and no one has ever given me
like an ounce of the attention to detail
that she gave me was amazing as magic
Thank You Kelly that was so amazing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
