sometimes their full branches but how
are you supposed to know which brows are
right for you so today we're having an
expert give us our ideal brow shape
it's ladylike and today we're getting
brow makeovers my relationship with my
brows is long and storied I feel like my
brows are like two children I neglect I
do love myself but my brows you know I
go up and down about them I've just kind
of given up and let the brows have their
way and so mostly what I do now is just
tweeze right here and just hope for the
best on either side sometimes I'll stick
like a little bit of eye shadow in there
if I know I'm looking a serious Jam but
most of the time I just rely on my
glasses to do most of the face framing
for me my ideal brow is probably then
daya's I think that her brows are life I
think Priyanka Chopra has pretty awesome
brows it looks very polished without
looking fake I really love Jennifer
Lawrence's brows she has hooded eyes
like I do the diet I want your brows and
hopefully today homegirl can give me
your brows if we wax too much I might
ride hi I'm bitchy brows and I am a
makeup artist and licensed aesthetician
and I specialize in brow shaping today
we're going to teach the girls how to
shape their eyebrows right and we are
going to show them the perfect shape for
their face
what kind of brow shape are you looking
for my hairs are kind of long and I
think I look a little bit less clean
that I would like to at some times but I
don't want to look too done I basically
just want to enhance what I already have
I want them to like kind of hold up
their end of the face framing bargain my
only request is that I'm trying to grow
these little baby hairs right here so
just leave them let them live I've been
waiting for this day okay do you want to
lay it straight up like this and trim it
so it's just even in length just so they
lay correctly when you wax them you
don't want to pull any hairs that are
out of line so we're gonna always start
here at the enterance corner of your
nose and then from the bottom of your
nostril across your iris and that's
where you really begin to kind of soften
the shape as well
all right oh twacks going on
who
but also all gamma baby beautiful man
I'm a beautiful baby
hmm that was very quick
I feel like I need a sticker you get
good I like to do it's just always kind
of weave it through not necessarily do a
hard line not making them too round just
following them inside the hairline oh my
god oh wow
I don't really know how to describe it
but I just want to call them 3d oh my
god they look great oh this looks so
nice right here yeah I can see this brow
bone you don't have to remove all the
brow hairs I get an extreme arch to have
your brow shape I think that if you gave
me more of an arch I would be weirded
out by myself I think I still look like
myself which is what I want I love them
these are like the best I've ever had I
had eyebrows for basically my entire
life
I feel really great especially since I
have a date tonight and my brows look
amazing I think that this is a happy
medium between soft and Priyanka I
didn't think that my eyebrows could be
this full or like the arch in this way
you shouldn't try and be some brows
you're not you should be your own brows
but you can clean them a little bit and
just make them look a little nice brow
transformation lady tested lady obsessed
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
