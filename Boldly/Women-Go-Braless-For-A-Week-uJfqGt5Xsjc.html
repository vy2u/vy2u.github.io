I'm not gonna wear a bra for a week not
gonna wear a bra somehow going to be
braless one of my favorite things to do
kevin wearing a bra for like 15 years
I like bras I like wearing them I think
they're comfortable I'm actually
terrified of this week of not wearing a
bra they're a lot bigger than they
normally are because I am currently
nursing I had smaller boobs I would
never wear a bra I like to pick clothes
where I do not have to wear a bra I work
out six days a week sometimes twice a
day going without a bra I'm going to
feel very exposed just like going up and
down the stairs for me without a bra is
an event this is with a bra how much
we're moving better for everybody if I
wear sports bras I take it off oh I'm
kind of sweaty right now so it's a
little hard
I feel the boob sweat already it's hot
outside hey hey a little less perky
already my nipples are like shooting out
through my dress right now this is very
comfortable for me I'm having the time
of my life ah I really hate you for
making me do this
about 20 minutes in I went to go pump
and just thinking about pumping caused
this to happen
I started leaking I'm mortified all of
my shirts seem to be sheer and white and
not good to go to work in without a bra
we've got white linen we've got
see-through lace more lace every morning
I have left the house with that feeling
like I'm forgetting something like put
on my bra it's actually quite difficult
going through my closet I realize I have
a lot of thin fabrics nothing that
screams don't look at my nipples so I'm
walking by and I'm like hey Quinta you
live in free and I'm not I just
completely forgot to not wear a bra
today so I'm not to take you up living
free I feel good now embrace me Sara am
I allowed to wear bras when I work out
oh yeah you I'm gonna wear oh I just got
home from spinning without a bra on and
it was definitely distracting to have my
boobs jiggling and sweating all over the
place maybe that's what this is all
about like feeling my boobs experiencing
them in a new way so I heard Hillary
went to a spin class braless and props
to her but I'm going to show you why I'm
refusing to workout without his fourth
bra on
I'm very mobile in the gym I'm like
constantly moving around sometimes I'm
upside-down I'm swinging around I'm like
lifting weights I'm sorry that I didn't
try it but I didn't want to flash my
whole gym so this is a nightgown I'm
like having to tap into clothes that I
didn't know existed because this has
like two layers one breast is up there
the other one is down there maybe they
are weird and misshapen in real life but
I never knew because I was always
wearing a bra oh my god I think it made
me more confident to be able to have a
meeting in front of
men with no bra and that was something I
was uncomfortable with before now I
think I could probably tackle like a
room full of men in my mind I'm like I
bet you everybody knows I'm not wearing
a bra I'm probably nobody knows that no
idea you probably also haven't just been
checking out my racks yeah everybody who
I've mentioned it to is like ya know I
have eyes the overall experience was
great I love not wearing a bra and I
still love not wearing a bra I wasn't as
self-conscious as I thought I was gonna
be I thought I was gonna be like super
paranoid I was interviewing somebody and
I looked down and like just full
cleavage and that's not something that I
feel comfortable with I'm still having
trouble reconciling my nipple is food
for my child and then when I leave my
house my nipple is sexual and something
very provocative my nipples turns out
are generally hard and like there were
times when I was like I could cut
diamonds right now and I hope nobody
notices I would love to get to a point
where it's very comfortable if any woman
just decided any day that she didn't
wanna wear a bra maybe I'll go to the
grocery store with my tits out maybe not
like who knows I still like bras a lot I
still find my bras comfortable I still
enjoy wearing them and it's not always
this big revelation it's just simple
liberation or I just feel good about my
body that is mine
