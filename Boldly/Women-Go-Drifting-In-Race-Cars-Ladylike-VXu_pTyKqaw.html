like a gunshot that doesn't sound like
it's supposed to happen
it's ladylike and today we're going
drifting today we're doing DIY makeup no
I'm not little juice thing you wanted
it's drifting like in Fast and the
Furious you go sideways and stuff like
racing I'm just here Chantal said let's
go and I'm going I think drifting is
like hard to control the car right like
fast in the Furious it's kids Michelle
Rodriquez Vindi ezel Tyrese
you forgot about Tyrese didn't you so
instead of like slowing and turning
you're just gifted mom confession time I
am actually pretty scared to do this but
since I'm making Freddy and Sofia do it
with me I am going to put on a strong
face and hold it down for the children
it would be cool if my mom doesn't see
this though Freddy and Sofia don't
really know what's happening so we're
doing it we are here today in Long Beach
at the Grand Prix for Formula Drift
doing ride-along
yeah we thought we were ready we're not
I have none
are essentially it's a slot car they can
buy from the dealership and it's it's
modified to be a race car we are high
sports power stock body cars in the
world
we have no limitations on what type of
engines you can you can use and so we
range anywhere from a 4 cylinder to 12
cylinder anywhere from 800 to 1200
horsepower today
all the smoke is watching the cars be
like 10 centimeters away from hitting
the side of the wall and just tariffs
like what is this where are we guys
bunker fall off and he just kept on
going so I'm pretty scared from that
because every run is action pack our
judges asked drivers to do really
intense things like get as close to a
certain part of the track which means
getting close to a concrete barrier we
don't know if that jack but it looks
like they're going about 275 miles round
yes not close to 80 I mean all the smoke
all the popping like everything is very
overwhelming your pompous wedding I'm so
sound the gunshots man yeah you know
woman up that life grab life by the
ovaries I'm texting Tyler to pray for me
- right and getting in that car this is
like getting super real
horoscope is like in my eyes I didn't
know what was gonna
yet how you would be addicted
come on come on man what a rush so
disoriented my body's taking I know
I would never choose to do this just
like on my own so I think it's cool that
like we got this opportunities just like
be in the space in an environment and
actually glide along with professionals
like that was crazy it did feel a little
bit like Disneyland Rajai thought it
might but I mean Disneyland on crack but
it was great that was the biggest
adrenaline rush I might have ever had in
my life after my body has calmed down
and I've had a chance to reflect on the
recent activity I'm really happy that we
did this I feel really kind of like
empowered I also really like that a lot
of the drivers seemed on the older side
so it makes me think like after I've
like had a few kids you know like Lane
Mike laid down my roots I could maybe do
this later on in life when you're empty
nester that's when I'll be back here
I consider doing it again yeah guys
consider it even Fred a changed woman
so Formula Drift ladylike ladylike
lady love it lady almost poops
I'm glad you didn't poop pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
