this is what I did today
we are going to be free bleeding that
means we're not going to be using any
period products at all we're just gonna
let it all out and everyone's gonna be
there for it if I couldn't have any
period products I know that my period
would be so messy
whenever you're caught in the situation
without a period product it's always
just like a feeling of panic getting a
period is hard enough even with all the
tools I have at my disposal we're going
to be kind of exploring what that means
did not have period products my period
lasts for seven whole days it's usually
the first three days or like what's up
lately I've just been using a deeper cut
I'm a tampon girl I use extra super
absorbent tampons extra super absorbent
pads I also have decently bad cramps so
I'm oftentimes popping ibuprofen of some
kind or another I don't know if I'm more
nervous for the questions people are
going to ask or the questions that
people are not going to ask like what
are they gonna think so many people have
like a visceral like disgusted reaction
when it comes to periods the much cuter
when they're you know actually being
used for an adorable little puppy rather
than my personal external diaper
you know how in like pad commercials
they use blue liquid instead of red
blood it's not gonna be blue it's just
because they knew it came from our
vaginas
I'm an Alaska and I'm Margo Lane and
were the cofounders of conscious period
a conscious period for every box of
organic tampons we sell we give back to
women who are living in homelessness
right here in the United States
twenty six point four million women of
menstruating age depend on food stamps
in the United States and because
government assistance programs like food
stamps don't cover period products about
twenty six and a half million women have
a hard time affording these essential
items tampons are taxed as non necessary
or luxury goods in 38 states out of the
50 states in the United States then
there's also sort of extra tax on
tampons in other countries as well
obviously these products are necessary
and they are absolutely not a luxury
honestly I think that you will get a
really positive response I think that
people will definitely be maybe a little
weirded out and curious for sure all of
those things like are a little bit
uncomfortable for a lot of people but
when you start highlighting it it
creates so much room for increased
understanding and awareness and it's
just like we think it's so cool
so it's about 10:00 p.m. on a Thursday
and I just got my period surprised that
means that tomorrow Friday morning / the
rest of Friday I'll be free bleeding I'm
mostly just nervous and I'm mostly just
feeling that kind of like pit of dread
in my stomach like oh god you actually
have to do this now
okay so it's morning one of free
bleeding today is gonna be weird
I chose something more full-coverage
just just for the heck of it it's kind
of like choosing the soldiers that would
go with you to defend Sparta against the
Persians they're sure to die but you
need your best men every time I've ever
leaked through my pants or anything like
that I have spent the rest of the day
incredibly embarrassed so I'm trying to
know that like I can do this and I won't
want to crawl into a hole you've arrived
at work I'll put down my puppy pad ready
to get some blood go in here if your
period is anything like mine day two is
the absolute worst it's gonna be a day
it's also raining today but I assure you
that water will not be the only thing
that's flowing okay so I'm at the office
got my legging and got my free bleeding
going I took a shower this morning and
it kind of stopped so we gotta wait for
to kick back in and the trickle has
started we haven't hit pad yet but I
feel coming hey it's about 11:30 I've
been checking there's still nothing on
the pad I just went to the bathroom and
my underwear is putting up its most
valiant effort my underwear is
absolutely stained Devin synched up with
me she's also on her period and I'm
ready to Tampa it's Nikki Nikki are you
excited that I'm free bleeding today
it's really weirding me out a little bit
actually that's actually why she came
over it draws women to me there's been
two hours and 10 minutes and we already
made it through this is what day two of
my beer
looks like I just rode in two overs on
my way to check out apartments and
luckily I did not stain the seats the
ubers were driving and I was just like
oh my god please no no no no we're in a
meeting right now I have a blood sure my
pants yet but I brought a pad just in
case just to be seated here very nice
chairs yeah you can see a ring honestly
it's like with every step I just feel it
all in there okay so it's about 3 p.m.
and I have officially hit the pad
Richmond is all our glory I would say
the worst part is the smell I decided to
go for a little walk because the stench
was sort of appearing is what I'd say so
I just needed a sort of walk around see
if I can air it out
the only problem about that is standing
up it's actually activated the bleeding
a little bit more I'm have to do post
interviews I will bleed through as I
already have so we're just taking
pre-emptive measures nice and settled in
Oh
Wow it's beautiful it is a lot like a
Rorschach test yeah what do you guys see
it it I see a power moon I see you
vagina I see a peach well I'm glad that
we made it there's three things I've put
on so far my underwear the chair and the
dress and my thighs of course my thighs
are very sticky right now it's crazy to
I how much blood I'm just producing
while sitting next to me all day
I've just been like aware of it but not
baby thank you sure I have to leave work
now and then go meet with a realtor and
I'm just hoping that there's nothing
weird there's no visible smells and that
everything is okay
but we'll see so I'm heading home
weirdly walking is like way more
comfortable that's sitting for me for
some reason walking I'm like oh I can
move around and kind of get experiment
is incubating I lucked out
my roommate ran and talked to the
realtor so I didn't have to do anything
I'm really I don't I don't feel good I
feel really embarrassed talking to
people I was in this car and I could
smell my period and I know that it's a
small car and it was just seeping and
it's cold so I couldn't the windows down
okay so we just went to dinner
he sat outside so we could sit on the
metal chairs yeah so wouldn't shun the
metal chairs it was like you know you're
not gonna ruin it because I didn't
really want to lay a huffy pad out when
we were at the restaurant I draw
attention to it yeah exactly
also cuz they've been like what are you
doing you're like oh I am I I've really
taken one period this is the aftermath
of my free bleeding wow that this was
just a pair of cheap underwear that
about to bleed in but makes me wonder if
it was you know Stefan cared about
usually I don't shower at night but with
the whole bleeding thing there's like
blood all over my upper thighs so got a
shower because I feel pretty gross this
is the dog test to see if the dogs
notice that it
different Oh Atticus mouse there's
something down there
it's my endometrium lining rest in peace
young boy shorts they did good work
today I free blood for a day and it was
squishy a little smelly revealing it was
pretty rank for sure I guess I'm just so
used to taking care of it and just sort
of like sweeping it under the rug I
haven't really like looked my period in
the face for like eight years
articles of clothing donated to the free
bleeding cause this thing I've been
taught to kind of like keep under wraps
and to not talk about and to not even
acknowledge was now just so clear and so
present and that's like so good stigma
around it because it's something that
happens so naturally that you can't
control you can't stop it no matter what
people were more compassionate about it
that I expected like people were like oh
I feel like it's okay like you know cuz
I would apologize I'd be like I'm sorry
if I smell just pee reading everywhere
and people were generally pretty
understanding I mean it's like an odd
thing to do at a workplace you know we
know this there's some blood in my
shorts there's blood and assurance the
funny thing is I was talking to
Chantelle about her free bleeding day
and I realized that we both skipped
lunch that day I'm just gonna keep to
myself and wait until I get home to
figure out something to eat it was just
like little changes like that where I
was just feeling like a little bit more
self-conscious just a little bit less
likely to say hello or talk to someone
and a little bit less of myself I also
realized I never put on makeup today and
I feel like I thought they were
no use I'm already free bleeding so I
might as well not put on makeup I think
I kind of spent the day trying to change
my frame of mind from like oh this is
blood and that's gross - oh this is
something that is the most natural thing
for my body to be doing that was vagina
I did that would I free bleed again
probably not just to do it I don't think
I would do it again if I had a choice
but I'm glad I did it I think it gave me
a lot to think about it is hard it makes
it hard to live life to go certain
places is it comfortable as it was for
me to do this for one day the other side
of that is okay like you have the days
over so now what am I going to do
because this is the reality for a lot of
people thank you so much for watching
