I have had the hairiest face since
childhood I grow facial hair like all
three that have lovely little trinkets
of hair sticking out like a little go
every time someone says anything nice to
me if they ever say anything nice to me
it's about my brows to just let them go
free is something that's just not gonna
work for me when I was younger I noticed
that people on TV didn't have as much
hair on their faces I did so that's when
I kind of thought that it wasn't normal
really woman with the unibrow is Frida
Kahlo and she's still called ugly I'm
hoping to gain some confidence in myself
I think it'll be nice to give my face a
break for like a month you like what you
see now give this a month I didn't
expect that no chin hair is already so
long you can kind of see that I'm gonna
be super hairy at the end of this month
I personally noticed like a lot of
growth
I'm getting really paired up so it's
been about a week since I've done this
challenge and already I have like just
hair
everywhere and I feel like everyone's
staring at my unibrow ah I have so much
hair it's driving me nuts it's not a lot
of hair on tape and personally I think
you can see it's really bothering me
there's a little bit of a unibrow going
in right there starting to merge this is
my worst nightmare
like I realized that this isn't that bad
but I feel super hideous I need to put
my brows so I just came back from my
interview I just kept thinking like what
if he notices how pushing my eyebrows
are and what if he just thinks I'm a
slob and I'm just lazy and he just
translates that into my work ethic and
you know it was just it was just too
much I mentioned it to my guy friend the
other day I was like hey everything on
BuzzFeed video he's like all cool what's
it about
bla bla bla facial hair
that's grouse about everything inside
world I think it's good to keep things
can save us for guys I rather be kissing
you and not flossing my teeth with your
beard I never want to do this again
I feel hideous I feel like a monster
right now not happy about this challenge
I might actually get them done today
because I just literally can't take it
anymore
you can't see it right you can't see it
I don't think you can see it I feel it
though I feel it I really want to take
it off ah oh I could totally see it now
usually I wasn't able to see oh my god
plucked a little bit like on the side
it's still left a little bit more hair
than I'm used to leaving I don't even
care that I pluck I'm a piece of
sorry I thought I'd be better at it I
thought like this is gonna be a really
great moment for me to like give zero
 but I never given more in my
life I think I would have been fine with
my facial hair I wasn't concerned with
other people's perspective of me I
didn't want to go outside my boyfriend
was coming in from out of town and I
just couldn't feel sexy I don't think it
was so much a beauty standard issue as
much as it was like a me issue the video
started getting more agitating I try to
put on makeup and you'd see like
whiskers at a point I was sitting in my
car and I was ripping up my own mustache
hair because it's making me paranoid I
had an interview this month and that was
I think the most nerve-wracking I had
ever been about my appearance I avoided
eye contact a lot during the interview
and I thought that really hurt my
chances spoiler it didn't but no one
said anything negative about them there
are a lot of people out there who either
aren't allowed or because of cultural
reasons they don't get to remove facial
hair hang in there we have to fight the
world as it is and the people in it we
shouldn't have to fight ourselves no
matter how minor it might be for someone
else it mattered to me if it matters to
you then it's important I think I like
the experience enough that I would
probably do it again for no-shave
November it's a good excuse to not groom
from
double doesn't hurt it just makes you
grow and grow stronger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
