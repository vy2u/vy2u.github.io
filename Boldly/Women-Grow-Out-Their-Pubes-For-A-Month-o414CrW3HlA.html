I'm excited
you
I probably started shaving around 1213
I've been shaving since I was 18 I've
just always been a bald eagle I've
shaved about every other day every two
to three weeks every other day I think I
got the message that there needed to be
a little landscaping down there probably
around college I remember like female
locker rooms everyone else had shaved
and I was like well maybe I should too
I got the period book from my dad when I
was in eighth grade this book showed you
different parts of female's body every
illustration didn't have use ever since
I saw that book
it was just like shaving was the thing
women did it was a sign of like
cleanliness in media when people would
make such a big deal about like oh you
see that blush and like making fun of it
as a woman it makes you feel like you
should get rid of it I just felt like
that was like what I had to do to be
sexy
I'm worried about whether or not I'm
going to feel sexy I also teach pole
dancing and I'm going to be turning the
lights down real low in my classes
I'm excited my girlfriend is up I'm in a
place right now where I need to like
find myself again and I think I'm gonna
find myself through my pubic hair I'm
performing in a pole dancing show
tonight where I have to dance on stage
wearing skivvies and I really afraid if
like it starts to peak out and today was
the first time I worked out I was
worried I was kind of like sweat more I
don't know smell worse or something like
that but honestly everything was okay I
feel this like really weird pressure to
tell someone that I'm hooking up with
that I'm growing it out so I just taught
class I gotta say the hair is like a
little out of control my close friends
I'll turn to my girlfriend be like and
how do you feel about this and what is
she gonna say no like I'm going to stop
hooking up with her for a month it's
your body you do what you want with it
shouldn't be in a relationship where I
need to tell you what you can and can't
do it
you sound like a record player from me I
know you don't like it admit it it's
awesome we are going to Disney World and
I will be rocking the full bush
with Mickey this is the American dream
half of me is like super excited and I'm
growing it out and then the other part
of me is just like get this off my body
I slept with someone and she told me
that my legs were stumbling and I said
excuse me
I'm growing out my vagina hair and she
said yeah yeah yeah sure but your legs
are stubbly so I got shame mmm we have
about a week left how do you feel about
it Kayleigh
we can't confess enough update the girl
apologize for calling my like stubbly my
vagina hair is longer and my hair on my
head
and I really love it actually kind of
digging in I used to shave like every
day and now I don't have to going into
this experience I really expected to
hate every minute of it but I didn't
having a full bush didn't hurt my sex
life I still had great sex this month my
experience this month was amazing I feel
like there is a huge expectation and
society for women to shave doing
whatever I wanted to do with my body I
felt really empowering it totally just
like looked different like I hardly
recognized her and it was really nice it
honestly made me feel more like a woman
now that I took it to the extreme
they'll be a lot more forgiving with
myself when it comes to shaving I'm
probably gonna clean it up a little bit
but other than that I am into rocking
the book I probably will go back to
shaving but that's just because I don't
know I don't really want to to be honest
I just feel like I have to I don't know
why this is interesting if you want to
shave that's cool if you don't don't
feel like you have to it doesn't make
you more or less beautiful just like
your own individual choice we've elected
a third bush
me they shaved and I won't say that I
miss it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
