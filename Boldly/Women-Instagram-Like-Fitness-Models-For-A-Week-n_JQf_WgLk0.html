rooms when I take pictures all of this
 is in the background and it's not
pretty I post on my Instagram oftentimes
once a day there are times when I like
look up hashtag Fitness on Instagram and
I see a bunch of people with their
coolest Fitness photos a little afraid
of like showing my body a time when you
put your body and yourself on social
media like people comment on it I really
want to encourage more body positivity
within myself and within my posts you
know like I'm really an average person
and so I just want to like be proud of
what I've got and Who I am rather than
like always feeling like I need to hide
it or just kind of like suck in when I'm
taking it so I'm gonna made our
Instagram fitness model she is going to
meet with me and tell me some challenges
that I'm gonna have to do throughout the
week hi my name is Anna Victoria I am a
certified personal trainer and the
creator of the Fit Body guides so
earlier this year I shared a photo of
myself and it was a split screen of me
sitting versus standing the reason why I
posted that is because I was feeling
pressure to be the perfect Instagram
fitness model and I I know that I'm not
I felt like I needed to share it to say
to myself you don't need to conform you
don't need to look perfect all the time
it's okay to be human and to accept
yourself and love yourself for who you
are and where you're at and I wanted to
put that out there to set that example
for all of my following are you wow you
are a hundred percent in Instagram okay
so there are going to be five challenges
day one you're gonna share a sweaty
selfie it can be like a mirror one or
you can hold the phone up whichever one
you're feeling at the time so these are
the poses I've been making when trying
to take this this fitness picture I've
been accentuating my body but the toilet
keeps getting in the way I get really
busy in the mornings and so I like to
workout at night but that doesn't really
work because when you want to take
pictures at night it just doesn't look
as good it really doesn't the last thing
you want to do after working out is take
a photo of your
so I'm sitting here just adjusting my
poses for the last several minutes and
my dogs over this it wasn't hard but it
was like mentally frustrating and a
comfortable for me day two the challenge
is you're gonna take a picture of
yourself doing something outdoors that
you like taking the freaking picture
with my dog was just way too hard I mean
I loved it because it was cute but every
other picture was my dog like licking my
face and everything like that and I
tried to make it cute but they all just
came out blurry today to was a little
bit of a struggle I couldn't find anyone
to take my photo because I couldn't take
a selfie and like include my dog in it I
finally tracked down what she agreed to
take a photo of me and Chuy like usual
my dog kept sitting down cuz it was a
photo so eventually we worked out a way
to make him look like he was going on a
walk but it was it was a bigger
challenge than I was anticipating to
just get that photo done third challenge
is going to be sharing a picture of you
working out with a friend and actually
that's gonna be us so we're gonna here
work out together yes so we're doing the
workout that's not super sweaty but
somewhere in the middle you know see
what she does behind the photos
obviously she takes these photos after
she works out and she looks great but I
don't think a lot of people realize that
a lot of work goes into what she does
and her look not only just posting
things on Instagram
keeping that image up and looking good I
think that a lot of work also goes into
keeping her Fitness up and just keeping
herself healthy and keeping herself
looking good so on day four I want you
to post a picture highlighting what part
of yourself that you loved that morning
I woke up in my ABS look nice and so I
thought this is the future I'm going to
show off today so I posted my photo
today and I actually got a lot of good
responses and I've actually had quite a
bit of good like vibes from the photos I
think like opening up these
conversations about health like physical
health and also other types of health
are always kind of a positive it makes
me uncomfortable to put myself out there
though every time I before I post a
photo I kind of just have to psych
myself up you know it's hard putting
your body and your fitness in your
health it's those are all very personal
thing
into a public space but once you do a
lot of other people like to open up
about about their health and their
fitness and their bodies and so I think
it's uncomfortable but a lot of the most
uncomfortable things are things that
make you vulnerable and things that help
other people feel more connected to you
so I had to do a little thinking with
this I wasn't completely sure what my
favorite part of my body was as I was
thinking about that I realized that it's
so much easier to find parts of your
body that you hate rather than finding
parts of your body that you like I think
that for a while I covered up my body
there at my life because I felt so
insecure about different parts of it I
felt insecure about being skinny I think
that using my Instagram as a way to
express myself but also reassure others
and let them know that I'm going through
the same things that they're going
through is really the best way to go
about it I think I really enjoy this
more when I am spreading a good message
and saying great things and kind of just
trying to uplift everyone else rather
than just showing off day five might be
a little hard it's my favorite and I
think it's the most important post of
the week I want you to share a relaxed
vs. post picture today I'm taking the
post versus non post photo and I'm
trying and the post photo went fine now
I'm trying to take the non post photo
and to be honest it's a little hard to
like not pose because I'm so used to
like knowing when my good angles are so
now I'm like having to think about do I
Duke the opposite do I like purposefully
just not like how do i how do you not
pose it was hard to be vulnerable and it
was also weirdly hard to know like how
to be natural and normal like what did
my what does my body look like when I'm
not posing so finally just not being
precious with it and letting it go and
being honest I got other people that
were also honest too and struggled with
similar things as me there were a couple
people that reached out that said I also
you know I'm working on my own fitness
and and deal with this too and this was
real actually really motivational or I'm
also really hard on myself it's really
important to be as authentic as you can
with your Instagram
you know I think that people see this
facade of you you know they don't really
see your chill out that Excel because
with Instagram you always want to put
your best face forward
sometimes the best face that you can put
out there is just the face that you have
I had a lot of ups and downs and I've
been really hard on myself and I
constantly always thought that I can't
post photos until I'm like perfect or I
can't post photos until I'm done and I
think it's important for everyone to
take the time to like learn how they
like their best self to like their you
don't have to wait to be someone else's
body and be someone else's perfect I
think that no matter what size you are
no matter what body type you are you can
be in a fitness model you know you can
share your self-love and inspire others
to do better and be better just by being
yourself
I felt really empowered this week and I
think it's just because I had to take
the time to appreciate what I liked
about my own body and myself what it
really is about is hard work and passion
and self-love and those are the things
that Anna taught me this week that I'll
definitely want to keep with me for the
rest of my fitness journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
