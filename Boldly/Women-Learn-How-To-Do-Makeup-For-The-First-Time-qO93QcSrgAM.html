my god
I really need this class because I think
I'm going to be doing my makeup for my
wedding I just love to learn how to have
more fun with my makeup I've always kind
of had like bad skin and mom was not
really good at makeup like we didn't
really do the girly things so I just
like never learned that kind of stuff I
was a tomboy growing up so I never
really cared about it
but now as an adult I just would like to
be able to do more than just like slap
some mascara on I don't know much about
makeup at all but I have gotten my
makeup done before and afterwards I felt
super confident so I think it would be
really empowering to be able to do that
myself
and to give myself that confidence hi
I'm deep again I am a youtuber and
beauty expert and I am so excited to be
here today to show these girls how easy
and fun makeup can be what is all this
stuff I'm excited but like a little
overwhelmed I don't know what any of
these I don't eat that are you excited
yes so we're starting with the contour
for the contour you want to focus on
sort of making a three shape on your
face using a shade of foundation bronzer
eyeshadow that's two to three shades
darker than your actual foundation color
my even one that's too darker is just
looking around
it looks dark right now you're gonna
find it oh but you're doing it in the
right spot it was I mean that's what we
connected is it no you are you are like
so what that does is if you connect at
the top it makes your forehead look
smaller okay so you're gonna be the
first to lead the blending right for me
wait I have a question yeah I'm ready
Timlin hey key here is dabbing instead
of swiping
you're gonna dab I look beautiful Jody
look Jonah
oh I can't believe we did it you did it
you did it okay so now to make the rest
of your face match like to do the brows
there's some like really easy DIY ways
to do it by using like a darker brown
eyeshadow and the key to filling in your
brows is really doing light feathery
strokes Jody yeah you can use the
spoolie on the other end to squeeze you
have smaller eyes and you want your eyes
look a little more big and like kind of
wide awake look
take the eyeliner and put it on your
actual lash line someone like me who has
really big ol eyes you want to take the
eyeliner and put it on the actual water
line which is the teardrop mark line
right here in your eyes sometimes I do
purple is that we're not it okay I
really like to focus on the ends of the
eyes rather than in the inside because
the inside of you guys if anything you
want to put a highlighter to get that
twinkle want to do the highlight on the
inside so you wanna do you use a spoolie
what I'm going to start by doing is
taking a lip liner that's two shades
roughly two shades darker than the
actual lip color that you're using so
the reason you want to use something
that's two shades darker than your
actual lip color is you're essentially
lip contouring and that contrasts
between those two shades is going to
create this kind of look of fuller lips
and just remember that the further out
you go from your actual lip line the
more dramatic lip look you're gonna get
which of these do I use these two and
that's eyeliner I'm just gonna keep it
like this signature love me Denis guys
I'm quitting my job we're going to the
runway it's about like how big you want
your lips to look oh wait guys you want
to know like the best dream for lipstick
everyone do a hook go like this huh and
you get all the sides so it doesn't get
on your teeth look that would have all
gone on your teeth
I can't I'm just like so obsessed with
how all of you look and I feel like it's
all like matches your personality so
thank you so much I feel like a million
bucks
so the brow moment for me was like the
best part of this okay be like these are
the brows I've always wanted like you
know you always feel good I feel great
I never ever wear lipstick and I never
thought that I like looked good in it
but I guess I was just doing it wrong
because how like I really dig in I never
had ever tried contouring in my life so
that was an experience after this I'm
feeling a lot more confident that I
could do my own makeup for my wedding
I just feel like so much more confident
being a woman and like being able to
control and take my beauty into my own
hands
don't try to mask the things that you're
not confident in try and like play up
the things that you are other people can
tell you you're beautiful other people
can tell you look good but when you feel
that way yourself and you feel like you
have achieved that on your own
that's so different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
