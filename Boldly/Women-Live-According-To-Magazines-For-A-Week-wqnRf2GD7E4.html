under a minute but when I was growing up
I feel like I looked to magazines to
teach me a lot about what it was
supposed to be doing as a teenage girl
it was sort of like this is the ideal
and if you can do these things and
you'll become the ideal I remember the
first time I ever learned about shaving
my legs and I remember reading a
Seventeen magazine article and like
having it like by the bathtub and be
like okay step one I'm really about
everybody being beautiful and I think we
should represent what millions of people
look like I have chronic pain not have
sex I don't have the ability to have sex
they don't have the ability to be
intimate in a way but these magazines
often talk about being intimate and for
a long time when I was growing up be in
the checkout line and I would see
Cosmopolitan 34 sex tips that you need
to use today it would remind me all over
again that I'm not the ideal woman
I'm hoping to maybe a wrote a little of
my cynicism and learn from them any
clothing tip that's like for real skinny
people is like probably not gonna look
good on me I am really bad at cooking so
that's gonna be shitty I also hate
working out so this is probably gonna be
hard I am on the floor of my apartment I
put a pillow down because I already feel
sorry for myself and luckily I have this
foam roller that I ordered on Amazon one
time I like 10:30 at night I'm going
into this as a person that never
works out and it's never open a shape
magazine until this week and literally
look here this magazine right now no
sick she's like doing a breakdance move
I attempted it though I was unsuccessful
not feel my left arm no idea if I'm
doing this correctly all I know is that
my hip hurts props to people who
can work out a loan at home and you
yourself or your only motivation because
I love having a trainer who tells me to
get my together taking pictures
when you're not a model or talks like
you feel like you just hate every single
one of them and you're trying to like
channel this inner fierceness but you
just come out looking really awkward oh
my god it took me two hours to
look like I am leaning against a
door look was just like someone in my
own closet but I did take the cosmic
advice for if is going out to a party
you should wear like a brighter fun
colored lip and I went with this like
dark blue screen and it was a hit
I mean sheep magazine right now and I
turned to this page and it's like I
I can't escape it like cosmopolitan sex
right on the cover shape supposed to be
about exercising or whatever being a
better person and here's a whole page
dedicated to sex so good I just feel
like it's not inclusive and ever fails
to make me feel a little bit stupid like
I feel embarrassed like I'm less of a
woman when I read the Cosmo sex tips in
high school it was like put an ice cube
on his wiener and it was like kind of
funny and I read them and I'm like it's
like tips for guys like to tell you to
stop jackhammering us are dudes just
this bad I don't know I'm so concerned I
spent some time doing my mint investing
app what's cool about it is that it like
tells you what you're spending your
money on too so I was like I post
mated the loss that's sweet and reading
Glamour just now I stumbled upon an
article that was talking about
suffragettes and the work that they've
done and it was showcasing Sojourner
Truth and other women of color and it
was just delightfully refreshing last
night when I set my alarm I had every
intention of waking up early this
morning putting on some nice magazine s
clothing but when I woke up it was
raining I was tired my stomach hurt I
feel like I've completely failed today I
don't even want to look at the magazines
because I can feel them judging me I
loving this lip color just loving this
look in general I have my two-tone
lipstick on and about to go out into the
world and see what happens you went to
different colors on your lip yeah do you
like it I'm kind of really a fan there's
a lot of compliments on this variation
of
a lot of people are like really loving
it just telling me I look really great
now that I've never put together myself
and I'm totally into it this is actually
how magazines should work like look to a
prince bow take what you have make it
your own
this week really made me appreciate the
small things that I can do for myself
the best thing was where you had to
recreate a look from the magazine
actually it's really good and I never
would have wanted out of it on my own I
definitely think I want to get more
women involved in investing I realize as
a twenty-something girl it was not at
the top of my list when I was growing up
it was all about like how you could
become thinner how you could please your
man and like ten ways to get beautiful
skin those are definitely still in there
but there was also stuff about ways to
stand up and advocate for yourself in
the workplace not only have women change
the things that were marketing towards
women are changing I know the editorial
is trying really hard to change but you
also have to change the ads too because
those are really what people see and
read and internalized please put more
black women and plus-sized women and
Asian women and Latinas and Indian women
and Native American women in your
magazines I want to buy clothes please
I'm really bad with my money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
