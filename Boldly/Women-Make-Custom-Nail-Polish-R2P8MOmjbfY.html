little published tonight
today we're making custom nail polish I
do like nail polish but tbh I don't wear
it that often because one I keep my
nails pretty short because I do stuff
with my hands and I like to play the
piano
I love nail polish so much I have
hundreds of colors I paint my nails
every single week I'm excited to make
like a fun color like I already do a lot
with my lips so I feel like I can do a
lot with my nails too I really want to
find that like one true wrong that I can
always wear I think it's super cool and
important to be able to make a custom
nail color so you can feel like it's a
part of your outfit that you customize
to that's so cool beautiful ooh
there's little pill capsules in here
mix and match two or more colors if you
wish so this is the mixer you have these
little removable tops done that's right
that's it baby you can put a q-tip in
this oh my god so give the children I
did I don't know which colors your
clothes affixed together like what's
that don't don't like blue and green
make purple no that's nice not sure
let's do this oh really
Eggman today holler run I am NOT this
messy I'm a person that's a primary
 blue
all right let's do it Wow
that's really good
you don't do that I feel like I'm making
science happen ha ha oh oh we lost the
stick that looks really good I love a
mint shade it's a pretty color red this
is magic let me murder two units cover
up the scene of the crime drip drop drip
drip buddy drop I hope it's like as
worldly and cool as it is in the bottle
beauty not the biggest fan of sparkle oh
right well you know what it's pretty oh
it's a lot Cheers
it's all Sheriff Sonny and Cher it's
like very pigmented that's a one coat
now yeah that's pretty good
it's real chunk yet here at the same
time which is a feat that I somehow
never have encountered in my nail polish
the consistency is pretty good and the
pigments pretty nice a luxe millennial
pink for a luxe millennial Sheridan huh
this might be good to put over like a
color already know what it went pretty
well I think I just feel like I ran a
damn marathon there were highs and lows
this color was not really the color I
set out to get but I'm not mad at the
color the color is pretty it's like an
experience also mixed with an end result
that you get to take home for
essentially six custom nail polishes is
a really good product it's nothing mom
better than drugstore prices and you can
control what you do I also like that you
can name it whatever you want my
ridiculous name I would give it is a
salmon swimming upstream I'm calling
this one the extremely fancy name of
blue I feel like that is so restocked
and he doesn't have unicorn piss but I
do I'm gonna call mine
make it rain bitch I make it rain match
guys
