feeling confident is something that I
personally struggle with we're here
today modelling lingerie throughout
history it's always a little scary
revealing your body to the public but
such a really supportive and
body-positive environment I think it'll
be good I'm so nervous
this is like not something I've ever
done before like I get to confront all
of my body issues at once I'm rough in
the 1980s I'm very excited I love my
outfit I'm probably gonna try to wear it
out of here and not give it back I'm
excited I'm confident I'm being turned
into the bride of Dracula so do you
think I'll be able to brush this thing
yeah I'm just kind of trying to put all
my nervous energy into being sexy I'm
just still wondering how people in the
19th century got laid to be honest yes
I'm just so good at straw I love it
everyone slayed every look you know
while not everybody here myself included
is like a professional model like
everyone brought it I think because they
felt comfortable doing something that
it's kind of crazy to do all of them are
fabulous everybody looked amazing
whatever you feel sexy in if that's an
18th century corset so be it
or if it's something like this then wear
it rocket I feel like being sexy is to
each their own
but I definitely also feel like everyone
should feel sexy at all times
I don't see myself as a model actor at
all so it'll be interesting you deal
with a lot of your own kind of anxieties
about your body I don't think I ever
look as good as everyone makes me see
you Oh God
oh whoa that doesn't look like I think
if anyone ever has the chance to be
photographed in this nature you should
absolutely take the opportunity this is
what I must look like when I'm forced to
feel very confident no one looks nervous
which is crazy to me because I know
every single girl had like her own
insecurities going into that so it's
really nice seeing each person just
looking so flawless and confident
because I think that's like 100 percent
of what makes someone super hot and sexy
oh I do enjoy this feel like this is the
person I've always wanted to be I was
worried about the bedroom shot because
everybody like was standing around and I
could see them cuz I'm looking at my
picture and like I said I kind of wish I
really do honestly I wish I was this
confident like this normally kind of
makes me a little upset at myself that I
don't see myself like this normally but
I think it's something that can be
worked on and I think something like
this is really helpful for something
like that for someone with especially
someone with body image issues like I
have I think any young girl that looks
at lingerie ads and doesn't see
themselves that's okay because a lot of
times those women don't represent the
population like there's different bodies
or different skin colors and I should be
more confident about Who I am and what
my body looks like you honestly just
have to create your own type of
beautiful and you have to create your
own
sense of self like I'm not meant to be
like everybody else
