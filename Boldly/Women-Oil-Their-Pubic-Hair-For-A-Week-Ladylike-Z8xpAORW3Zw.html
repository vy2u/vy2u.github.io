steel wool hair care is important but
how important is it you know down there
it's ladylike and we are oiling our
pubes for a week I don't really have
many boundaries so if there's something
that comes to mind that I want to share
about my pubes I'll usually share it I
don't discuss pubic hair because it's
odd I rarely talk about my pubic hair
with anyone actually there's way more of
a stigma with pubic hair with women than
with men men have a lot stronger
preference for the women I love that
it's a lady that invented this fur she
created a product that sort of helps us
embrace our pubic hair and just take the
best care of it that we can I don't want
it to like stimulate growth what if it
smells what if I get some weird UTI from
it this is a very luxurious package I
will say that much it smells like
lemongrass ewwww this seems like it's
gonna be really fun but I definitely
don't think that I need this I think
it'll be really cool to just like pay
much more attention to a part of my body
that I don't typically I think I'm most
excited for the fact that it should
eliminate any chance of ingrown hair I
have super super sensitive skin let's do
this Kirsten what would you do if I told
your oil in my pubes
I would say that all your plan good for
you about you to the Pew boil for the
first time and I think it'll probably be
fine I just I don't know what it's
trying to do like what's the goal here
you have let it grow I really enjoyed it
it smells very spa-like I'm really
excited to see how soft and supple my
hairs become by the end of this week
Tyler also tried the pupil it did it
didn't really do anything for me I kind
of felt like um Justin Bieber just put
on a face mask but I also had to put on
a pube mask as well it's just weird to
be sitting here after a shower just only
moisturizing your pubic area it was fine
it's a little sweaty
I guess the application process is
pretty interesting because you apply it
with a dropper it feels like a sensual
science experiment it's a little more
moist is what I would say than usual but
so far I don't see anything getting
softer or anything really but it is fun
today's really hot I'm feeling very oily
I'm feeling very sweaty it's just like
it's not happening and if you just soft
they're laying down like like baby hairs
what could this oil be doing that a like
$10 bottle of jojoba oil from Trader
Joe's could not be doing Freddie tell us
what you just told us well I said that I
ran out of deodorant this morning so
instead I just there's some pew boil and
all things no I smell great this smells
like paint ha ha ha ha I can firmly say
that nothing really happened but it was
very fun but nothing really happened
what did you do this week I old my damn
pubes for a week it's a nice like doing
something for myself kind of feel like
oh no one's gonna see this I started
putting it other places
it made my pubic hair is softer I felt
like they were more manageable I came
into this hoping my pubes would get
softer are they softer not noticeably it
helped
me in like razor burn I will say that
this pube oil made me hate my pubic hair
a little bit less this did open a door
in my heart towards pubic hair care so
I'm a tried shampoo it was kind of nice
to open up the conversation and talk to
people about pubic hair I guess and kind
of get advice on how to maintain it I
just think that everyone should talk
about people's I think everyone should
try specific hair care for pubic hair I
think it's a cool experiment I think
it's just nice to sort of pay attention
to a part of your body that you wouldn't
otherwise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
