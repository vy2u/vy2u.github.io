good like no yeah so even if you turn
them inside out the fabric isn't exactly
thick so it's gonna still smell the
inside I've gotta say disgusting now
he's thinking of crotch smell today
we're playing never have I ever
Beauty Edition I have played never have
I ever I plant like every time I play
like bring a fire the drinking game I
don't know if I'm allowed to say that I
love playing it though you get to know
so much about your friends I have
definitely played never have I ever
before but usually there's alcohol so if
we can spice this up nice this is the
sober version yes very respectable very
high-class never have I ever tried to
use a piece of hair as dental flaw that
is the weirdest question
three-two-one I have never even thought
about it ever I only started doing it
recently because I asked for floss in
the office and nobody had any insight
was like you know you can just use a
piece of your hair and I was like that
has never occurred to me
my fate of the day it's like your own
hair it's our own oils so it's like you
know it's already coming off of you I
don't floss enough so I haven't thought
about using my never have I ever burned
myself at the curling iron
who hasn't truly I've been my ears
so many times yeah same my ears my neck
oh yeah once I dropped it on my thigh
yeah I like to kind of you know spread
it around like lotion I was at my
cousin's wedding and I was curling my
hair I think it was unplugged it's still
hot and I was like kneeling looking for
something I fell over and I landed on it
with my foot but it was so bad it was
like the size of a golf ball maybe maybe
it was like a little bit smaller than a
golf ball probably like that size of
like just like not even my story
I'm completely scarred I have nothing
say to this I have burned myself but not
to this level never have I ever spilled
and they'll polish everywhere
last night ho ho I ruined a beanie baby
that way my mom will never let me forget
the one time I was like not paying
attention in her bedroom doing my nails
black and next thing I know one part of
my body just so looped and next email
there's like a big old puddle and legs
it on the carpet it was on the carpet
like this straight carpet she was pissed
never have I ever gone around all day
with lipstick on my teeth I mean maybe
not all day but for a couple hours
because people are rude yeah
those days that I walked around with
lipstick in my teeth all day are the
days I know I didn't acknowledge anyone
that was my friend don't know why cuz
they would have told me exactly what
have told me my sister gets mad at me
every time I tell her that she has
something on her face and I'm like so
you'd literally rather walk around with
it on she's like yes I would because
it's embarrassing to me I like fine some
people really do hate it
just say something it'll be weird for
like two seconds
but like it's greatly appreciated never
have I ever turned my underwear inside
out to wear it again myself I've
definitely thought about it but then
when it came down to it I was like
that's just too gross and I didn't do it
let's get this completely straight I'm
not a dirty human I was traveling and
you know when you like you pack all of
your socks and your underwear and your
bras in like one little pouch well I
forgot that base at home where were you
vacationing like Costa Rica like some
one of those like tropical places my
bathing suits like oh wow that grosses
you out more than turning your own
underwear inside well no I turned it
inside out told my parents and we went
through shopping later that day it's not
like I lived in them for that entire
week no all right so an emergency
situation not a lifestyle never have I
ever cried in public and ruin my mascara
if you lived in New York you have cried
in public you hide on the train you've
hide in the street I mean I
but not for the sense of crying but
because I wear contacts and like a
slight beautiful spring breeze could
come along and the next thing I know I'm
just like gushing and I'm just like oh
the pollen hope the dust Oh pollution of
LA I cry - and - like emotional music so
I'll probably be in like forever 21 and
some song comes on it's about like
someone going and getting broken up with
and I'm just like so powerful never have
I ever slept with makeup on and woken up
looking like the cool okay I definitely
have yeah this is like me every weekend
when I like come home a little bit tipsy
and like really tired I just fall asleep
in bed with my makeup on and then in the
morning it's very odd it to it but this
is from yesterday you're lying
never have I have I tried to remove gel
nails myself pretty sure we've pretty
much done everything at this time you
know I wanted a French manicure and they
did a gel French manicure and I got
really frustrated when I realized that
it was gel and I just like pulled it off
which is I know it's so bad it's so bad
but it's like the worst habit Etienne to
yourself I have never had gel nails
removed properly I've always removed
them myself I thought you were going to
say I've never had jell-o no rough I
love them although I have acrylics right
now but gel or acrylic something yeah
there's a reason I have acrylics on
right now because I peeled my gel off
and my nails are disgusting underneath I
was like I thought to cover them up with
these fake nails never have I ever gone
a week without washing my hair duh I
don't know what challenge I was
challenging myself whether to have all
the oils or just have better hair but my
hair was so processed I was like I need
to stop watching it need to let it
breathe
and by breve I mean I need to never wash
it again I got up too late and it was
really bad it was really bad no one
noticed which is great but dry shampoo
became a very close ally and friend
never have I ever gone a month without
washing my bra that's pretty intense I
haven't yeah I definitely have I have
nice bras that you can't put in the
washing machine you're not supposed to
put bras and washing machine however I'm
very lazy about hand washing my delicate
clothes I washed my clothes like all the
time see I know
watch my class all this time but I
definitely wouldn't leave my bras a
whole month because that does sound like
a long time yeah
never have I ever used makeup way past
its expiration date oh and you can't be
buddies duping me pick a side we all
have if you haven't and that is a
 lie you know that there is some
 sitting in your makeup bag but like
you just remembered one day and then you
used again even though that's probably
three years old I mean yes because I've
no idea expiration date is right well
mascara you're like not supposed to use
after three months or something like
that yeah that's true I heard that
however yeah no I'm not throwing it out
I'm not I'm gonna use it until little
crusty Krusty's and get on my I know
infection
seems the expiration time is a
suggestion let's note I believe I've
lived through expired makeup so it's
fine yeah I've learned that neither was
a perfect at makeup and general
cleanliness and I like that but you know
when you're in a pinch you do some
things that are kind of questionable or
you live through some makeup experiences
that are a bit intense but you make it
work and you learn from them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
