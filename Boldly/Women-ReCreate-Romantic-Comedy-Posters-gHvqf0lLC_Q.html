rom-coms for me when I was growing up
very much we're the same type of woman I
never really got to see my culture being
represented in the way that it should be
authentically being a plus-size woman
being a woman of color being a queer
woman like you ain't find me nowhere I'm
a damn unicorn definitely the best
friend who was like black and like kind
of the comedic relief I feel like that's
like as diverse - God oh that girl's
hair is curly she must be crazy it's
very frustrating to always see yourself
as like a supporting character because
then you grow up believing that you're
not the lead in your own movie I'm
hoping that I can recreate this pose and
it doesn't look like someone made a
mistake
today I am recreating the pretty woman
poster I am feeling like the classiest
hooker there ever was in all of Beverly
Hills this is like Julia Roberts when
like she was America's Sweetheart I am
like my couches sweetheart a very iconic
smile to try to replicate
I love the pretty woman poster Julia
Roberts her hair is in its natural curl
it's a darker color and it shows a lot
of her personality and she is smiling
like that iconic Julia Roberts smile she
just seems so happy today I will be
posing with Jacob who I've never met
it's always great to first meet someone
when you're supposed to play their love
interest
I will be recreating the
no-strings-attached poster we don't have
to be the best friend watching someone
else fall in love like I can have no
strings attached
today I'm modeling with Courtney and
this is going to be interesting so I've
always wanted a big oversized shirt and
be like oh my gosh I'm so cute and
someone else's shirt it's a lot of ass
to capture I hope that this shows that
no matter what size you are whether you
are super small or not or in-between
that like you can be sexy and you can
wear your little shirt around whether
it's yours or not and everyone's gonna
look good no matter what I am going to
be doing Kate Hudson in How to Lose a
Guy in 10 days I've lived in this poster
and it's just kind of like two people
playing Jenga with each other in the
pose like she's like this but like I
can't get so instead it's gonna be like
no boys allowed or whatever this pose
how do they find themselves in a
situation where like they both tipped
over at the same time Macey has figured
out that there's no way you can do this
pose without it being photoshopped
together so we're now filming it
separately and I'm being held up
bigger people have romantic adventures
too I think it'd be really cool to see
our romantic adventures
I'll be recreating the notebook with the
always beautiful Rachel McAdams and I
hope I can do it some justice today I'm
actually posing with my boyfriend
Russell and I think this will be a fun
experience for the two of us and
hopefully he doesn't drop me he's giving
you that it just heavily rained look
rom-coms for me when I was growing up I
never really saw a leading lady who was
curvy and considered sexy and romantic
that's fantastic beautiful I'm really
excited to show that as a curvy woman
you can also be a leading lady I'm doing
JLo from the wedding planner growing up
as a Latina seeing JLo in movies was
amazing Jenny from the black Maya from
the black I never really got to see kind
of my culture being represented I don't
know like I wish la-la-land had like POC
it's like why can't a Latina be in it or
like African American or an Indian or
something like but I'm excited to
represent an average-sized woman which
is like in America I think it's size 14
to 16 she's kind of like like this I
have too much boobage for that I mean I
got a little butt thighs arms I'm
excited to show that in a movie poster
because it's usually photoshopped out
I just hope this shows girls everywhere
that you are allowed to be the lead in
your own love story you're not just the
best friends you're not just the comedic
relief you are the star of your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
