my underwear because why the that
I've had a very up-and-down relationship
with body image over the years I would
just look at a magazine and I would look
at this photoshopped image and I would
try and make my body look like that body
of my body wasn't perfect that no one
was gonna love me no one was gonna think
that I was a valuable human being or
that I could contribute anything there
are days where I'm really feeling myself
and then there are days where I just
don't want to exist in the body that I
live in but I think this is really going
to put it to the test
like can I be body-positive in front of
an army of people practically naked it's
the morning of the show you're very
nervous this is real like we're gonna do
this I tried to shave everything that I
could and I think at one point I like
stopped shaving and I'm like do it I'm
done I'm done
when you watch Victoria's Secret Fashion
Show the joke is that all girls are
crying and eating ice cream because you
want to look like that from this
experience I want to learn for myself
that I can be comforting my own body I
think I hope to gain a little bit of
understanding that even though I'm goofy
and fun I am a very sexy powerful person
too i transitions when I was 13 issues
now with my body are blessing I'm most
excited to the outside of my body and
see myself walking down the runway and
say like hey that girl's cool like look
at her she's like super confident today
what I hope to gain is a little bit of
bravery I've definitely never walked a
runway in my underwear ever because no
one's given me an opportunity I'm 4 foot
11 so I would never be allowed to model
I hope to gain like a newfound
confidence because this is the side of
myself that I don't really engage with
the reason I'm doing this isn't about my
body
it's about representing a lot of other
women's bodies feel like I've just
gotten to a place where I feel
comfortable expressing myself fully you
know I'm a boss ass bitch no matter what
I'm wearing or lack thereof it's not
about promoting one type of body but
making sure that we're promoting all
different types of body all the
empowerment that I'm gonna feel I'm
really excited to feel that because I
feel like that's really needed right now
this might come as a surprise but I do
not get mistaken for a Victoria's Secret
model I know you see me and you're like
oh my god it's Gigi Hadid
I'm really excited to show that we
should all be given the chance to feel
as beautiful as we actually are I hope
to gain a better understanding of where
other women are coming from anyone out
there that has a body type that I have
and hoping that they see me in my
underwear and they're like I am Queen
and they realize that they're just as
beautiful as I am I've been preparing by
eating a lot of sweets turn around
drop it yeah
I feel like we may be the first woman
ever to walk the runway with unshaved
armpits welcome little shaver armpits or
our legs cuz we don't fly that way and
it's okay if you do I think that's what
I love the most to see how beautiful
like everyone looks and their underwear
and like everyone just look good
ah holy these puppies are high
there's no turning back now so kill me
now I truly appreciate all of you coming
here and supporting these lovely women a
lot of what I stand behind is just being
yourself and just rocking what you have
and just being confident and I can't
even tell you how awesome these women
are and how awesome that we have this
experience of this opportunity to do
this okay thank you
I may not look like I have body issues
but being trans trust me easier why
should the Victoria's Secret Fashion
Show limit any of us when I hit the
runway that all comes down to your
confidence if you believe and everyone
else will believe like this thing came
over me and like every nerve but since I
had strayed away and I was like came to
slay and slay I did before I heard the
crowd I was nervous then I heard the
crowd and so I think this was a very
good beginning step for me feel like I
blacked out and I was like it's not
gonna happen it's not gonna happen like
this isn't really happening and then
that's when it hit me okay like I guess
this is who I am and I am this like
leopard print lady
I hope that this can change the
narrative for how women are viewed in
the media
this was like my inner thirteen-year-old
who always watch and TM that wanted to
be a model got to shine tonight people
in the audience they weren't even there
I was just feeling myself so I never
really look at myself in the mirror and
just super confident and like yes I love
your body you're awesome
but this attire gave me that confidence
I honestly do feel a lot better about
myself when it really comes down to it
you really have to accept to love
yourself and I feel like that this whole
experience really just helped me do more
about
I think it's one thing for me to work on
loving myself by myself and it's another
thing entirely to then go and put what
you've worked on out on display I came I
saw I conquered
presently being in my underwear in front
of all my co-workers helped my
confidence
once you step onto that stage there's a
weird adrenaline rush that comes with
everything I just felt really excited
and pretty and I loved everyone shouting
my name
I think I gained definitely more
confidence just being in front of people
being in front of a camera
it was definitely really nervous to show
my stomach because I don't really ever
show this much of my stomach especially
because I have a five and a half month
old baby but I felt like I wasn't good
company and everyone was really
supportive so it was a really good
experience
just do this my hand is shaking the
cameras literally shaking from my hand
oh my god did it
I feel super exhilarated and I don't
want to put my clothes back on
we haven't like black thought I won't so
fast and when I came back I was like oh
my god don't worry how many people were
screaming and excited I mean II feel so
good and now I know my models like this
yeah it for their self-esteem I'm gonna
like gonna they looked amazing and it
was so empowering even I was emotional
just saying that so it was so dope to
see all of them big confident real also
doing so really yeah I would wear the
stuff that I saw I don't know I have so
much respect for them even more than
before they are the best I look up to
them for sure
I think mostly what I'm taking away from
today is that if you own it if you
believe in it that everyone else will
believe in it and that each and every
one of those Victoria's Secret Angels
capable of feeling insecure this was
incredible this was a lot more
empowering than I think I ever realized
it would be having everybody here and
cheering just reminds you that no matter
what there are people rooting for you
I'm taking away a great sense of
gratitude for all of my flaws I'm like
all the rest of these girls embracing it
and loving it I love watching the
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show but yes I
wish they included more body types I
think today goes to show that no matter
what you're wearing no matter how your
hair is or how tall you are if you think
you're beautiful
who cares what everyone else thinks it's
about how you feel if you're happy and
healthy then that's all that really
matters
