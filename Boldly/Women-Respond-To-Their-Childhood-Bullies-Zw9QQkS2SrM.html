you're young and someone makes fun of
the way you look because you can't
control that I've gotten shoved into
lockers I was bullied by is a small
group of boys like about three boys my
friends always said I was kind of easy
to make fun of but it felt like it
always came from a place of love I hope
when I was a little kid I was a little
chunkier than everybody else and all the
other girls so people noticed that I was
different and they'd like to touch my
stomach or point it out today I think I
would say in response to that I think
you meant can I touch your six-pack a
guy once told me that I would be much
hotter if I had a bigger butt so my
response to that guy would be my butt
does not need your approval to be
fantastic I was a skinny kid but I
didn't really have a flat stomach I had
a little extra baby fat that kind of
hung around so they always told me that
it looked like I had a little kangaroo
pouch and to this day they still will
mention it when I was growing up kids
would tell me that I was adopted because
it's impossible for a brown girl to have
a white mom well my dad is from India so
white plus brown is a lighter shade of
brown did you even listen during middle
school science cuz that's not how
genetics work the mean comment I
remember hearing about my body was that
I had no but I think many
african-american communities having a
big butt is very like it looked looked
up upon but it was really that one
comment one time that got me to realize
like oh my god something's wrong with my
body to the person who made that comment
I would say that maybe I'm not your cup
of tea but my body is fine the way it is
it was about two to three different
bullies and they just would all say I
was ugly one of them specifically when
every saw me in the hallway he would run
the opposite direction and just make a
huge scene about it people do that out
of fear they do it to fit in so in fifth
grade a boy who was in my class told me
that I had fat thighs my responsive now
would be that my thighs were not fat
they were strong now I actually like
think I have really great thighs the
thing that I got to use most full was my
mustache and my general body hair and my
name is fazilet fuzzy was a really easy
nickname it's because of people like you
who picked on me and hurt me that I
became as strong as I am today
I feel bad for people that feel a need
to bully other kids because it's
probably just coming from a really dark
place so instead of trying to fix
themselves they're just trying to make
you feel bad about yourself and say mean
things about you work on being
comfortable with your own body and be
around people that love you don't let
their words affect how you feel about
yourself
they're probably jealous of how pretty
your skin is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
