the line why haven't we had sex yet
that's direct
I guess that's implying that that's like
a good line I mean I get it that was
women were thirsty but I know many girls
who would work I've gotten through the
 it seems to take a bit of the
romance out of it and smart girls want
to be told they are pretty pretty girls
want to be told they are smart yeah that
one's not chill everyone thinks they are
a constellation of all traits I'm pretty
and smart and I want to be told both
compliments are wonderful things to
spread them around gentlemen the perfect
opener is tell me are you as interesting
as you look that's like an abominable
opening I think it's a good opener no I
picture them wearing like a velvet
blazer with like thinning hair
he cannot maneuver casually not needing
an opener is the best opener I'm a
little corny in that I don't mind a
nickname like hey MA hey boom I mean I'm
down with why haven't we had sex yet for
the love of God please manscape yes that
was a very valid statement okay sure but
also like who cares man state this it's
like weird it can't look like buckwheat
down there if you expect us to you must
as well he's really manscaped um and
he's on a swimmer I want him to be a
little gross because that's manly if a
girl doesn't respond to me I walk away
permanently that's turning twice in a
row
like that is a medius and is only
going to creep girls out I'm torn on
this Chris I'm torn you can't force the
traction that's trail but then like my
high school boyfriend was a guy who I
was like not into all freshman year and
then sophomore year he like just kept
trying and I was like madly in love with
him I like persisted self only
difference between someone being creepy
and cool is if you're attracted to them
or not and that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
