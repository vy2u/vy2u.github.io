all day every day so today we are trying
out lorax brunch I like to eat so any
meal of the day I'm excited about the
like brunch is like fun cause it's like
normally with your friends there is no
day that I can't do a good brunch when I
like heard we were trying like brunch
themed makeup or whatever I was thinking
like you know like the makeup that's
like shaped like boobs I'm seeing a lot
of pastels yeah my enemy there's a fine
line with pastels like you either look
okay or you look completely crazy they
thought this packaging out honey this
packaging is everything the names are
cute though Bloody Mary French totes
like I really like the blueberry I like
the avocado toast I have no idea what
I'm gonna mix this with how I'm you know
what maybe I'll make it like a liner
this is called brunch Queen I'm gonna go
for barista the coverage looks like it
might be a little blotchy I'm gonna be
optimistic all right definitely want to
try this french toast I actually like
don't hate it
I'm gonna go with alter ego I hate this
let me see yeah I really like the
glitter on eggs bedding oh Jesus I'm
returning back to home base because this
is never gonna work
I'm gonna try this pastry chef
wish me luck guys
this is the worst a lot of these colors
look dusty get very different than black
skin and they look on I'm putting
blueberry scone in the corners of my
eyes I'm putting it on my lips to try to
bring out some I think one positive that
we can keep in mind here is that like
you can always get creative with things
I was like super optimistic at first I
feel like I was just let down I still
think the packaging is dope the colors
like at first sight are pretty yeah I'm
just like not that kind of girl I like
everything a lot darker I started to
question myself like am I good at
putting on makeup maybe I don't know my
face am I even cute let's cheers to
always making things work even when it's
not for us here's the makeup remover
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
