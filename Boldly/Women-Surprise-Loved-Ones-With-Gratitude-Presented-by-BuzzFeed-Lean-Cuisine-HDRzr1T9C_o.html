influence in my life in the absence of
parents she has taken the end when she
didn't have to she means every she means
everything to me it reminds me of my
relationship with my mother Jolene has a
very good daughter she gets whatever I
need I'm always saying jali jali I met
Samantha at work and it is very unusual
to go to work and then find a daughter
we've had a relationship for 15 years
she's always doing for others so I
thought it would be excellent to
surprise her and do something for her hi
what a surprise my sister she's helped
me in more ways than one especially this
year she doesn't let anything get her
down if anything she uses it as
motivation and that's one thing that I
am I about her any last words before we
tell her why she's really here hi how
are you my sister told me that we're
gonna be talking about beauty products I
thought was funny because I think she
was a beauty expert stop learning how to
put on makeup I told you lean we would
get makeovers I was told it was like a
self beauty makeover but there's
something a muck would you like to you
tell her when the shoes really about oh

brought you here because I wanted to
tell you how much I love you and how
grateful I am for everything you've ever
done for me thank you for everything you
do for me honestly I want to tell you
what you mean to me and I want you to
know that I love you so mad Shanice I
brought you here because I'm grateful
for you and I just wanted I want to know

interview and that means everything if
it weren't for you I don't know what I
would do and without you I don't know
where I would be so thank you very much
i love you but really nice I don't know
what to say is that this is it oh my god
she's the best that you could have it I
didn't want children and I ended up with
one that was perfect I'm so happy that I
have a daughter I didn't carry you here
but I certainly carry you here in my
heart I never asked anything of Shanae
the fact that she's so appreciative of
me hey was caught off guard like I
didn't know this was happening I thought

this position to meet my daughter's help
