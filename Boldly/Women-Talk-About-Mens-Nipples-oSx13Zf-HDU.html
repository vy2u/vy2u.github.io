deal with male nipples why do men have
nipples in the first place I know that
nipples develop before your genitalia
and then something bad happens to them
illegal men what do you know about male
nipples
supposedly an erogenous zone I like it
when they like being socks on because it
makes me feel like I'm making them happy
how come in that sounds fun yeah you
like sucking on it that's right
got really low nipple standards I have
no idea if I find the guy attractive and
he's wearing a tight t-shirt and his
name will show that's hot I like them to
be small small nipples on a manner very
odd to me one thing that's really lovely
for many gentlemen is that they just get
to have hair all over their nipples
I don't mind chest hair but when there
is only dark hairs around the nipples
that's weird some dudes make the best of
it right they do like those little Sun
tattoos around the nips no piercing yes
that's going backwards I think I just
have a grudge against male nipples
because they can be out all the time if
women started going oh my god the
nipples with guys would they also get
censored all the sudden yeah I don't
think that either nipple should be
censored but I really don't think that
we should all be topless people act like
if you don't censor female nipples like
they're gonna be out everywhere they're
gonna be out to get you but I think
everyone should be able to do whatever
they want if they want to show their
nips like show your niche
put a shirt on take a show-off in the
pizza now I will complement my male
companions on having very beautiful nips
never in my life talk this much about
male nipples I probably never will again
they're just coming on my mind all day
and they wondering what everyone's nips
look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
