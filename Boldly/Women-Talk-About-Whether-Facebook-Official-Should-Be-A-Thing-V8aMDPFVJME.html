official right I personally don't do
Facebook official needs to be a thing I
don't think it should be mandatory I
think especially now because Facebook's
just as much a professional platform as
it is a personal one I have been
Facebook official before mostly when I
was a teenager and you sort of felt that
pressure in high school to to have that
status and that likeability is it's
complicated still a thing on Facebook I
don't know but if it is I think that
that's a pretty insensitive one to have
because imagine being the other person
we post so much of our life on Facebook
so I feel that when you don't put your
relationship status on there then you're
trying to hide something maybe like if
you're getting engaged or married I
think it's fun then to update your
facebook like why talk about what you
just say for dinner how many cats you
have or you know how you feel about your
neighbor's dog but they're not about
your partner I have lived with my
boyfriend over a year and we're not
Facebook official I kind of just think
why the only reason I have my
relationship status on my facebook is so
I can remember our anniversary because I
have a bad habit of forgetting it I mean
don't if you want to just go nuts but I
did anyone really care after high school
if you've got into a new relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
