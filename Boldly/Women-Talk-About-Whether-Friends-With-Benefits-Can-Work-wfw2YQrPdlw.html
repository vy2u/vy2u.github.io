oh that is a tough one I think there's
one time friends with benefits can work
in your life and that is literally right
out of high school or when you're in
college and you just like for you to do
whatever you want and you don't
necessarily want to be tied down to a
relationship I think you can have
friends with benefits obviously it's
such a tenuous sort of line to be
treading it depends what your definition
of friends with benefit is whether it's
you know you've hooked up with a friend
a few times I think that that can
definitely work it actually worked
really well with this one girl that I
met we were in exactly the same boat at
the same time kind of post breakup I
think friends with benefits definitely
can work my philosophy with basically
any relationship is just being honest
about your feelings what I think changes
things is when you stop making plans
with other friends or you maybe stop
going on dates you stop seeing other
people casually because you're always
hanging out with this friend with
benefits I think friends with benefits
is one of the things people think can
work but when they actually try it out
practically it just gets messy you can't
expect to be friends and then friends of
benefits and go back to being friends
that doesn't work I feel unfortunately
that someone always ends up getting hurt
either you develop feelings for them and
they don't feel the same way or
vice-versa
so I think this day and age I probably
would avoid it to be safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
