been coming out with their own workout
gear or activewear athleisure or
loungewear but is it actually good for
working out or is it all just for the
name will be going through a series of
tests to see which gear makes the cut
and which ones will tin the heat its
ladylike and today we're playing
celebrity workout gear Olympics
I am honored to be wearing Queen B's Ivy
Park right now something that came from
Beyonce's mind is in my hands right now
if Beyonce has even breathed on it it'll
be okay I'm wearing Jillian Michaels I'm
feeling good okay even though I don't
really work out I do appreciate a fly
little number I think I trust Jillian
she's been in the game for a minute she
knows what's what I'm wearing the
fabulous Kate Hudson's fabletics I don't
think she acts much anymore but I do
believe she works out the bra has a very
interesting back and I'm interested to
see how that holds up if it gets tangled
or if people think that it's a pentagram
and I'm worshipping Satan I am wearing
Carrie Underwood I mean she has a body
she must know how bodies work I'm a
little worried about the bra my boobs
are hanging a little low and that does
not bode well unless this shirt just
burst into flames halfway of the day I
feel like it's gonna be fine all right
this is the bounce test in which we test
if the sports bras will help the bounce
whether or not our boulders can be
contained
we're gonna run towards there and jump
around all right Ready Set Wow
oh I'm gonna speak for everyone and say
that what you just saw there is not how
we actually run it was to you know
simulate some intense bouncing although
I will say I do run very embarrassingly
I think I went pretty well my boob
stayed intact during my parkour moves
Gilly held it down these things didn't
move at all it was definitely better
than nothing if I hold my hands right
under my boobs they are hitting them and
I have really small boobs so there's no
like mm I feel like I'm playing dodge
ball with myself and losing I have no
complaint five out of five for twenty
five out of five a three out of five two
out of five I'm into this visually but I
need a bra that's gonna like strap me
down so tight that I will never escape I
do apologize for getting out of control
and jamming Kristen's finger but it was
all worth it long putt
so we ate lunch which is good because
now resident badass Jordan is going to
lead us through a sweaty workout we're
gonna sweat and then we're gonna see how
long it takes for us to become dry once
more I'm gonna get them pretty sweaty
they're gonna be doing an interval
workout there's gonna be some cardio
involved some strength movements
involved they might not like me at the
end of it though I'm a little nervous
Jordan like is intense she goes hard
we're gonna be doing six different
movements and we're gonna go 45 seconds
on 15 seconds of rest three two one go
I feel pretty good alright guys 15 more
seconds push through and then you can
rest Freddie you're not doing anything I
can see you fire down you guys have 10
more seconds of this you got it every
time I just keep working 10 seconds and
you get to rest and rest you're done
nice work
I'll high-five you so it took about 20
minutes for me to be completely dry
that's some serious veg sweat happening
undercarriage is looking pretty pretty
spiffy my butt crack took a little while
to dry the open back right now to me is
completely fashioned and zero function
I believe that honesty's the best policy
and I had a fire down below when I was
doing that they pack in like three
layers of fabric right here and I don't
know why my general undercarriage area
dried up pretty quickly
think about the pants was it every time
I jumped up they jumped about two feet
down I have to give it a five out of
five like I have no complaints a 3.5 out
of 5 I think in terms of sweating I give
these a 4 out of 5 I'm gonna have to say
3 out of 5 because there's a pee there's
a bee the Beehive coming after me
we finally made it to the last workout
of the day yeah the last test you guys
are all so tired I was whoo okay I'm
Alison I'm not at all a certified yoga
instructor but it's gonna get very
namaste over here right now
the shirts are probably gonna ride up
that always happened let's be real but
uh I'm not upset so we're gonna start in
child's pose everybody you can either
have your knees together feet together
and bend over with your arms back or
forward my pants are already pulling
down this is so good this is good this
is gonna open up your lower back
generally the outfit held up I will have
to deduct a point because during the
inverted pose my pants did drop a little
bit causing a bit of drop crash pull
yourself up and then if you're feeling
good you can kind of fall over your
breast to your body
there's nothing about working out that
peeves me more than my shirt touching my
face or going over my face when I'm
doing yoga because the shirt was so
loose I was sure that I was gonna get
touched in the face but somehow I didn't
look out taller bridges she's so tall
they did me well in yoga the only thing
was the pants they ripped down a little
bit yes
my shirt did not ride up I was a little
worried earlier today about how long it
was but that came in handy for this just
collapsed into the mat goes into it four
to five a five out of five a four out of
five I give this a four point five out
of five there was shirt to spare see you
guys I'm still here right now Julianne I
killed the game from the bounce test of
the stretch test to the sweat pass and
I'm not afraid to say that I'm bragging
that Julie and I are the shit
I'll have another half out of 15 not bad
it did a good job I think my only thing
is the pants I'm just not that into the
pants they're hot please don't kill me
Beyonce for not giving you 15 out of 15
it's aesthetically beautiful but I
wouldn't want to run away from a bunch
of bad guys wearing it I also found out
that on the inside of my shirt it says
stay the path it was nice it was like
okay Carrie's looking out for me
I feel like in hindsight maybe this is
just a yoga outfit it's like not for
impact sports whatsoever but yeah I feel
like I did pretty well and I'm keeping
this pentagram broth because
counterculture heyday we put these
clothes through their paces we did it we
did it we did a lot Julie did it Oh
Julie was the winner yeah this is her
wheelhouse this is where she lives
absolutely her real house you know what
more we don't use enough wheelhouse yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
