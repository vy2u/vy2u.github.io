mostly because I love eyeliner I feel
like a makeup look isn't complete
without eyeliner at least for me I
normally always wear bottom eyeliner
it's a must it's the one makeup product
that I can't not have on my face so I'm
feeling a little bit edgier kind of
wanting to do a more like Rockstar type
of look I really like bottom liner when
I was younger I used to wear eyeliner on
my bottom waterline a lot using like
expensive mac eyeliner and it would
always run down my face I've stopped
using eyeliner look at the bottom of my
eyes just because they would always
smudge look like I was crying but I'm
hoping this eyeliner will make me fall
in love with wearing eyeliner at the
bottom I wear it for 20 minutes and in
my eyeliner just smudges I've tried
matte guys tried Sephora I've tried it
all and I'm just trying to find the
perfect eyeliner the Sephora contour eye
pencil I took off all of my liner so now
we're gonna test this baby out I'm
trying the Marc Jacobs Highliner
gel eye crayon it's a fanciest eyeliner
I've ever tried on I see you Marc Jacobs
aqua XL I pencil makeup forever
Wow waterproof and extra long-lasting
you know it's legit when it has extra in
front of it
perversion oh that's intense word for
some eyeliner let's relax I even noticed
my eye was watering a little bit and it
didn't really smear I think I have trust
issues with expensive eyeliner it goes
on pretty smoothly it's dark enough that
I don't have to go over it constantly
let's see how it wears throughout the
day this feels like a very creamy soft
eyeliner which doesn't really spell
long-lasting generally but I'm just
being a skeptic it looks really good
it's a couple hours in and it's looking
like it's holding up pretty well I'm not
gonna lie this eyeline
Blayne I broke the rule and touched my
eye doesn't leave some budget at all
actually it doesn't like that smudging
nice you're powerful doesn't matter
tells you about me yes if more men can
tell me this wearing this eyeliner
unsold you did the bottom ones yeah I
can tell that yours is smearing here and
you I can see where yours this Mary on
the corner - mm-hmm or smeary ladies
probably 95 degrees out and my eyeliner
is doing mom boy I just came back from
walking outside and it has smeared even
more
maybe it's my eyelids maybe it's not the
liner maybe the liner's doing his job
then I'm here you know with my oily
eyelids it's not sliding down my face if
anything I feel like the line who just
gotten home dinner we're gonna test if
my eyeliners waterproof or not and I
have Steven help me out you got a spray
bottle okay it's deep inside a little
too much fun dances as you can tell
there's waters and it's still on yeah it
all feels like a mess yeah it's still
off sorry
I watched something that was super sad
and now I'm crying so let's see if it'll
hold up it looks like it's smearing a
little bit
so it's the end of the day and honestly
it didn't last the workday and I really
didn't do much today so it would
definitely not last like going out to
dinner or dancing or doing anything with
friends on the weekend I had to read the
Sephora brand out of five I would
probably read it like a 1 or a 2 to be
honest I guess I could see why it was
highly praised it did actually stay on
but it did smear and I didn't even
really touch my eye at all I cried like
a little bit but no tears actually like
streamed down my face I give this
eyeliner a 3 out of 5
it's like hardly on my waterline anymore
like it was 24 hours my butt I'm sorry
cuz why I have trust issues thumbs down
from Megan it looks like I just applied
the eyeliner on and still intact the
colors there overall 5 out of 5 I think
I found my perfect match and name is
Mark Thank You Jacob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
