American heroes to show you just how
hard their job is you're about to watch
us probably suck at it it's ladylike and
today we're going to learn how to fight
some fires
I definitely admired firefighters I know
if I ever had a space where I wanted to
be a firefighter I liked them I thought
they were awesome and heroic and dope
but I never thought that I could be one
I think a lot of it is that when you see
posters for firefighters you see men you
don't really see women I'm getting
myself mentally prepared for like how
physically taxing today is gonna be I
don't have a ton of upper body strength
I heard that we're going to have to
carry 150 pound dummy I'm anticipating
us getting schooled by some female
firefighters I am excited to challenge
myself and push my limits I think
today's gonna be a wake-up call that
this is real life and like things like
this happen and to try and be as ready
as possible don't try it are we trying
tell him don't try this at home maybe
try this at home learn these skills and
try this at home kids
I've been on the Los Angeles Fire
Department for 16 years now I'm an
inspector 1 I'm also a firefighter and
paramedic I also assist with the
candidate systems program so I do a lot
of strength training for candidates
coming into the field what got a lady it
just did enough to believe it could
actually pursue this career when I was
16 years old
I joined the Explorer program with LA
City Fire Department and literally from
the first day I walked into the fire
station I knew it's what I wanted to do
I never thought I wanted to be a
firefighter but I did thought that was
not a female job one of my jobs was an
athletic trainer with the firefighter
football team some of the guys were from
this department and said he should
really think about the job we're hiring
so I wrote out and I realized for that
five hours of a ride-along they work out
their team-oriented they get to help
others and they eat together and cook
together so that camaraderie for that 24
hours and I thought you guys get paid
for this what's like the normal like
start time it's like when a recruit does
it for the first time ever a minute in
15 a minute 20 as they're getting used
to it so but once you do it over and
over they practice several hundred times
they can do it in 30 seconds so do you
guys feel like as women since there
aren't a ton of women on the force and
like you said there's a lot of
upper-body work required you have to
kind of work twice as hard to get to the
same level as everyone else we
definitely do have to work harder and
work differently than
- right no there's a lot of specificity
exercises that we can do to train our
upper body to become stronger it's not
only mentally and physically challenging
but it's also emotionally challenging as
well I'm going to put 60 seconds on the
clock and you guys are up alright ready
go
how do you think we're going to do today
we're going to be put through like an
obstacle course and have to carry like a
165 pound dummy I think for a group of
three or what's met four percent of
Alana I hope you'll be able to every
finger we think you guys are gonna do
excellent we know you're gonna pass the
flying colors
so what you're saying is my height is
not going to be an advantage today your
height will be an advantage today yes I
came here for there you go arm through
could you imagine like running to get
the hose and oh my gosh that's what we
have to do right we're gonna wear this
to do it
oh we're wearing it with us
this first obstacle that we have here is
going to be the hose drag so we're going
to drag it over there by the barrel
around an obstacle and into this box
where you're going to pull it all the
way through to get to this red line this
simulates getting the hose to the fire
the second event you ladies are going to
be doing is our forcible entry event so
what it is it's a ten pound sledge
hammer and you're going to be simulating
that you're forcing entry into a locked
door or facility the third event you
guys will be doing is a ladder
simulation so firefighter sonoda is
going to go ahead and demonstrate
actually raising a ladder up she sets it
on the side of the building and then
she's going to raise what's called the
halyards the fly portion of the ladder
the key in this event is not to let it
slip through your hands if you do it's
an automatic fail at 165 pounds and this
is the one we thought you take
that's ready get it
pull that giant hose pull it Freddie
go Freddie go
go - ago nation
all right Oh
I've hit every wrong
put that ladder up
let it go
yes we miss all of those
this is definitely
all right good so that is four of the
eight good job ladies
yeah a great job we're imaginating
ourselves but we did half a day minimum
standard I had a lot of fun I had a
great time actually I'm sweating cook my
eyebrows probably sweat off at this
point yeah it's such a deep appreciation
for what you guys do now yeah right now
we're right in the middle of our new
testing process so we are doing a lot of
recruiting we are looking to increase
our number of emails in the fire
department it's not easy but I think
that if you can get through all of this
I could see how you feel so satisfied at
the end of every day yes thank you so
much yeah thank you guys so much
that was lady tested lady encouraged and
we are encouraging you to apply to the
Fire Department training program
hey I'll click on that put us over there

some we like just okay but watch anyway
