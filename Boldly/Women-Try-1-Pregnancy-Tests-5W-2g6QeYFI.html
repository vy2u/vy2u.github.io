pregnancy tests I actually don't how
much is it the dollar yeah pop-tarts are
more expensive than those pregnancy
tests
have you used an at-home pregnancy test
before yes
multiple times you know you have scares
every now and that sorry mom and dad
tried quite a few pregnancy tests in my
life I am five months pregnant so yes
they've been accurate have you ever
heard of $1.00 oh yeah definitely a
couple friends that abuse them I've gone
to the dollar store you'll see the $1
pregnancy test am I gonna pick one up if
I think I'm pregnant probably not I feel
like there are some things you want to
cut costs on Mike you don't have to
order delivery all the time you don't
have to go shopping pregnancy tests is
where you don't want to cut corners all
right I've seen this before
pretty simple I feel like more expensive
ones have a lot more packaging going on
results in three minutes
Wow over 99% accurate okay that's
reassuring this actually seems a lot
more put together than the pregnancy
test that I took and that was a more
expensive one there's like a dropper and
this little plastic device oh wow
this is like so much smaller than I was
expecting it to be this looks like a toy
that fell out of my Barbie Dream House
usually there isn't this separate
dropper they make it pretty easy with
the other ones you just see directly on
it I feel like I'm gonna feel like a
little fly intensity I'm gonna pee in a
cup and then I'm gonna put this dropper
in the cup then drop it into the
collection well which sounds great
something Handmaid's Tale do not
read results after five minutes I'm
wondering what happens exit 5 minute God
with these lines it gets so confusing
okay one line for negative two lines for
positive it's invalid if only the
line appears or no one that is too many
options I just need a pregnant or no
pregnant situation yes maybe when you
get an expensive one you're paying for
the convenience of really understanding
what the I just read not at all I'm
pretty confident I'm pregnant I just had
my period so I think I should be okay
what if I find out I'm pregnant
literally I find out right now here's
the epoxy opener and device in dropper I
forgot you need is a cup so I actually
got fully on clothes and had to put
everything back on it casually came in a
coffee no look I gotta say for a dollar
paying for cost convenience but
definitely not actual convenience one
two three and now we wait for whatever
result I already see those two lines
pretty strong there we go there's that
red line come up we have confirmation I
am not pregnant wonderful moving thank
you set the timer for three minutes
and right when I look down I already see
the two lines appear okay so it's been
three minutes and I'm gonna walk I know
it was really scared of the line being
somewhat faith but that's a very big and
bold read learn a couple of minutes
after you take a pregnancy test and
you're just waiting on the results are
pretty nerve-wracking it's nice to know
that this is very effective the main
difference between like higher end ones
and cheaper ones is the time it takes
for the test story one stick is not
pregnant two sticks is pregnant and on a
twenty thirty dollar one it's just not
pregnant or pregnant which now I'm
thinking like why would I spend an extra
ten dollars just to get a word say that
I don't know nothing
has like bothered me more than coming
into the work room being somebody your
brain
