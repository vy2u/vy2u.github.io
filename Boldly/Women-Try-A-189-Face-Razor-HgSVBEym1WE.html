as me today I would be trying a $200
razor for my face I've never like shaved
my face I don't think I realized that I
had so much hair on my face
actually pretty hairy I was looking at
my face one day and I just noticed like
I like just here everywhere and I was
like dang when I go get my eyebrows done
now understand what the ladies ask me
when she's like live you sure
does it hurt I think I'm concerned that
it'll grow back and it'll grow back more
I'll have to buy this product and do it
every day today I'm trying the derma
flash I feel like I'm gonna turn into a
superhero afterwards I ain't no worse
attractions this is the moneymaker right
here out direct wait do I take my makeup
off
I just reapplied my lipstick for optimum
results use derma flash prep cleanser of
course for outdoors we have to use the
same cleanser from the same company
making the same product I need to sly
this thing in here huh
my eyeball is gonna be proud of me
because I think I'm getting rid of this
stash it kind of feels like I'm combing
the wispy hairs that might be on my chin
man I look so fly in Miami I'll be like
the most litters hairless person on the
beach my face looks cleaner and it feels
smoother when it looks like my barber
missed a spot
what can I do Ricky you can hear it when
it gets a hair feel like a man looks
like there's a lot of hair accumulating
and I haven't even gotten to the stache
guys I'm going to work in a barber shop
after this I got half my mustache up
right now and it looked like I got like
a goatee going on over here and I got
like babies a baby's bottom right here
you can feel like this stuff Oh like no
I didn't have a boyfriend before I
wonder if you can use this for your arms
or your legs there's the whole werewolf
mask right under me oh wow that's a lot
of hair
I can't find another piece of hair on my
face to take off guys besides my
eyebrows I think we're good here there's
like a vibrators where it's nightmare
now let's see what this soothing thing
feels likes is the prep was I supposed
to do this first those instructions are
not clear I think it's better than a
razor because not only didn't take off
my hair but I feel like it also kind of
like just cleaned up like the the top
layer of my skin a little bit I would
prefer a product that would not take the
hair off and still revitalize your skin
that cream that they have you put on is
actually pretty nice my skin does feel
really smooth I didn't even notice I had
air on my face until today so clearly
it's not a priority for me to take it
off everyone has fuzziness so we should
just live in all our fuzziness
