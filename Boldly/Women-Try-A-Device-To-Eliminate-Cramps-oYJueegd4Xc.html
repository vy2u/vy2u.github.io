there was an IndieGoGo campaign for it
and it's basically this little square
device you attach it to your stomach and
it's supposed to ease your cramps my
cramps are really light sometimes I
don't even have cramps I'm drying my
period I do my period as a flower but
then with a bird pooping on it because
it's just like a little annoying those
first two days I'm just on the couch
here are the clouds which are raining
down more blood because I literally
changed my ultra tampon probably twice
an hour
I have endometriosis when I'm on my
period can't leave bed I'm vomiting
here's a knife and I've often
contemplated cutting out my own uterus
because it hurts so bad
hi I'm dr. Jenn Gunther 9 ob/gyn and I
specialize in pain medicine for women ok
so when I sent you that link to the
IndieGoGo campaign basically what were
your first impressions of Livia that it
was a transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation device that look like a tens
unit would it work to get rid of Perea
pain
well if Livia is a TENS unit than it
would work because TENS units do work
for P vibration travels faster than pain
and so the brain likes the signal it
gets first and so if you get a vibration
type signal that then shuts the gate to
your green receiving pain I feel a
little skeptical but I'm super excited
to try it I'm hoping it works I get like
a little emotional thinking about if it
did take my pain away because I would
feel like I had in my life back
I'm at work and I try to figure out how
to do
yes okay so there's some sticky thing
here I'm gonna put it si mi ovaries um
I've had it on for maybe ten seconds now
and I turned it up pretty much as high
as it would go because my cramps are so
bad today and the craziest thing is that
it like actually works I wish I could
describe the feeling it's like
vibrations instead of pain there's like
a little bit of pain in the background
but it's like much easier to ignore when
you have the song I don't know if it's
working yet but I'd say it is certainly
distracting me from my cramps because I
have two vibrating pads on my stomach
I'm feeling some heat and it actually is
making me feel a little better but it's
nothing like drastic day to and the
cramps are worse than ever
I used my Olivia and I actually feel a
lot better my pain got incredibly bad
around two hours ago and I ended up
having to take more painkillers and when
I had the Libya on it didn't do anything
I've noticed that when my cramps are of
medium strength that putting the livia
on really does help it go away but when
I have those extreme cramps like I
normally do around the time on my period
it kind of barely touches them
I actually had a great time with Olivia
it really distracted me from the
awfulness that were my crimps there I
was able to work because I felt like my
body was just vibrating and I wasn't
feeling the cramp my cramps aren't that
bad I think maybe the effect wasn't as
great on me because it sort of took it
from not that bad - Oh like a little
better
Olivia did help me in a lot of ways I
would definitely use Livia again in the
future I didn't have to take as many
painkillers I wasn't like vomiting but
as far as like getting out of bed and
like living in my life still wasn't able
to it also just made me realize like all
the things women have to go through and
deal with women are having horrible
cramps at their desks at work like on
medications and just have to pretend
that they're totally fine and that's
crazy so it is good that their products
like this that do help women in those
situations and there should be more
