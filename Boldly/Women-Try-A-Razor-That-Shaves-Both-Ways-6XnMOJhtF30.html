back onto my arm shaving I don't like
doing it I would like to meet someone
that enjoys typing I feel like shaving
is one of those things for sale I tell
you is necessary when you're like a team
girl if you feel like it
good for you go ahead and shave if you
don't feel like shaving don't shave
I like the after-effects of shaving but
I don't care enough to do it almost ever
I do it when I first start dating
someone a lot because I always like to
feel silky smooth but then the longer
I'm into a relationship the more I just
become calculus lady
I usually shave my legs right before I
think I'm about to hook up let's just be
real so today I'm gonna shave my arms
just cuz I want to see how well the
razor works I think that having a razor
that allows me to shave both up and down
sort of makes me feel like I might be
able to shave off half the time it takes
I've tried so many different razors but
they just are all the same I'm open to
it I'm definitely open to it I just
don't know if it's gonna cut me or not
feels like pretty mobile like it'll go
with the curve it's very bad of course
it's pink because it's for girls razors
are just kind of facing each other I
feel like they just took one blade and
turn it upside down and we're like we're
geniuses I just think it's gonna cut me
I buy nicer razors cuz about what I pay
for my razors it might even be a little
bit cheaper
it looks very comfortable to hold look
at the finger divots this feels very old
just to be shaving my buttocks on camera
do I have to just do it like that that's
scary
sounds like it's working back down
definitely doesn't hurt let's go here
maybe I'm not like pressing hard enough
yeah it looks great but that's the
normal weight and then I guess we go :
this feels so weird
it's coming off for sure but like as you
can see there's definitely still hair
there I think it yeah I guess it worked
I don't know if it worked as much on the
way down going up it's taking all of the
hair off anyway doesn't look like the
going down portion is making a
difference is like the hairs already
gone
well there are only two blades on the
bottom this three on the top so I guess
the most you're gonna get out is gonna
be going off this is a very hairy part
of me and get clogged in the razor and
you have to rinse the razor out I'm just
gonna go down to see if that's taking
off as much hair is just going up
absolutely not
now I'm doing it like FASTA it
definitely does what the other razor
gets what the first razor didn't get
which is so nice and it's just way
easier to do cuz usually like stop stop
this is definitely not saving me any
time this is depositing lumps of my own
hair back onto my arm yeah at the end of
the day this might work a little bit but
not enough for me to invest in it and my
regular cheap razors would never get
this much it's great for speed shave I
mean I hate shaving so anything to make
it quicker great this seems like it
would work better with an area that you
shave regularly it's really safe feel
like I'm doing a lot of stuff right now
and I don't really feel like I'm gonna
cut myself one bit of blood could be
worse lots of hair but there's
definitely still like big patches of
stuff this razor is freaking awesome it
wasn't a bad razor but I wouldn't say it
really delivered on what it said it
would for me I was pleasantly surprised
I didn't have any faith in it and I
should have done it's ultimately not
that great for super long hair I don't
know if it'll work as well on like the
private areas you know parts that are
actually shaved it does feel very spoon
I would certainly recommend this razor I
really honestly would with this thing I
could be ready for the hookup in five
minutes I'm so glad I have one - shaved
leg now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
