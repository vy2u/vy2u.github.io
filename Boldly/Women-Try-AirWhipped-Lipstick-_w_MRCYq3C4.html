to get all over them the puppies are
going to look terrible so when I wear
liquid lipstick it tends to dry on my
lips and it kind of looks like oh people
lips clouds about comfort they evoke
serenity it's not usually what you think
of when you think about matte liquid
lipstick usually it's the opposite of a
cloud it's like some mint I think one of
my main concerns about this product is
if it's hydrating will it last
whoa-ooh packaging is very simple very
minimalistic packaging I don't know
there's something really pleasing about
black and gold oh it's a nice pop of
orange just perfect for the summertime I
don't know why I chose this color for
myself I'm gonna look like the freaking
aliens from Galaxy Quest that's a good
one I feel like it has a good angle so
you know that you could blind your lips
with it as well wow this color I don't
know how I feel about this color the
color is very bold though it has very
good pigment it smells like chocolate
the thing is it goes on smooth but I
feel like it needs a couple applications
I don't know this is more hydrating bull
see I look spooky as hell and I'm not
mad at it usually when you put up liquid
lipstick it immediately feels like the
Sahara and you're rubbing two dry pieces
of paper together and this is kind of
more like dry carpet I mean if it can
last long and it's smooth and it smells
like cocoa butter I'd be for it let's
see how it holds up
all over I feel like something that
should be noted is that this barely has
any lipstick residue on it I feel like
when I usually eat the fork is covered I
look like scary vampire who loves
seltzer there's a little bit on the
edges but not that bad it's been on for
like three hours now and I just had
lunch okay that looks boring does it
look worn no I mean you could use
another maybe little one a little
touch-up but um it looks good the color
looks good it's doing a good job
feel soft not like crunchy so far no
lipstick it's not dry it's not dry but
looks like a Smurfs butthole a little
bit I wish I could say that my lip
glosses pool and my lip glosses poppin
but right now it's just flopping right
now it's the end of the day and I feel
like this lipstick did a pretty good job
of living up to what it says it does I
feel like it was a tad less drying than
some of the other lipsticks I'm used to
and had a creamy texture and a nice
smell I mean the color I've grown to
love my lips do feel moisturized but
they look dry so I don't understand the
combo for that I feel like there's other
ones out there with a little more
staying power but you know what I will
say in terms of matte lips
not drying at all it's kind of like a
creamy a creamy lip juice paint which
pretty good ladylike is moving to our
