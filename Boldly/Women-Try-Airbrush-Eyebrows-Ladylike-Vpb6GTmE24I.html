right we're doing it again airbrush
makeup but this time these brows
hopefully it'll be less wet this time
but just as fun I care about my brows to
try to maintain them sometimes I go a
little overboard with the tweezing I
don't fill them in on a daily basis I
actually don't even really know how to
fill them in I do wish they were a
little bit darker a little bit thicker
so I try and achieve that look just by
filling it I basically just kind of at
this point in my life let my brows have
their way and just tweeze right in the
middle so they don't ever really meet
mostly I just fill into the pencil I
didn't go go well I hear things I like
playing with eyebrows and there's no
like tweezing involved right so it's
gonna be fine
I think airbrushing my eyebrows on could
be a really good thing especially if
it's it's supposed to be super fast I
tend to keep machinery away from my face
but we'll see how this goes so to open
this this is the darkest and this is me
so I'm gonna do medium brown that's the
right color for my brows my eyebrow
hairs are pretty fine I'll probably use
the dark brown so it's the finest
stencil that best matches my eyebrow
shape I need to get my mustache waxed
this is petite round arch my eyebrows
are like wide but not long I hope
there's a stencil that can accommodate
for that my brows are full ish oh my
gosh I have so many stray hairs this is
embarrassing um full high arch whew he's
all kind of look the same to me I wish
my eyebrows fit in these stencils okay
so I think I'm medium round arch my
brows are also different shapes kind of
let's do petite spoolie out these bad
boys show everyone the patchy bottoms of
your brows I was like real proud of my
eyebrow game before I was asked to do
this I'm worried this isn't actually my
color that maybe I should have gone
darker oh Lord oh dear said it okay well
that was kind of nice actually I might
have picked the wrong color actually
that's pretty precise okay this took two
seconds straight up I can definitely see
these little guys under here so I wish
the stencil were a little bit bigger
from the middle to the end it's a little
bit
thinner than I would like for them to be
but all at all I'd be fine leaving this
room like this the actual shape and the
filling in looks rather nice
now the left brow so I kind of wish I
had someone to hold this stencil up for
me this is a lot of multitasking this
brow looks quite nice this is kind of
fun I actually think it worked pretty
well I actually like this a little bit
more than the normal use of this when I
said oh I hope this isn't as wet it's as
wet when you put it on immediately but
it dried really fast even if you didn't
want to rely solely on the temptu
airbrush makeup to like do your brows in
the morning it's an awesome starting
point for just starting off you're
filling in process and I think you would
cut off like 15 minutes from my normal
routine would you use again on special
occasions just because I'm not the type
of person that fills in my brows daily
in the mornings I'm just tired so I
don't know if I would be able to do this
everyday but maybe for special occasions
I like this I'm into this I am I'm for
this I'm Pro this and team this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
