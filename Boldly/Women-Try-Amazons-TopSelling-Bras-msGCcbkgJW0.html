today we're gonna be trying on some of
Amazon's top selling bras these are
really the creme de la creme we're gonna
be talking about boobs big ones small
ones freaky ones saggy ones all boobs
are fair game today Amazon and I are in
a monogamous relationship I'm not gonna
say exclusively buy from Amazon but I do
mostly buy from Amazon
I love Amazon so much it's a problem for
my bank account no much I love it I've
never bought clothes from Amazon if it's
cheap and you don't have to go out of
your way to the store to buy bras I'm
all down for it I believe I am a 36 be
my sister looks exactly like me but
she's got huge tits and yeah I'm jealous
but also like I can wear more things
probably usually an A but sometimes imma
be I just stay away from bras I am a 36d
which means like I need a pretty good
bra my ideal bra is a brawler because
they're comfy I'm always looking for the
best t-shirt bra that I can wear a white
tank over and it looks like I'm not
wearing anything I want to find a really
good bra that does not break my bank one
that I can afford while living in New
York City that would be pretty great
okay so I'm gonna go try on some bras
bye
sorry okay
supersoft and it has like this little
side thing so that your boob doesn't
like spill it on the side which I kind
of like it might be a little big or it's
just that all my other bras are smaller
which is the possibility I feel like
this is a good everyday bra I could wear
this under all my t-shirts and I'd be
super comfy so kind of feels like the
material in Spanx if you want a good bra
then I can see paying for you for this I
love this color and it's super cute and
it's really comfortable this is
definitely NSFW I like this one a lot
I'm surprised this is not one I would
have ever picked out to purchase this is
why I don't really wear bra let's I have
boobs on the side I got under boob I can
do this feel like you could go to
Coachella and wear this as a top this is
definitely gonna go in my bra that
collection and I feel like this is a
staple bra line it is so so soft if my
boobs could be on the cloud right now
that's what this is a little small I
think I would want a little more support
I don't have big tits I could probably I
could definitely get away with it's not
as comfy as I thought and I'm kind of
disappointed but it looks really good
it's not like the greatest support make
girls are at my waistline but it's so
soft like I wouldn't even care I want to
take a nap in this bra I want to step
tea I want to eat popcorn I want to
watch Netflix in this bra I looked at
this bra and I thought it was like gonna
be like increase your boobies to cup
sizes but it's not one like that at all
this one makes me feel pretty this is
what middle school Delaney would
consider lingerie
I think this bras also to streamline
comfortable always want a bra that makes
you feel good and pretty even though no
one can see it or maybe someone can see
it I think it has good support I don't
want to leg test it too much on my boobs
flop out it does its job I feel like a
bra should be like a boyfriend
for all those girls out there having
trouble finding the right bra might be a
little easier than you think so
pleasantly surprised I feel like I'm
always looking to like on something
but I actually really really loved these
even if it's something you wouldn't
usually pick out I think try it because
like I learned what the bralette it can
be awesome
I think Calvin Klein's too my favorite
but that's just like kind of a given I
was not a believer of the traditional
bra but now I'm down to buy a bra now
let me know that I can just buy bras
online and have them shipped to my door
stop I'm just never gonna leave my couch
alright peace Rachel and Vanessa out and
I'm taking this bra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
