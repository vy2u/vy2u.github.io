it's a boyfriend
I need a stepping on a relationship it's
fine guys today we are trying Amazon's
top selling lipsticks
whoa I am a prime member and I'm happily
been a prime member for the last three
years and I shop on Amazon all the time
but for everything except beauty I've
never ordered anything from Amazon in my
life
what literally never I use Amazon for
everything my groceries are delivered
from Amazon I will try all-in lipsticks
in the shops and I hope you know I'll
take my recommendations from friends and
see how it looks and then our order
online it's definitely a risk to order
Beauty online especially when you
haven't used it before and especially
like a whoops sake let's get these
lipsticks on I'm ready
I dare you hiya Luger my hell is it a
silent J yeah Jimmy jelly lipstick Oh me
fully designed with gold flakes and real
watch oh it's the flower wine ohh-oh-oh
hose now it's like an expander
gadget-gadget I'm like a spy but with
lipstick pretty sure I feel decadent and
rich like a Roman Emperor I feel like I
would hang loose from the sale I'm
already feeling feelings but not good
ones there's no flame there's no fire
it's pink there call this dream per mole
like no I'm literally dreaming this yeah
this by 8 the gold things I don't think
you should eat the gold things I don't
want me to even attempt to samosa gets
better shut the front door they have
Lime Crime Line Prague I've never I've
always what does it try there's a lot of
things about Lime Crime that I will not
go in depth about it's a great product
ooh I like the applicator brush it feels
spongy
yeah it smells like cake don't make that
noise I'm gonna marry this lipstick that
color looks like old like velvet
curtains Burt's Bees I know
chopstick okay it's also good already
I'm in love or at least in deep like
it's like saturated there it's a good
payoff it feels yeah super payoff and it
feels moisturizing tune-up looks good on
you
you sure yeah even though it's not matte
which is my favorite lipstick kind of
texture I don't mind this this would get
on anything I had like I can't eat with
this and so that's like a no be be great
for like an afternoon job yeah
this come on there it is Kat Von D is it
an awesome knockoff I know
Kat Von D's on first of all I don't
support not buying Kat Von D because I
love Kat money but it's black so I love
it this is efforts like I'm dragging it
across my lips they're like I have to
dip it more than I want to dip it with
Kat Von D and you only need it once I
feel like I put on 17 coats and it's not
all there who did this
why I hate how much this is working I
guess it would look nice in a photo it
doesn't feel good you what I mean I
would do it but I don't know I love a
green lipstick I have never worn one but
I love seeing it on people I heard about
this oh yeah what is it I don't I can't
even tell if it's doing anything neither
can i it feels like a ball is very ball
made
oh but it's definitely turning see you
can tell I like inking up see the way my
pigment is sets up my lip is pretty
though I don't think my mystery turn
green it's cool no it's not I'm lying
yes isn't even cool I don't even know
what I do I'm just pretty good I put
this on my table right you could look at
it no it doesn't work okay
I'm a little confused but the Internet
is a confusing place so gimmick was cool
you know I love a lipstick that has a
flower of gold flakes and but what does
that then do like expectation
expectation expectation reality I
definitely support the fact of people
like trying new makeups in general you
know like that's awesome but you don't
have to go on the internet for that
sometimes you can go in like experience
in real life too I'm gonna stick to
Amazon from a DVDs and from a prime Day
special
let's go out you look like you're about
to have a damn party
