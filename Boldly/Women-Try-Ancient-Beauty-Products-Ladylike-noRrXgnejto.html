boys are just like I like you better
when you're not wearing makeup like this
is probably where it started for such a
good point we are trying out ancient
mini rituals mmm right isn't that what
this is gonna be like you should give me
some mud and be like Willy on this
foundation I feel like I have tried
ancient makeup before my mom has some
 left from the 80s I'm afraid I'm
gonna learn that I'm allergic to
something but I didn't know about before
to be interesting the whole the kind of
see like how things evolved you're like
makeup didn't come in many shades then
so yeah this may be a bad day for me
Cleopatra was known for bathing in milk
and honey is also known for yeast
infections do you feel like this yeah
thing maybe just go into the honey and
just we'll just see what happens even
though I look you want to chug this milk
I mean it's just like you're putting
soup on your face oh you guys smells
like all of the lunchboxes oh this
weirdly feels like it's gonna make me
break out more I would not use milk on
my skin ever again I feel like a used
band-aid right now it was good enough
for Cleo I'm not gonna turn my nose up
at it I'll turn my nose I've had it I
don't this goes against everything I
stand for Oh straight up just put the
chalk on our faces okay is this
the same set that used like powder wigs
I'm gonna powder my hair because racism
oh whoa Oh lots of fallout oh god she's
getting everywhere Oh something about
chalk just kind of smells fresh though
you know it doesn't seem like you would
even be attractive I think I look pretty
attractive right now I just feel
exceptionally like I have a ton of
dandruff
during the masa judge
I mean I'm gonna period right now very
unhappy so this is pretty good for me
but a lot of sweet things on their faces
aren't the Flies just coming for you I
don't think there's a right way to do
this but I'm pretty sure of doing it
wrong what did they use well I guess you
didn't really need makeup removers back
with makeup remover was the river it's
actually really difficult to blend and
it dries down very fast
so you gotta be quick I'm trying I'm
trying I'm kind of into the mulberry
how's that it looks like blood
I mean it's overdone just just keep
eating it a cold Koh l-not coa oh it's
not from yeah no then what is this wow
this is the OG cat i rounds were a thing
back then I wonder what ancient Sephora
was like I love this you shouldn't blend
it with your fingers oh oh it starts off
not that strong and then suddenly it's
like that's a lot of pigment I'm really
going hardcore with my brows with this
isn't really into it color wise it looks
like any regular makeup consistency wise
it's very much a powder so it's
difficult to apply with I think the
level of precision that we're used to
your eyes look nice can your bro I know
they're nice aren't they Cleopatra had a
lot of skill to be able to do such a
sharp cat eye with powder it's like
doing the crossword in pen
I feel dressed I just I feel like sticky
I didn't realize that the phrase beauty
is pain has been around for forever it
is crazy how the principle of it is the
same line your eyes make your lips
redder make your cheeks red I admire
ancient women they're trying to hustle
and they're just using what they have
I'm jealous
I'm jealous of your ability to turn
berries into actual face cosmetics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
