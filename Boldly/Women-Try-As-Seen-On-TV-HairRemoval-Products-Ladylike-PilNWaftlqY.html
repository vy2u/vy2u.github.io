gym it's sort of like hey you got to be
careful there's a lot of sharp turns
this could probably like navigate that a
little bit better I'm talking about the
Virginia today we're going to try some
As Seen on TV hair removal products we
got lots of hair everywhere to take off
we got stashed on Pitt hit us with the
first product you sandpaper your hair
off like your piece of wood the big one
is from wherever and the smaller one is
for like for sensitive period out oh
it's a little rough but in vibrate this
is like a terrible trip to Home Depot
burns real bad so this is only making my
skin drier Oh fine oh my Apple would
hurt a razor is so much faster than this
but less fun it worked it did not work
for me no it actually where no pain the
gross part that we have to like stand
ourselves in order to make people feel
better about our bodies it's smelly oh
it worked better than I thought it would
I thought it was just gonna injure me
and instead if you know injured me a
little but it also took the hair off I
have used for this before oh there's a
blade there's like looping blades
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's all gone
whoa it's like a lawn mower I wouldn't
let this near my nipple but I imagine if
you had more precision this could be
good for nipple hair it's a phone rake
this is just a tiny razor what's the
point
evidence that works not the no no the
yes looks like a vibrator sounds like a
vibrator and it's called yes finishing
touch this is heavy duty
its motion sentence you can turn it on
but won't actually start doing anything
until you press it to your skin this
tickles I don't know if I want a razor
that's smarter than me oh wait if you
mow it like this that's when you get
it were they faster than a razor were
they faster than waxing not really even
the beginning one that's just like a
little sander works which was shocking
to me if their purpose is to get in
crevices then I would say they're useful
they're good at exploring the cave
they're not good at mowing the lawn this
is a vibrator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
