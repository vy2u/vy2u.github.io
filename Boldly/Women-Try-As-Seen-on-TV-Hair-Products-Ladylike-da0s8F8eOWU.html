just be faster to wear a hat
I see on TV hair products hair products
that are bought at 11:00 and night when
you're bored and sad I honestly don't
think any of this stuff will work on my
hair we both have a lot of hair they're
on a lot of women with natural hair in
the commercials but I could be surprised
you're giving the ball yeah yeah you
know I'm trying to be fair here this is
when I turned off the TV because it was
me like are you lacking volume no
mounted above it it bumps itself heart
hair across the crown of the head
I'm already lost like this yeah here I
you drop yours yeah he's from scalp to
about 3 inches high Wow
wait what uh-uh Oh God
ooh I'm gonna do it no I bump it insert
firmly on Scottie you you bow then I
didn't fan out of hair over bump it
fluffing even so basically this step is
make sure no one can see your damn
puppet oh oh my god oh my it does not
look bad I look like a conehead I'm mad
it is hard to do it right but when you
do it's worth it hairs Gani aah oh my
god don't do that I'm not sure really
clever because I feel like these
instructions would immediately get
dropped in the toilet
oh this is not gonna hold hair broke
yours no I didn't
Oh sandwich hair at the nape of the neck
sandwich me okay sandwich was it broken
no you can probably do this really well
is Chantal and the other end up and over
the white arrange hair across origami
then pull down boom oh my god I do it
which style are you going
who even thought of this who was like oh
I love those snap bracelets let's put
them in my hair was it a man glam twirl
create 100 dazzling here's that rapid oh
my gosh are so many instruction I don't
even know where to begin
just a thread through the hole you run
it through the hole you got to put it in
the hole I'm so scared I'm scared too
that's a terrible sound so I go up maybe
we are supposed to keep it up and this
is scope popper I pushed down effort ohh
oh my god it's beautiful
got caught it got caught I cannot
believe that this works yep not for
black people I'm tired
my hair is worse we are adult women and
I still felt like I was in danger about
half the time raise your hand if you've
been personally victimized by the bumpit
I like the idea of products that make it
easier to do your hair I just think
those were not the products most of them
are two person jobs yeah you definitely
need a friend I ripped out so much of my
hair really what we're saying is that
these as seen on tv products are
worthwhile because they can show you who
your real friends are real friends don't
let your hair get caught in rap
mechanism waiting like not approved yeah
I mean to be fair that one strand is
really curled 78 strands to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
