like stir-fry I do I have a wok at home
I know that's not what we're doing today
welcome to Benihana my name is Oscar

favorite part about Benihana is
definitely the onion volcano it's a
volcano with onions yeah but what is the
volcano I don't know how it works but it
is an onion and it's also volcano which
is magic do you wear the hat every time
yeah when we cook into the front you
look married probably with right now did
you not look like I put it all inside
it's a bonnet Freddy it is it's straight
opposed to the bonnet so all right hey
how you doing I'm good I want to always
hold your board and your knife
across music my little neck

gonna make some fried rice with Oscar
Dan you wanna do your April go grab it

start from the front move the spatula
don't hold it hold the onion in place in
your hat sure Oh close did you get it Oh
guys my dreams are coming true
very little veggies now you don't want
to give it a good chop
oh right now the goal is to make some
fried rice and then serve it to my
friends all I'm trying to do today is
take some of the things I've learned
from the lesson and make a lunch that is
even a quarter as tasty is what we made
at the restaurant on this grill right
now there is butter there's garlic
there's a little bit of oil there's a
little bit of soy sauce
earlier today my intern Kelly helped me
dice some green peppers and then we also
dice some onions next I'm gonna add just
a little bit of salt and the vegetables
we're gonna let simmer for a little bit
do we have that we have the rice spoon
did we see with that one fighting chance
we're gonna add the rice so the rice we
cooked earlier ow
it's really hot don't touch it the rice
is done cooking about 15 minutes I've
brought in my intern Daniel to taste it
it's really good
all right thanks Daniel okay I'm gonna
mix the vegetables and the rice together
now because of the amount of rice I'm
gonna make two eggs I brought in Freddy
and soft - come join me at the table and
they can be the judges of the rice I
just made you look breakfast it does
either you guys want to mash it all
together
no really I immediately pointed to
Freddy like you would want it no I'm sad
about it but I'll do it look like hash
brown you're being particularly reserved
with this rice right now final step once
you cook your rice and you've mixed all
the ingredients together is to serve it
