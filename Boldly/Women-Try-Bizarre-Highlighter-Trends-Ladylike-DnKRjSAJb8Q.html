turned into something that I didn't
expect we are trying crazy bizarre
highlighters trans people are getting
crazy on the internet with highlighters
I've never highlighted before but I've
watched soft and Freddie talk about it
highlighting is using kind of shimmery
things to accentuate the highest parts
of your face it is true artistry and it
takes a lot of skill and talent but
sometimes I just miss putting on blush
we're gonna go hollow traffic you may be
a hollow sexual in which case this video
may arouse we'll see who comes out alive
so you're gonna do this Jay Charles
Beauty look on me there's no tutorial I
just have a picture of what he's done
and so I'm just going in this is such a
weird distracting nipple I like it it's
a little bit of a surprise I'm hoping
that it shows up really pretty on my
skin tone will blend into oblivion which
is what usually happens when I contour
anyways I've never had anyone put makeup
in my ears before is it sexual it's a
little arousing
don't look at it yeah okay I mean it's a
look unless I have a music festival that
I really need to get to I'm not sure
when this would be the most practical
know about the face not the bird face
anything but the bird face this blue
moon I would expect to be kind of more
icy and blue but when I put it on it
still is very much purple very where to
avoid the cat eye at all costs I'm
almost wondering if I just do kind of
like one side of your face never mind
that's a terrible idea don't know
they're just like one kind of like semi
harsh line that I'm not at right here
when in doubt buff it out I don't think
I did a great job it's not really close
to the picture but it's something show
me my face open oh wow I'm fine oh you
know I can't look like Frosty the
Snowman this is a really good kind of
fun right I like it I'm into it I'm
really surprised at how well the color
showed up on my skin tones now I gotta
put some stuff on Chantelle's face so
I'm gonna do this Cromie look on SAFF it
looks like there's really only a couple
of colors that I'll be using or that she
used at least bitter laced beauties
rainbow palette was sold out so Freddy
made her own and I'll be doing some of
that on Chantelle's my face already off
to a rocky start
you just plunge right in that that
looks cool it's not an eyesore good this
is not an eyesore bye Freddy
no this is a very chilled look compared
on the other ways I'm taking smaller
individual brushes to just reinforce the
colors of the rainbow and make it a
little bit more pigmented what she's
just like chroming out all the parts of
the body that protrude feel very at
peace I don't know what it looks like
but I don't really care
why's my body moving are you gonna do a
cloud that's it are you done I'm done
okay yes that's one side oh oh this is
fun
I look like the tinny woman I love it
that's okay there's a there's a little
sweetness to it
you know from the intense rubbing my
face just got I thought it would be
worse but it actually looks quite nice
it looks like Chantelle was like
visiting a preschool and they were like
the ice to make up and she was like all
right Freddie also made this cute Pizza
highlighter which we wanted to use in
this video because we made it for this
video but we did not have any use for it
in this video so Freddie how was this
experience for he highlighting is hard
if you're going for it looks like this
it's really tough and it really takes a
lot of a lot of skill it was fun to try
it out to see if it was like actually
doable by regular people we have a
greater appreciation for makeup artists
and highlighting artists that we did a
pretty good job I was pretty proud of us
and this pizza highlighter is cute
because it's like a rose gold if you
swash it all together
lady tested lady shimmer lady we did a
thing yeah lady you bet we did it lady
you got the look you've got to look hey
y'all click on that post over there see
more videos from our channel some of our
favorites are in there and some we like
just okay
but watch anyway because we love you
yeah I'm sleepin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
