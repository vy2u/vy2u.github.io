face right now do you feel like the fear
I think that body here is natural I
think I just shave it when I remember -
I don't know
I get very cold find it helps keep me
warm I feel like society stresses that
women should always be like super shaved
and smooth and have no body hair which
is ridiculous I've never had any waxing
whatsoever ever I feel like saying wax
and they're just like torture to your
kuduk at the thought of paying someone
to do something very painful to me has
like never appealed to me at a certain
point most women get a Brazilian wax in
their life so I'm thinking why not maybe
I am overreacting you know maybe this
isn't as bad as I think it is you know
maybe I'll go in and it'll be like like
a little pinch you know done my name is
Rachel Lynn and I'm the owner of proper
puss salon I love writing an excellent
environment for people to come in to
make them feel special and waxing is
definitely a healthier version of hairy
Louisville billion it's light breeze
across my genitals I feel like just as
weird as the first time I went to the
gyno I think that was not bad
picking up the butt oh okay cool oh my
gosh I just want an air again Oh God
it's just I feel pretty calm oh this is
the worst thing I've ever felt in my
life
I think it's as soon as your body
realizes it's not and a whole lot of
danger it's what it calms itself
[Laughter]
excuse me I feel like I'm gonna sauna
we're heading closer in I might actually
convert to waxing after this just really
like the feeling of the hot wax got my
skin how far would you say we are in
this process oh whoa I'm good I am good
hitting me like a racehorse ah okay that
was a that was a solid time if that's
the ripping part class is actually quite
nice pretty much what happened here I
think I like it but it's really strange
to me because I've never seen my pelvic
area completely naked it's been two days
since I've gotten my first Brazilian wax
this is gonna sound kind of lame but
he's very proud of myself is a lot
better than I thought it was gonna be
Adriana the waxer was just very good at
her job it wasn't a big deal I don't
know she just made me switch my legs in
one way and another way honestly I do
understand why some people would get
like a wax I see it the same way is
getting a facial or like a really nice
manicure I am glad that I know I don't
want to have this experience again pain
wise I would do it again try a Brazilian
wax if you've never done it even if you
feel very comfortable with your body
here which I am it still actually might
feel pretty nice ain't all about mind
over matter see look at me now not even
flinching Oh God
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
