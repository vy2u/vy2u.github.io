cheeks are very nicely rosy I love all
blushes I love creams I love powders we
all know drugstore brands that are like
just as good as luxury brands I don't
know sometimes I do think you get what
you pay for but maybe I just like to
tell myself that after I spend $30 on a
lipstick super great colors these are
really really on trend yeah a
little-little row single intense I just
got so embarrassed on one side of my lip
this is a nice color let's see how it's
just very like matte help me light it
feels like it's a little industrial I
would probably think this was like
mid-range
something you'd find at Sephora yeah but
you got yet very plastic
yeah it's plastic eat I'm gonna with
eight around ten like eight to ten
Laurens on the money
oh I don't know that I would pay dollars
for this dude this is gorgeous I want
this oh okay it's like a baby Chris he
just looks like she told someone's
secret I'm just like shaking it feels
really nice actually this looks like a
very natural palette felt exactly the
same as the elf blush yeah who needs
this mom I have a few blushes and
they're all separate although I don't
know how much is what would you ask I
would say like 20 to 30 holy it's a very
pigmented which is what you're paying
for I would buy it if it came with like
fewer options but then also was reduced
in francs this is some like professional
ash this is for people who like have
ring lights in front of their mirrors
before they go out
alright that what it is more than make
up I think it's art okay this is
pigmented which means it's a little
offensive yeah made in Italy pigmented
quilted pressed look to it it's got a
sparkle in it I love Tom Ford he is just
everything to me it's $80 you yeah that
seems about right $80 I don't think if
the quality sound much higher in the
Smashbox it's very soft and it blends
very nicely
Smashbox was a little hard for it to
move around on the face for $80 this
blush should like transform my face yeah
I think a lot of the time the price
difference comes from the packaging and
not necessarily the quality I love the
hell phone I want a middle ground
between Elfen Smashbox but I did really
like elf oh yes most compact had most
amount of shades that seemed to actually
work with what you wear in real life I
feel like I'm looking next 15 to 20
dollar blush that is markedly better
than elf and that's it yeah I would love
it if the compact like every time I
opened it Tom Ford gave me a compliment
I see your hair is look it's so great
even though you just woke up I'm like
Tom ha
