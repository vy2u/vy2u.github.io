me for this but they want their
lipsticks to be able to double as a sex
toy
I love lipstick I wear it every day
I don't feel complete without it I feel
like I tend to avoid lipstick a lot
because I can't color inside the lines
it's for special occasions only and when
I don't wash my hair to distract or not
if I'm testing out like some blues or
some greens or some colors that I don't
usually mess with I'll pay $8 the stuff
I know was good I'll pay with 25 the
most expensive lipstick I've ever bought
Kylie Jenner's lip kit for $29 I'll pay
$25 for a brown lipstick if it's going
to be the lipstick of my life
I like wet and wild oh wow oh okay great
it brings back such good memories I like
this color I don't think I've used wet
and wild since I was like 12 dark wine
well this isn't my color palette like
this is our very color it's definitely
gonna be on my pee okay so the texture
reminds me of eighth grade it actually
doesn't have that bad of a smell either
I mean it smells like chemicals but like
a good chemical this color features me
this goes on like surprisingly smoothly
if I was like experimenting with makeup
and wanted to see if this was a color
for me I would buy this because I'm
assuming it's like four dollars well
seven thousand I would jug I'm doing me
yeah if you could find a video mmm
sleep this is Suzy I want these on
display this is magnetic Oh what what
this feels really nice wait I like
thought wet-and-wild felt really good
but now I feel like this is way better
oh I love this is a winner yeah I would
pay 20 bucks for this this feels way
softer than when well now I feel like
when wad was like sandpaper compared to
I think if you if you have if it's
important to you in your budget to to
have like makeups that are expensive and
are gonna last longer and be more
efficient yeah hair then like yeah Pro
this one but you know con $20
look how good it looks with my nails no
I don't even want to use that either I
feel like I'm looking okay but look at
also between these three if you needed
to line your lips it'd be Tom Ford look
at that point we in line and then you
could fill these you just kind of got to
like make your lips mm-hmm it feels
really nice so I'm gonna be wrong but
looking at it on I feel like the Mac
looks better I don't like it I don't
like it
she don't like it mm-hmm this looks
like you mix it with water I could be
the richest thing walking around these
here United States of America and I
still don't think I would pay $55 for
any tea lipstick if you're gonna pay $55
for this it would be to not use it
because it's just like pretty right yeah
I want to vote this one the first one
the best because it's 75 cents literally
you can walk down the street find a
dollar and make yourself look good yeah
so I'm kind of like rooting for the
underdog but realistically I would buy
the Mac one I tend to think that a lot
of makeup is about finding your fave
like your fave in like your staple one
so like it's a coat you really really
really love and like then I would say
spend more but if I tell you just like
we said testing or trying like this
little buddy bed goes to show that like
money doesn't necessarily equal quality
after a certain point like yes between
75 cents and 20 dollars there's on
market difference from 20 to 55 no when
you have this lipstick you better have
the rest of the outfit to pull it off
you got to look like a full-fledged
entire $55 lipstick product so if you
got this but you don't have nothing
nothing else to go with it then don't do
it just go just be as you are first of
all have you seen Tom Ford whoa heaven
is my endless bottle really he's fine I
think that's already fine hello Thomas
uh-huh
know that humper damn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
