a prince or go through an entire frat
house to find the boyfriend so today we
are trying special green makeup that
supposedly reacts with your ph level to
create the perfect rosy hue it's really
hard for me to find like a shade that
usually works for me in makeup overall
for our Korean I have pretty dark skin
so I'm naturally very pale a lot of
things can wash me out I have to be
really picky
a lot of things will be too dark on me
or too light on me so trying to find
that perfect balance could be a bit of a
challenge
what grow I'm a like Kermit the Frog
after the nasty frogs it feels okay oh I
just put my finger on it and came my
pink it feels like what you would get
from like limited to cuz I don't know
it's a bit I just feel like I'm rubbing
oil on my face that feels greasy and
sticky this is it anything happened put
a little bit too much on but it's not
showing up it is getting darker yeah I
think it gives you a very nice healthy
glow I feel like a blushing bride shiny
as hell now look at green when you first
put it on that's looking nuts on you on
yours it just looks like a clear loss
maybe my pH balance just isn't what it
used to be I like the color not so much
the actual feeling of the lip gloss this
isn't a color I would normally put on
myself oh my god it's so pink right now
oh but there are same green sparkles
it's still I just put some on my hand
and it's green on my hand right now this
literally feels like the same
consistency as the blush Oh Oh God
that's moisturizing it looks like my
lips are sunburned yours is turning into
like a darker pink I like go a lot
it said it was going to change into a
shade of pink and that is what it did
truthful marketing the color looks fine
on here I think it did change to a color
that is fairly complementary to my skin
but it's not the color I would choose
it's very Lizzie McGuire chic hey now
hey now this is what dreams are made of
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
