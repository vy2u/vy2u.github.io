I'm about to slam some hot dogs today
I'm excited because I think I might be
good at this I'm kind of just here SAFF
told me to come and I said I showed up
most of ladylike videos are like about
makeup and style and I was like how many
hot dogs can we eat I am very interested
in how much I can actually eat because I
have to actively stop myself every meal
I can eat a lot more than anyone ever
expects me to eat I think I've been a
loon
I think I'm gonna be somewhere in the
middle I don't think I'm gonna be in
last place but now that I've said that I
might be in last place and I will feel
terrible after the fact but it's never
not worth to eat a lot I love hot dogs
and I'm nervous
eating them competitively will ruin my
relationship with hot dogs for the rest
of my life I think I'm most nervous
about the innuendos my name is Mary
Bowers I'm major league eating number 41
ranked competitive eater in the world
I'm here today to teach ladylike how to
eat competitively I am dressed up in
preparation for the Nathan's Famous hot
dog eating contests on July 4th in Coney
Island New York I dress up for every
competition in the food that I'm about
to consume and today it's hot dogs
Mary is about to teach us the technique
for what we're about to do how do you
not choke there's always an EMT at all
of the major league eating events we
have kale in the corner who's our EMT
hello thank you yeah in a contest
what you'll see people do is they'll
separate the hotdog and the bun here
grab a hot dog okay you prefer like a
sweet food competition or like a savory
food so a weird thing happens the first
couple of bites in a contest you can
taste the food but after you start
picking up momentum and eating more you
can't taste the food anymore
if you want to go quickly one method
please just snap straight in half so
then in at once do they separate the
competition for men and women or do you
compete alongside the guys so the only
competition that separates the men and
the women is in hot dogs all of the
other contests we are at the same table
and even in the hot dog eating contest
we get equal pay which is nice you'll
see competitive eaters dunking the bun
into liquid so different competitors
have different drinks that they like to
use try it dunking the bun in the water
and then it goes in the mouth straight
to the back of the throat and just drink
drink the bun I'm so upset just the
thought of shoving things in my mouth
almost made me V word oh no no we don't
use the V word at all in competitive
eating it is called a reversal of
fortune I think we you you build a
tolerance over time you don't just wake
up one morning and say oh I'm just gonna
go run a marathon what you build up over
time so basically not what we're doing
today yeah pretty much
I'm so hungry I'm hungry so I think
that'll help I also am bloated I'm
bloated from one hot dog but I feel like
maybe that's good because my stomach is
like stretching I'm feeling pretty
nervous I think I've come to the
realization that I will not win welcome
to the very first ever BuzzFeed ladylike
hot dog eating championship I hope that
I'm in third place cuz then I didn't
lose but I also didn't not win I fear
more so that bready might get sick
because she couldn't even keep a bun
down and vomit freaks me out from dead
oh wow we're starting yeah my money's on
Jen what my money's on Jen
the sad thing is I've been confident the
entire way through
I think Jensen talking about this all a
day long so she has the willpower it's
definitely more of like a mental battle
but if anybody's gain because you know
if you do too much you bite off more
than you can see that can be a fatal
flaw here I'm hearing some groan this is
where eaters are kidding what is known
as the wall but we all know that in life
as in eating we push through the wall
there's always the possibility of the
dreaded reversal of fortune keep in mind
ladies and gentlemen the world record
for hot dogs at the Nathan's Famous
Coney Island hot dog eating championship
is currently 69 hot dogs and buns in ten
minutes and we look like we are on track
to beat today
version by block I had a reversal I
tried to swallow too much fun and then I
started choking and then I was like I'm
not gonna die today one of the things
that you really have to watch is breath
control I think she may have been
holding her breath ready has had a
consistent pace throughout that's what I
like to hear
like a full five and we have
I think the contest was really very
impressive performance from everybody we
all feel terrible I feel pretty
lightheaded hearing those newcomers do
usually around five hot dogs from the
start
hot dogs one and two were a breeze hot
dogs three four and five were like no no
no
at one point towards the end I didn't
think I was going to have a reversal of
fortune having everyone around and just
like cheering and like sort of invested
in what we were doing is really cool
this also gave me mad respect for these
people like I think about Joey Chestnut
who had 69 my god oh my god so proud of
Lee like like everybody was really I
think on board with this whole process
all day long I'm done I feel you would
at fame I need to go home so we lady
tested this and it is lady mighty
impressed I'm impressed
lady impressed lay dead lady very very
dead we out
