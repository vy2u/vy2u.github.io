here I am sitting here is sticking
on my fingers I kind of regret though
today we're doing a do-it-yourself gel
manicure and I feel like naked without
having nail polish on so I usually get a
manicure or something once a week I like
to think of myself as a nail Pro but I
keep it like super 101 just nail polish
I've painted my nails before it hasn't
looked too good
I'm gonna do my left hand I'm like oh
not bad not bad and then you switch over
and it's just like a horror show it
sounds like they're stickers that go on
my fingernails they sound fancy because
it has the word gel in them I don't
really do gel that often just cuz I feel
like it kind of destroys the nails a
little bit I'm excited about a little
scared cuz I'm doing it myself I hope it
goes well included inside two strips of
eight adhesive nail stickers to fit all
nail sizes they're trying to take into
consideration that some people have fat
nails and some people don't I'm gonna
start with my pinky nail I think I have
mid fat nails is this another set of
directions I should be looking at this
actually comes off pretty easily they're
telling me to file this I need scissors
definitely I think you need to have long
nails for this oh wow oh it came through
but I don't have any of the design it's
just like black nails this is the most
boring thing to have to sit and watch
someone do instead of a topcoat there is
a blacklight flashlight yeah black light
good for seeing bodily fluids on my
fingers I don't even want to finish this
kind of feels like it melted it slowly
now I don't have to look at the dirt
under my nails I think this is a really
good product for someone who has let's
say experience doing gel nails but if
you're not gonna taking directions like
I am or reading directions and following
them I don't
this is for you or for me I actually
really like them shockingly this sticker
gel manicure is definitely up my nail
game if I figure out how to use a nail
file I think I'll be really good at this
if these are a same gel nail that's just
like a better version they don't destroy
your nails and I definitely wouldn't use
them again I feel like this is some
Punk'd video I'm just gonna keep going
like nothing's wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
