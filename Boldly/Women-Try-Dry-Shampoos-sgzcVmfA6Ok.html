makeup for this video you know living
proof is by far the best dry shampoo I
don't do my hair that often as you can
tell I also sweat a lot because I'm an
active sexual human I have uses since I
was about like 15 in England this is
from England - my friend recommends it
to me and I was like what earth is dry
shampoo and it's been a godsend ever
since I love baby powder as dry shampoo
because you can literally find it
everywhere it's cheap and it's super
effective okay so not only does this
take out the oils in your hair but it
actually cleans your hair it comes in
like a ton of different fragrances it
even comes in like different colors for
a different colored hair I have tried
other brands of dry shampoo but I always
go back to my baby powder did you smell
this smell this I currently have like so
much in my head and it seems okay place
thing doesn't have to be Johnson you can
go generic sometimes that's even cheaper
it's a little on the pricier side but
I'm willing to shell out gives you a
little volume it's pretty cheap
you could literally go without showering
for weeks if you wanted to it with dry
shampoo my relationship with dry shampoo
is currently non-existent because I
haven't found one that works for me yet
I've never tried dry shampoo before
mostly because I find all the brands way
too overwhelming so typically my hair
does look a little oily after a couple
days I mean I have fine hair but I have
a lot of it and I go to the gym almost
every day so I sweat I have pretty
greasy hair I wash my hair every single
day dry shampoos like if you find a
really good one you're loyal to that
brand for like the rest of your life and
I'm ready to make that step because I
wish I didn't have to wash my hair every
day it wastes a lot of water I don't
really like showering ooh okay have a
feeling it's going to make it wipes
this one looks fancy all right I'm ready
to be lazy and not wash my hair all week
it smells really good it's been like
five minutes since I sprayed this stuff
and I have to say the smell is very
strong but it does look like it's giving
me some volume my hair doesn't feel oily
at all so so far I like it I like the
consistency I like that's holding the
shape that I just put my hair into it
cut feels like it's tangling up my hair
the only thing is that I kept touching
my head all day and I would come away
with this like powdery stuff that it
leaves on your hair so I've been running
my hands through my hair this entire car
ride and that tangley feeling kind of
went away scent is a little strong for
me there's no residue there's no grease
it's like a great experience power it
has a really nice smell
it's like clean and fresh smells a
little bit like bug spray it's a one
thing I'm noticing it's really hard to
get the white stuff like brushed out I
like that is the biggest purse world
problem it doesn't feel sticky like the
living proof did and it doesn't feel
tangle the either I could tell this one
is giving me a lot of volume which I
definitely need only thing that's really
annoying is that it's clearly left some
stains on my forehead you definitely
soaked up all the oils you kind of got
that nasty white residue on my hands at
the end of the day like maybe a little
bit greasy but for the most part looks
pretty fresh so I decided to test
sitting outside with dry shampoo it's
still clean
I wore an all-white top just in case of
any baby powder sprinkles also this is
the one I'm most nervous for you can't
mistake the baby powder smell it's not
bad but it's a little overwhelming it
looks like I'm getting ready to play
like an old lady in a play feel like
I've gotten it in there to the best of
my ability at least essentially it does
the same damn thing definitely looks a
little bit cleaner it's not giving me
that clean feeling that the dry shampoos
I used Ed didn't really hold
well like the throw out like midway
through the day I just kind of felt
greasy it did not do the trick my hair
is totally oily so the baby powder
worked pretty well for me actually it
just didn't really give me very much
volume so my hair felt really heavy all
day okay okay
I'm the winner is Vettes and the winner
is living proof and the teeth is the
winner not the best way but it's not the
worst way it's not the worst way it's
just not the way things are the best way
it's the best okay and the winner is
ah
I'm not so happy I also can't knock it
because I've never tried it
well I've never tried that either so
that is true it doesn't matter what wins
as long as our hair doesn't look
disgusting and all these things do that
they make your hair less disgusting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
