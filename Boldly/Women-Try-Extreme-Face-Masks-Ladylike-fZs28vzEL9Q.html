feel like Freddy Krueger I feel that
rage that he probably felt we've all
heard about those gross intense decadent
face masks a lot of people love them but
we're a little scared can snow mucus
really give you the skin of a goddess
it's ladylike and we're trying extreme
face masks so I've never had a facial
really never had such good skin that I'm
ever gonna facial well yeah that's the
thing so like I have really like strong
skin like it's not sensitive at all so I
don't really pay much attention to it
I growing up had pretty bad acne as what
I would get facials and peels all the
time because it would help a lot with it
and it would help any when we do beneath
the skin my skin did have a nice glow to
it that I feel like it kind of doesn't
anymore
I do have two pimples that would be cool
if they could calm the F down in general
I just want to see what the hype is
about we have three types of mass today
that we're gonna try out we're gonna try
a 24 karat gold masks so I don't want
that one I want that we also have a
placenta masks and then we have snail
mucus we're gonna pull straws to see
which one of us gets lips now yes gold
so badly which ones that oh I get the
snail mucus yeah okay cool let's go do
it come on come on
alright I'm about to put this snail
hydrogel mask on my face I know that
snow was supposed to be the worst one
but I'm very open to it it's supposed to
have a whitening effect which could be
helpful because I do have some lingering
acne scars to help lift and firm skin
in part and apples grow there you go
it's like we're gel not like play-doh it
feels how you would expect a placenta
masks to feel if you like a mightyduck
I feel like a sexy Tin Man it's cold and
it's gooey and it's nothing that I ever
wanted to experience I think I'm done 20
to 30 minutes I'm hungry I don't know
how long it's been but I decided to take
it off oh I think I was only supposed to
have this one for 10 to 15 years this is
very different from any cheap mask of
everyone's before cuz usually sheet
nests her paper I imagine my face to
show like a lot clearer you are fasting
Cleopatra and I'm a whole lot of woman
thanks for your question right now feel
very dewy and a little sticky my skin
kind of feels like moisturize doesn't
feel dry or anything it just feels feels
new I feel like this stuff was more of
just like an overall experience
if irritation and redness and
exasperated skin were my skin concerns
still mucus did not help I do feel like
it did sort of rejuvenate the skin so I
mean I feel like I did its job okay so
we put these masks on our faces we did
it this definitely makes me want to get
back into facial care like it just feels
so nice and I feel like we all really do
actually look rejuvenated like I said
before I've never done a face mask or
gotten a facial and I could for sure see
myself just like exploring different
options $80 for a mask me but I will say
that there are a lot of inexpensive
sheet masks that are super fun so why
not try crazy masks the lady tested
lady light but lady be smart with your
money is that what I was supposed to say
you pointed at me and then I got nerve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
