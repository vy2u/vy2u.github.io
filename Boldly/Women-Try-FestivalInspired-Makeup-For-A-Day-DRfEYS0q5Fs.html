looks like Coachella today we're trying
festival inspired makeup when I think of
Coachella looks I think of just like a
lot of gemstones
I think the festival looks is generally
sort of mystical magical unicorn very
free and fun it's a place where it's
like really accepted for you to go out
be kind of wild
let's get festival ready I just have to
be careful to make it look like I don't
have pinkeye my goal is to always look
as close to Shay Mitchell as I can
possibly get barely done anything and
I'm already like breaking out and dude
let's put like a darker color in the
crease so I've watched what not to wear
and Carmindy told me and loved it take
me to Coachella you can never have
enough butter what I have learned in my
life now we're getting to the part that
I was actually just trying to avoid this
whole time which is the lashes this is
like when the like scary music cues
building anticipation music because this
feels like a quest how do people do this
just apply false lashes for the first
time in my life now Rex
nothing like a dry sandy desert and a
matte dry lip we're gonna try with this
lighter color of lipstick doing a fake
lip ring oh I need to do that
I think they'll say I look like David
Bowie hopefully which is the highest of
compliments I'm having a really hard
time looking at myself in the mirror
like I don't know who I'm looking at
that's like a different person
so I'm gonna rock this look for the rest
of the day and we're gonna see what
people think I never wear makeup to work
so this is gonna get very interesting
I'm about to go surprise
my co-workers that I work with every day
with this look and we're gonna see how
they feel about it
you'll get beautiful unicorn it was
amazing I love it you're an inspiration
whoa oh my god that's what do you think
about my look it's very cool it's pretty
sparkly Lee do I look like I'm going to
Coachella yeah kinda but you're not
going to actually Coachella
hey festivals stands out when you walked
in I was like what is what's happening
like a lot of people are looking at me
it's very uncomfortable
I'm surprised at how many people were
just like yo this is a good look for you
you should do this more often that is so
dope that needs to be reverie day like
my eyes started to feel a little dry and
I couldn't my contact is starting to
hurt getting a little crispy and I can't
can't touch it bumped into something
knocked a glitter off into my hair to be
honest this filter has never felt more
applicable in my entire life around the
middle of the day I definitely felt like
this area where the glitter was start to
feel like tighter Boston crochet
some people said that it looked like
pinkeye
so what's going on it's impossible look
Oh Chella okay is it you pinkeye I made
it through the day sort of almost
basically the glitter is empowering the
sparkle makes me want to just like be
free and wild you look amazing
every time I walk past you today I'm
like damn highlight on point the
reaction was very much like this looks
like something that you would normally
wear which I was surprised by I love it
if you did this on any day I feel like
looks good I think one of my big
takeaways from today is that I can put
on false lashes by myself and you didn't
mention that you did it yourself I
thought you went to a professional feel
pretty good about this look we'll see
how the internet feels about it but I
like it and I do want to wear glitter
all the time and I want to find ways to
and just incorporate that because like
it used to be like not great for now
it's like Oh unicorn this unicorn that
confetti whatever if these kinds of
makeup trends and looks appeal to you
you should do them wear them to the
festival wear them to school wear them
work wear them wherever you want to wear
them honestly because life is too short
for us to be like I look weird do what
makes you happy and what makes you feel
good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
