my hand that's nasty
when I think of foam foundation I think
of ice cream and whip cream it's a foam
cloud of make out it's probably gonna be
like those soap dispensers that I could
use that are liquid in the thing and
then you press it and foam comes out and
you're like this is cool magic I
think I've seen foam foundations and
commercials and might maybe and my
friends makeup bags I'm super excited to
just like sprint that all over my
hand like a little saucer all right
let's see what this foam foundation is
all about today I'm trying Revlon
Photoready airbrush mousse makeup in the
color zero to zero she'll because I look
like a white ash says exclusive err
whipped formula with photochromatic
pigments that Bend and reflect light I
am trying the Elizabeth Arden flawless
finish mousse makeup says it's for
normal skin natural coverage translucent
finish so we were doing Maybelline New
York Coco a nude air foam shake well
before use
shake shake shake foam foundation for
the first time oh oh
it looks like it's chocolate mousse but
it's not when I first put this in my
hand and on my face I was like this is
too dark but rubbing it in it's really
sherry now I want to make sure I don't
over ply cuz it's so thin I just don't
know what exactly is too much oh it was
a look it was a long ass way it feels
pretty good it's very light and like
blendable which i appreciate how rich
wise it's doing a damn good job and the
color shockingly changes as it's on your
skin it is like oxidizing to my skin the
longer it is on it I think we're done on
days where I'm I really feeling myself I
would be so down for this the
application of the foam is super
fun getting that like satisfying feeling
of like popping bubbles I will say I
think it took me a lot longer to apply
than my regular foundation because I
found myself just going over certain
areas because it still didn't look like
they were covered but in the end it
still looks good like you know you're
not like when you're in a pool and you
accidentally belly flop and makes that
like slapping Sun and you're like no one
heard that
that's this but like repeatedly over and
over again Lady Lake is moving to our
