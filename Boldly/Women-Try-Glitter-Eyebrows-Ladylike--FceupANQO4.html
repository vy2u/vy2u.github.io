lost I don't know what I did to deserve
this
hey doll faces welcome to ladylike it
seems like every holiday season the
internet tells you to glitter something
this year it's eyebrow we're gonna try
these out and see what they're all about
it's ladylike and today we're testing
glitter eyebrows using an eyeshadow
brush spread the glitter base all over
your brows covering it completely kind
of upset that I'm putting this glue on
them
I'm nervous that like something that
happened did the brush into glitter how
to fold the tissue over your eye look
crazy okay I guess I'm done I feel super
festive I'm not that mad at it all right
no it's sue everybody else think
so
okay Freddie and I are like going out in
the open I'm like kind of nervous now it
looks so we heard we were talking and
dishes back with me so I'm talking like
it's a non c'è and then she turned
around god or eyebrows would carve it
that's how what the pucks on your face
is it Wyatt
what why why it's my beautiful eyebrows
so I'm at the bar with these brows it
seemed to be in YouTube what do you
think Kane I'll give you as good or look
at these the more I kind of like them I
guess I'm not as bizarre as I like bad
they were I'm taking off my glitter
eyebrows I think they look pretty crazy
I'm just afraid of getting a lot of
glitter in my eye
oh my god I think my fool eyebrows gonna
cut off all right this is gonna be a lot
harder than I thought I'm very concerned
I seem to have lost a little bit of hair
I started soaked my eyebrows and coconut
oil um and I think a little bits coming
off or dangerous yeah it's definitely
not not dangerous I think the more all
the stories I put way too much glitter
on um I was just trying to do a good job
I was just trying to make it show up on
camera I don't know why I did that I do
regret it a little bit that's a lot of
eyebrow hair that I have lost
there are definitely cons and risks to
be aware of so I had to go to cinema
secrets to get medical adhesive remover
and they took it off for me
I'm happy I'm never doing that again
you guys thought was crazy it sure was
so the look was fun the look was really
fun the taking off process not fun I had
to get them professionally taken off and
the lady told me to never use eyelash
glue when your eyebrows in that we were
insane for doing that but that's what
all this tutorial says so does whatever
surreal set we looked like three of them
wait Jen you use nail polish remover
yeah I did I use nail polish remover
because the internet said that I should
do that and my vision got like very
blurry after a while this is that lady
liked nope
lady tested lady not bruised but maybe
with different glue so I don't know if I
could put my eyebrows through that drama</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
