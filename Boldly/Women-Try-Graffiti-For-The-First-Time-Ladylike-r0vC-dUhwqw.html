literally this is ladylike and today
we're trying Rafiki
we're here with artist Blu he's located
in Los Angeles he does amazing stuff
he's worked with kendrick lamar's the bt
awards and he's going to teach us a
thing or two about the fini today how's
it going separate so what is the
difference between street art and
graffiti graffiti is more so I'm gonna
do it because I want to do it street art
is more permission-based both of them
cover so many different types of art
whether it be wheat paste or spray paint
or stickers so for us as beginners what
are some things that we need to keep in
mind it's like a personal thing like you
on like a law so it's not so much based
on someone else's style it's about like
developing your own style that's awesome
let's do it then we're going to learn
Ted throws house and burners tags one
lies one color it's just it's like like
signing something people use quotes a
lot just because it's like a nickname
yeah there's like a million different
ways of like quotes like the put them
you can put them like bit aside hey baby
girl
one of my nicknames from Quinta is 4wd
and so I wrote 4wd I'm working on it
after that as a hollow how I was like
doing your name in bubble but not
filling it in so I'm still one color you
can like put a little extra like fancy
do-dads I think the most surprising
thing is how hard it is to work with the
spray paint especially the nozzle I mean
my finger hurts but also like in terms
of controlling the scraping it's super
hard and if you can see blues
amazing at it after a hollow is a throw
up the throw up is a hollow that's
filled in so if I just spilled my name
and hollow letters and I filled it all
in with blue and I did outline and red
that's a thorough it's like two colors
so basic
what oh my god so yeah I did that one
first I was I didn't like it too much
I think like the Z and the Q the capital
Q in the capital Z are a little bit hard
for me so I want to get better at them
but I mean I like it for my first one so
I decided to change my hollow my
nickname 4wd um and so now I'm just
practicing that it's coming together in
a perfect world I would do it again but
you know it's graffiti so you're
thinking on your feet
burner is like a throw that has like
umph to it maybe it's like dripping like
green goo from it like you know there's
like something else on it
that's a burner it's like a graduate oh
I love it
so have you worked with any lady
graffiti artists are there a lot of them
plus Alaska in graffiti you don't know
who these people are you don't know if
they're a man or a woman all right so
yeah I'm curious to what you guys what
kind of tags and style you guys are
gonna bring to the table so blue is gone
and we're here alone and we're gonna tag
the long fray we're breaking in criminal
criminal activity all right so we have
Jen today she was sick for our first
session so now she's joining us today
and we're here at our old office they
don't know that we're here they don't
know what we're about to do so we're
gonna tag it up oh yeah nothing Jake
Quinta's going to ever explain why I am
4wd so tell us 4wd because like a
four-wheel-drive car she is reliable
fast strong able to go through the snow
easily 4wd yeah it's me I was so
surprised by the amount that I think we
improved technique-wise from when I
started that pink can feels like really
normal and style-wise too like now like
you even if it was writing different
words I think I'd be able to tell who
did what yeah it's beautiful I think
it's like always a rebellion from like
fundamentalism and it's basically making
the city a cool place like I think about
filly in San Francisco and they have a
lot of graffiti and it's just from
people deciding we are going to tag this
area we are going to make it our own oh
 wait where's your water bottle
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
