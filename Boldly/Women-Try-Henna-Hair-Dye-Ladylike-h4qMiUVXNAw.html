read the directions first no we did oh
yeah yeah yeah today we are using henna
hair dye and dyeing our hair we are at a
friend Evan's house because we like her
bathrooms they really love my bathroom
I've never dyed my hair before I think
this may not work because my hair is
already pretty dark I don't think it's
not gonna work but I think that the
change will only really be visible in
like sunlight like I'm gonna have to be
standing directly under the Sun for you
to see any change
I think I'm dyeing my hair to Auburn
color which is great
anything that brings me closer to being
Lily Potter I'm okay with any time I
have colored my hair it's just been too
jet-black so I'm gonna venture out into
some chestnut tones today and we'll see
how it goes I'm scared of bleaching my
hair so this seems like pretty much the
easiest way to do something let's do it
yeah we are preparing the henna we have
these blocks as you can see these blocks
as a half Indian I do have some
experience with henna my family calls it
Mandy it smells smells like plants
it smells like plants so I cut up all
blocks the blocks are in here and then
we'll just get to it so there's some
water in here we're boiling it maybe I
should put it a little higher it seems
like it's gonna overflow oh maybe not
maybe it will just float very nicely I
will let it go in a little bit oh yeah
that seems like what I'm supposed to do
maybe just a little
I am slaving away over this hot stove oh
what's this it's a label Wow I did not
expect myself to be so bad at this but
we're forging ahead right guys yeah
we're here with a steaming bowl goal
what steaming a second ago a steaming
bowl of this I've caca don't come for my
cookie part I woke up like this put your
beautiful things easy you do you want to
put some
just on your hairline really fast yeah
what I used to get perms back of the day
yeah they would put like Vaseline or
coconut oil on my edges so when you burn
them so this is what we do
do not get ahead on my sidebar I do not
want them any darker all right let's do
this it smells like chai tea sorry I
don't know I don't know how to get in
there I feel it very luxurious even
though you're putting tack out of my
hand should I stumble out blower women
put poop on their hair for the first
time speed more of my neck hairs yeah it
goes back with my college hippie self is
so happy right now
there are dingleberries flying whoa my
hair long I feel like I'm doing the
environment a favor so I'm gonna be on
my hair a favor
Politico feels so organic look how you
gingerly picked off the Kaka from my ear
and put it on my hair dingleberry oh my
nose no and yes at the same time don't
touch it
oh god I'm it's my nose is itchy YB YB
can you reach it out I know on the
corner
Oh a little bit more nail hmm
oh my god it's so heavy oh my god is so
heavy so no we could hang out for like
five hours just chilled I am the
princess of caca tomorrow so I've had
this bag on my head for about two hours
now it doesn't smell bad it doesn't itch
but I'm not mad I'm glad I'm doing it
for work it's been a long-ass time
it's been about six hours we ate we
lounged we laughed we cried devon has to
go get an x-ray for her foot because it
might be broken so we're gonna wash her
out right now I was willing to go with
the shower cap on my head I'm nervous
like I don't know what line we need this
tap at this point it's just oh wow look
at that
so I just showered it took me about 35
to 40 minutes just to get all the hair
out of my hair I'm winded I'm tired just
got out of the shower and I'm really
excited to see I think it looks exactly
the same Freddie thinks it looks darker
it's not that we'll see what happens
tomorrow what I love is that like I'm
not sure if it changed like a tint or
the color of my hair but it feels so
good it feels so like moisturize and
conditioned and it smelled great yeah it
was really fun to try once but I don't
think I'm gonna be doing it again
necessarily so maybe I might have to
actually dye my hair darker if I
actually want it to be darker it's
interesting because yours did not turn
blue it turned reddish you think it's
redder than yeah especially in the light
it's definitely redder I feel like it
worked on my hair though yeah yeah I see
some some change I definitely recommend
waiting a day before you pass judgment
though because this got better the
second day around there was a giant mess
in my bathroom when we showered it was
like covered in mud it looked crazy
there were dingleberries in my brassiere
doodleberries everywhere I thought my
mom has described my boobs as
dingleberries before they are not that
small no you all have real small booth
machines out let's just end this video
with us cupping our own bread boobs lady
