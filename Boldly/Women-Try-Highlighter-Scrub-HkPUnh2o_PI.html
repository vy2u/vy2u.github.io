how I make a living I'm a beauty fashion
lifestyle blogger the natural look
better I'm not really a fan of like
putting a lot of makeup on I believe in
my full coverage but like I'm not a fan
of like the Instagram trend right now so
I'm not the one who necessarily like is
attached to fashion or attached to what
people are doing but if it's cute and I
like it then why not okay so highlighter
I love highlighter honestly for the
summer time my go-to beauty essential is
just a bare face like clear skin and a
balm highlighter highlighter I don't use
it but if I knew how to I probably would
honey you gotta have a highlight like
that's my personal preference cheekbones
have to be sitting what if I told you
there was a product that just hit the
market there was like a merger between
glitter and how long how could you feel
like the Sun like a unicorn I would love
that
permanent glistening I love it
she's cute I love the packaging I'm
excited first it says shut your clothes
and get wet in the shower right your
booty and massage me around your body
shower with water only to keep your
shimmer shut me out of the bathroom and
end of the day I think I'm ready to show
me
I feel so good it wasn't glitter it was
not glitter ya have no idea how happy I
am that it was not glitter I smell
amazing and I feel like I got some shine
even though there's some glitters I mean
but I'm shining my skin is glowing I
feel like I need people to see it I'm
ready to put my halter tops on like
let's do this I think I think that the
shimmer worked I mean I don't know if
you can tell in this lighting um but I
think the shimmer worked when I stepped
outside
I was definitely shimmery but not too
shimmery where it looks like I'm doing
the most a highlighter I do feel like it
is giving me like a glow a little bit
and also like they didn't really
describe how good you feel afterwards
like my skin feels my skin just has like
a glowy cue to it which I personally
love this product is gonna be a staple
all summer long
all summer 7 things like if it sold out
go back next week go back next month
trust me you don't want this I'm so
happy and said do not eat because I
definitely would have probably tried it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
