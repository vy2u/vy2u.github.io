which I've been waiting to try for a
couple of years which is supposed to
give our glow back to our faces
yeah and clear out our poorest I'm very
excited because there's somewhat
expensive so that's why I've never tried
them before I only recently found out
about these and realize that they're all
the rage so I'm just late
I'm also very outside of the facial
conversation like you're getting a lot
of skeletons out of the closet are you
ready to go to this no it's gonna be
vulnerable hot I have Hollywood
California glam glow thirsty mud
hydrating treatment Fred's a thirst
bucket Hollywood California glam glow
flash mud
brightening treatment flash muffins
flash Matt the flash mud warning Youth
mud tingle exfoliat treatment tingle
exfoliant it's one word one way I have
the Hollywood California glam glow super
bud clearing treatment this feels very
legit - all that that Yankee Candle mine
smells kind of like a hotel lobby mine
smells like orange juice smells like a
massage all right let's get these masks
on our faces
I feel like brightening is a big thing
come wintertime like everyone's
complaining about how dull their skin
gets so this looks like caramel and I'm
just gonna go in oh it's so smooth
there's like little Fleck ease in this
lucky's yeah there's like little bits of
dry thing in this it's very grainy but
to me that means it's gonna be very
exfoliating so I'm like fine a bit as
much as I like this I feel like I've
used half of the bottle and I've only
gotten half of my face so this you have
a one-time-use
touching what is this a debris that I've
found it's like there's like little
pieces of tree bark in this this is full
on a stick
cheap Lane sentence 100% of stick in my
mouth oh it's already tingling I do old
as soon as you said that the tingling
kicked in Oh mine's starting the sting
well there's a lot of debris in here
this feels so serious I'm
I'm gonna lie it smells amazing I'm
obsessed with watching the poorest
amount of your face right now
so these masks are supposed to change
colors when they're done I guess it's
time to wait I'm only going to be able
to talk for about like doing room it is
before it all dries up okay so it's been
20 minutes they weren't kidding about
hydrating masks like I look like a
grease ball I can't smile rld's this
whole situation just falls apart I look
like the moon emoji I feel like I look
like Emily from the corpse bride a
little blue a little bit of rigor mortis
and sudden so it's crazy because I don't
sweat on my face at all but this mask is
pulling out like little pockets of oil
on my nose especially I can only assume
that the little dots are like where
they've taken the oil out like they'd be
extracted the oil so I'm very excited
let's do this let's do it I'm ready to
become a little bright spot according to
the directions I don't wash mine off
with water I can but they suggest using
a tissue to dab off the extra oils and
then just like massage the remaining
into my faces like a moisturizer I can't
even express how much better it feels to
not have this on my face it kind of
hurts it kind of feels like I'm
scratching sandpaper on my face it
definitely looks and feels hydrated
I definitely feel like a fresh new baby
I do feel like intensely exfoliated like
a new layer of skin has surfaced I see
your freckles more I just squeeze my
nose there's still like a fair amount of
stuff in there
my skin definitely feels like fresh I
feel like they saw me you know they saw
me they saw my skin type and they're
like hey we got you so that's why I have
sort of a warm feeling inside it really
didn't pull out as much oil as I'd hope
but it definitely gave me like the shine
and the dewy look here and here if
someone wanted to give it to me as a
present I'd do it again I'd use this
again if it was free
lady tested I was a lady a print lady
approve yeah lynnie approved mm-hmm lady
clear lady dewy mm-hmm my face is
holographic
