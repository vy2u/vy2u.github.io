instead of nails because larger palate I
think nail art is intense I don't know
how they do the little design I don't
think I have the attention span for it I
think that if you are good at nail art
you're probably good at all art people
have been doing creative stuff with
their nails for a long time so there are
some really inventive like dope stuff on
Instagram and real life I can come away
as a person who at least understands how
nail polish works I think that'd be a
win I don't anticipate that I will
create a masterpiece on my fingertips
but I do think I'll have fun so what are
we going to be doing here today we are
going to be learning some intricate nail
art you're like Instagram Queen of nails
I'm trying really hard but I guess how
long is a kid yeah two hours um
it took about an hour and 15 minutes do
you think that nail art is like a
sustainable part of it being routine
definitely a lot but it's also something
that I think if you can find sort of
peace or harmony in it or enjoyment and
I think it's worth it okay so first
we're gonna take a cotton pad oh you can
grow right now it's just like a step one
or you off and I'm gonna have you cover
this and push down what is this it's
just nail polish remover Wow okay and
then just wipe off your nail
make sure there's no natural oil and
that's all clean
a good rule of thumb whenever you're
taking anything out of a brush no pun
intended
yeah scrape the product off the side of
of the brush and then you take the side
with product on it and that's how you
start and I like to start at the base in
the middle and just swipe up protects
your nails from staining didn't even
know that was a thing that can happen
life is dangerous this is great a skate
great it is a hundred percent called
mail tears it's beautiful it's one of my
favorite tap it against your wrist or
palm just therapeutic it is kind of nice
right go around the edge of your nail
and just make sure that you've got the
tip of your nail covered that looks
beautiful
oh well yeah very the part where I got
it all right
we're both going to use the white as the
white for our flowers we're going to
pick a medium pink and a dark burgundy
color and we're going to blopp it onto
the palette oh it damn yeah the kids are
doing these days when you take the pen
and we're going to put it right in
between where the color divide is the
thing about me is I have a master's
degree in oh my god my hand shaking oh I
saw that I was watching it at this time
I want you to take the flower so that
it's sort of on the nail half on the
nail and half off this is the most art
that's ever been anywhere near my hands
the worst thing that could happen is you
spend hours on your nail art and then
you put on your topcoat and it smears
everything you have to like basically
use the Force to figure out yeah when
your nails are done so good so good so
good grab a little more I've never
delivered a baby I thought it might be
kind of like this I had an incredible
time today
but unfortunately I can only pick one
winner Kristen did a great job I think
she came in and she sorted to know to
expect but she went with a flow I guess
the one thing is maybe the sizing of the
flowers she could have placed them a
little bit more intricately on the nail
despite the shaky hand I think Devon did
a great job I wasn't sure how one of the
flowers was going to turn out but we
were able to turn it to something really
positive Jen also did a great job this
is really a tough competition I think
that Devon is actually the winner of the
nailing it competition I didn't win
that's absolutely not what happens
you're lying to me I did a thing I did a
good they said it couldn't be done but
uh look what I just done I feel like I'm
still a winner
I feel like this bump is still a winner
what's even better is I'm gonna go eat
some spaghetti and shrimp after this
people know that even though I do not
have cool nails I'm still feminine thank
