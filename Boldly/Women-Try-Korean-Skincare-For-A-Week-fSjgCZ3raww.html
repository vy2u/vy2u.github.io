 on your face would get rid of acne
I'd be like let's split the uber to the
nearest farm we're trying cream skin
care for a week I am pretty obsessed
with all skin care products I'd say most
of my money goes towards odd I have
combination skin dry on my cheeks and
completely oily everywhere else I have
been getting random breakout in sounds
about like 19 20 I just don't want acne
anymore come at me I'm ready to be a
kpop star I'm dr. Annie Chu and I am a
dermatologist Korean women are very very
committed to beauty and skincare
everyone's heard by now about these ten
to twelve step Korean skincare rituals
because they really enjoy and feel like
they're taking care of themselves really
inside and outside oh oh oh yeah that's
a lot a 2-step cleansing ritual or
double cleansing basically you wash your
face first with like oil based cleanser
which takes off I makeup eyeshadow I'm
Lauren Conrad in the home then you
follow it with a secondary step that
cleanses the more organic residue star
on your face while leaving it still
really sort of pH balanced and nourished
without stripping of all its natural
oils do you hear this I know literally
McCartney butter oh my god go crazy oxy
prone skin tends to run a little bit
oilier you want to look for exfoliating
products or products that have retinoids
these products turn over the skin a
little bit faster which prevents pore
clogging and dissolves dead cells I feel
like a puppy is just rubbing its body
against my face time for toner let's do
this tone it up they may be in Korean
skincare as well but they tend to have
slightly more gentle formulations
because Asian skin is more irritable
essence for you serum for me in essence
typically is a little bit lighter in
texture usually doesn't have a very high
concentration of active ingredients but
more it's about rebalancing the skin
like this it's not like a knife manga
well you just got really good smelling
ones for the last two a serum is a super
potent step in a skincare regimen that's
nice oh that smells like like sweet yeah
we do end up stripping the skin of its
natural pH so they'll have multiple
steps just to reestablish that pH and
bringing out the Baskin Robbins sample
spoon the Koga ice cream let's go put
some ice cream
let's connect great husband we deserve
but this was a lot of work there's also
a much heavier emphasis on sunscreens
and SPF s which is probably why they
continue to maintain looking so fabulous
super like watery which I'm a fan of
that was long but there's more bring on
the masks
thank you thank you chic master kind of
like a cheat way of getting high quality
ingredients in really quick is based
around an occlusive effect so whenever
the skin has an ingredient on it
driving the ingredients deeper into the
skin I love this it's gonna be like a
nice solid thirty minutes looking
forward to this week but if I ever wake
up late this is gonna be a problem let's
do it leggo the fact that the routine is
so long had its pros and cons in the
home and very tired and now I have to do
like a 20 minute skincare
routine let's talk about how long it
takes to double cleanse AM and PM I
literally can't that's just too much
time definitely woke up late this
morning and I have to go through my
entire Korean beauty routine before I
head out I'm going to be even more late
than I am already so that's great but
Allison taking care of my skin you know
loves the mask it was like a rave on my
face
usually like sheet masks are very
soothing and moisturizing feels minky my
face is tingling humming that little
whippin maker every morning was the most
monotonous but like weirdly satisfying
moment of my morning and night routine I
noticed how a lot of like my little
bumps started to clear up my face feels
so glowy right now
let's Bob one thing that I really am
excited about using more often were the
sheet mask that we had the directions
recommended putting it in the
refrigerator beforehand so that it would
be cold and it was the most refreshing
feeling ever it has been a week it was a
very long week mostly because I suddenly
had to do like five hours worth of
skincare definitely found out that my
routine isn't as extensive as I thought
it was compared to the Korean version I
noticed as the week progressed that a
lot of my acne was kind of going away
I've really noticed overall color
correction the redness and the
patchiness of my skin has evened out but
I'm very excited to get back to my old
routine and just incorporate the
sunscreen and the sheet masks every once
in a while
definitely gonna keep doing it my face
has never been cleaner Oreo
do you think I look like JLo say nothing
if I look like JLo I don't need a
Halloween costume
next year I'm just gonna go as a
bear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
