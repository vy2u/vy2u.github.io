like full lips have become all the rage
but I'm not sticking needles in these
puppies to achieve them because pain
whatever happened to the good old non
invasive products its ladylike and today
we're trying lip plumpers
my lips have actually been on a journey
I've been told that my face is like a
jack-o'-lantern in that my mouth is just
cut into my face and I have like no lips
I like my lips overall I feel like my
lips are kind of like sad-looking if I
just M chill but I'm not mad about them
there has been a time where I did
consider getting lip injections due to a
childhood injury that I had on my lip
but then I was like whatever I don't
think these are going to be that
effective I think probably surgery is a
most effective option I have just heard
that they kind of sting and are
uncomfortable and so why why would I
want that I don't know I'm excited to
try it
bring me the good news KN see beauty all
natural collagen infused lip mask
lifestyle lip is a clear cosmetic that
enhances your lip for lasting fullness
oh it's cruelty free like grab lip
instant plump in three to five minutes
oh okay smells like nail polish there's
just like watery fluid just coming off
of it maybe that's the collagen it
smells like something the doctor would
use to clean your arm right before a
shot I'm specially just on for 20
minutes hmm tastes like vanilla looking
room I feel very sticky
it looks nice though it's a very nice
lip gloss it's are distinct the through
glue the hurt feels very hot feels like
I ate an all tobacco burrito that was
very relaxing kind of like putting
cucumbers on your eyes your enemy nose
very cooling a nice sensation it seems
like this works by just kind of
irritating the crap out of your lips
I feel moisturized I don't think I look
any pumper the only people that know
that I'm wearing lip plumpers right now
is the lady light crew so I'm just gonna
go about my day and see if anyone else
notices and has anything to say to me
so do you notice anything different my
face anything notice anything different
about my face um you're wearing
foundation they don't look that much
plumper to me you have a nose ring
do you give a hot you have highlighter
or using highlighter I've kind of
changed my mind I think that my lips are
a little puffier Rick right up here if
your eyelashes are longer I put on a lip
plumper oh yeah no I don't know yeah oh
it didn't work I think I'm kidding
myself I don't think that they changed
at all and uh nobody said anything
nobody noticed no dramatic change if
anything people were surprised I was
wearing a clear gloss instead of a dark
lipstick oh it's not funny anymore
you're looking new lips too looking I
know that did not work not at all yeah I
had fun though but I don't think it did
much when I used to use like lip glosses
like in 2006 they were very painful
they had like bee venom in them yeah no
thank you no but those things would
actually just kind of irritate
temporarily and that's how you get
puffier but I was just sort of calmed it
tasted nice and it was very hydrating I
ended up licking off a lot of it though
the normal lip wear that I have been
using is generally drying out my lips
but this did the opposite so it was a
nice change it was like sticking your
mouth and like a bat of KY jelly I've
never used KY jelly so it's just like
moisture great moisture in the
downstairs gym yeah yeah the top Stoops
 so we just ghost mouth Lube is what
you're saying
yeah I mean basically lip plumpers lady
tested lady lubed luge that's what we
said
lip plumpers it's like KY lube for your
mouth oh yay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
