today we're getting Lisa Frank makeup
looks I thought we were gonna do it
ourselves so I was a little worried but
I'm not so I'm much happier now
things that I appreciate about Lisa
Frank she didn't just stick to one color
scheme she was like no we're gonna use
all the colors these different designs
are pretty great like they're kind of
triple like what she has getting a new
like Lisa Frank school supply was like
getting a new iPhone except in 1995
opening your desk and pulling out your
folder and by just like look we got my
unicorn folder when I was young Lisa
Frank made me feel like I was
unstoppable I was taking over the world
you couldn't tell me anything
as an adult I think I'll probably feel
like a circus clown but it's Friday so
here for today I'm gonna be getting the
ballerina bunnies I loved bunnies
I loved ballet I was not very good at it
but that's okay I know the first Lisa
Frank school supply that I got was a
folder I'm pretty sure it was the
cheetah print but Lisa Frank cheetah is
goals I still want to beat him Lisa
Frank Tita this is crazy
I had this binder with these two
unicorns dancing over a rainbow it's
really all I want in my life
just like dancing on a rainbow with like
a magical creature like as a kid you're
sort of discouraged from being bold and
standing out and her school supplies and
all of her products were like no you be
bold you stand out you make a statement
when we were little girls Lisa Frank
made us feel like little Queen but we're
gonna see if it has the same effect in
your 20s and 30s ah I look like the cool
kids binder honestly except for the nose
and the whiskers this is actually like a
really cute like going out look can you
see this highlighter right there you see
that little glitter patch on my forehead
if I were unicorn that's where my horn
would be this is like a childhood dream
come true I did not realize that I was
going to be wearing this for the entire
day hey let's do it so I'm about to go
into our production office with some
very important paperwork and I'm going
to see if I
can command their respect I know you all
what's happening with you Lucy oh I kind
of love it
thank you look really just like like you
could just like growl so pretty it's
shiny I can see it from afar that's
perfect
is it Halloween like randomly that I'm
not aware of I'm assuming you probably
don't take me more seriously
probably less seriously yeah there's a
dot on your nose
I want to Boop it about to do an
important business meeting for business
stuff for ladylike it's legit actually
an important actual meeting and we're
gonna go like this
yeah we look good we look professional
they look like serious as lady
Steve serious face I'm a business bunny
so I just left Chipotle and the cashier
asked me if I was going to a party and I
of course forgot that I had this makeup
on it's like no oh but I should've said
yes because life's party um what so I
have to cut my day experiment short
because I have a very important meeting
that I should probably look normal in
myself for also I'm in a couple of other
shoots so it's been real it's been fun
it's been very nostalgic
we're just sushi earlier tonight
surprisingly at the sushi restaurant
they didn't bat an eye I think they
really like my makeup they really like
to look but it is time to take it off
well it's a day after Lisa Frank and now
I felt a little crazy
I felt so empowered by it though that I
was like you know what we'll do bright
lipstick two days in a row oh Lisa Lisa
Lisa Lisa
