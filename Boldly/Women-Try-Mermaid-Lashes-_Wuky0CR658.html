about to get mermaid lashes hello i'm
Clementina Richardson I'm the owner of
envious lashes in New York City and the
celebrity lash expert how can we
describe very much the Marly lashes are
really popular really trending right now
colorful cuz you already look fabulous
with lash extensions but then this is
putting a little like cool twist on in
the beginning they're a little hesitant
I'm a little nervous that it's gonna be
too much for me you don't usually wear
that much color in my life but I'm so
really excited for it when you look at
them in the lash pad they look a little
extra or dramatic but once you apply
them they're really soft and feathery in
light these are supposed to last for a
while so my sister told me to wear swim
goggles when I take showers I have a
pair of goggles so I'm going to try to
make these babies last oh I'm afraid
that they're just gonna fall off cuz I'm
always rubbing later no crying we will
not cry these next two weeks after we
get our lashes okay
Clementina what kind of eye shape do I
have your eye shapes are narrow and long
your eyes are round so what elongate
your eyes give her a natural lip and
open up the eye we're gonna do some
blues cuz you have those people bluish
greenish eye little purple blue of
course we'll have some black in there
and they built the real another color
let me surprise you
let's do it
so I'm applying the primer with the
primer doesn't support physically
repulsive
I would just dip it into the user
the average person has anywhere from 80
to 150 strands for imacros in order to
style a client you have to first know
the eye shape the client has and how
best to contour
it's best to not get them wet for the
first 48 hours because that's how long
it takes for the Yousef to cure you
definitely don't want to rub your eyes
at all while wearing lash extensions
because the hundreds that we will have
damage to natural lashes
hey the big so good I'm never going back
to basic lashes off oh my god I'm a
princess now
definitely the purple in the brown is an
amazing look y'all that she looks so
cool I love it the dark and the light
with that lavender and this is an
exclusive Clementina did it here first
I feel like an idiot that I have been
doing this my whole life
these are gonna make the boys go crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
