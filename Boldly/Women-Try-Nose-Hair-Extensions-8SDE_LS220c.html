thing in my nose so I have like a bush
coming out of my nose it's gonna be hot
there's a makeup artist who uses fake
lashes I think it's a joke I'm not I'm
hoping it's a joke to make nose hairs
nose hair extensions are basically where
you take false eyelashes and stick them
up your nose people in social media I've
been trying this new trend we're gonna
give it a try in real life to see what
the hypes about I can honestly say I've
never stuck something up my nose as a
trend did you blow your nose before this
no was I supposed to well I did well
I've never worn falsies in my whole life
me neither I've never touched them I saw
like on a tutorial where they just like
yes I did about that beauty bloggers
this one's like in my brain I'm gonna
shove it up the nose that's my questions
the girl got a bogey oh like tuck do a
little tuck tuck it I'm gonna make a
little spiral then shove it right up I
feel like this one looks at you
realistic how looks like pubes to me
like I snorted some pubes
what do you think I kind of like it I'm
trying not to read through my nose I
don't need that going up there oh my god
is that forever pretty much feels like
you got spiders up your nose really
didn't expect that it would be like this
hard to breathe yeah a little nose hair
next thing you know you're looking at
your dad in the mirror oh I like this oh
that should be the trend that was a
hundred percent human hair girl eating
human hair 100% human my body finds me
I just like the idea of like putting
hair where people don't expect it and
daring people to say something say
something I feel like a hairy goddess
and I kind of love you are a hairy
goddess I'm really excited to see how
people react to my look like crazy no
honestly I'm not mad at it I really
wanted to get rid of a guy on a date
definitely for a bunch of tiny insects
on a moon about from your nose and they
just like trying really hard to escape
just shoved it I was really jesting it
stuck to my finger and then I took my
finger out of my nose and now it's on my
finger maybe this is a trend beauty
bloggers I'm jealous of any and the face
because I think Hourani style
theaters highlights beard yeah I think
it needs to be styled something like I
need some wax something like a moustache
you know you can't just like let it it
starts getting crazy when it gets long
incredible for women generally accepting
a little computers by the trends some
people didn't even notice it I'm just
two mustaches but I can get them out
like this nope I really do feel like I'm
picking my nose though well we kind of
are oh these poor things I think they've
been through hell whose hairs are they
you're actually just want to use these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
