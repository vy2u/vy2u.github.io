there make some hombre eyebrows on our
eyebrows hopefully this time we won't
almost lose a brow this is so
reminiscent of last year's video glitter
eyebrows if you missed it big gone it
was a mess because we put glue on our
hair we couldn't get it off that's a lot
eyebrow hair I don't know what I did to
deserve this I'm never doing that again
today is safe is it won't need adult
supervision are we sure
so apparently ombre eyebrows are good
for like holiday parties and glam events
and New Year's Eve and glitzy don't
invite attendees oh yeah no no but we
don't got any of those things if I were
dressing up as a candy cane or something
maybe I would do my brows to match the
whole look but like just doing your
brows and then like showing up at a
holiday party like alright we're gonna
do it hopefully we won't lose our
eyebrows
so the tutorial told us to use white
cream eyeshadow but had a hard time
finding that so we have white liquid
lipstick it all goes on your face anyway
it's not glue whatever it is suckle ooh
this is how it always happens we try to
substitute and then it goes to
Kristen is auditioning for the role of
Dumbledore in the newest fantastic
beasts movie oh this seems like it's
going well so hi this is good this is a
good look see I'm trying not to over
white the brow like it's supposed to be
directly all the hairs I guess it's just
any color you want right it it already
looks like the glue it looks exactly
like the glue this is too much I don't
think it's enough I mean I don't know
I'm gonna do yellow to orange ah I'm
gonna do purple
I put blue and almost all everything
that I glue you do blue let's go for
green this is definitely my eyebrows
darkest timeline right now - seventh
grade I'm sad already it's the holiday
holiday season cheer with the dark color
I was just like yeah now I'm just like
meh is yellow gonna be too light it
looks a little bit like when you pee in
the shower oh my god it does I don't
think it looks awful I know that some
people might disagree with me but I
actually think it looks kind of cool I
think you look really cool the actual
resemblance of my brows to the Grinch's
brows is like truly breathtaking like
it's really on point it's probably your
favorite color purple is the color that
I think okay that that gave me no
information I think I wish I would have
gone for a darker you know what they
look like candy corn Haven what we're
done think we're done the title of this
look is barbed in the upside down are we
wearing this all day okay
alright let's do it
walking through the campus at BuzzFeed
we've gotten a lot of oohs and ahhs and
they seem to have some positive
connotations yeah mostly is yeah la
Hache I mean like together we make sense
I think individually we're gonna look
weird as time progresses the more and
more disappointed I am with my color
choices the yellow is just too late
it looks crazy is this a style that
people are using somewhere we don't know
is this only from a zoo Disney movie is
this just trying to recreate Zenon girl
the 21st century is it always supposed
to be like a smooth transition yeah this
take the clues but it's very Halle Berry
stole my brows she's gonna shake it up
is this the finished product are you
happily through its the finished piece
of Shady
it's supposed to be on trend for the
holidays ah
who are those fur it looks a little bit
like caterpillars so are you here to
take you back to the capital for the
Hunger Games or do you think it looks
kind of cool
my first thought was a muffin I will say
that I do feel a little bit like Elphaba
from wicked so I'm okay with those vibes
I like it because it's subtle all of you
look like aliens right now but you look
like an alien from like a classy planet
hmm
support you trying something new
sometimes fair okay cool I forgot that I
was wearing these and I went into the
bathroom and caught a look at myself in
the mirror and I was kind of scared
because I just looked like a demon
you look like The Lorax Lorax we
seriously do look like dr. Seuss
characters yeah I don't want to be in
public like this so it's time to remove
the holiday festive hombre brow but a
day hope it comes off better than that
glitter eyebrows compared to the glitter
eyebrows these things are coming off
pretty easily all right it worked out
not too bad ninh hurt didn't feel bad
got him off didn't lose any hair that's
a win we wore ombre eyebrows for a day
and it was anti-climactic
it was sticky I was sad about it it was
so extra if I were talented and did them
well I think the reactions would have
been better so the idea of ombre
eyebrows didn't make me sad it was just
my color choices in my application that
maybe said the best part was people who
like didn't realize was for a video but
we're being like very polite you were
just kind of like oh it's nicely tell
someone doesn't think something's nice
when their voice is really high
yesterday sometime mid day I get a text
from South like hey can I have the
hombre eyebrows apply so I can take them
home and hombre Tyler's moustache
someone tweeted at me to make Tyler's
moustache hombre so Tyler let me ombre
his moustache and we went out for sushi
when you see makeup gurus do these type
of eyebrows it's incredible Gotha it
looks dope but like honest it just kind
of looks like a series of unfortunate
mistakes I think that by myself
especially because I wasn't like wearing
a costume
I looked completely crazy but me and
together different areas on brain we
were like a perfect pair if you went to
a gay event and more hombre eyebrows
we'd be like I'm home I'm home brain the
lady tested lady is fine
if someone who knows what they're doing
is helping us out Tyler approved
hey y'all click on that post over there
to see more videos from our Channel
so what our favorites are in there and
some we like just okay but watch anyway
because we love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
