a lot of stuff online mainly because I
don't like I get to shops and trying
things on finding sizing it can be hard
for a short girl whether it's online or
when you're going out to the shops
i buy clothes online pretty much all the
time it's easier for me to try things on
so with my formal dress I showed my mom
a design of what I wanted and then she
sent it to the Philippines and what I
got back was something completely
different I actually bought my phone
dress at the markets
my Nona made it I actually were
addressed to my formal but I felt so
uncomfortable the whole night and it
wasn't me you know it was such an amp up
for the big day I don't think that I
would have traded that for an online
shopping experience I actually had a bit
of a rough time finding something for
this occasion today I feel like it's a
little bit frustrating to be honest it's
2016 these shops should be like way
ahead of themselves and realized that
not all women want to wear dresses I
feel like you've been nervous about
today I just feel like with a formal
dress it's hard to not try it on before
you buy it there's the extra pressure
you want to look really good there's
going to be photos taken of you so you
need to make sure that you get a dress
that fits really well and buying things
online it's really hard to guarantee
that that's going to happen once you get
it and it doesn't fit then you have to
obviously send it back and then think
about actually going outside to go
shopping and it's just too much a source
had kind of a range for plus-size but
they didn't really carry any of the
sizes I'm not getting my hopes up with
this dress just because I feel like it's
not going to fit right I'm really
nervous about fit in my dress and you'll
be able to see my bra which is kind of a
struggle of my life I'm really excited
about the dress I chose today of all the
dresses that I looked at it's the one
that I would most wear I love shirts and
any excuse to get in one is really
exciting for me so I'm pretty pumped
let's rewind back 10 years and do this
all over but this time I'm going to be
myself
okay I actually really like this I
didn't think I would like it as much I
really like the cutouts that said as
expected you can see my bra Wow I kind
of feel like a Grecian god I kinda feel
like a cupcake I actually quite like
this it fits a lot better than what I
thought it would
surprisingly it fits really well I feel
like I wasn't gonna like it and I really
do I always knew that buying online was
a good option but I never thought that
formal dresses would be the case too so
I'm pretty confident now that I could
probably find not even just a formal
dress I guess a dress for any formal
occasion you know what this would
actually be like the perfect dress for
someone who could go braless I'm
surprised and it fits so well I thought
there might be problems but I was kind
of hoping that it would be a bit high in
a neck but again probably be fine for
someone whose boobs were just a few cup
sizes smaller it's also kind of tight
around here so it probably is an address
that I choose in that sense because I
can't really breathe it is not a very
flattering cut yeah definitely
reinforces my weariness of buying things
online because it doesn't look the way
it did on the site to be honest I kind
of feel like this is a wallpaper design
or like a fancy armchair I think it has
changed my opinion about buying dresses
online because even though the straps
are a little bit big they would be an
easy enough fit so it definitely takes a
hassle out of shopping and having to try
on a bunch of different stuff before you
get the one you want it's really
particularly tricky for me because I'm
after such a nice look I like shirts but
I don't want them to be feminine for
lack of a better word but in saying this
this is exactly the kind of look that I
enjoy it's difficult to kind of put
yourself out there in a clothing store
let alone just trusting something online
but I think everyone looked really
spectacular today I think someone should
just
us out on a date right now this is
definitely something that I wish I could
have worn - my formal if we could turn
back the clock and do it all again that
would be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
