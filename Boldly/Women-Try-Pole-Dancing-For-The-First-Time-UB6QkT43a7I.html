is pole dancing but really it's so much
more I teach women to uncover their full
feminine expression through dance
I think pole dancing is for like sensual
sexy women like I'm not that I feel like
I'm the pole it looks like a lot of fun
and I just want to have that kind of fun
I am a confident person so I'm not
worried about that but I will be shocked
if my ass actually gets off the ground I
feel like we're a fun group hoping for
like a routine or something like a Mean
Girls like I feel like the best way to
explain what s factor is is just to show
you so I'm gonna dance for you yeah
so that was my dance oh yeah I connected
with your confidence and your strength
it was clear that you're like feeling
yourself it was just really emotional
like almost cathartic now at the point
in the class where I'm going to lead you
through an hour workout when you see a
woman push into her curves Society has
taught us that
oh she's seeking some kind of attention
but just because you're acting sexy and
feeling sensual doesn't mean that you
want sex here is a space to give your
body the vocabulary to push into your
femininity and see what happens so now
that we finished our first workout I'm
going to teach you something called the
S walk so what we're going to do is
we're gonna walk around in a circle
let's just start walking at our normal
gait you're gonna start to slow that
down by half cross one leg in front of
the other you start to feel this natural
sway out of your hips okay let's take
this into our first trick Firefly looks
like this
oh okay I'll let gravity take you all
the way down but when you do but it
looks like you're doing something
bend your knees ever so slightly and
just let yourself feel like I just
turned into a wizard and then this is
the most important part yeah ass ass ass
so from here just ass wait no there's no
asommus you needs a little bit of ass
Frandsen you're trying to avoid it all
right well that's class gals they were
so good trucks just started coming out
of their bodies they just started having
so much fun in their dance I don't
always feel like my sexiest but in that
moment I realized that everything about
me is sexy my favorite part was reaching
that sexy part of myself and really like
believe I yes I did have a lot of fun
pole dancing did not feel sexy for me
although it was nice to like get in
touch with my feminine side I've never
experienced like tapping into my
feminine sexuality in just a feminine
space so that was really cool because it
wasn't like I was putting on a show for
a boyfriend we're all just like these
women and just getting primal and raw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
