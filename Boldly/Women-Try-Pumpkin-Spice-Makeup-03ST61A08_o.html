like to think of myself as the pumpkin
cream today we are trying pumpkin spice
makeup I freaking love pumpkin spice get
it like the pumpkin spice latte every
Starbucks as soon as it comes out and
like within a week I have pumpkin spice
lotion that I get every year and I
lather that on I have a pumpkin spice
candle and best believe that has been
burning since September 30th I'm just
not exactly sure what pumpkin spice
makeup would entail the smell of pumpkin
is just so comforting it just reminds me
of like being a child and going out and
running through the leaves and I'm
excited to put makeup on my face that
reminds me of that it feels like I'm
like a chemist in a lab with this thing
I swear it's actually not really that
orange it's just kind of like gold this
is subtle I like this one I could be
down with this I like the color on this
oh dear it just like melts into my skin
and it's gone okay I don't really smell
anything I just see a lot of orange I
feel like I'm literally coming out of a
pumpkin patch so many pumpkin spices so
little time this is the pumpkin King oh

I'll just say I really hate orange
makeup I'm getting a little bit of the
scent do you like I'm preparing for like
a fall Holi festival okay I love pumpkin
spice but I don't think I love it this
much I wish it we're like a little dark
gray it's fine everything is fine it's
supposed to be a highlighter it smells
like rotten kind of like a rotten
pumpkin oh I was not expecting that what
is this I thought that I put a small
enough amounts to where this wouldn't
happen but I guess I was wrong this is
very pigmented I actually like this one
no I don't know how to reverse engineer
what I've done to my face so I'm just
gonna keep powering through Dulcy came
to my rescue and got me a makeup wipe
I'm not trying to
scare my coworkers I don't actually
think it looks terrible definitely tell
that baby girl loves autumn with this on
that's a nice shimmer it's like almost
like a bronzy color it smells good
got a little pumpkin spice hint to it
which I'm all about
I don't you okay with this
it is very orange it goes on so gently
like a soft little pumpkin kiss oh it
tastes good the lipstick is 100% the
pumpkin King pumpkin queen pumpkin royal
family it all makes sense now like full
pumpkin here feel like I should have
dipped everything else and just put the
lipstick on cuz the lipstick is great
got the pumpkin spice smell got a good
nice color
everything else is self-explanatory fall
has fell I'm ready let's go pumpkin
patch 2017 here we go I think my overall
look is beautiful I keep looking at it
and it started just becomes normal you
it's like people want to completely turn
into a pumpkin like that's that's cool
when it comes like the actual color of
pumpkin and putting makeup on your face
you don't have to go there you don't if
you feel comfortable enough why not
I feel pretty festive I'm ready to
welcome fall with open arms and I think
that anyone who sees me today will know
that that's how I'm feeling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
