sport I'm expecting to feel really good
at the end of this I'm ready to cover
something that not a lot of people know
about for 30 days we are training to be
LA Derby dolls and I feel overwhelmed
ports are not my thing I'm not athletic
I go to the gym and run on the treadmill
and call it a day I know how to maneuver
myself on rollerskates so this is a
whole lot of woman coming down so I'm
not planning on falling I'm the most
nervous actually about the time
commitment being a mom I feel like you
do not do things for yourself we're all
going to a sport where we don't know
what's going on we're not very skilled
at it I don't know much about roller
derby honestly
what our league does is that you can
borrow skates a helmet protective gear
until you can actually afford your own
no one's paid we do it because the
league needs it and we all want to help
out in a certain way I didn't know what
I was getting into I'm walking in and
now you're screaming and yelling there
were so many people there which I was
not expecting and we were just thrown
into it begin your day one to the end of
day one was just like an emotional
roller coaster we were just like some
kind of crew jeremy is a very like
demanding sport you definitely have to
commit to it it was really a lot for me
to take in that first day like I was
damn near ready to quit we had our first
Derby practice today and I hated it I
cried I felt so unfamiliar I just felt
like I was thrown with everything today
and it's not what I was expecting like I
expected to like inch into this one at a
time but like we went over T stops today
and I don't even know how to t stop I'm
a joke I'm a Derby Joe I need to work
out more I need to train more and I'm so
much t these adults come in and they're
so full of I can't they're full of
decades of you can't and decades I can't
and they
terrified and they do it anyway and to
me that is so beautiful and suddenly
they realize they're capable of so much
more than they ever thought they could
be if you come here and you put your
skates on and you tie yourself today I'm
going to try something new and you just
go for it it might not work out you
might not pick up a skill that time but
you will eventually the second week came
and we did jumps I fell a lot I learned
about falling and just just getting back
up just get back up it's okay it's okay
I felt like for the first time since I
was a teenager I lost the fear I got up
on that bang and they tell me to just
pick up as much speed as I could and I
pick up as much speed as I could and I
aimed straight for the cement floor and
sometimes I I jumped the cone and I'd be
fine and sometimes I'd fall my ass but
every time I would get up I definitely
was sick a lot more often than not so it
was definitely difficult because I felt
like I was sick the whole week I feel
really sick so sick the night before and
I was like wobbling around and then my
TMJ kicked in this is getting real I
feel great I did a great day I loved it
was so much fun I went on my own
say I went on my own time
I challenge myself a lot of anxiety it
didn't
I'm
now I don't feel like when I find really
interesting about my experience in Derby
is how it is both informed by and
informs my professional life I have
learned to speak up for myself say in a
meeting at work because of the
confidence that I get from Derby I was
really getting into the groove of things
with re3 I was getting used to like okay
I got this I still fell I think I
improved certain teachers it was harder
for me to learn certain steps but with
other teachers
I just learned him like that and it was
sort of like an awakening for me in a
sense because I had realized that I
learned differently from different
people so I learned to be less hard on
myself being that my expectations were
the biggest for us anyway there were a
lot of things that I did that I did not
think I would be able to do today we
learned how to break
and her foot has to go this way
it's so strange I want to go to this
place where women are free I want to go
there every week I talked to the woman
that was instructing us at the end
because I feel like I'm holding myself
back but I don't feel comfortable being
on the actual like round part but I
think next week I'm gonna have to try
and do it because I'm not pushing myself
hard enough I learned a lot about the
sport in general I learned is sort of
like a relay race which is kind of fun
but like on skate I think it's just
important to put yourself outside of
your comfort zone and try new things
because I think a lot of the women that
skate here I never thought that they
could even roller skate let alone hit
and fly Ross the way that they do I'm
really lucky that those women stick
around and try to pick through some of
them are my best friends common
misconceptions about roller derby and we
don't fight each other I think a lot of
times when I meet people and they find
out I play roller derby the first thing
they do is go oh elbows inside no that's
illegal it happens but I try not to do
it and when I do it I feel really guilty
about it or celebrating what their
bodies can accomplish they've worked
really hard to get really good at this
sport that's not gonna elongate their
muscles that's not there to like give
them a dancer's body it's there to make
you strong and kind of hardcore and and
give you some tools I think to like
really you know take up space in the
world and not just on the ring I would
definitely say that one of the biggest
things in Derby is just empowering each
other and encouraging each other like
yes I was skating fine and the coach
even came up to me and she was like I
think you're ready for that track and it
was great but I didn't feel like I was
until the end practice where my partner
was like hey let's go up on this track
and I was like alright well I'm not
about to bring this other girl down I
just
like we needed that encouragement to be
like hey you don't have to be amazing at
this but you can push yourself I was
afraid that if I make a wrong move I
would just cause everybody to fall but
one of my partners was like if you fall
we all fall that's okay
we got right off the bat like they want
to support you and help you because
eventually you're gonna be skating with
them eventually be on the same team so
everyone wants to help each other
there's no competition like there's X
amount of spots and only X amount of
people are going to make it eventually
we want everyone to be skating so
there's always like this camaraderie
this sisterhood
Derby for a mom it was a lot physically
I think it was a lot mentally but at the
end it was very rewarding to get to see
other moms who make time for themselves
and have this cool hobby she had to see
working women who make time for
themselves all of us had a day that we
were like oh God
this was horrible I can't do it all of
us had a day where we were like I'm in
so much pain like what am i doing to
myself and all of us loved it like
ultimately I think there was something
about it but all of us I'm gonna take my
life one week at a time but I'm going to
roller derby again on Sunday I'm not the
kind of person that like falls down and
then gets back up again I'm kind of I'm
the kind of person that's just like and
I'm down but this required me to fall
get back up and to praise me in my fall
and praise me in my failure to fail big
which is something that I need to learn
in general it's okay to fail big and you
can always get back up and try again you
can try again as many times as you want
don't let stereotypes or people dictate
what you do if you have a dream or if
you have a goal or if you have a sport
like Derby you want to do then just do
it just freakin do it everyone please
support your local roller derby team
we're doing amazing things not only
physically and athletically but also we
are fostering a community of strong
girls who know who they are at 12
