stories collection
there's so many this is like the pr box
is not actually something they can buy
right cuz I would do this I would
actually like this I around forty shades
eight dollars each ooh I love this
there's like different little themes for
each lipstick there's like holidays lady
business
brunch days I'm choosing this one that
looks like a $100 bill this one is from
the little collection called lady
business color is a cream lipstick and
it's green something that reminds me of
like lady business is that something
that I do is like I set goals for myself
every year my first year I like walked
in a runway show yeah my second year I
went and modelled that ASOS and then
this year I'm like trying to start a
clothing line I think this really
resembles just like making sure you do
something once a year that you're really
proud of tag throwback and I know red
lipstick looks okay on my face this is
actually really pigmented so into a
school disco and there was this boy who
was like giving me the eye
my friends like pushed me into him made
me do a slow dance with him and he
kissed me it was just like a washing
machine of tongue ahh
and then I'm finished I had lipstick
well there of my mouth and just saliva
everywhere so this is malt shake it's a
very pretty like deep red brown so I'm
doing hashtag throwback me and my friend
were like really stressed at work we're
like we're gonna treat ourselves and
we're gonna go to a spa so we're looking
online and I saw a Korean spa and so I
was like oh my god this sounds amazing
it's a great deal Laura and I go there
like three of us are gonna have fun and
the ladies like take off all your
clothes Lauren and I look at
and we're like you want a snake it like
head to toe I was so hesitant because we
don't have those in Texas learned that I
became even closer friends after that
day
this is shade 30 and it's in the color
matinee which is perfect because it's
like 90 performance and I was like in
jazz and all these performances every
year got so excited every year just to
perform just so I could play with all
the makeup of performance you always
want to have a really good ride this
feels like butter on my lips and it's a
cream too which is great you know every
day I see the Sephora I see you with
your lip stories my story in the
festival vibes collection it's called
desert trip I think it's like a desert
flower like boyfriend placement band
they were playing one night the same
night as FYF fest which is spunky a fest
it's like a festival in California Lady
Gaga came to this bar and so and she was
very nice and said hello everybody and
we were like yeah we love you they
decided to do karaoke with like my
boyfriend's plan like playing karaoke
and so my boyfriend ended up playing
baby one more time with Lady gaga
I took mine from the pool o'clock
section this is a nice topic my memory
that reminds me of pool clock is my last
birthday I have a whole group of friends
that I love so much like let's just all
go to Palm Springs Nino was there I was
so she'd been a test it was a small
wedding there was a cake we also had a
hashtag anyway it was like a hundred and
ten degrees that weekend we just were by
the pool the entire
time where do we go out after we're
asking the waiter and he was like oh
there just happens to be a club next
door and they're like wow and we get in
no one is there I was nowhere this one
guy challenges my friend Jessica to a
dance battle like we weren't we're even
close to them and he just walks up and
was like dance fast boys she did it
and she won I was like probably my
favorite weekend in my entire life great
collection truly you can buy any of
these shades and just feel like there's
a story behind it and a reason why
you're getting them and a big fan yeah I
really like the packaging that's
actually my favorite thing I just would
want to collect them because they're all
different like it's a good way to get
people to find more than one I think if
you were doing this together with
somebody and like actually like picked
from topics just talk about memories it
would be a great way to just like get to
know somebody a little bit better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
