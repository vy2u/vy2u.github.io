nyla and today I'm going to be trying
the boob and I typically work out three
to five times a week I really love doing
cardio so running the elliptical
Stairmaster it's creepin booty I
recently started working out with a
trainer so I workout probably three to
four times a week I think one thing
that's really hard for women with big
boobs whatever body type you are big
boobs move in places they go in one
direction and usually it stores my face
for doors around I go to a really small
gym I'm always really self-conscious
when I'm like jumping or even doing
jumping jacks that all people are
looking at are my boobs you know sports
bra that's too tight it's just
uncomfortable to wear so I don't like
wearing it and then the sports bra
that's too loose it's very comfortable
but when I'm doing cardio my boobs are
just like smacking me in the face
constantly I have never heard of boob
and it's a very catchy name though so
the boob man comes in three sizes small
medium and large I'm heading to work out
with my boob and well I do like about it
is that it fits anywhere it's like so
squishy and easy to carry so I decided
to wear my loose sports bra I have nail
polish on it's a little toasty
just like this is good it's placed it's
locked
it's loaded got some flab but who
doesn't these days we'll go see how this
works
I feel great there's so much support
I'm not jiggling this is great see that
see that no boom and so much better
honestly
so my first thoughts doing is like
little workout and the product is that
it's not made for my body but like I do
feel a slight difference it's just not
enough that I think this products gonna
be my go-to thing but I just think my
boobs are a little too big because a bit
of and I plan on using the boob and
again it kind of in a weird way
motivated me to get through my workout
because I was comfortable and I didn't
really have any complaints about my
boobs this actually worked and it's kind
of crazy I feel like if I go run stairs
outside I think about like my boobs
bouncing everywhere and not wear double
sports bras and to just put on a sports
bra and wear this I feel a lot better
doing and it's a lot less laundry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
