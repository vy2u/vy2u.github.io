terrifying
what is trying the Sphinx razor today
which claims to be the razor that you
can use anywhere yes I were in my car so
I brought Nina and Izzy and here today
to see if they can shave while I Drive
ms in the back and she has band-aids
just in case something goes wrong just
in case something goes wrong here is my
question where does the hair go great
question your car is gonna be covered in
a layer of like my wool when I shave
there's like a ton of hair on the Rays
where is the hair gonna go so you guys
are gonna try shaving your armpits first
then working your way down to your legs
and if we make it through this car ride
you guys can stick around the see lady
likes version of this video with the
Sphinx razor where they try shaving in
the most extreme places let's see if
this razor lives up to the hype and
let's see if I find any hair in my car
after this
Sting's friends uncle models broken up
into four different compartments one
compartment for water and one shea
butter moisture bar and the two blades
rich of all there are seven steps which
seems like two minutes the first step is
remove half we have to remove water
container and add water oh oh look at
that perfect yummy next step is to place
the water container back and spray water
on desired shape area it should it
tickle oh nice watery mist and look it
but then we rotate the center dial with
both thumbs to the moisturizing bark
whoa oops I went the wrong way there we
go oh okay so it's soap like cheddar
award I love baby Bell it feels fine
that's nice yeah feels very nice we have
to rotate the center dial says first or
back up razor and shave desired areas
all right this is the razor and it's
 terrifying what is it this this
doesn't look like any razor that I own
looks like razors I own cuz I buy
disposable razors there no pot holes and
there's no bumps ahead I start going
smoothly do it I'm not even looking I'm
a woman on the edge okay Wow hair is
going away huh wait I think it's working
really well
it's decent I'm kind of soulful here's
the thing it's not a super close shave I
would say I don't know about you Izzy
but I split I don't know how I guess you
pretty clean yeah pasty legs let's try
it have missed it my leg whew lather 'ok
lather lather lather oh yeah feels like
I'm doing it in a public bathroom you
know yeah that's the quality I'm feeling
right now all right with it my shame
roll bumpy in here whoo okay so it feels
nice it's like pretty smooth but like
how much hair is it actually taking away
yeah ooh ouch we're all my goodness I'm
just really dry to the leg pretty well
yeah there's a lot of hair on the razor
Oh
Ashley's like so it oh baby yeah
definitely like it better for the legs
and for the pit is easier I get a close
shave on the leg than it is on the pit I
think it's better served for some parts
of your body than others but it's like
on all pretty good would you guys ever
use this again this is for like if
you've already shaved but you missed a
patch cuz that happens to me all the
time really do you feel like it's a good
just like a little backup to have them
occur
thanks for driving us around yeah even
your car girl I'll be fighting stubble
in my father's neck like two weeks all
over I'm South Asian and we are very
very people and so like there's a lot of
stuff happening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
