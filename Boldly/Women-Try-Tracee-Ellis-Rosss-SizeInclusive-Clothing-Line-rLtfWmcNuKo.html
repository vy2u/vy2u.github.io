clothes and dancing around today we're
gonna try some pizzas from Tracee Ellis
Ross is live collab with JCPenney I love
Tracy because she is not afraid to try
new colors new style she did not forget
about any body type or size or height
she really kind of designed for everyone
KZ Ellis Ross she's a friend she is a
mom figure she is an icon she's always
dressed really really well I love how
she can go from like casual like cool
mom to like businesswoman and he does it
like very seamlessly this clothing line
is a powerful example for black women of
like what they can do for themselves
there's something that you want to see
out in the world like you can create it
when I was a little girl I'm thinking of
clothing lines I couldn't name you one
that was like a woman of color or that
extended to like all the sizes and now
that there are little girls that can
refer to Tracee Ellis Ross in like a
main store that's all across America -
is insane to me
I'm really excited to try these clothes
on I can't wait yeah let's go get these
look yes
I love this outfit personally this is
chill as a plus-sized woman they're like
don't make things look baggy on you and
this is like so overly baggy that it's
like a look I would be avant-gardist
 with my makeup put on a beret and
live my life I decided to go with the
sequin top because I thought that it
would like fit me better and I feel like
this is a very like Tracee Ellis Ross
outfit I agree it's like you're here to
party but I can get business on you yes
I can't talk about mergers and
acquisitions
Oh
comfy Oh cute
I feel so adult right now like matching
head-to-toe same cribs like oh yes I am
glamorous I go to sleep with my life put
together who cares if I had cereal for
dinner the first thing that caught my
eye were these sparkles this is giving
me disco vibes like I feel like a disco
ball yes I think it's really cool how we
have two different kind of vibes going
on like I have my little ter Tracee
Ellis Ross son have on the dress and
then you have like more of a cash like
hipster look
I like it it's super fun I wouldn't
typically wear this I feel like it's
very form-fitting I feel like my butt is
a little smushed and I'm not wearing
I think I'm tripping your ass looks
great thank you I think I do like it I
think my ass duh looks great I really
love how long it is I've never had a
body con dress that does that it's a
little like obviously we need to get
over that it's tight to our bodies
whatever if it's there you're meant to
see it so it's so long on me but I love
the you're taller and you get like a
little bit of leg let's see to me yours
is like a fashionable long like usually
dresses would like stop a little bit
higher if they're long on you or they'd
go extremely long on you like it's just
enough of your shoe what a body design I
love the color so I think how I would
wear this ensemble
I'll belt it yeah a white belt and I'll
wear some really nice heels this is like
such a great like power work dress sorry
put together it's a fun design also like
great with sandals on vacation going out
to dinner it's so versatile which i
think is fantastic and fluid yeah switch
up the shoe you got it like I should be
wearing this on Easter to church with
the fail like perfect dress all around
I feel like the most stylish person on
Capitol Hill I am really into the fact
that you can wear the Blazer without a
tank top underneath I feel like that's
awesome
I feel very in control of my sex and my
sexuality I also will say I'm pleasantly
surprised by the children pads I do a
lot of thirsting and I see a lot of
shoulder pads from the 80s and they're
very like usually like they take over
the entire outfit it's like oh yeah look
at me yeah I'm powered business don't
put me in this boardroom did this is
more tailored to my waist so I feel like
I'm still giving off Delta Thiet me in
the boardroom don't interrupt me in the
boardroom but I also look sexy we did it
yeah we did and it was such a blast I am
thoroughly pleased with that we tried on
I think my favorite was the gold dress
my favorite was actually the one I was
most scared of which is the suit I just
love the way the pants fit and I never
wear pants but I'm like I think I need
to run out and get some pants yeah
they're an excellent wide-leg I feel
great everything was so good everything
like fit exactly how I wanted it to and
I felt super like powerful in it I feel
very fashionable yeah I feel like I
could I could go out and like how drinks
with people but I could like go to the
office I guess like it's the first tile
I actually am someone who usually shied
away from plants and patterns but like I
really love these patterns I don't know
you can't help but like smile when you
see them I know when Tracy's gonna do
something she's gonna do it right and
her personality and what she represents
is that of inclusiveness so I just knew
that this was going to be a perfect fit
for everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
