least nowadays we have a few options to
battle our periods but what if we didn't
its ladylike and today we're trying out
vintage sanitary belts
we have a box of unopened pads from 1975
vintage 70s sanitary belts printouts
from the 1969 copy of how shall I tell
my daughter Ingrid will you do the honor
oh I will and open that oh it has a
deodorant protection it's like a giant
tissue box
oh hello I'm gonna deceive they smelled
funky take a pat everyone take a pad oh
they're very like squishy
they're like little pillows they're a
little yellowed but it's okay I was just
like the wrapper thing could just I
think it stays there
if you don't wrap it wait what Linux oh
is this this is for the the belt 200 yen
you don't just stick this in your
underwear like we do nowadays a belt or
panty that fits properly will keep the
napkin from twisting and slipping and
sure against telltale bulges and help
guard against accidents boulders and
accidents to things you will avoid with
this product to clarify they didn't wear
them over their clothes but we will be
doing that I have the wedding one but
it's very lazy mind every day you're the
grandma alright let's do this I'm
sweating a little bit I'm sweating a lot
actually
don't sweat shanti and you hold on i'm
sweating - well we can't even figure out
which way is supposed to be the front
I'm thinking this v-shape goes in the
front don't need that we both have a V
in the front so we're like we're gonna
also put the V in the front when I did
wear pads the butt part was always the
one that would get me cuz you know when
you're like sleeping or lying down or
sitting the stains end up like back here
but then you also have to be sure that
you don't slide it too far back because
then you miss stuff from the front look
at your clips they look like little oh
my god that's scary - it was like bottle
opener I know oh my god yours are dainty
though cuz you're getting married
wait are you so you're so far ahead of
me what are you doing well how do you
get ID
stick it in it says to just pull it
through this and then it's supposed to
hold it like that ma where are you how
do I kind of slid mine to the middle I
struck it out along with all the dust
how would you do this on your period
this is a lot of work imagine being on
the toilet unfastening from the back
pulling it out and just being like hmm
let me grab another one of those like
what is this should point out on the
package they describe these as similar
to lingerie we can confirm this is the
sexiest we've ever looked it looks like
a third but gee it's a little like
erotic it's altered way like it has a
hand on my vagina your neck Ricky is
very firmly in place but it's just
uncomfortable because it's just with you
wherever you go I mean if you think
about it's kind of like this is kind of
like a song like a g-string mine is
folia jockstrap with a little tuft at
the end this part like could be cute if
you just eliminated like its actual
purpose there's no way you can just walk
out and feel comfortable on your period
I would suspect that there would be lots
of leaks just rappin I am really
enjoying my little tale so we were
talking earlier about the tell-tale
bulge and now I know what they mean yes
I know imagine if you had to carry this
around like in your bag just in case
your period came I don't like this but I
respect anyone who had to wear this
thanks God for modern period products
that was new I still I still don't quite
know what to say about this after
wearing it for about 15 minutes
its core sort of made itself a cylinder
in between my legs I can't say how
effective this would have been to be
fair the pads are 40 years old I wonder
what they would be like if they're if
they needed to absorb anything yeah I
mean actually though I still very
comfortable peeing my pants right now I
mean really props to all the women
to have worn these because it's tough
it's crazy to think how period
technology has improved literally in the
last like few years versus like all of
female history should point out I do
love the phrase period technology lady
tested lady confused what is it it's
warm it definitely does like a scrunch
