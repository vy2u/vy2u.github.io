clothing line I try to avoid shopping at
all cost I wear the same four outfits I
am a size 12 in most places but a lot of
stores I actually cap out shopping is
not something that I honestly love to do
all the cool stores that my friends and
everybody go to isn't what's going to
have my size so I think it's about time
that women from size 2 to 22 can all
look fashionable and get it from the
same place going shopping for my size is
a little bit difficult I am really
really small so hard to find women's
clothing that fit finding clothes in my
size is not hard and I think about that
a lot when I go shopping and think about
all the women who do have trouble
finding clothes in their size when I go
shopping with my friends it's a little
more difficult either we have separate
stores because one plus size or my sizes
sell out really quickly so it can be a
little difficult shopping in person I
think it takes a long time to learn kind
of what works for you what stores work
for you it's really really tough to kind
of walk into a store and just expect to
find clothes you want when you're a size
18
I tried on this denim jumpsuit I was
like this is not my style it's not going
to look good on me but putting it on
honestly I was pleasantly surprised it's
kind of like that feminist vibe of like
I'm wearing men's clothes but I look way
better than any man ever could and I'm
gonna put some heels on and I'm gonna be
comfortable all day long
you
so today I tried on Zendaya's jumpsuit
in an extra-large
it's a velour jumpsuit this has pockets
lots of pockets which is great it's not
something I try but it's not something
I'm super eager to take off
today I tried on Zendaya's two-piece
kimono set it's kind of like a suit
kimono hybrid situation I like dig it
it's comfortable the fabrics nice it's
kind of good because it gives you a
little more room till we go around your
arms I do kind of feel like I'm going to
like a karate themed club but I feel
pretty good
my expectations for this line I think
everything every piece is going to be
really unique it's going to be a little
bit out of my comfort zone I think it's
a lot different from what I normally
wear
I tried this shear really pretty shirt
and these quadtone Jean I like that the
shirt is kind of work inappropriate but
also you can make it work the pants I'm
a little bit disappointed because they
were really long it would have been
great if you also had different lengths
for pants for short people like me that
would have been really cool if I can
look just 1% legs and daya I will be
 happy
I got outfitted in the dope-ass
two-piece it's matching all laced up all
throughout this sweater and the pan and
it's pretty comfortable I look like some
cool 90s pop star ready to go on stage
I'm keeping my fingers crossed but I'm
like not trying to show my excitement
because like I don't want to see a
letdown happen so today I tried on a
jacket I loved it because it's oversized
and like oversized is so comfy I thought
about it first wearing it as a dress but
then I realized that it really doesn't
do much for my figure so then I just
tried it as a oversized jacket and put
something on underneath and I thought it
was much better I love seeing this line
on everyone's bodies I mean every one of
us has such a different body type and I
thought we all looked fantastic I was so
impressed with how they looked on each
body type and each woman like I think
that that confidence that retailers have
inspires me to have confidence and
wearing it it's like okay if you're
gonna invest your money I will also
invest my money the line is pretty cool
it's definitely for more minimalist
people this is definitely like a hot
line though there's like some sexy stuff
here I think it's awesome that she has
all these different sizes and really
managed to not just make the sizes
smaller or larger but also think about
each person's body type and make it
really fit to them I think it is hard to
think of places that people would want
to wear such a look cuz these are such
strong looks unless you're always
serving good looks all the time which
power to you I think what Sunday is
doing whether you like her clothes or
not is really just paving a path for
celebrity lines to be like hey we should
probably just gear our clothing towards
women of every shape and size because
that's how it should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
