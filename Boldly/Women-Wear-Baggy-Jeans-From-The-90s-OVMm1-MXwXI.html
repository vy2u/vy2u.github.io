want to do with this Danko jeans were
popular in like the late 90s like maybe
early early off oh when I was in Middle
School they were cool to wear them I
never wore them I didn't think that they
would look good on me
judge none choose one I think these
jeans cause a lot of attention and an
attraction I don't want all eyes to be
on me okay these are my gym coaching
this is so much I feel weirdly both
covered and so exposed at the same time
you can't even tell that I have legs in
these pants I put on the tube top I have
the name necklace I'm trying to channel
like late 90s early 2000
I'm from the ground here which is kind
of into it what do you think where are
you damn Jenkins the wedgie was
unbearable we brought and that it's
really hard I'm dying
like sitting down has been rough
these beans and honestly I think they
were on these jeans have been super fun
to wear today I've done a lot of
attention for the most part everyone
loves them but I will say that they have
given me the wedgie of a lifetime and a
very very detailed camel toe
these guys really did it for me I think
if we just loosened it a little bit in
this region these would be like totally
100% something that I would wear again
it was a fun experiment today I'm really
glad that I pushed myself outside my
comfort zone and like did something that
I probably would not have done if it
were not for this video so thanks Jacob
judge Nunn shoes one yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
