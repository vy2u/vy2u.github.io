a sense of smell I do not have a sense
of when my brows are too bold like I
will keep going until they are midnight
black this week we're gonna be wearing
Instagram makeup to me Instagram makeup
is just like if you've ever looked on
your explore page extreme contour there
are many very talented women and men who
do their makeup to the fleetest matte
lip with the liner with the highlighted
Cupid's bow extreme highlight if you
don't have fake lashes you should leave
the explore page I'm just worried about
not looking like myself looking like a
clown and having taken like two hours to
achieve that look I'm most nervous about
the fake lashes that's something I'm
really not used to doing and actually
don't really know how to do last time I
tried to put on my own lashes it took me
about 20 minutes for one lash that fell
off four minutes later I am excited
about learning how to do eyeshadow
because that's something that I've kind
of like avoided for a long time I hope
to learn how the Frick they do their
eyebrows from zero to a perfect ombre to
like sleek on the side I'm hoping that
by the end of the week like I'll feel a
bit more comfortable putting on lashes
and feel like I can throw on lashes for
you know a night out or a date night
alright let's let's do it let's get made
up you know all the my name is Nicole
and I'm a makeup artist and today I'm
going to be teaching the girls how to do
Instagram makeup Instagram makeup is
creative it's dramatic I don't think
it's going to be difficult for the girls
to learn this I think it's going to be a
very fun experience for them to really
see how much goes into Instagram makeup
they may not get it on the first day but
I think throughout the remainder of the
week it's just going to pull together
really nicely for them so we always do
the start with a fresh canvas we want to
remove all those dirt and oils you know
we're girls we naturally in sweats so we
want to make sure we got everything off
of our face
it's going to take me all day to do my
eyes I've never used concealer this
stuff is amazing
so with highlight and contour the rule
of thumb is for highlight it's to bring
out areas that we want to enhance more
and then contour is for those areas that
we necessarily want to push back or we
want to conceal more and you know not
show so much
forehead contours iffy for me because my
baby hairs are so intense now it's time
for the baking so you pretty much you're
applying your translucent where your
highlight is so we got our eyes we did a
highlight to do the contour we have our
blush let it work on our eyeliner so I'm
going to create the line first I've
never started with the tail before yeah
this is crazy
all right here's have your lashes yeah
so just get it placed on like where you
wanted to lay and then you can maneuver
the edges I think this is surprisingly
okay I think I finally done I'm hot and
a little confused what time it like what
time of day is it I don't know
I hope that we do your proud this week
yeah on everybody to see well tag you in
every photo I love your lash gauge
you're about to bat your eyes and
 blow me away Ria's okay it's a
lot more makeup especially in terms of
the on top of your eye that I'm used to
it's kind of fun and it looks good when
you look at it for a second I feel like
this is like glamour shots yeah like oh
I want to give you like a boa and then
bedazzled earrings wandering around the
mall uh didn't know what to do today
didn't expect to be going out but I feel
like I did my makeup so I probably
should so we decided to get soup
dumplings
I nearly actually fell asleep with this
makeup on which would have been horrible
I am bout to take his makeup off it's
gonna be a quest so I'm home and my
eyelash is hanging by a thread it looks
completely insane but also it's weirdly
satisfying to take off all that makeup
so let's make good so I not have to do
my own Instagram makeup for the first
time by myself and I do not know where
to begin I'm stressed Chantal is way
ahead of me how's it going it's it's
going as you guys can see I did not have
time for the cut crease today but it
still took me 50 minutes from beginning
to false lashes friend and I have been
deliberating which brushes which we
don't know which one is which so I'm now
taking to the internet so it's an hour
and 40 minutes later what a concealer
it's pointed concealer my eyelashes feel
a little finicky like I feel like at any
moment they could fall off but we're
just rolling with it the color
definitely isn't as strong as it was
when we did it with Nicole I now see the
appeal of a salade because I had a
salade and I only really messed up my
lipstick everything else is pretty much
in good shape your eyelashes
a very present so I would definitely
equate doing all this makeup to artistry
um however the sad part about it is that
like you don't have a product forever
you put in all this work and at the end
of the day you just wipe it off I'm
about to go to a shoot in like ten
minutes I don't have time to do the
whole nine I'm gonna do my brows come
back and finish it then I don't have
time today I don't know if I am very
doing Instagram make it yeah I don't
have time to do a cut crease and that's
a real thing so this is my calendar
there is no time for me to be spending
an hour and a half on my makeup there's
just no time so I am half with your
contouring and realized I forgot to put
on foundation so Freddie I just looked
over and you look like an angry ghost
this whole week has been so fun
experimenting with eyeshadows and I feel
very much like a little eye shadow
experimenter my lashes though they are
decked out in mascara do not have the
fake lashes on them and that's because
yesterday I got blue in my eye and it
hurt a lot it's windy out and I feel
like my lashes are gonna fly off I'm
gonna take my makeup off as soon as I
get home just to give my skin a little
bit of a break I'm going to have to have
a funeral for my makeup because r.i.p
this look that I liked a lot okay so
this is gonna be my first attempt at
doing my makeup before work I'm gonna
see if I can knock it out in an hour
because that's the only time that I have
this is the closest I think I've gotten
all week to the original look I'm pretty
proud of what I did I don't think it's
perfect I think that I can definitely
work on the cut crease a little bit but
it's close its close ish I did the
concealer and all of that stuff and now
I don't remember what comes
I think it's I think I just go straight
to eyeshadow I was so close to getting
this done in an hour flat and of course
the lashes added 25 more minutes so I'm
at an hour and 25 minutes definitely did
not hit the hour mark and I'm now 10
minutes late for work
I think I was a little bit less product
shy I did leave my eyelashes off though
should have known today would be a rough
one since I only have one earring and
also so bad lash one earring it's just a
day but I've all this makeup on my face
and it kind of worked out today because
we are doing our fashion show for the
clothes that we made so we'll be walking
down that runway in just a short bit I
spent a lot of time on my makeup today
and I'm just sad to have to take it off
so I'm just kind of like in the bathroom
like procrastinating like you know
waiting so I'm about to do the last day
of Instagram makeup and I am already
tired I know my shadow is pretty low-key
today and that is not Instagram makeup
Instagram makeup is the opposite of
low-key but since I have a lot of other
things happening this wig blood on my
nose I had to keep it chill Freddie just
called me out for not wearing my lashes
and she was like oh so you don't have
any and I was like no I got so I just
thought where the eating is very
difficult because you get this guy so we
were staring into the Sun trying to take
selfies and look what happened to my
damn eyes shadow
it didn't give myself enough time to do
all this makeup I definitely did it the
fastest I've done it but still not quite
enough time and I'm running late I think
I literally got glue in my eyes I think
I might be getting better at applying
lashes Wow
it only took many many days so we tried
Instagram makeup for a week a long week
and it was uh dehydrating it was tiring
I just always felt tired after doing it
I was out of breath one day out of
breath I hadn't read in your own face my
own face I thought it was 79 percent fun
as I was doing it it was like this just
doesn't feel like it's Who I am I did
have fun learning how to do it I'm going
to keep doing this not every day but
sometimes it's definitely so much that I
learned that I will implement just maybe
like different skills on different days
and not all skills on one yes lady
tested lady will do some things
sometimes
no nobody you guys are crazy I feel
freaking exactly yeah well thank you
