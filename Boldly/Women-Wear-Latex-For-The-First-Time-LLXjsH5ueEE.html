Tanya have you ever had any experience
with latex at all before I don't even
like wear tight clothes me so nothing
close to latex
I'm more of a like shirts and loose
baggy tees kind of girl I'm gonna want
to be casual latex before that I've
never been styled by another so that's
pretty exciting it's quite a scary thing
to do for the first time a little bit
nervous I think it's about finding the
right garment the right garment for you
but the one that makes you feel really
empowered I'm really excited to feel and
look like a giant condom you're
definitely going to feel like a giant
condom but a very sexy giant condom all
right all right let's do it come on
my god
it's so good like I'm about to like
perform at a Katy Perry concert of Katy
Perry my gosh I feel like an endangered
species or something actually like I
feel so naked but I'm looking less naked
then I feel feel really powerful I feel
like I want to go out and dance five
times and basically conquer the world
this is never colonized it feels like a
second skin of something I would never
pick ever but I am really sold on it
actually how do you feel now that you're
finally in latex for the first time you
know what I'm actually so surprised how
much I love it I was really surprised
today actually I really like this color
and I really like how the latex shows
off my figure a lot of women find that
when they try it on the first time is
that same natural fear of being too
exposed and finding out that it actually
is just so much more sexier than they
thought everything is sort of on show
but you feel like a actually like a
superhero and I you know it's a thing we
go oh gosh I just need to remember to
feel like this all the time I don't
think I've ever liked myself more
actually it sounds really weird to say
but latex is actually really flattering
I felt like I was this weird mixture of
like Tank Girl Catwoman and like a bikie
and it was the best feeling in the Lord
you feel almost invincible and so
there's something that makes you go I
need to stop apologizing I thought that
I would walk away from today feeling
insecure about certain bits of my body I
thought that the latex have kind of
highlight all the things I don't like
but it kind of did the opposite it's fun
to try new things and you never know
what you might learn about yourself I
actually feel a little bit like Lady
Gaga I think this is a hundred percent
something she would wear and I'm on
board with that because I think she's
pretty great I'm not sure if I can take
it off or if I want to so we got you
addicted now yeah I feel like it's one
of those things like once you pop you
can't stop
but awesome I had so much fun
you're living yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
