already regretting this which is an
all-time record in terms of how fast I
have regretted the decision efficient
mom jeans high waist long crotch wide
hip can we get away with wearing mom
jeans without being moms
we'll find out it's ladylike and we're
playing can I wear that mom jeans
edition I don't really like pants in
general so I feel like any jeans trend
is just a thing that's happening over
there away from me I already dressed
like a mom most of the time especially
in springtime I love kimonos I love kids
I'm into the trend
I like the trendy versions of the mom
jeans but in terms of like a true mom
Jean like a colles mom Jean I'm a bit
concerned I always planned on being a
leggings and multiple scarves kind of
mom so the idea of mom jeans is kind of
terrifying to me
mom jeans are usually higher waist and
tapered at the ankle I really like mom
jeans because they are super versatile
just depending on the top in the shoes
it can totally transform the look when
I'm wearing mom jeans as a casual look I
usually like to wear a tank top or a
t-shirt and tuck it in in the front
because the high waist is really what's
going to lengthen everything if you're
wearing with sandals and they aren't
already cropped you should roll them up
a little it's really easy to throw a
button-up shirt over it and a blazer and
you can put on some nice shoes and you
can go to the office like that people
will take you very seriously you do not
have to be a mom to rock mom Jean so you
just have to have an ounce of style
that's it figure out what makes your
butt look good and you can rock mom Jean
I can get our mom denied by mom jeans
Kohl's certified I keep forgetting I
have them on they're so comfy and then I
stand up and realized that they rise all
the way up to the bottom of the tips I
always lose my parking ticket but today
I didn't because I just kept it in my
back pocket and it didn't fall out
because they're actually teeth I don't
know how to style these at all pants are
so complicated what do people do
those are mom jeans I didn't notice I
thought that you're just wearing them
really high up cuz I was like a new
style where the mom jeans on the plane
felt light as a feather slept so great
you're great
I literally just googled how to pants so
that's how this day is going we just
walked by two moms wearing skinny jeans
and I think they judged me I think they
judged my mom jeans normally when I get
home
I take off my bra and change into comfy
pants but today I don't feel the need to
change into comfy pants because I'm
already insanely comfortable you guys
are only putting good twists on it with
like modern style like seriously I don't
even know this is an outfit I don't know
if you can legally call something an
outfit if it's just what you would wear
to sleep plus pants I look very 90s
today like
meg Ryan in every movie ever the other
weird thing about these jeans that you
have to worry about the upper panty line
which is a panty line that no one has
ever had to fix before I see why they're
a trend because it's kind of like this
like ugly pretty thing like oh it's not
really enhancing any of your features
it's kind of a statement piece every
time I'm eating I happen to like waist
things on my mom jeans it's okay I just
feel like a mom and I used the tide to
go up in just like get that stain right
out okay so I'm killing the game right
now with braids minimal makeup as you
can see
Birkenstocks and my mom jeans I am
bombing out today and it's so insane
today it was great like I put something
together that didn't involve a t-shirt
and wasn't a total disaster uh and I
liked it and I was comfortable in the
pants that was also amazing by the way
pants are kind of great mom Dean we did
it I learned to love pants I love these
pants because they're stretchy they're
mobile but I do wish that there was a
tapered leg I agree and I wish they were
black cuz like the wash is a little
difficult at times what I did like about
them was the fact that like choosing an
outfit each day was pretty easy yes it
was just like okay mom jeans and then it
doesn't really matter what else you wear
because it's just mom jeans I feel like
we all needed more crotch in order to
fill out the jeans but wait oh my god
that's not extra room yeah not how body
work yeah mom jeans are made for penises
is what we learned all right guys
lady tested lady Annerose yeah liked it
love yeah hey nice Maggie
