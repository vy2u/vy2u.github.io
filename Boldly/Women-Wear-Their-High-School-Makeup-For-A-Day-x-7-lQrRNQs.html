Frank cloud today we're gonna be taking
it back old school I'm going to recreate
my atrocious high school look being an
emo is like a form of expression for me
since I was like really like shy and
like depressed and lonely I just figured
I might as well look the way I fell on
the inside hello just look really dark
and scary freshman year and sophomore
year of high school I was like into like
weird colorful makeup and like the big
hair and just I don't even know what
scene is this day I was I was following
a trend I definitely hung out with
multiple types of groups like I hung out
with the jocks I got the crabs people
who like the band's the drama I never
really associated myself with one
specific group the groups that I hung
out with in high school the first year I
didn't really fit in with them so I was
like sad all the time and kind of like
by myself
but when I transferred high schools that
group that was just a group of fun
really like awesome people who were
super into dancing and Bollywood the
very eyelash primer I had in high school
this is the eyeshadow we'll only be
using the black one I struggled a little
bit with acne so Foundation was a
crucial part is the pencil I'll say
black no I hadn't yet figured out that
there was like an inside you know crease
to put a different color in so it would
literally just be two colors I only put
the foundation around my eyes and around
my lips girl Sailor Mercury was my that
was like my myspace URL I never make it
fold because I feel like it looks really
harsh but back then I used to make like
this little square in the front now that
I'm doing this again I just realized how
dumb this is well I would start like way
back here okay this is like not even a
drill looks like a caterpillar the
island is basically just too like lying
out the rock hair and eyes
it's nice again to see how far I've come
I feel like I'm looking at a mirror that
I just want to like punch as you can see
I am blind out of my right eye I may
trip over some objects I don't want to
leave this chair I don't want to go
outside into the real world because I
don't know what'll happen a lot of my
time in high school would've been
shopping for makeup so I'm gonna go to
Sephora and see how this experience go I
got compliments on everything but my
makeup these eyelashes definitely block
the Sun they're like a little umbrellas
for my eyes I think your eyelashes are
like way bigger than they were yesterday
I kept getting so many double takes and
I had to explain myself I was like this
isn't what I look like every day don't
worry coworkers are looking at me
actually went surprisingly well there
were a couple laughs but everyone else
kind of really liked this colorful love
sure luckily nobody was scared they were
all pretty good like a lot of people
were like oh my god I love it but when I
walked into the bathroom and looked at
my face the murals like yeah do you like
makeup yes kind of looks like my Hot
Topic jury I think that I like looking
back at pictures of myself when I was
younger and saying like oh I really did
change I did learn how to be bold and
really embrace my inner happiness I'm
just glad that I'm not afraid anymore I
feel like I was hiding behind all this
makeup I can look at this makeup today
and be like oh my god that looks
ridiculously ugly people back then
really did compliment me on my makeup
and really encouraged me more to like oh
you should try to pursue becoming a
makeup artist that really gave me the
push to really pursue a passion be proud
of who you are
and represent it in your look on your
face remember that makeup is to enhance
your beauty you are already beautiful
the way you are
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
