woke up because I choked on my own boob
and fallen into my mouth this is what
I'm dealing with on a day-to-day basis a
bralette is basically like an arts and
crafts project that you have to wear
afterwards roll outs are like these
really thin kind of sports bras and hot
girls pretty much just wear them to
Coachella bra let's are intended to be
seen this is actually like a kind of a
cute top so it basically just takes the
fact that people see your bra straps all
the time and makes it intentional for me
a bras a necessity it's not a fashion
statement it's more like I need to do
this or else my boobs will cause me pain
I will be trying on this absolutely no
wire I try to like buy bras like if I
was in a car accident what I want
someone to cut this bra off of me
this is where my boob should be this is
where they are I think that the week is
going to be challenging style wise and
somebody somebody wise but honestly I
think it might be worth it my stomach is
here and so my nipple is kissing so
picking out something aware today was
actually terrible because everything
makes my boobs look saggy they're just
so hypnotized by the baby but it's
tripped on a chair but today two of
braless we're wearing our bondage e one
yes Merson asked you I was thinking of
ways to hide it while Kristin was like
how can I make this into my outfit these
straps just keep on like
oh yeah I mean everywhere they're made
to be seen blue bralette look at that
cleavage man these are not supportive my
boobs feel like too sad water balloons
about to hit my feet that's also doesn't
have like a cute v-neck or like side
thing or something it's Ryan and i's
engagement party and i know I suppose be
wearing a bra today and I wasn't sure if
it was gonna work but then I realized
that this bralette actually goes pretty
well my white dress it's really too hard
trying to figure out how to make this
for all look classy I think I kind of
did it crap you think that part of your
dress no it's not it's not part of my
dress to the bra it's in tough to come
up with outfits I think so this is
today's outfit it's kind of like farm
girl chic but honestly I feel like this
fraud is the only one that has any
support because it has like a D seat
belt attached
I'm just really over notes before the
ovulate of my boobs hitting my stomach
when I walk up to downstairs
so it's the end of the week do we think
the brawler's are something that women
with big chests can wear yeah I
think it's gonna take a little bit more
trial and error most places have freebie
turds yeah as well just try exact if a
store doesn't have free returns don't
shop there it's like going to a fast
food place with no drive-through you
don't deserve our business boobs are
like snowflakes they are all different
our boobs are different so brats are
gonna be more effective for different
people
