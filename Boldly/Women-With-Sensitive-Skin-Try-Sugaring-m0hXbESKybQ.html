we were just getting normal waxes so
this is a surprise to me hi I'm Danielle
Cara with sugaring LA and here we offer
a sweeter alternative than waxing I'm
just really excited to have really
smooth skin because shaving it comes
back after like an hour I already feel
it
usually when I get waxed or threaded my
skin gets really irritated so I'm really
hoping that sugaring will avoid that and
it'll be smooth and painless I'm not a
big fan of shaving I get a lot of
ingrown hairs so I'm interested to see
if this is a better option so I'm really
excited I really don't think it works we
must try it let's do it alright so we're
gonna to apply our sugar paste sugaring
and dates back all the way to the
ancient Egyptians it was said that
Cleopatra had her whole body sugared
except her eyebrows in her hair as I'm
molding the sugar on it's seeping into
the hair follicle it's wrapping around
the hair and then as I go to flick it
pulls it up in the natural direction the
reason we use our sugar paste is it's
made of lemon sugar and water and it's
all organic ingredients and it doesn't
stick to any live skin cells so we're
just exfoliating the dead skin cells so
it's actually like a skin conditioning
treatment that's really good for your
skin that is the cool part with the
sugar you know it's really like seeping
into the hair follicle
oh yeah the sugar paste is safe for all
skin types hair textures we use a
lukewarm paste that warms up to your
body temperature so you're never left
red or hot or irritated and clients just
love the results because they don't have
the redness or the tenderness that they
can get with waxing it feels so much
cleaner than shaving doesn't it well and
it's actually pulling it up by the root
shaving just cuts it off at the surface
of the skin
we're just loosening it right now I'm
going over it the first time so the cool
part was triggering is we're able to
kind of keep going over it to work these
short hairs my armpits feel the
smoothest they have ever felt in my
entire life it's why from when I was a
baby who didn't have any hair but like
this is great I got my eyebrows and my
mustache done and my skin feels so
smooth it feels very exfoliated I
couldn't believe how clean and easy it
was and also eco-friendly it kind of
baffles me that it's an option that
doesn't hurt the environment in any way
and that we're not using it more
sugaring usually lasts about four to six
weeks depending on what stage you're
pulling your hair out we recommend
people coming in every three to five
weeks so they're able to pull the next
stage of hair that's coming through and
that's how you're gonna get the long
term permanent results I definitely want
to get it done again I feel like it
pulls hairs out better than wax cuz it
was getting even my short hairs it felt
very exfoliating like it was getting rid
of all like the dead skin cells and my
skin feels so smooth eyebrows are all
shaped so I feel good I always shave so
there's always some form of prettiness
in some corner so it's really nice
knowing that it's not gonna grow back in
two days and then I'm not gonna get an
ingrown hair I'm just gonna run around
with my armpits in the air why not I
just want people to feel my legs is that
weird
I've never asked someone to feel my legs
but I think this is the time that I
would say would you like to feel my legs
those are crazy so damn good right
overall she did such a great job she has
the magic touch this is pretty sweet if
he asked me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
