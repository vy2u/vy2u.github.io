when I was like 11 my boob started
growing really fast and then they just
stopped growing and they never continued
oh you know if I definitely had boob
Envy
doesn't matter how much weight I put on
they stay the same it's so frustrating
the only time I ever feel like I really
have boobs is when I'm PMSing boob
touching cleavage is not something that
I achieve ever it's like something I
wanted forever like unless have cleavage
I'm not sure how comfortable I'm gonna
feel walking around I just feel like
people are gonna know I'm faking it I've
seen this all over Instagram I've
actually seen an article written about
it to some people said it was good and
others said it didn't work at all so
like I'm really interested to see if it
would work with me cleave me up oh my
god there's a spa slit your nipple
doesn't have sticky stuff on it I
haven't even laced it up yet and I have
cleavage I classified myself as like an
a for the video but I think I needed the
because I'm falling out a little bit
that's okay let's see what happens when
we do this
okay oh my goodness okay look at them
touching and nervous because I don't
understand what it's like to have boobs
I don't know what to expect
but I'm just curious to see if this does
change how we will look at me
this I'm a little uncomfortable going
out and it's like very much on the
market on display I do wonder though
from the side they might look flat as a
pancake
because flat I have no boobs from the
side at all like my ribs is
bigger than my baby I will say it looks
quite good just straight on with my hair
down so that you can't see any other
witness at the sides I feel like I have
a bounce in my step because there's
something to bounce stairs I've just
been informed that I have like a double
boob because we brought ends here and
they're like have more hair because it's
trying like push them up so yeah that
line actually doesn't look too great the
bra gives me cleavage for like 10
minutes and to like move and then it's
just like it stayed on most of the time
except for when I drove 20 minutes in
the heat
my whole bra area is so sweaty and awful
I feel like beginning to unstick because
the bra is a size too small it keeps
sliding off of me so I have a plan and
this ladies and gentlemen is what we've
been waiting for and my sister knew it
was immediately she was like I said that
one with the lace do you notice anything
different about me physically you've got
bigger boobs I was like wait a minute
she's got cleavage not normal I'm sorry
Easter I don't know what's too much and
what is just looks normal you know yeah
take it from me that's normal
there they are I feel like I care way
more about my boobs than my boyfriend
does that weird do you notice anything
different you're wearing clothes are you
shorter oh you're not wearing a bra
oh my god no bigger
my boyfriend tells me a little time how
he really likes my school Boop so I I
don't know how he's gonna react does it
look natural I don't like it I like you
the way you are ah
so I've been sitting around with this
awful stomachache and I couldn't figure
out what it was but I think the pressure
that this bra is like cutting into me
right here with this thing that I have
on to ensure the Cleve is happening
I think it's pressing on my stomach and
making me feel sick so I'm gonna take it
off and see if it makes me feel any
better I already feel so much better
having those boobs is not worth having a
massive stomach ache having cleavage was
fun for a moment but it requires so much
work that it just didn't matter it was
like a novelty to have a chest birthday
but I felt really insecure with it
actually surprisingly I went out to
lunch and I did surprisingly notice more
people looking at me I would just look
around the room and notice that their
eyes were already on me and I've never
really experienced that before one of my
male friends but he can't say hi to me
just like stead nothing but my chest and
like I've never had that happen before
and it made me feel so uncomfortable
I've always wondered what it would be
like to have cleavage and I wondered if
I would find myself more attractive or
more sexy and through this I think I've
realized that I don't I see women with
small boobs who I think are super
beautiful and super sexy all the time I
definitely learned that I'm not as into
cleavage as I thought I was like I
thought I was really missing out but
considering how insecure I felt when I
had it I don't think I'm that desperate
to have it anymore I think I should just
be happy with who I have whatever level
of boob you have non boob big boob small
boo boom there's no wrong way to feel
sexy whatever makes you feel good is the
right way to be doing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
