to play I tend to do a lot of my
workouts outside because I don't like
looking in the mirror when I work out
because I'm really critical of what I
see I think it's very easy to be like
yeah sure I'll do this I'll just like
take off my shirt and then in the moment
you're gonna be like oh I would
really like to stop thinking about my
body so much and stop being so hard on
myself I already was like man I wish I
didn't sign up for this now it just
seems to like oh does Kate not realize
she doesn't have a six-pack maybe so we
should tell her it's not quite to the no
shirt stage yet I kind of want to face
that fear head-on of having to see all
parts of my body I hope I just feel very
confident about myself even more so than
I already do
I think if this week can even allow me
to let go of that a little bit I will
consider it a success
I was kind of amazed at how I don't know
unselfconscious I was at the time
probably because it was very dark in
there so it was like a good first class
to kind of like get into it nobody else
was acting like it was weird so then it
made me feel like it actually wasn't
weird and maybe this week isn't gonna be
so bad
it felt kind of good and I noticed a lot
of people were doing it but I wasn't
super sold till like day three one
really positive thing about this
experience is that working out shirtless
has allowed me to focus a lot more on my
core form and I feel like I'm getting a
more effective workout and that was
something I wasn't expecting to happen a
morning workout is done in the park I
felt like everyone was watching me I
don't know if I want to do it again in
the daytime it was a little stressful
the practicality of it is pretty great
you're not getting your shirt all soaked
in sweat and you can stay a little bit
cooler during the workout so it's a
little bit more comfortable and then
after the workouts over you have this
like nice dry shirt to put back on once
you start getting cold again so today
felt great like badass extra fabric it
just it gets in my way now usually in
every work unless there's like one
person who doesn't wear a shirt and I
had to be that person who took off a
jacket and I was so worried that people
would think I was trying to show off and
then a few minutes later I looked around
the room and four other people had taken
their shirts off I think you just get in
your own head like I need to get better
I need to get better I need to get
better before I can reach this goal but
really I mean it feels better just to be
comfortable at the point you're at now
it flew by and I noticed how like great
it felt not to like be all covered up I
felt very free and my workout I think
that a lot of the insecurities I have
about people thinking I'm bragging or
people thinking that I'm showing off
might be self imposed so I just finished
my last workout of the week and while I
wasn't able to get rid of insecurities I
have about my own body I was able to
stop caring what other people thought
about me you know what like that's one
shirt I will not have to wash so I am
very excited yeah I feel like it was
good confidence boost all round I didn't
think this challenge was going to be
that hard but it was actually incredibly
difficult and taught me a lot about how
much I worry about what other people
think about me in the gym to all the
plus-size girls out there who think they
can't take off their shirts because
people are gonna look at them them
 them hard who cares I would love
for us all to stop worrying about what
we look like and start worrying about
how we feel this challenge allowed me to
realize I still have my own work to do
in that department
it seems superficial but I don't know it
just
I feel confident more confident in
athletic ads women are usually shirtless
I felt more athletic because I looked
like that ad and that was really cool to
kind of feel a little sexier in the gym
there's no reason that you should feel
like you can't take off your shirt and I
just think it's like freeing you just
like feel good if you're a person who's
like I just need to get better and then
I can get this if it's like to wear a
bikini or if it's to work out or to buy
these pants or something just do the
thing now because you're there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
