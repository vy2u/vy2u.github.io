to be honest with you my past experience
with finding foundation has always been
really hard to find something that
matches my skin tone never goes dark
enough I love noise noise and really
caters to my skin tones and eye
undertones and it really brings out the
keys in my skin I just are actually
trying to look for a real foundation
until I was like a sophomore in college
ever since then I just went to Sephora
had them do the color matching thing in
drugstores
you know I have a really great
relationship in high school I definitely
wore a drugstore makeup I remember my
friend telling me one day that my makeup
did not match my skin tone it's like
yeah your makeup looks kind of orange
and I was like when I started using
makeup first went to a drugstore and I
had a really really bad experience
probably bought like three or four
different ones they all didn't match I'm
a little nervous to go out and wear
foundation that probably isn't my skin
tone in public just because I know
people will probably be like all right
look at that black girl trying to look
like skin no I'm not trying to do that
at all not even a love-hate relationship
at our makeup it's just like we don't
see eye to eye because they don't see me
I often find that and like it in-between
between two shades my biggest
reservations or that I'm gonna look like
I'm about to be sent to the morgue we're
on our way to CVS to get some drugs for
my makeup
but it's said that it's the darkest
color I'm scared I'm gonna put these on
and then I'm gonna look a lot lighter
than my actual skin tone these were the
darkest colors in two different products
what is it if I blend it enough it'll
like kind of match follow me
where where do you see my palm is where
I'm gonna put it neither one of these
this is definitely team white skin and
this is definitely team Breanna these
are all supposedly mochas this one I
think my me the one that was literally
before this was three shades lighter
there was no in between
creamy beige yeah and so beige is the
darkest color or at least what was
available in that sort I don't see it
happening but I never know hopefully I
find one so I don't have to spend $40 at
Sephora anymore today I'm gonna go with
this foundation the day has arrived
it looks very white and I just kind of
want to get it over with the keeper in
this piece this one actually I feel good
about definite like my summers hands to
be glowing right now but I feel lighter
than I'd like to be able to keep this
it's not like it's distracting it's just
not really that true to my skin tone
which is a shame because I love my skin
tones keep in mind when I was at the
store I chose what was the darkest one
there and what was available to me can I
see what's gonna what's gonna probably
happen what is this this one's not as
bad that's yesterday's I actually got
with this one I am wearing the lightest
shade that I chose I've been at work for
like an hour no one seems to notice so
I'm just gonna go up to people
if they notice anything different about
me you look the same I currently have
Revlon this might actually work so I'm
really really liking this Revlon golden
caramel color on me it blends really
nicely it's not too heavy and it looks
bomb what do you think of my face is a
new he is glowing this isn't my color
but it's not terrible this looks like
something that maybe I could have worn
before in the summer
look so good I'm so excited that I
finally don't have to spend $40 I
already know this is not gonna work out
for me
hello what is this exactly whether there
is a darker shade or not I don't know
because this was the only option
available for the darkest shade oh my
god
yeah this this is what I look like with
all my makeup and it doesn't look that
bad Karen I'll see you a direction or
jaqen now I'm gonna do these does my
neck blank into my face just not too mad
about it now I'm smoothing it in I will
say it got better but I mean had to
shoots today so I was meeting a lot of
new people and I was on
permit and the foundation I was using
didn't really hinder from the experience
for the other two girls it's like
probably constantly on their mind we
made it we made it to day five it's my
last day using the foundations it mean
by Maybelline but maybe it'll work for
in here and like as you can see
Maybelline you you are the winner you
are the one that has been the closest to
my skin so it's kind of starting to
blend in a little with the lighter area
of my face the dark area as you can see
it's not the same color but this could
end up giving me like a completely even
skin tone so do you think that according
to I think in general all of the
foundations that I've been using get rid
of the redness and make my skin tone
even which is cool something really
positive that I'm starting to realize
about some of these makeup products is
that even though I may think it's not
necessarily my skin tone a lot of people
who see me aren't having an issue with
it so actually some of these products
might actually work this past week has
been very interesting for me it wasn't
really a challenge the last time I used
drugstore makeup uh six years prior fast
four years later they still don't have
my color out of the five that I tried I
think maybe it was a Maybelline one when
I you know tend to line up a little in
the winter I could see that product
actually working for me I like the
Revlon one a lot because I think it
matched true to my skin color and that's
exactly what I wanted a foundation and
I'm currently wearing it right now so
the brand that I think that the one
infallible makeup one if I manage if I
might use that one my viewpoint has
changed a lot with drugstore makeup you
know the first time I tried it out I was
like 13 years old maybe the brands over
the years have just brought in their
options and had more colors available I
found out that some of these companies
actually do have darker foundations but
they're available online
the lighter person gets to go in the
drugstore and just buy their makeup I
should be able to as well for me that
was probably the most eye-opening part
is just recognizing my privilege as a
lighter skinned woman of color I
appreciate you these brands who actually
give take the time to do your research
to go in your lab and and take
feedback from people like me so keep
doing your thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
