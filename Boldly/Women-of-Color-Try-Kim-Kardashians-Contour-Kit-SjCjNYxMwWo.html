different way if you don't like the way
I do it you can catch me outside when I
contour I usually contour before a night
out when I want to look like an
Instagram model oh of course I've heard
of Kim's contour kit who do you think I
am because Kim is known as like the
contour goddess I think that it's gonna
be a good product a little wary about
you know how it's gonna show up on my
skin I struggle a lot finding the right
shades for my skin tone in terms of
people of color I am NOT like the
darkest person of color that I know but
it's still really hard for me sometimes
this could go anyway this could go
horribly wrong or this could be the best
thing ever so we'll see
the packaging is kind of nice it's like
you could either be getting makeup or
you could be getting seaweed I love love
love this so there's this cute brush oh
my god that's all it comes with I'm
Nutella colored this is Nutella colored
I mean we're in a good range here she
included some instructions on how to
snatch your face to begin applying the
contour shade of your choice on the
hairline jawline inside of the nose and
hollows of cheeks I can see why she does
that what I'm seeing is very subtle so
I'm still kind of on the fence of
whether or not this is like the contour
kit for me I'm what are we just using
this as foundation y'all begin
highlighting apply the mattad
highlighter so any areas you wish to add
a natural highlight and glow to without
any shimmer the chin forehead
this is probably what Kim does it's
either too light or the undertone is not
I'll really like the way it goes on
though it's a really pretty color this
is my favorite part
okay you're onto something have the
shimmer highlight honestly saved the day
I would buy this if she just sold this I
would buy it overall I think the contour
stick itself was really nice all in all
I know that there are better contour
options for me out there so I feel like
I would definitely go for those it's
insane that the market for makeup is
still so limited then we have so many
different skin tones to us we can't just
have one monotone color applied to those
that are researching that and finding
better colors and shades for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
