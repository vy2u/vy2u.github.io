weeks ago it's winter so it's over for
all of that
today we're gonna use two different
razors on two different legs I've shaved
my legs maybe about once a month I only
really shave when I have to go out just
wear pants you know you need to shave
your legs if you're wearing pants I like
to get women's razors and I think
probably because I've been conditioned
to just think that they're better and
they are colorful and I like colors I
typically use a mens razor just because
I do have that like thick hair so this
is simply Venus by Gillette and this is
just Gillette no Venus
so they logic has a three blade shaver
for women then we have same day logic
for men
Schick Quattro both have four blades
these are purple and Purple's my
favorite color so their marketing worked
so I'm starting with a mens razor and
the men's shaving cream edging blade for
precision titanium and diamond coated
blades okay so this is the Gillette
sensitive skin foamy shave home aah whoo
whoa I could actually really feel the
strip wow that's very smooth I don't
even know if it actually got any hairs
oh I can see how it'd be easier for me
to cut myself with this razor like I
just took it around the ankle and I had
to be a little bit more careful there it
was really good it's strange that it's
actually getting a lot of my hair
because it's times where I have to go
like a couple times this isn't getting
everything the first time around which
is disappointing men's versions were
fine very good when I think it's a win I
love mens razor one really long hair I
completely miss now we're going to
women's we have the skin Schmitt
skintimate intimate estimate this is
really scary this looks like it would
cut me this design looks very curvy like
a lady like a curvy lady fuck it hurts
this is crazy like men's razors are just
so much better lubricated is so it
mmm see there's a little bit of blood oh
no I'm late I guess getting a job then
all you can ask for I would rather use
the guys than the girls it's so intimate
so I bled and now I'm all red right here
and I'm red there I don't think there's
a soft difference I feel like it's the
same
I think the men's rays are one so we'll
check back in a few days to see how they
held up so the woman's razor worked the
best it's kind of a letdown because I
feel like this whole time I could have
been using women's razors and it would
have worked a little better the women's
is just cleaner so I'm probably gonna
use the women's razor for now on the
mens razor did a lot better for me I
mean the hair grew back at the same rate
but the leg shaped with the women's
razor has like more marks and scabs
because it kind of tore my skin a little
bit more the way that the mens razor did
better for me hair is going back on both
of them but it's longer on this one this
bad boy thank you for letting me shave
my legs I wouldn't have done it for two
months if it weren't for this its
ladylike and today we're trying razors
I'm not ladylike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
