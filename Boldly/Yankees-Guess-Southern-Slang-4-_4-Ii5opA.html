no I'll show you my redneck card if you
need to see it I can do that there's a
car
I believe peddle means to pee it's like
messing around with somebody I was
piddling with them hips full and a
poodle of piddle right that's it poodle
so pedal to waste time just messing
around
quit pedaling around or I've also heard
people say fiddly diddling it's a thing
yeah quickly diddling around I people
say this could be sexual like let me
turn your hide let me let us hand my
hide I don't know this one
I probably means just get a suntan I
know what this one means this is when
you whoop someone's ass tanmaya hidin
one of the most terrifying phrases in
the southern diction it just you know
you're gonna get your ass whooped
this seems like it's not a real word I
don't even know I don't know it sounds
like a nickname for a hippo or something
it's like if someone falls over and
their legs and limbs are all over the
place it's like man look at the way he
fell he's all cattywampus caddywhompus
this is a phrase that you all hear
mainly in cartoons
it just means things are going crazy
it's a little you know things have gone
awry I'm sorry
like it should be as simple as it is but
it's not when you're like hungry and but
you're too lazy to go out and get food
that dog just won't hunt can't satisfy
his lady that dog won't hunt is
basically just saying this is useless
like that boys is useful as the dog
won't hunt it just did
why do you even have it give it up that
dog won't hunt this cannot be a real
thing
probably means something like it's a
problem to you but it's really not that
big of a deal is this like when
something small but then if you were a
grasshopper it would seem giant you're
when you're young so you're a knee-high
to a grasshopper probably means that
last thing you were seen we're playing
this small like a grasshopper it's all
right yes I knew it
knee-high to a grasshopper referring to
a little kid like your aunt would say
back when you were knee-high to a
grasshopper you are not tall enough to
ride the rides at the carnival must be
this time yeah or me right now still not
tall enough
oh that's so cute I wish I had been born
in this house
Oh bless your heart bless your heart
poor stupid person but see that was nice
didn't that sound great you like Oh
bless me that was cool yeah you're like
oh I feel good but I think I just got
insulted
I just got reamed by a southern person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
