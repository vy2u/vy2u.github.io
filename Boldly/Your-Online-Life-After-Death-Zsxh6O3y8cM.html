right I mean bad news is you probably
can't decide how you're gonna die in
real life the good news is you can't
decide how you're gonna die or whether
you're a guy at all I'm lying catch you
a question hey Jamie could you share
with us the last Facebook post that you
had my brother wrote take 10 minutes to
watch my sister talk about pew I went to
a cheese club meeting where we dressed
up in cheese hats and everybody brought
all their favorite cheese's I recently
posted this photo of Lenny Kravitz
blowing out the crotch of his pants and
his his dong is hanging out so if you
were to die tomorrow do you feel happy
about these posts I guess if I died
tomorrow this would be my legacy
this cheese Club I don't know I mean is
this my legacy my legacy would be dick
pics look so how do you avoid the legacy
of dick pics well you need to do some
planning but luckily there are options
option one takes trust and reliable pals
so if you got both of those go out today
and share the passwords for your Twitter
Instagram Gmail Hotmail etc etc with the
person you love the most for Facebook
you don't need to share the password
just go into your settings and designate
someone to take over a buddy a lover a
jilted lover heck it's up to you option
two this takes more work but less trust
use online services to store your
passwords to unlock after your passing
or use an account like dead social where
you store messages and photos that will
be posted after death and intervals
surprising and haunting your loved ones
for years into the future
so once the appropriate preparations
have been made it's time to make some
real decisions first decide if you want
your Facebook to shut down or become a
memorial
Paige you could do absolutely nothing
but every year your friends would get
the reminder to birthday and they might
not like that lastly think about what
your final messages and photos will be
what's the lasting impression you want
to leave on the digital landscape store
this online or give it to the person in
charge of your account what do you want
your last message to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
