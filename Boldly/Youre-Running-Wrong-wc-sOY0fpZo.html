chances are you've got places to go
sometimes that means walking sometimes
that means driving and sometimes when
you're feeling particularly athletic
that means running running isn't just
great for your body it's good for your
mind too it's been proven to improve
your mood concentration and sleep
quality but if you aren't careful
running can do more harm than good
listen up so you don't cup and injure
yourself you may think running is all
about your legs but it all starts with
your head look forward to align your
neck and back
don't let your chin jut out make sure
your shoulders are relaxed in level keep
them low loose and in check throughout
your run don't get tense after all it's
just a gut em run let your arms
accessorize your run keep your elbows
bent and don't get too funky relax your
fingers and don't clench your fists when
it comes to your torso it's simple stand
up straight as your hips shouldn't
lie like your torso keep them square
guiding you straight ahead your legs are
important because duh you're running
your feet should land directly under
your body and your knees should
naturally Bend when your foot hits the
ground mind your feet and your ankles
land on the ball of your foot and roll
forward while flexing your angle for
maximum push off your feet should not be
making a lot of noise be silent and
deadly like a ninja now get off your ass
lace up your sneakers and get a move on
it tiger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
