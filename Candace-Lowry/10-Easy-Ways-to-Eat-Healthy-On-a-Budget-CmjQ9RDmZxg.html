hungry because you'll buy all the Oreos
hi everyone welcome back to my channel
today I'm going to be talking to you
about ten ways to eat healthy on a
budget so now you have no excuse not
having a lot of money is hard you know
when you look at people like Gwyneth
Paltrow and all of this they're like
well now is our oil and our bread and
Korea town behind dollars per article I
can't afford that I don't know what to
do and all these smoothies and health
places are also expensive but the good
way to get around that is by making your
own stuff and shopping smartly we try to
make money but for now rich I mean if
you are rich like way to go tell me your
secret this is eating healthy and good
thank you so so so much Skillshare for
sponsoring this video it's a really cool
program that you can sign up for for
like ten dollars a month you get over
15,000 classes you can try a project
take anything you want and go at your
own pace so you can actually just learn
on the go which is really nice you can
get actually a two month free trial by
clicking the link in the bio I would
definitely check out B DSLR editing and
camera workshops because you can really
learn a lot without having to invest in
these giant programs it's an app so you
always have it on your phone so you can
do it anywhere lounging beachside
sitting at the gym going on a run you
have no excuse to not learn people
alright number one if you don't eat it
freeze it I thought I was really clever
for any of that
I am so bad about food waste I just buy
things and then I
like do I really want this okra again
instead of just letting it sit in your
fridge freeze it for you to freeze and
breathe it because you've been like
basically double or triple or quadruple
the shelf life depending on what it is
especially when you buy them in season
it's really helpful because when you're
craving that pineapple or watermelon
I've never frozen a watermelon that's a
bad example but we are craving certain
fruits and vegetables and they're out of
season they tend to be more expensive
number two number two buy all of your
dry goods and like grains and quinoa and
rice I am in bulk because they're going
to be cheaper per ounce ultimately I
know that when I go to Costco I'm like
do I really want to pay $25 for a bag of
rice but this rice will literally last
you a year and you never have to go back
and buy those things alright this one
can be a little monotonous especially
for people like me who get bored very
easily but me prepping you guys meal
prepping is a great way to save money it
is hard when you make five things
chicken and rice they're like I have to
eat this every day for lunch but there
are ways with different spices and
things that you can jazz them up and I
think a lot of people when they think of
meal prep they're like it's just chicken
and rice there are so many creative
things that people do now for meal prep
where you can basically have something
fun and exciting every day with the same
ingredient it's already ready so you
don't really have an excuse to get lunch
or to run and buy something on the fly
okay the next one so I don't want to
sound like an idiot but have you looked
at price labels at your grocery store it
basically is this little label that
under the price it says price per ounce
and it basically blew my mind because I
thought I was buying things that were
cheaper than others just based off of
I stag alone but when you look at the
price per ounce of certain brands it's
so different and you can save a ton of
money just by looking at that I do still
save up those days for halo top or for
in mind which are like five dollars a
pint and I eat the whole pint in a night
so that's just like a five dollar
dessert
all right another thing is yes I get it
a lot of pre mazing a super easy buddy
save so much money just by making
yourself a prime example is you can get
premade rice to cauliflower but if you
get a cauliflower head and just chop it
up yourself you're already saving money
they really hiked up the prices on
basically just cutting your food for you
you can do it become that chef you can
be a master chef the next thing is look
I get that we love touting the brand I
get that we love honey bunches of oats
brand I get that we like Lucky Charms
but you know take those off brands get
the ice cream store brand a lot of the
times if you line up the two nutrition
labels they're basically the same
nutrition if you got a cottage cheese
that was program and the cottage cheese
it is like Lucerne I don't know and you
put them together they're the same thing
Caesar scraps save your scraps people
leave less of a carbon footprint what
you can do with scraps is just
unbelievable you know you can make soup
you can replant your scraps for more
scraps and for more vegetables which is
incredible you can really just make more
meals out of your food waste the next
thing is by hand and fervent foods if
you're really needing to cut down on
your budget now I know a lot of you are
like for Candace canned food has so much
sodium you're right it does but there
are a lot of low sodium options and no
sodium options and if you rinse things
thoroughly it's
okay frozen foods your mother great
saying if you're really bad with food
waste like me my freezer is like oozing
with rosin foods right now just because
I'm so bad with food waste and they're
in there and I know every night I can
just defrost it really quick put a
little olive oil and make a bit big big
big that you play so you always have
something in your freezer to eat when
you're like oh should I order out
tonight know your freezers like open me
take from me and I will give the next
thing that I will definitely say it does
shop hungry you know why because you're
just going to want everything every time
I shop hungry I'm like I'm gonna make me
this for dinner I'm gonna make that for
dinner and I end up getting like four
meals for dinner and I can't eat all
that and so definitely eat before you go
shopping it will stop impulse buying and
you'll feel a lot better and be able to
think and get everything done and you're
not going to be like Candice needs some
Oreos the final thing is just be smart
with your money by writing things down
and write out the essentials and budget
and set money aside for the week in
being okay
this week's groceries is going to be
sixty five dollars I might keep ten
dollars of fat for eating out whatever
I'm so bad about being scared to check
my checking account I'm like do I want
to do this but if you're budgeting and
you're writing out your grocery list and
you have this set thing of items you
need before going in you should just be
able to check those things off without
having to think and impulse buy and buy
all these random things that you really
don't need and thank you guys so much
for watching I really hope that these
points help you when you're trying to
budget but also eat really well and be
healthy and keep keep doing good guys
keep doing well I'm here just listen to
me while you're tired and don't want to
run anymore
and be like it's candy
you're doing so great and if you like

more of me I'm not that annoying I
promise I guess I'll see you next time
