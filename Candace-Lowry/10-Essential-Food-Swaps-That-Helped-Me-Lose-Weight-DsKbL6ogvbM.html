on my phone
something weird happen to my camera
which is not good I wanted to do a video
on the 10 food that helped me weight me
10 foods fault that helped me get
through my weight loss and get healthy a
lot of you guys have been asking for
more fitness and health tips so I
figured I'll give them to you so I might
as well just start with number 1 I
exchanged regular peanut butter for
powdered peanut butter and this is
awesome because I love peanut butter but
when I was in that mode of losing weight
and trying to get a little leaner
I really couldn't afford to have all
this peanut butter all the time because
although it might not be you know
technically unhealthy it's really high
in fat so and two tablespoons is only 50
calories compared to 200 calories in
this bad boy and you're also saving 14
grams of fat so I just throw this into
my smoothies and all of my oatmeal every
morning so I don't know I love it I've
got this at Costco this thing's giant
and I go through a lot of it everyday so
that's my first flop so let's get into 2
through 9 no sorry
let's get into 2 through 10 now get
ready to throw out that cereal because
you're changing it for oatmeal why you
save yourself added sugars fillers and
you add yourself some extra fiber and
you can just kind of mix it with a
little bit of stevia and cocoa powder
and you still get the same taste and it
helps you poop next rule of thumb
exchange all of your oatmeal bars for
something with less than 6 grams of
sugar per serving because you don't want
all of that extra sugar in you and you
really want to be able to chalk it full
of natural ingredients and nothing like
an added corn syrup or anything like
that ok I love brown rice like everyone
else but I have really gotten a love for
cauliflower rice that's right you're
going to save yourself a lot of calories
here maybe not a lot of fiber but you're
getting in a lot of added vegetables
throughout the day and you can make more
volume which I need cuz I am angry next
up I exchanged regular milk for almond
milk or coconut milk why you ask because
it saves me calories and I got oh well
you know what it's just savory calories
I feel like milk but this was great for
smoothies and you know I get a little
tummy ache with dairy and yeah next up
throw that juice out and exchange it for
a smoothie because you'll be getting all
of these natural sugars as well as the
fiber that comes with your food all
right this is a tough one I know but
you're going to change that yogurt for
regular boring old yogurt and add some
fruit instead of having these syrupy
sugary you know spreads on the side just
add your own fruit and you save yourself
a ton of sugar and calories and you're
getting natural ingredients as well as
the fiber with
berries and you guys know how I feel
about regular ice cream but we give that
halo top or enlightened I don't know
about Arctic zero but you know you know
my feelings here but you're getting
added fiber saving fat saving sugar and
you get a little more protein and you
get to eat a lot more of it you can
check out below my other video comparing
the two and you might surprise yourself
alright I know that this one sounds
weird but I actually have exchanged
flour for chickpeas when I'm baking
cookies or anything like that and it
really actually works and you're getting
some added protein and fiber and it's
not all just empty calories and I'll
post some recipes below to help you kind
of have a jumping-off point here but I
promise you it is so good alright and
this is my new obsession changing
avocado toast for sweet potato toast
it's the best thing ever you just slice
your sweet potato into toast like slices
spring it with a little bit of olive oil
and put it in the toaster for about two
rounds so you're getting all these added
vitamins fiber and vegetables for not
really you know knowing that you
exchanged it for bread alright everybody
I hope that these helped you and I still
live by a lot of these every day and
don't feel like you have to kind of be
doing this all the time and just
remember everything in moderation but
these things really helps me during that
weight loss time and you know it helps
me pack in a lot of vegetables because I
have a problem eating a lot of
vegetables ooh but hopefully these help
you save some calories and fat and some
added sugars and added fillers and
ingredients you know with the beast
walks it's also looking at how many
ingredients you're ingesting
and all of those fillers and everything
like that so let me know what you guys
think and I'd love to hear if you guys
have any favorite slobs in the comments
so um let me know you guys alright see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
