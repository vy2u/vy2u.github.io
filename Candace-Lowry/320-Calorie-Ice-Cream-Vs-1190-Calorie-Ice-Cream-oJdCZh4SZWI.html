channel today what we're going to be
doing is comparing the same type of ice
cream at two vastly different caloric
description we're going to be comparing
two of these same ice creams but of two
vastly different calorie value so what
we got here is halo top peanut butter
cup and haagen-dazs salted peanut butter
fudge before we get started
no this isn't sponsored I just wanted to
genuinely know what this is like
when I started out my diet weight off
during whatever I was really missing
some of my favorite foods in the more I
miss the food the more I craved them so
I tried to find little things that curb
those cravings in a healthy way and one
of those things is halo top because I
don't just eat a bite of ice cream I can
pack it down this is a segment that I
would like to call cheap or take a seat
which means is it just totally works
cheating or can you take a seat and grab
a nice little substitute that's a little
better for you so we're going to looking
at be a taste today the caloric value
the ingredients and what you're actually
eating so fast fiber sugar everything
like that I guess we can get started
with the taste today we have halo top
which is 320 calories for the entire
pint and then we have haagen-dazs salted
peanut budge which is clocking in at
almost 1200 calories for the entire pint
I know anybody saying you but you should
have self-control in hella bite well
that's not the way life works for me
sometimes okay already is looking at it
it's pretty different we have our
topping off which is packed full with
chocolate peanut
everything like that which is probably
adding to the calories like I don't
really mind and then being able top is
more of oh my god then he will chop it
more may like blandish kind of look to
it it doesn't really have much going on
in it but inside there is a peanut
buttery these we're all so this one our
low top looks like pretty nice we've got
a good peanut butter swirl going on this
is pretty good this honestly to me
tastes like ice cream it has it's more I
see if that makes sense so you can kind
of tell that it's not made like typical
icing which is heavy cream and a mixture
of milk and sugar but it does taste
pretty good like I do I can get into it
moving on let's get into the hot dogs
here it already has a beautiful mix of
chocolate and goodness and happiness
that's pretty solid you guys the problem
is I would eat this whole thing and then
get a horrific stomachache later and
hate everything take sex review
obviously talk about it a little bit
more flavor the consistency is smoother
creamier I get that
halo talk pretty good I will admit all
right so let's look the ingredients here
we have got 4 halo chopped milk and
cream eggs but we also got as the third
ingredients erythritol and that is a
sugar alcohol that your body can't
really digest it has the same taste in
flavor and sugar but you can't really
absorb it the problem here is that it
can cause a lot of people a big tummy
ache but doesn't bother me so let's talk
about the fiber for a second here all
right you guys for each serving of this
you have 12 percent of your daily amount
of fiber okay that's a good amount but
if you're going to eat this whole time
you have 48 percent of your daily amount
of fiber in here hence why this might
make you poop a little but hey that's
okay
it doesn't really have a ton of
chemicals added and I get it know what
people I'm sick of people being like any
handy chemical it is you're right that's
fine but there are certain chemicals
that you don't want going in your body
okay so to get that out of the way
if you're going to comment that it's
fine but you got to stop being like that
moving on to something like haagen-dazs
the first ingredient is cream skim milk
sugar and egg yolks all right
that's why you have a lot of fat in here
and that's why it tastes so good it's
not filled with artificial foods or
anything like that so it's all like
wholesome ingredients which you could
argue it's all natural so like that's my
one serving of this is 55% of
daily saturated fat so multiply that
times 3.5 and you've got well over your
daily amounts of saturated fat
there's also 0.5 grams of trans fat in
this these kind of facts are routine in
the hydrogenated oils they've been
linked to heart disease you really don't
want to be with this kind of stuff if
you want to eat ice cream you eat ice
cream just do it in moderation one
serving of this haagen-dazs ice cream
has the fat equivalent of two Snickers
if you were to eat this whole pint it
would have the equivalent of seven
Snickers one entire pint of this halo
top has the fat equivalent of half of a
Snickers bar looking at the sugar here
you have got about 24 grams of sugar per
serving in this haagen-dazs which he is
the equivalent of 6 teaspoons of sugar
that means 6 sugar cubes if you were to
eat this whole entire thing of
haagen-dazs you would have 24 sugar
cubes into your mouth and then espera
halo top for the entire pipe you're
ingesting 6 teaspoons of sugar so that's
6 sugar cubes for the entire pipe
however you're facing eating and
consuming sugar alcohol you know now
that I've just destroyed your hopes and
dreams I just wanted to talk about you
know these are the kind of things that I
started looking at and how you want to
treat your body and I am not in no way
saying you should never have this ice
cream for the love of God I just ate it
and it was so good I think it's fun to
like compare these types of things if
it's a cheat or take a seat definitely
take a seat out on this one it is insane
to see that this entire pipe is less
caloric than half a cup of this
haagen-dazs
I would love to hear what you guys want
me to compare and especially with taste
like these stuff can be next
I don't want to put any brands on blast
right elbow like Arctic zero um Susan
tastes like dirty water so it's not my
favorite I'm so sorry
I don't want to hear what you guys make
for ice cream or substitutes like that
because I live for a good cup of ice
cream with a little bit of chocolate
drizzle and be sure to give this video a
big thumbs up if it helped you out if
you liked it if you didn't okay fine you
can give me a thumbs down it's pretty
rude I'm not going to lie but you know
