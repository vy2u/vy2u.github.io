better call me a little barista candy
with what I'm making here hello hello my
basic bitches and bros today on a very
special episode of this calorie counting
the pumpkin spice latte goes way back
and what I mean dude somebody is like
knocking on my door okay that was weird
somebody keeps like tapping on my door
and nobody is there today on this very
special episode of counting calorie
comparison thingy I think I called it
like cheat or take a seat like three
episodes back but we are going to be
comparing the 380 calorie pumpkin spice
latte to my homemade version which I
really want to do and under five
ingredients I don't know if that's gonna
happen but so when the holidays roll
around I am so into these drinks and
holiday specials you know I'm more of a
peppermint mocha kind of girl but a
pumpkin spice latte really does butter
my egg roll so I am excited to try this
out because the main reason why I don't
really order pumpkin spice lattes is
because of the calories and sugar
content in them so this bad boy right
here has 380 calories with 2% milk with
whole milk it would have 420 calories
not the worst we've seen here but it's
still pretty bad because this has 50
grams of sugar in it the Grande pumpkin
spice latte has 14 grams of fat which is
22% of your daily amount
eight grams of saturated fat which is
40% of your daily allotted amount it is
a little disconcerting that it's $5 I
don't remember pumpkin spice lattes
costing $5 I mean so how much they are
really felt like airport pricing anyway
the pumpkin spice latte came into
existence you know a couple of years ago
and then they decided to put actual
pumpkin in it in 2015 so the ingredients
are milk and then pumpkin pie sauce
which they call it or pumpkin spice
sauce they call it that it's basically a
sugar condensed milk all of these
different flavorings that make it taste
pumpkin II and it has a little bit of
brewed espresso in it whipped cream
which is you know whipped cream so and
then a little pumpkin spice topping so
and it also has vanilla syrup in it so
that's where you're really getting that
added sugar as well I think this would
be so easy to make at home I think that
this would be simple natural you can
make a vegan friendly version even
though vegans aren't that happy with me
right now I think we should get going
right so I think I'm right about five
ingredients I've got unsweetened coconut
milk pumpkin puree pumpkin pie spice
you can do vanilla bean vanilla extract
whatever you choose if you want to be
fancy you do vanilla bean a little bit
of Truvia and some coffee also I feel
like I've let you all down we're at six
ingredients also also I've let you down
we're actually a nine ingredients if
we're technically gonna look inside the
pumpkin spice
I really let you down all right so I
combined everything together heated it
up it kind of looks a little bit like
baby diarrhea right now however I
promise you it'll taste good okay so I
think I might be on the right track here
because I just opened up my pumpkin
spice latte and it also looks like baby
poop there's also kind of can you see
this this like weird separation going on
at the top of oils or sugar
um damn it already got so dark this took
me like five minutes okay I'll hold on
let me turn on a light okay that's a
little better
Wow this is very odd okay so I have my
two drinks here Oh brand don't show
Heisenberg so I have my two drinks here
this is my homemade one and this is the
Starbucks one so one is definitely
lighter than the other this is a very
warm inviting snuggly would watch The
Bachelor in it is it almost 400 calories
worth I don't think so the only point
the only weird thing that's happening to
me is my lips feel like I just put
chapstick on there are other drinks to
me don't have that and I've only found
it with the pumpkin spice latte so I'll
put the recipe below in what I ended up
making from it but this is coconut milk
pumpkin pie spice a little bit of stevia
vanilla and coffee so this looks pretty
good very fragrant it smells like a
liquefied pumpkin pie honestly
hmm oh my god damn a dam I did it again
candy this one has less of a coffee
taste and more of a spicy pumpkin II
taste to it it's not nearly as sweet I
expected that but it tastes really good
it's thicker because there is pumpkin
puree in it unlock it
nope alright let's look at the caloric
information on this wait you guys I'm
dying right now I want you to guess
okay well it's in the video title but
it's only 60 60 calories in this the
calories from come from the unsweetened
coconut milk and a pumpkin and then
coffee doesn't have anything really in
it and then the pumpkin spice is just
spices 50 grams of sugar 2 grams of
sugar 50 - 50 - Oh Magda Jota this has 3
grams of fat and this has 14 so you're
really really saving a lot of calories
here you can make the pumpkin pie
Frappuccino with a little bit of the
pumpkin pie a low chop some coconut milk
some coffee and then a little bit of the
pumpkin spice I don't really think you
need it I'm gonna go try and make that
alright this is not sponsored again this
is not sponsored I'm just really excited
to eat this halo top so I'm gonna use
half a cup of the pumpkin pie halo chop
half a cup of coconut milk half a cup of
coffee and then maybe a little sweetener
and some ice I don't think I need the
sweetener but we'll see it's definitely
I did this wrong I think I put too much
liquid compared to the sock with in it
so I instead of doing half a cup and
half a cup I would do 1/4 of a cup
coffee for the cup coconut milk and then
half of a cup of halo top or whatever
pumpkin spice ice cream you have Oh
dusty is pretty good though ok maybe I
haven't perfected the Frappuccino yet
but let's just you know I think I think
I'm onto something but let's just get
back to the regular PSL all right I'm
back oh my gosh we really have gone on a
trip today you guys if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up like
let me know subscribe for more like this
if you guys want me to find something
else to compare or something else to
make myself let me know I'm trying to
work on some pancakes some other things
well thanks for watching if your not
basic just love some pumpkin or if you
just love seeing my face thank you for
coming by please check out my videos
below
um I would say strain it if you can if
you can't just add a little less pumpkin
puree and as a reminder I'll put the
recipe below alright guys
love you so much ok that's not a Native
American
let's not alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
