get started let me just make one thing
clear a lot of people were saying in my
colleague video that I didn't know how
to say tortilla you guys
I was joking I do not say Tortola on the
Reg okay so now we can get it to the
video hello everybody
you welcome back sorry it's a little
dark in here
the Sun currently now goes down at 455
and I shoot these videos after work so
it's a little dark but I feel like it's
very nice and cozy because I will be
making a peppermint mocha and I'm very
excited because this is my favorite
drink at Starbucks and I'm very happy to
can defy it I got my cozy sweater on got
my tree up if you can see Patrick is the
star on our tree every year and I tried
to put a fireplace on but it kind of
just looks like my head is on fire and
I'm like the devil being like welcome to
hell the best part of the year is
Christmas and the holidays because
everybody is equally stressed out and
excited I think it'll be super super
easy but I really hope that I can get
that iconic taste to me a peppermint
mocha is almost like a warm melty york
peppermint pattie mmm it's just so
creamy and Coco e and good and I don't
know I love it so a classic peppermint
mocha with 2% milk
that is a grande has 440 calories so my
goal is to get it at least below 120
calories and it's 50% of your daily
amount of saturated fat which is like
whoa but there's 54 grams 54 grams of
sugar
in this so I really want to be able to
really put that down at least below five
grams hopefully the ingredients are milk
espresso peppermint syrup mocha sauce
and whipped cream so you're getting that
fat and sugar really from that
peppermint syrup and the mocha sauce I
can whip this into shape I really think
that uh we can fix it up so come along
these are the ingredients that I'm gonna
be using I'm going to do some
unsweetened coconut milk you know I love
that some espresso powder you can use
coffee if you want but I'm gonna use
espresso powder cocoa powder I go for
the special dark kind peppermint extract
and if you feel more comfortable using a
regular sugar versus a artificial sugar
or stevia you know feel free to use just
a little bit of syrup or agave if you
feel that that's necessary oh man it's
looking it's looking pretty chocolaty
it's smelling the smell of peppermint
it's just it's just delicious here are
the two peppermint mochas this is the
Starbucks one this is mine I made mine
again with a darker chocolate they're
both Brown just like on the pumpkin
spice latte there is this ring or little
film of oil another important thing
about peppermint mochas is the smell so
this one already smells a little sweeter
it's it's not as minty fresh I'm ready
taste these I really I really hope it
works
welcome back to my humble home I'm gonna
try it one more time just to kind of
cleanse my palate mmm yes
sugar I'm scared I'll burn my tongue I
don't want to burn my tongue I'm rubbing
mm-hmm
this is really good this is like the
dark sultry cousin of the peppermint
mocha it has this really vibrant just
relaxing peppermint smell to it I think
it's pretty pretty good it's not nearly
a sweet I'm going to warn you there's
definitely more of a coffee flavor
profile with it I think that this was a
dupe can you do pit yes we can
I'm gonna toot my own horn again be me I
also have like a my mouth also feels
like I just brushed my teeth so I just
calculated all of the nutrients and
calories of this and it is take a guess
wait I'll give you a second it's
actually in the title it is 75 calories
that is incredible if you're using
something like stevia or Truvia it has
less than one gram of sugar total if you
use something like maple syrup and you
use a tablespoon it's probably gonna be
around 10 grams of sugar but we'll just
forget about that 7 grams of fat and a
lot of calcium just like the typical
peppermint mocha but 75 calories
compared to 440 calories that's an
incredible difference always choose
sukhino peppermint mocha who cares
whatever you know you can enjoy it just
you know do it in moderation I'm gonna
post the recipe below and I want to hear
if you guys make it if you have a
favorite hot chocolate or peppermint
mocha recipe let me know because I am
always on the lookout for recipes and
