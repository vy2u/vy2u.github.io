want them all the time but then I know
that it's just going to turn the
bubbling fad my slow metabolism and then
I'm going to have to exercise so much
the next week howdy hey everyone welcome
back to my channel and today we're going
to get Starbucks or really mad at me
probably and ruin all my brand deal with
them so today we are going to be
comparing a regular service cappuccino
to a lower calorie version actually one
that I kind of just pulled out of my
butt and invented and I think it
actually worked
I love two cappuccinos I lived for
frappuccinos I was personally a
strawberries and cream gal but you know
they pack a lot of sugar and and you see
all of these new ones popping up like
unicorn and s'mores and dragon there's
probably going to be like a poop emoji
one coming up soon they keep getting
like higher and higher in sugar and it's
like where is all of this added sugar
coming from and ideally for someone like
me you're supposed to have 67 grams of
sugar total a day and one grande
Frappuccino will typically caulk in
around 61 to 66 grams and then when
you're getting into something like the
really decadent
sweet ones that can be upwards of 80
grams of sugar now I'm not saying that
you can't ever have these again that you
should never drink one all I'm saying is
that these are great for moderation and
if you're craving one you can probably
make one for a lot less calories and a
lot less added sugar on your own first
of all we're going to be putting up the
grande mocha frappuccino from Starbucks
I'll begin the candy homemade
Frappuccino I tried to think of a cool
name reverse Chino but
I got candy Gino where do the candy
Chino versus the Frappuccino the candy
Chino is made of almond milk ice coffee
cocoa powder stevia a little bit of
enlightened hot cocoa ice creams and
half a banana so it's really that not
that many calories and I really hope it
tastes good I mean that's what I would
think a mocha would be made out of but
this name clocks in at under 100
calories and 9 grams of sugar let's look
at the mocha frappuccino a grande mocha
frappuccino has 410 calories 66 grams of
sugar and it's 45% of your daily
saturated fat 23 percent of your total
fat so you know that's a lot taken and
there's just so much added sugar in it I
don't know where it comes from
I'm guessing it's the syrup this is herb
I let's not be totally white here
Candace I used to slay all the men with
my cute little uniform skirt from school
sipping on my Frappuccino and then I got
in my 20s engaged 30 pounds I'm going to
be testing them out today and see if I
actually might have correct the code
here let's start with the Frappuccino so
you know it's pretty hefty I don't know
why this has to do with a taste test but
Oh ahaha Yo Gabba Gabba
this is very sweet very good I can taste
the coffee notes I can taste the
chocolate but there's really a distinct
syrupy taste to it
so I can tell that there is a lot of
sugar this brings me back to my
childhood where I was dumped in the
school parking lot in high school and it
lived off of these for like three weeks
crying every day anyway these um fixing
us um is it my whole day's worth of
sugar mmm I don't know so let's move on
to what I took what I conjured up in my
kitchen I honestly I'm actually very
proud of myself for what I did
I used a base recipe which I'll put down
below and then I kind of adapted to it
adding a little bit of the enlightened
ice cream which gave it a creamier look
to it more like a Frappuccino and not
just coffee and ice this is what they
look like together not bad let's try out
the candy Chino maybe I should trade
mark Desmond fellows for overpriced also
let's talk about the price okay so this
one of these bad boys is almost 5 bucks
which is more than my allotted lunch
money a day and this would probably
clock in a lot cheaper because I just
threw it together in my kitchen out of
things that I already had
okay.we I'm I'm very proud of myself
right now this tastes really good with a
little tartar like dark chocolate you
know just a little dark and mysterious 9
grams of sugar 66 grams of sugar 9 grams
of sugar 66 grams of sugar almost 50% of
your daily saturated fat not even near
that amount you should try this I want
you to try this at home because I want
to know if I'm just full of myself or if
I actually made a good copycat skinny
product I guess the main takeaway here
is that I just want you guys to know
that you don't have to give up things
you love if you want to get into a
healthier lifestyle if you look at these
two things they almost taste exactly the
same and one has 1/3 1/4 of amount of
calories and 1/6 know barely any sugar
and it's all natural sugar now I know I
don't really like using artificial
sweeteners because I know that there are
some studies that it tricks your body
into thinking you're consuming sugar
which can actually have you crave it
more but I kind of made the exception
with stevia and if this isn't a daily
thing it's totally a great substitution
let me know what you guys want me to
compare next and make some dupes for
proud candy day for me I think it's a
dupe I think it's a skinny do please you
