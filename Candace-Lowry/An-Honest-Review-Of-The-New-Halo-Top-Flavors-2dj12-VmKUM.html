excited because my basic bitch self just
got all the new halo tops and we're
going to try them out because everyone
knows that I'll all pay low top I know
you guys love halo top this is literally
that I'm just so excited to try these
flavors I really want to get into it
have an honest review of these flavors
because like I'm pretty picky about my
ice cream and it's got to taste good if
I'm going for the whole pint it's got to
taste good
they're actually very great for making
pho milkshakes and frappuccinos and just
making entire um you know ice cream
cakes out of a plank yeah I don't know
if that's if there's too much to say by
the way yes I am trying ice cream in my
pajamas so oh that's the way you got to
do it right I guess I'll rank them from
best to worst so let's get into it
because I know that you guys just want
to know what these taste like before
investing four dollars a pint so the
first thing about halo tops which I'm
really bad about is that you're supposed
to wait like ten minutes before eating
it so it gets a little soft and squishy
but I'm really bad at that because when
I want my ice cream I want it now
alright let's get into the first flavor
cinnamon roll so it looks pretty good
look at that spoon shot you know you can
see little chunks of dough in it
this one's really good it's like if you
were to freeze the milk after having
cinnamon toast crunch and then work at a
Cinnabon and accidentally drop some of
the dough into that milk no sediment a
little overpowering but I really like
that it's very holiday it reminds me of
waking up in the morning to those diet
cinnamon rolls that my mom made me I can
see how 360 calories but if you like
chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream or
you like having those chunks of dough
Depp recommend alright so we're going to
move on to the candy bar which I feel
like is a very vague flavor because
there are so many different kinds of
candy bars like is this going to be
three musketeers territory or is it
going to be twigs or like kick camp
what's this going to be so one thing
that's interesting is that there's no
snappy catchphrase or there's no snappy
description when these flavors come out
so it's just like candy bar alright
there's the spoon shot yeah looks looks
very chocolatey looks like kind of like
rocky road
you know let's try it oh oh oh my god
there's no way there's no way that this
is only throw 260 calories hmm okay if
you have ever had the frozen Snickers
ice cream bar this tastes exactly like
it I don't know how they're doing it I
don't know if they've joined the
Illuminati you have they sold their
souls what's going on here this tastes
exactly like a frozen Snickers bar that
you just threw in the blender and then
put into an ice cream pipe damn
way to go halo top on this one so the
next flavor is mochi green tea I'm a
huge green tea fan huge matcha green tea
and my dad always makes fun of me
because he says that green tea ice cream
is basically chocolate ice cream dyed
green so this hopefully has little
chunks of mochi in it something tells me
there's going to be a little squishy
surprise spoon shot there we go very
green very cute I do like how there's no
artificial colors in this so let's try
it
whoa whoa this is very floral almost
it has a very perfume iya taste if you
have ever had those frozen green tea
mochi ice cream balls at the grocery
store it's that's exactly what it tastes
like
and there are little squishy pieces of
mochi in it which is very cute very fun
surprise but this is a very strong green
tea flavor a very like perfumey Jasmine
green tea flavor going on so it's
definitely not what you see in like
typical green tea ice cream I really
like it but it's not very sweet if that
makes sense this would actually this
would be great to make a green tea boba
that you can make it home for lower
calories moving on are you bored of me
yet the next flavor is very fun very
Pinterest I feel like it it will do very
well on Instagram it's also one of the
lower calories it's the rainbow swirl
what spoon shot here very colorful
you see a lot of girls taking pictures
of this on the Instagram like or like
there are different flavors for each
color together they're pretty good this
reminds me of when a crane pooped on me
at the zoo and I was eating those
rainbow dippin dots that's exactly what
it tastes like I like it I mean it's not
the best one but if I want to go ham on
an ice-cream pint without you know the
guilt all right so the next flavor is
pancakes and waffles
pancake collective pattern I wonder if
this would be cute to top your actual
pancakes and waffles with so it's like a
pancake section you're the spoon shot
here you can see little specks of I
guess pancakes and waffles in it which
one is the pancake which one was the
waffle we'll never know it does have a
really strong maple smell to it a lemon
to it I really like it it's like I'm
drunk in an IHOP it does have a syrup
flavor but it's more of I like regular
maple flavor to it
that's really the first thing that hits
you over like a batter but mmm I like
this one next flavor almost there
second-to-last flavor we have chocolate
covered banana I'm a little worried
about this one because a lot of the
times when people try to make banana
flavored things it have this really
artificial banana II taste to it it has
that smell so here's the scoop it just
kind of looks like chocolate and banana
has nothing too crazy up mm-hmm
fake banana fake banana damn it the
chocolate good but the banana just
overpowers the whole thing and tastes
like I were to chew on a bunch of yellow
Laffy Taffy's spit them in here and
blend it with vanilla ice cream I think
that it just said that's not my favorite
thing in the world it's not for me
all right to round it up we've got the
caramel macchiato which I feel like
already would be great for making
frappuccinos I feel like this will just
be a creamier version of coffee oh there
are caramel swirls in this though spoon
shot hoaxford caramel it looks very
coffee II I don't know if this will be
crazy but looks like it'll be good
whoo this is good it does have a little
bit of a iced coffee flavor not too much
it's more on the caramel side but this
is a really good because there are these
milky ribbons of caramel in there I
could see myself having this you know
watching The Bachelor having a good time
let's rate these bad boys in seventh
place we have the chocolate-covered
banana
sorry it's a dog-eat-dog world and I was
just not feeling the artificial banana
Flav in sixth place
we have caramel macchiato not that I
didn't like it I really liked it it's
just nothing too crazy to write home
about number five goes to the mochi
green tea appoints for creativity and
points for trying out a new flavor
fourth place goes to the rainbow swirl
really enjoyable really liked it
negative points for bringing up the
memory of when I got pooped on at the
zoo all right in the third place in
third place we've got pancakes and
waffles love it nothing too much to
complain about
maybe I wish that there were more
battery pieces in it
but I'm just trying to find a way to get
these top three into their right
positions okay number two in second
place barber is cinnamon roll because it
makes me live out my fat kid dreams and
number one people bah buh buh buh buh
buh buh buh buh bah buh buh buh buh buh
bah
number one goes to candy bar because
it's really good and I still have no
idea how they got all those flavors in
for 360 calories it's really good and
it's the closest thing to chasing like
real fatty fatty ice cream
