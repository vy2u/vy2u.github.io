morning welcome back to my channel I
feel like now it's become a tradition
that I just wear my pajamas in every
video that I do okay that bus needs its
brakes checked so today we're going to
do cheap versus custom eyelashes I'm
going to try to put on you know regular
I guess like CBS eyelash extensions and
wear them tell you how they feel
compared to getting eyelash extensions
and I think that a lot of people
sometimes wonder if it's worth the money
because eyelash extensions can be really
expensive they also take a lot of time
but you don't have to do anything to
your eyelashes hi
it was blessed with you know not know be
eyelashes and if I do say so myself I'm
gonna show you the differences the pros
and cons and we're gonna actually go to
an eyelash extension appointment which
should be fun I'm actually very nervous
to show you guys these eyelashes I got
because they're not like huda beauty or
something fancy I just bought I'm not
I'm not a beauty guru
I just thought lashes this packaging
kind of looks like it's from the 90s but
I bought these eyelashes that come with
eyelash glue you just kind of put them
on in all of the scenarios that were
doing
I have bare lashes so this is right now
this is no makeup on my eyes I have some
cheek makeup on but we're gonna go ahead
and put these on ooh I did not blend
I'm sorry I like love curling my lashes
and I'm gonna do when I see a lot of
people on Instagram do and apply them
with my tweezers can't well that's it
eyelash videos cancelled I can't get the
glue open all right I feel like I have
to be like an octopus to do this you
have to have so many hands you guys
probably have no faith in me right now
but in the lash glue on the lash oh
I dropped the glue all over my phone
okay here we go oh gotta let it do this
I see people do this a lot but the glue
dry a little bit but okay I got one on
um definitely gonna be like to work /
three ovens they dip all right so here's
what I did I have this leftover glue
from the nicer eyelash extensions
I hate motorcycles and after struggling
almost crying questioning my existence I
got them on and I think they look pretty
good
the main problem about putting on these
extensions is that like you have to
really know how to do it you've got to
wait for the glue to dry you know you
might get your eyelid stuck together and
you kind of have to like press on them
all day but they feel pretty good and
they're pretty relatively quick fix but
I'm gonna go throughout the day see how
they feel put a little liner on I guess
to kind of blend out that eyelash line
on there but
that took a while uh I want to take this
off out oh that's a great unibrow though
I took off my lashes and I'm about to go
to my little boutique which is a place
near me and get some silk lashes you can
get silk or mink and I think of getting
a full set of silk and this process
usually takes like an hour an hour and a
half so I might get a nap in that'll be
nice
here's a little peek of my lashes now I
got a little remnant of eyeliner on
there but you can see what they look
like but my lashes on this water bottle
on my way home so my little beauty so I
got my lashes done as you can see the
procedure took about an hour an hour and
a half I honestly though they put me
under the snuggly warm blanket with like
a little leg pillow thing and I was like
I'm not gonna fall asleep I'm gonna be
fine and I drifted off and like woke up
and I was like what is happening and you
can't open your eyes when they're doing
it so I was just kind of like the reason
why I waited until I got home tonight to
talk to you guys was because um my eyes
were really red because I fell asleep
and so you'd probably be like what is
wrong with your face
I couldn't wash them tonight so I had to
put on a face mask and kind of just
scrub around my eyes okay I just washed
my lashes um they could have come
together so I'm just kind of gonna brush
them out oh they feel so clean it's
funny that you have to kind of like wash
them and treat them almost like
little pet I think they're looking
pretty good this is without any eye
makeup on I think I'm really honestly I
think I'm giving Sponge Bob a run for
his money all right welcome back it's me
I just want to do a breakdown of the
differences with the price range and the
pros and cons of things and I really
like this new little brush that I can
brush my lashes with and it makes me
feel really cute I understand now why
instafamous people look so good without
makeup on is because they have these
false lashes and they're just like no
makeup and a mic girl you got those
lashes on and you're looking good and
that's why if you want to use faux strip
lashes the hardest part is getting them
on and having them stick it's like
halfway throughout the day sometimes it
just feels like so heavy and you just
you need like a push-up bra for your
lashes basically when I was sweating I
was like are these gonna melt off and am
I gonna look like that one girl on the
meme when she's crying I could just wash
my face and be done with it
and you know they can range anywhere
from $5 to $25 and I would recommend
getting the higher res lashes with the
strip lashes you can have more fun on
your occasions but also there's full
lashes all over my room and they look
like scary caterpillars but let's move
on to the custom lashes it is very
important to look up the place that
you're going read the reviews and take
those reviews seriously especially if
there's pictures they can do a really
shoddy job with your eye lashes it can
cause them to pull fall out you can have
no allergic reaction to the glue and
it's not worth taking the cheaper route
if you're gonna get these lashes they
should be anywhere from a hundred to
like 175 and I know you're like oh my
god
so on your money it is but in the long
run they last for about three weeks you
can do touch-ups they just automatically
kind of naturally grow out and you
really don't have to worry about your
eyelashes every day I would say
definitely in cheap versus custom I
would go for the custom lash I mean
it's so nice don't touch them or getting
anything oily on there cuz it will kind
of break down and dissolve the glue like
last night I was on the edge of the
pillow sleeping being so afraid that I
would mess up my shoes but I really am
into it but also love yourself you don't
need lashes well I think from an
evolutionary standpoint you might need
lashes but we don't need to get into
that yeah if you guys like this video

even know if that even works like does
