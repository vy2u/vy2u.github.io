see this right now this is not good so
we're going to try to fix it hello
friends hi today as you can see I am
tired and my hair is fluffy right now
but that's because I'm going to be
trying out this like customizable hair
shampoo um called function of beauty
and I've never used it before but you
guys I have real fluffy hair I see the
resemblance to Simba I mean Mufasa it's
real thick it's color treated and I just
want something that will make it soft
and will kind something from the Pantene
commercial so I tried this out it's
called function of beauty and lookup
special so function of canvass all of it
anyone can do it you can put any name on
there I'm not special okay so what you
do online is basically oh my god it's so
pretty
look at how special this makes me feel
so special so what you do online is
basically putting your hair profile and
you can choose from like straight wavy
or curly hair and then you do like a
texture here like cords fine whatever
and then if you have normal dry or oily
scalp and then you put in your goals so
my hair goals were to get like
nourishment to fix wouldn't I have like
a bleached hair so anything that would
make it real soft and stuff all in
touchable and not feel like you know
you're touching straw and then you can
choose your fragrance but the thing
about this is that it's like be natural
I like feel way I don't feel cool enough
for this stuff honestly but oh it's
pretty cool and it tells you like what
to do in the description of
your shampoo and conditioner and so from
that they make this like customized
shampoo and conditioner and then you can
choose the color which I was like a real
excited about and I chose this like
galaxy purple which is like real nice to
watch very relaxing and then the
conditioner is purple and then if you
like can't choose between colors you can
have like one page in one blue one green
whatever they like make you feel very
special because you can put your name on
it and you can be like oh yeah I got a
customized shampoo this smell mmm it
smells so good it smells like I work at
lush full time I feel be natural with
this right now so one of the things that
comes with being an adult is taking care
of yourself in your body and growing up
and graduating from like dollar shampoos
so I try I try to uh you know see if
this works because this seems very
grown-up like the packaging is very
grown-up it's very much like I shop in
anthropology and I am a very big budget
and I'm a very successful beauty guru
and makeup person which I am leader of
so we're going to try this out and even
work and if it's worth the money it's
you moments later okay no offense to my
Garnier no tea no shade to Garnier this
was pretty professional
this looks pretty adult for me I'm into
it
20 minutes later I threw in a CBN
shampoo and these look a lot more
instrumental going to like I feel a
little more comfortable having people
take showers in my shower now two
thousand years later okay so I just got
out of the shower
um and I will say it was so nice wait
like things bogging up
it was nice it felt like a spa I didn't
feel like this first wealth problem that
I usually feel um it smells so good you
guys
it smells great
the the condition is really interesting
because it's more like a lotion it deals
with a lotion so it's not very it's not
think it's pretty thin but I do have to
use that much in a detangled really well
a lot of the times with natural products
the shampoo can kind of not foam up and
feel really kind of heavy and very
clarifying but I didn't feel that way it
was very like saucy and nice and when
you look like Ferris Bueller it was
wonderful um no I'm going to see how my
hair dries it detangled really well and
I have a problem with that
so I don't know so far so good function
as candid is so far so good I was
brushing it and it feels really good
it's actually drying pretty quickly
don't know how that happened but I'm
going to dry it and show y'all if it
kind of does what it says it's going to
do which is keeping the frames down
keeping it straight it's already drying
a lot greater than it usually does
rather than being like so let's see
let's see
just don't be alarmed when you see my
hair ready guys are you ready for it
woah all right so it dried my hair and
it gets like this every time I try it
it's oh my god it's huge you guys it's
giant
but look okay you're all like and just
what happened to you oh my god this
isn't working for you it actually dried
it very straight and it doesn't feel
crunchy Oh God
it definitely didn't put down the volume
part of it I kind of look like I'm in an
80s rock band this this is this is me
this is my real I you know what I'm
gonna straighten it a little bit put
them my product in it
I don't like use a lot of products I
just kind of like a heat protection but
look you guys are probably freaking out
by how weird this looks but I'm actually
pretty impressed that it's so straight
it's usually very wavy so it's like not
curly it's not pretty but it's not
straight
so there's actually kind of made it
straight it didn't make it lay down
that's for sure but I see the
resemblance to Simba alright so here's
my final look I just straighten it a
little bit it feels really good it feels
really healthy it's still smells really
good on the fragrance is great another
thing I should point out is people with
like friggin allergies or anything they
don't like on a fragrance you can choose
your level of strength of fragrance
which I thought was really interesting
let's compare to my I guess like
everyday
shampoo conditioner it's about eight
dollars a bottle so eight dollars for
shampoo eight dollars for conditioner
but if you get these bad boys these are
both 16 ounces and for two of these will
get you about 42 dollars so they're it's
not cheap but I mean it is your hair and
all of the ingredients are spelled out
and each ingredient has an explanation
for why it's in there which I really
liked
part of becoming an adult is like
starting to take care of yourself so if
this means that my hair is going to stay
healthy I mean I would say
it is really important but for me I
don't have to wash my hair every day so
I'm not going to be blazing through 40
bucks worth of shampoo and conditioner
like non-stop it is a little expensive
and I can totally understand that but it
feels good and it didn't make me feel
like I needed to put all this extra
product in the smell was nice I didn't
have to use a ton of product and it made
my hair feel pretty good
as for the frizz control it didn't
really help that much I don't know if my
hair is just lost cause but it is really
damaged from being bleached and it does
feel a lot better I used it for about
two weeks now because I wanted to get
like its full effect and it doesn't feel
crispy and crunchy which is what I felt
with my other color shampoo and
conditioner I mean it makes my hair look
pretty good
I can't I like it if you guys liked this
video let me know if you have any
questions about it let me know that as
well I think I covered everything but
just in case they didn't let me know
alright you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
