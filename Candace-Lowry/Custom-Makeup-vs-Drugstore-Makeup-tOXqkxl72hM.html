beauty I'm like um here's my wall chill
concealer hello everyone welcome back so
I noticed that you guys really liked my
custom shampoo versus cheap shampoo so I
decided to do custom makeup vs. cheap
makeup I think there comes a time when
we all become adult or even even a
little more mature that we realize we
need to invest in really good makeup
every time I go into a store like CVS or
Sephora I'm like am i cool am i warm
what is my tone Who am I what if I get
tannin summer I try this G Ella or
geology gala Jill I so I tried G Ella
custom makeup and you basically can
design all of your own makeup based off
of your unique skin tone and your skin
type if you're dry if you're oily water
however what have what have you so I
actually got to Skype with the Creator
in who's in New York and I'm in LA and
she basically got my entire face profile
just by looking at me on skype and I was
like is this a joke when she was
interviewing me and she asked do you
want glow or matte
do you want something in between are you
only are you dry and after answering all
those questions I was like wow I really
don't I haven't been doing my make
correctly she said your cooler color she
actually said that there needs to be a
pH balance in your face wash and in your
cosmetics that you buy and one of my
main problems was that I asked about
getting a bold lip because I feel like I
can't find the right lip color for my
skin tone and she was like oh that's so
easy let me just do that just like this
five minute Skype session she basically
got my entire profile I have a
foundation I have a concealer I have a
blush and I have a lip and they all sent
it to me and so I've got in the mail
today and I also before this did a look
with the typical makeup I use and we can
kind of compare and see if it's worth
the money if it's not so let's see what
happen I got a day and night anti-aging
treatment not that I'm old but I just
feel like at a certain age in your 20s
you really need to start taking care of
your skin has glycolic acid and I have
really sensitive skin so she was able to
tell me even down to the percentage what
I should be putting on my skin to not
kind of make it break out I got this
foundation I asked for a matte finish on
my foundation because I get a little
oily in my t-zone but it's really weird
because I get dry around my chin and so
she was able to blend this by hand to
match my skin profile I asked her a bold
lip that she thought would work Oh
oh my gosh this is beautiful it looks
like this if you can see it it's
actually very pretty
I got a concealer looks pretty nice oh
it's very creamy I really like that
I got a cream blush and this is in spicy
mauve
there's no gloss to it so that's what
that looks like as well I love these
kind of darker undertones to them I'm
really excited to try this all out and
they came into a little packages I'm
going to put on a makeup look and then
we can compare to my typical makeup look
and see see what we think here just
remember that I am NOT a professional
makeup artist so please don't get mad at
me if I do something and put it on here
I feel like a baby book
though so so far I really like how
there's not a lot of smell to it it
feels pretty good and that was that was
one pump and see how that goes I think
mugs he's getting into something I mean
she pretty much matched my skin tone I'm
telling you you guys she was looking at
me on skype so so far really I'm really
digging the foundation oh there goes
money I'm gonna go ahead and put the
concealer on and just I've under-eye
circles that was one of my concerns is
that I really have a hard time I don't
know why I guess at a certain age you
just become tired all the time
I'm just gonna get this one pimple I
have because my period this looks pretty
good
so spicy mauve I'm just going to put a
little bit on my cheeks here and we'll
blend
I asked more for a kind of just subtle
like oh I'm awake but I'm really digging
it I'm going to put a little bit on my
eyes for eyeshadow as well I really like
the idea of blush or bronzer having
multi uses so I just put on a little bit
of my typical eyeliner it's been a
couple minutes and I really I'm like
shocked as to how well this matches my
face I do wish that the concealer was a
little more matte but the foundation is
great all I have on is the foundation
and a little bit of finishing powder so
it is very good coverage I would
definitely say I don't nobody L but I am
so bad at applying lipstick it has that
like older crayon smell to it but I
think it's just because it's so natural
I really like matte lipstick but I feel
like my lips are like butthole lip as
the fiestas by the end of the day and so
I asked for a matte
stick and this actually it looks very
mad right now but it feels like a cream
which is very nice oh my god I feel so
pretty it is a little expensive but if
that means that I can love me but if
that means that I can finally be
comfortable with my shade and have a
perfect shade of foundation like I'm
going to definitely do it alright guys
so I put on my typical like drugstore
makeup look which I really don't think
it's that much different on the big
differences I can tell is that my
foundation a little bit lighter and my
blush and lip are very much Pinker than
this kind of deep plum look so I think I
might have gotten my skintone wrong but
I also really like this lipstick but so
you can see that on the left is the
custom makeup and on the right is the
drugstore makeup and I think it's a
pretty close dupe I would say but let's
go ahead and go care the main big thing
is that I have all this drugstore makeup
for less than one of those yellow
products however it's custom it's
organic you can pronounce all of the
ingredients so the big thing we're doing
with here is cost I feel like and you
also can't really see the product until
it arrives in mail if you're not from
New York or go to visit New York so the
pros obviously it's custom ok I feel
like when you get custom make up like
this you're also paying for the learning
experience and learning about what your
specific skin type is I also like that
these products are natural so I feel
like you know natural products tend to
be more expensive
I guess it's just the way life works you
know to be healthy you got to pay more
money the cons I would definitely say
are that it didn't last all day I mean
it doesn't promise that but you know I
know that the price can really hurt a
bunch of people you know I'll show you
right here the differences you know the
foundation is almost $50 and a lot of
people can't really afford that I think
it's worth trying at least once because
then you can kind of get a grasp of what
makeup you should be looking for in the
future all right now that I have removed
on my makeup and giving you a fresh face
in my own natural state that sounds like
I'm naked I would recommend definitely
checking out the foundation because it
really helped me get a grasp on what
kind of complexion I have my color tones
if I want a matte or dewy finish and the
overall color that I need I also really
want to know what you guys would love
for me to try out for custom versus
cheap next time I'm really glad that you
