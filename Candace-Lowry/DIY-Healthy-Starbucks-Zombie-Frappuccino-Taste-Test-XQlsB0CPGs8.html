it is zombie Frappuccino J mm-hmm it's
zombie Frappuccino day and you know what
that means
every little basic bitch including me is
gonna go to Starbucks and ask the
barista for a zombie frappe
I want to taste it I want to get to know
it I want to feel it in my mouth and
then I'm gonna make a healthy version of
it because that's what I do
this zombie Frappuccino has I think like
54 grams of sugar I really want to cut
that in half at least and try to make a
healthier version a skin F I'd version
it's supposed to taste a little Apple II
a little tardy a little zombie II it is
this green drink with like a blood rim
and then some pink whipped cream that
represents brains because you know
zombies love those so I'm gonna find one
drink it and try to copy it in a good
way so we'll see how this goes I know
Michelle's trying it so you should check
out her channel too you know she loves
trying those fraps but all right let's
get to Starbucks
here it is zombie Frappuccino looks kind
of like the dragon Frappuccino actually
okay let's taste this
it's very sweet
it tastes like if you melted down one of
those caramel apple suckers that you
used to get at Halloween it tastes
exactly like that the whipped cream
doesn't really taste like anything
different I think it's just colored
and then it's a mocha syrup
I bet I can make this alright I just
went shopping I asked some people on the
gram what they think I should use for
ingredients and I think I'm gonna try
some spinach and Apple first to make
that green and then maybe get some honey
and put a little bit of berry is on
there we'll see how that goes
I gotta say my tummy's been a little a
little grumbly since then drink that but
I think it might have been the sugar I
don't know alright I really hope that
this homemade one works we're gonna see
alright so here's what we got for my
green smoothie part I'm going to use
baby spinach unsweetened coconut milk
half of an apple and then a little
Manila extract and a banana I've also
got this superfood green mix just in
case it's not green enough a lot of
people recommended matcha but I'm trying
to stay as true to the actual flavors as
possible which might be a little hard
and then I'm going to make a caramel
just out of apple juice I didn't know
that until someone at work told me that
so I'm gonna do that for caramel a taste
and then I am going to make a little
honey drizzle with I think I'm just
gonna have to add a little bit of food
coloring or something and then for the
whipped cream I'm going to use coconut
cream not better for you but I guess
just free of added oils okay I know I'm
going to Gweneth Paltrow and y'all right
now but apparently if you boil down and
the simmer apple juice it turns into a
caramel ish type thing so this is
totally extra you don't have to do this
I just want to see if this will make the
drink taste a little more firmly
alright in the meantime I'm gonna whip
up this cream
as you can see this looks pretty nasty
right now but I have added a little bit
of vanilla extract and a tiny bit of red
food coloring and we're gonna whip it up
damn that's looking pretty brainy oh my
god you guys oh my god you guys it
turned into a caramel what what this is
amazing
okay okay we're going somewhere we're
being totally extra about this
Frappuccino but we're going somewhere
all right let's taste the caramel I
don't want to burn my tongue mmm
among our that's so good because the
water is basically evaporated out of it
and it's really this concentrated tart
sticky Apple II taste oh I love that so
I've mixed a little bit of red food
coloring and added it to honey and it's
actually starting to look really good
and this is what we're gonna line the
cup with oh my god
oh my god what look at this look at this
I'm so proud I'm so proud of myself this
is this is looking great this is kind of
how I want it I want it really gory I
want it really just like whoa that's a
zombie you know I'm gonna put this in
the fridge while we make the smoothie so
your calls now aside from the fact that
looks like I just killed everyone in
okay this was all going so well and I
did actually screw one thing up I don't
think that I did the coconut whipped
cream right it's still pretty runny damn
I so close so close dude oh look at how
sad it looks with the cream on top I
should have just gone from the regular
whipped cream it's it's okay right it's
a little scary
mmm-hmm there's a good apple flavor I
think that caramel does a really good
job of that tartness you can't taste the
spinach I was really worried that I
would be able to ma'am mm-hmm
this tastes good and it's not nearly as
sweet so I will warn you with that I
think I did a good job except for the
freaking whipped cream definitely into
this definitely would drink again
all right guys looking at my
calculations here it looks like this had
24 grams of sugar so I cut it in half
okay all right
so I've slept on it I've meditated and
here is the final recipe for the skinny
I don't like you but the zombie candy
Chino half of a green apple half a
frozen banana a cup a handful of spinach
and a cup of coconut milk unsweetened
and that is for your green base and you
can choose to add that Apple caramel
that's actually pretty good for the
bloody rim it's just honey and a tiny
bit of food coloring if you don't like
using food coloring you can use beet
root powder for the piece of failure
that happened to me I was so close I
wanted to use coconut cream for the
brains but it didn't work if you guys
know what I did wrong like let me know
in a nice way not in a mean way
obviously overall we saved a ton of
sugar we saved some fat and all of those
sugars except for the honey are really
coming from the natural ingredients so
that's cool and you get all of those
antioxidants and vitamins and minerals
from the spinach and the fruit so yeah
but obviously you guys this is for fun
if you want a zombie Frappuccino go and
get it I it's kind of weird tasting but
it's worth trying if you guys want me
to do this for any other Starbucks
drinks let me know if you guys enjoy
this let me know as well I love doing
these recipes and trying them out and
give this video a thumbs up subscribe
for more health and fitness coming your
way all right you guys thanks for
joining me on this journey bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
