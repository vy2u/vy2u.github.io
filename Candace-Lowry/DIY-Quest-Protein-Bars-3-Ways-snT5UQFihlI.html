oh my god my work lanyard is still on
hello everybody and welcome back to my
channel
I'm feeling very Westworld right now
some West Western vibes going on here
but that's not what this videos about
today I'm gonna teach you guys how to
make your own quest bars at home and
save you a lot of money I personally
love quest bars they're very low in
sugar and very high in protein but then
he can break the bank so I found this
recipe online that is very similar to a
quest bar but I made a couple tweaks
they added this really hard to find like
artificial sweetener and it's really
just - truth be told worth it - just put
a tiny bit of agave in there and you're
gonna be fine you're not gonna die I'm
gonna teach you three ways to make a
quest bar we're gonna be making Oreo
peanut butter and chocolate chocolate
chip cookie it's actually pretty simple
I was very surprised so let's get
started actually I'm gonna warn you guys
that um they kind of look like poop but
they taste really good this involves no
bake no like using fancy mixing gadgets
I don't want you to have to go to the
store and like pretend like it's Great
British Bake Off or something we're just
gonna make these super easy relaxing
quest bar to get ripped for the first
recipe you're gonna need blue agave I
don't know why this blue but you know
what I mean
peanut butter PB - I chose it with grape
- maybe a Cappy B and J kind of thing
going on protein powder
Nilla protein powder for the peanut
butter one and Nilla extract and then
two bowls I changed my shirt cuz I got
hot yay Serrano
um I also forgot an ingredient you need
almond flour this is why I don't have a
cooking show great step 1
always wash your hands you don't want a
dirty quest bar you know while you're
making this it's gonna seem really weird
and like clumpy and I get it but it's
gonna come together I promise I mean get
out my handy dandy kitten tea spoon
measures and we're gonna do what 1
tablespoon of the vanilla protein powder
in a bowl 1 tablespoon of peanut butter
I personally like I like crunchy and if
you don't you're wrong so so we're now
gonna mix this up it's gonna feel really
strange and get really dry so
essentially what you want to do here is
turn it into a ball a protein powder
peanut butter ball essentially you're
going to go ahead and put it in your
hands and roll it up into a ball should
look something like this not that cool
it counts like a ball of sand it should
feel like a ball of wet sand I'm making
this sound so appetizing and we're gonna
set this aside so now we're going to get
out our almond flour you're gonna grab a
tablespoon of almond flour and then
you're gonna throw in a tablespoon of
powder - peanut butter and then you're
gonna do one more tablespoon of protein
powder now I know some of you might be
thinking like whoa I don't want to get
swallowed that's too much protein powder
you can always just make this into two
bars now this is gonna sound weird but
you are supposed to put a teaspoon of
vanilla extract and a teaspoon of your
sweetener if you want to use liquid
stevia you can to me agave is so sweet
a little goes a long way and it's a
natural sugar just go ahead and heat
that up in a pan which sounds kind of
weird but the bubbles will start to form
and then you're gonna pour that in to
the mix of protein powder and powdered
peanut butter and you can always add a
little more or less depending on the
consistency you get so don't be afraid
to add a little bit of water if you need
to sometimes like powdered peanut butter
just sucks the life and moisture out of
everything so you're gonna mix these
together until it kind of forms another
wet ball I've got my two balls here got
my peanut butter ball and I've got my
PBJ ball what I'm gonna do here is
flatten this one out in put little
gloves on this so it'll kind of become
marbled if you don't have parchment
paper don't worry I can use foil here to
just spray it with a little nonstick
spray just so that you're not like
crying
I've made them here they are look at
that it's pretty easy so now we're just
going to stick these in the fridge just
to let them harden up a little bit and
you're gonna want to keep these in the
fridge as well boom
my little poop logs my peanut butter
poop logs time to move on should we do
Oreo yeah I like love cookies and cream
it's so the cookies and cream you're
gonna need almond flour the Blue Agave
one single Oreo no the extract and the
vanilla protein powder dark chocolate on
my face oh that's something not that I
was eating an Oreo
so unlike with the peanut butter one
we're just gonna go straight into that
second step of mixing together the
almond flour the protein powder and
you're going to do 1 tablespoon protein
powder and you're gonna do 2 tablespoons
of almond flour this time and we're
gonna heat up that teaspoon of agave and
the vanilla extract once you have your
vanilla ball formed like so we're gonna
get out some rage on a single Oreo
it's not too much rage but you know what
I get it all crumbled up once you have
your small sad mound of Oreos here we're
going to take the ball and knead the
Oreos in it we're gonna act like we're a
Cold Stone Creamery
I'm gonna stick this in the fridge and
then we'll do a comparison all right our
final bar is going to be a copycat of
the double chopped final ball it's
double chocolate chunk bar which is
gonna be kind of like a chocolate chunk
brownie just not as good as a real one
so for this final bar we're gonna use
semi-sweet chocolate chips
agave chocolate protein powder vanilla
extract almond flour and cocoa
all right so for this one I'm gonna do
about a tablespoon and a half of almond
flour and the other half of the
tablespoon will come from the cacao and
then we're going to add our heaping
tablespoon of chocolate protein powder
yes what we're gonna heat up some agave
you kidding I'm not gonna lie this kind
of smells like a brownie now you will
notice that it's a little crumbly see
that but it will form into a ball so now
we've got our Brown ball we're gonna
flatten this out and sprinkle some
semi-sweet chocolate chips into it
so we've got this little vlog I'm gonna
throw it into the fridge and let it
harden a little bit
oh wow ooh I really like this one you
know what it tastes like have you ever
had a Buckeye and not grainy I was
really worried to be grainy now you will
notice that the texture is not as hard I
guess just because it doesn't really
have all those added ingredients I think
this is a really close bet on a quick
and easy copycat quest bar for the
peanut butter one here's the Oreo moment
of truth mm-hmm you know what this
tastes like a vanilla cake ball with
Oreos damn I think it's the almond flour
oh my god in the Oreos are just like me
see the regular one track it's crashing
embarrassing they're a little they're a
little different it still has the hunks
of chocolate and everything in there
I'm so proud of myself that tastes like
a brownie it tastes like a brownie ball
these two have the most similar flavor
look at a road car damn those are good I
really hope you make these I'm gonna
post the original recipe that I found
down below and then the recipes that I
used in this video this saves a lot of
money it's very easy to make and you get
to play with balls I really hope you
guys like this video please give me a
thumbs up subscribe I love you guys stay
happy stay healthy and send me your
pictures if you guys make this alright
