I just got back from a little vacation
from Hawaii
it was very nice thank you for asking
that is so sweet
so I've been wanting to do a video about
Kaman's diet misconceptions myths what
people say what people believe there's a
lot of times especially when you're
getting into starting a healthy
lifestyle you don't really know what to
believe and you hear one thing from one
place but then the other place
contradicts it and I think that it can
be a little daunting and confusing to
know what's true and what's not
I have gathered the common myths that I
have found about diet and eating healthy
these are supported by studies at
Harvard and various doctors and
researchers and I'll cite them all below
and at the bottom of the screen so I
really want to when I'm telling you
these things make sure that I'm telling
you the truth and I'm saying real facts
the first myth that really hits close to
home to me because I love my fat is
lower fat automatically means the lower
weight now this can ring true when
you're talking about saturated fats and
trans fat and things like that but there
also are healthy fats that I think
people are sometimes afraid of and that
comes in olive oil you see that in fish
like salmon and commonly in the basic
bitch life of avocado which I love to
enjoy I love my avocado toast so in
order to have a thriving life you need
carbs protein and fat if I tell you
olive oil is good for you some person
would be like well I can have half a cup
of olive oil because it's good for me
just because I'm saying an avocado or
olive oil is good for you does not mean
that
you can overdo it on avocado and have
six a day in all seriousness it's okay
to have fats in your diet it keeps you
full it helps rebuild cells and it helps
your hormones so it is important to keep
fats in your diet this leads me to
number two which is low-fat versions of
food are healthier than regular versions
of food companies invent like low-fat
version of Oreos or low-fat versions of
pop-tarts or any kind of foods like that
they actually add more sugar to the food
and in a recent study in 2016 they
proved that more times than not low-fat
versions of food actually had a higher
sugar count and that equates to a higher
added sugar count so just try to if
you're gonna have an Oreo if you're
gonna have a cookie just eat the cookie
don't try to find some way around it
just eat it and be happy that's what I
do
honestly alrighty then moving on the
next point that I really experienced
myself as well is that just because
you're working out does not mean you can
eat whatever you want I started doing
something like pure bar four times a
week and I was like I can eat whatever I
want now wrong I'm so wrong if you
change up your metabolism to the point
where you put on more muscle because you
burn more calories and therefore you
increase your basal metabolic rate then
people think they can eat whatever they
want muscle needs more calories but in
reality it takes a pretty long time to
build up that muscle mass just like it
takes a long time to get rid of fat and
really shrink those fat cells so the
next thing that I hear a lot of people
say is that no matter what a calorie is
a calorie and looking at that yes that
does make sense I mean you could
basically say I'm just gonna have 2,000
calories of butter today and it'll be
the equivalent of 2,000 calories a veg
Stables but it's really not the case
because those calories also have
nutrients attached to them and fats and
protein sugar everything like that okay
I might be having the same calories
every day but I'm working out and these
calories are comprised of different
nutrients and ingredients than what I
was eating before the next thing is
green tea and caffeine can cause weight
loss so you kind of see these like green
tea miracle diets or what Hydroxycut do
you remember Hydroxycut okay I was
obsessed with Hydroxycut commercials
when I was a tween and I was like I'm
gonna get ripped with Hydroxycut if
you're already sensitive to caffeine and
you take an overwhelming amount of it
you're gonna get anxious you're gonna
feel jittery you're not gonna feel good
well you can have those effects of you
know not being as hungry having more
energy you're really gonna fall into
those crashes and you're I mean I have
anxiety I can't deal with that I have
one cup of coffee and I think the
world's ending but I love coffee there
is no miracle cure and that's what's so
upsetting is that there's no miracle
cure if it sounds too good to be true it
is too good to be true and I'm so sick
the next thing that I'm sure a lot of
people will argue with I do see
arguments on both sides people tend to
think it's better to eat a ton of tiny
meals throughout the day than three big
meals and they think that having three
big meals can lead to weight gain and I
think people say that because if you
starve yourself it's like on the
military diet I was doing I was so
hungry that when I actually got the
chance to eat food I eat so much more
than I normally would eat this comes
back to you know people think that this
will boost your metabolism because
you're eating so much and so your
capitalism's working your bodies
constantly working but it does come back
to your muscle mass and the fuel that
your body needs and at what specific
times you need it the next one is you
need to kick-start a diet with a cleanse
of course there have been so many
studies that have come out recently that
totally disproved this theory and you
might lose that water weight that's
great you know I lost a couple pounds
when you don't eat and you lose water
weight and you feel really thin but when
you go back to eating regular food it
all comes back and your body has a
natural detox system you know that's
what our bodies are for also when you go
in these juice cleanses you're basically
just throwing out key nutrients held
within those fruits and vegetables
you're kind of throwing out all the
fiber all the skin everything like that
so it's better to just eat the fruit or
eat the vegetable I'm sorry
juicing is so expensive you cannot argue
with that you really can't based off of
all these juices juice cleanses when you
can just go to the store and buy the
ingredients yourself the the next one P
backing off of cleanses is people tend
to think that if they take a ton of
multivitamins or if they take a ton of
supplements they're gonna lose weight
and that's all they need to do and
that's it and that is definitely not the
case because sometimes the body just
decides to eliminate these vitamins you
know if you take an overdose of vitamin
C it's not necessarily gonna make you
feel better or give you a cure of a cold
you're just gonna pee out that excess
vitamin C the thing about taking these
supplements is that these vitamins and
these important nutrients are already
found in the food that you're eating if
you're eating a balanced diet the next
thing is that people have thought for a
very long time that microwaves destroy
nutrients in foods and there's a Harvard
study that was recently
done this year Harvard people they
tested a bunch of foods in the microwave
and this was particularly with things
like vegetables they wanted to make sure
that if you're just microwaving
something it's also not leaching out the
ingredients and they found that there
was little to no effect on the food
however if you're going to boil your
vegetables or boil foods they always
recommend that you either drink the
broth or save that water for making soup
in the future so that you can keep on to
those nutrients but the things I just
said are pretty blanket statements but
can apply to everyone and you know at
the end of the at the end of the day I
always say at the end of the day but
when it comes down to it this is all
about you and all about your body and
every body is different once I looked at
my own body and I created my own plan
for myself and talk to nutritionists and
talk to personal trainers I was able to
gain the knowledge of how to really help
my body that really comes down to a
healthy wow that's a bummer my camera
went out of battery and I thought I
couldn't make it through the whole video
and I clicked and now the sun's down and
it's just it's just out my day right now
I really thought I was on a roll I
really thought I was on a roll they're
being encouraging the biggest thing I've
learned that I will reiterate after
these talking points is that diets are
not meant for everybody
nothing started working for me until I
just ate healthy and gave my body what
it needed I want to give a special shout
out to Squarespace for sponsoring this
