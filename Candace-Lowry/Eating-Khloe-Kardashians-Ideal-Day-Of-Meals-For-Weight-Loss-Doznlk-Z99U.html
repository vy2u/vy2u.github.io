okay that's hello everyone good morning
it is another beautiful day in LA here I
am so sorry for the lack of content I've
had lately because I've been on hole 30
and it's been so hard
wrapping up hole 30 right now and I'm
excited for that video however I wanted
to do another celebrity diet or just
kind of analyze a celebrity diet and the
one that I was looking at that actually
could work with whole 30 is Khloe
Kardashian's post pregnancy diet
someone's someone backing up right now
so I was looking at Koli Kardashian's
post pregnancy diet and it is pretty
compliant with whole 30 except for
oatmeal so I'll teach you guys how to
make a whole 30 oatmeal I'm gonna do her
ideal day of food for weight loss and
we're gonna analyze it at the end and
what she starts with at the beginning of
the day is a scoop well like a
tablespoon of almond butter and then a
tablespoon of jelly and you can actually
make jelly without added sugar so I'm
gonna do that but she basically just has
a PB&amp;amp;J before she works out and I'm
assuming that this is to kind of get her
energized and have that reserved energy
for her workout but I'm excited for that
it's like the PB&amp;amp;J without the bee yeah
I don't have her but I don't ever waste
but I'm excited to look at this so I'm
gonna be Chloe at the end of this okay
I'm about to go workout but I feel like
something's missing
okay now I'm about to go
I'm just kidding I just put a butt
implant and to be like Chloe okay
post-workout meal time I am going to
show you guys how to make a paleo or
whole 30 friendly oatmeal and yeah I
mean so far so good I liked the little
burst of energy for the workout I don't
like eating before my workouts because I
get a little noisy but this sounds
pretty well alright so let's get into
making this weird coconut oatmeal thing
all right we've got my two eggs my cup
of fruit and this fancy hole 30 approved
oatmeal could I have used any more bowls
I don't know
but so far this looks like a great
breakfast that will keep me full you've
got your proteins your quick carbs here
that are all-natural very low sugar
across the board here and yeah I think
this will really keep me full my snack
of the day one piece of seasonal fruit I
chose a nectarine hey everyone it's
lunchtime and you know what that means
more grilled chicken so Khloe
Kardashian's go to lunch is okay wait
this her go to lunch is 4 ounces of
grilled chicken or another grilled
protein substance so if you're
vegetarian tofu if you're pescetarian
fish you get what I mean
she hasn't with a starch either potatoes
or rice she has a salad with greens that
are high in iron so a lot of spinach and
dark vegetables and then tops it with
broccoli asparagus beets and I just
added some mushrooms and then a little
bit of olive oil and vinegar I went to
Whole Foods and got this salad because I
feel like she's like kind of a Whole
Foods kind of girl you know what I mean
like pretty bougie not that that's a bad
thing I mean it's just like she's not a
Ralph's girl okay we all know that
shoes like you have a secret also Kobe
loves nuts
okay that's Khloe's snacks on almonds
throughout the day healthy nuts so I'm
gonna keep these snack on these
throughout the day
I like the heart-healthy mixed nuts it's
basically everything but a peanut
alright everyone it's dinner time
I don't be honest with you I'm not
hungry
and I never say that so this is weird
but I'm gonna make some fish and some
sweet potatoes
that's her dinner yeah so it's like not
that cool and then I'm gonna turn my
sweet potato into fries which you
basically just toss them with a little
bit of olive oil and then throw them
into the oven so come join me on this
dinner journey
okay I'm actually having a really hard
time cutting the sweet
all right these bad boys are gonna go in
the onion at 4:20 Funyun now that those
are in the oven we're gonna get started
on a fish
Wow I just turned the camera off and
then I was like that was really cringe
what I just did so I'm sorry that I did
that you hear that oh oh you hear that
that's better than sex cooking tilapia
and watching this out of box so I can
look like Khloe Kardashian damn these
are looking crisp honestly not mad at
this dinner looks pretty good and um you
know Oh got a little got a little steamy
in there this just kind of reminds me of
a meal that's someone who does a lot of
CrossFit would eat like Khloe is getting
swole right now hello everyone welcome
back you've gone through this daily
journey with me and I want to go over
the type of diet the science behind the
diet the calories that I took in and
where they line up across the board in
terms of macros fiber your nutrients
everything like that I will say that I
give so much credit to someone like
Khloe Kardashian for really taking a
sustainable approach to dieting there
wasn't a skinny tea added or a specific
type of skinny smoothie this was just
approaching getting back to her healthy
typical way the best way possible and
the most sustainable way possible I had
a total of 16 hundred and seventy six
calories give or take that day I'm using
my Fitness Pal so we broke everything
out it was very heavy on the fiber in
the morning you saw that with that
oatmeal regardless of whether or not you
used regular oatmeal
or the Paleo oatmeal and you get that to
keep you full throughout the day so this
was a very protein and fat heavy diet
and little carbohydrates and so you
typically do this so that your body
starts tapping into your fat reserves
once all of your carbs are depleted so
that's why you see that she had a very
very low carb diet aside from her fruit
which is you know those fast carbs to
keep you energized like I was never
hungry and they made an emphasis in the
article I was reading to eat if you're
hungry and I think people forget to do
that if you're hungry feed your body
just feed your body with the right stuff
very low sodium so I didn't even reach
half the maximum amount of sodium for
your day we were under the sugar goal so
this diet has zero added sugars zero
added sugar alcohol so this is all just
natural Whole Foods anyone can do this I
mean it was this was easily one of the
simplest and one of the most cost
effective diets
I've tried aside from going to Whole
Foods of course she has a big influence
on young women and people you know have
this pressure especially girls to be
skinny and look good and I like the fact
that she views this as a fitness and
health journey not just a weight loss
journey please you guys let me know down
below whose other day of or eat luck or
like eating in the day of a person diet
you want to see here all right ladies
and gents I'm going to go now let me
know where your thoughts are below these
are fun to do and fun to entice as well
and please like and subscribe I am
rolling out some more content now that
whole 30 is almost over and that video
