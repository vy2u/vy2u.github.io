this isn't a happy video per se but I
wanted to be informative and I think
especially with the timing of Kate Spade
it is very important that people talk
about this um the day Kate Spade died I
was at the call center and a lot of
people called in because they saw the
number after Kate Spade so you know
getting that out there is really worth
it I wanted to use today as a kind of an
AMA about the suicide hotline
I asked people a while ago in the
community tab I was like please send me
any of your questions I want to do
another video and right now I feel like
is the time to do that video again if
you haven't seen my previous video I am
a suicide hotline or crisis line
volunteer so one of the big questions I
got was do you get paid and the answer
is no so that to me should really tell
you if you're thinking about calling
that these people are not just being
paid to be there when you call that I
fine you don't have to be in danger you
know you don't have to be an immediate
danger when you call the phone number
you can just really be having a hard
time you know I get people that are
coming down from anxiety attacks I get
people that just want me on the phone
just that they can calm down but I also
get people who are calling on behalf of
friends people who are calling are
calling for a reason and that's because
they want help and they want just
someone to listen to them this is a
place where people can understand you
and understand where you're coming from
alright that was a super long intro but
I'm gonna get into the questions if I
call do you just really read from a
and that is definitely not true
everybody that works there has their own
style and their own personality we are
just speaking from our heart but we also
are educated on how to properly talk to
people and the right and wrong things to
say but the number one thing that I want
people to know when they call the line
is that we're not just answering like
Siri you know a lot of it really is more
about listening we're trained really to
listen and be proactive in letting
people know that we're not here to talk
about ourselves we're here to listen to
you we're here to just find a solution
for you
what is the youngest or oldest person
I've ever talked to I have talked to a
11 year old who was suicidal and had
abusive parents I've also had someone
that needed rescue that was like 82 I
think they're pretty awful so we get
everything this is a good question let's
just say your mom goes through the phone
numbers you call does it show up there I
don't know probably stupid question but
I've always wondered if you agree to it
we can call you back and see how things
are going if somebody chooses to call
that number it will not go to the
suicide hotline however if you dial the
suicide hotline number directly it's
going to get you there but when we make
follow-up calls we want to make sure
first of all that the person has consent
and second of all that if they miss the
call and somebody grabs their phone that
person can't call them back and see
what's going on so we try to keep it as
discreet as possible does anyone ever
verbally attack you if you aren't saying
what they want to hear this is a hard
question because
everybody's different and especially
when you are under the influence or you
have a severe mental illness we have to
recognize that that's not the true
person talking that's the alcohol or the
illness and you know it's my job to make
sure that the people are safe and that
they're in a safe environment but if you
know we're being abused verbally we need
to set that boundary how does it affect
you personally I got a bunch of people
who asked if it affects me personally
and the big answer to that is yes but
not in a bad way
my mom was really worried about me
taking this position because I have had
depression in the past and she was
scared that it would kind of bring up
bad memories but it actually to me it
does the complete opposite and it helps
me leverage with people and understand
how people are feeling and it also makes
me feel like I'm actually helping people
the hardest thing is to hear that kids
are being abused by their families or
that kids have parents that don't
believe in mental illness and that's
really really hard but on the flip side
of that because they called they know
that there's somebody out there who
understands what they're going through
how can people access the suicide
hotline are there online resources if
people don't want to talk to someone
there actually are so you can either do
texting chatting or you can do like old
school I am in Brooklyn
this is a hard question because a lot of
people are really afraid that we're
gonna like rat them out that's not my
goal my goal is not to put you to find a
place to throw you in my goal is to
first of all make sure you're safe
second of all make sure that you have
any kind of buffers so that's somebody
who cares about you who you care about
that's around or if you have any kind of
coping mechanisms but if you're in
immediate danger you know I could say
I'm worried about you is it okay if you
seek help or we find a way to seek help
for you and nine out of ten times they
do want that if someone's saying I'm
suicidal I don't know what I'm gonna do
it may be tomorrow and they don't really
have a concrete plan and they're not
actively doing it I'm not gonna call the
cops on you if somebody has just taken a
whole bottle of pills and they're
slurring their speech and they need help
I'm gonna get you help you know
everything we do is very very
confidential and we cannot tell people
about your condition we can't tell
others about what's going on you know
it's all based upon how you're feeling
since working has your views on suicide
changed do you have a new perspective
and I will 100% say yes a lot of people
still believe especially after 13
reasons why that suicide is some sort of
vindictive thing that people do for
attention or to get back at other people
it's really helped me cope with people I
know who have died by suicide and
understand what they were going through
as much as I could and that it's not a
personal vendetta
it's truly that there's no other escape
plan for them talking is so important
like put down your phones and talk to
your friends it's okay to tell someone
if you're worried about them don't like
creep them out but you can say like hey
X Y &amp;amp; Z I'm worried about you know
how you're feeling and I just wanted to
check in and see if everything's okay I
know it was a good call if I did
everything I could and I was a hundred
percent confident that that person was
gonna be okay even for the night my main
objective is to not cure what you have
it is to find a solution that's just
temporary to make you feel relief I
can't solve your problems in 30 minutes
but I can definitely help you find a way
to start from point one do you ever get
pranks we do pranks all the time it's
stupid it's not funny and you know if
you want to be that cheeky we might
prank you back I don't know have you
ever been on the phone with somebody
when they took their life and that is no
I have never I have been on the phone
when someone is actively trying but I
have never been on the phone with
someone who went through with it
is there a follow-up program or protocol
can people be referred to a local
in-person support so if somebody wants
just resources I have every resource in
the book for them from homelessness to
addiction treatment to child abuse to
abuse from a spouse or significant other
and that's really what we're there for
too is to be like a really nice operator
that just wants to give you a hug
there's also phone lines that we can
refer you to that are called warm lines
that people can call whenever they just
need a check-in or they just need
someone to talk to but they're not
necessarily at risk we will not call
someone unless they tell us that it's
okay for us to do so how do you get
started it's really just googling the
suicide hotline within your area based
off of your phone number you get
directed to a certain area so I get a
lot of the Southern California calls
they typically have volunteer openings
all the time you just have to be
prepared to do
a lot of training but it has truly been
the most rewarding thing I've done it's
so important that you find something in
your life that makes you feel good and
you find something in your life where
you're giving a part of yourself to
someone else and we forget that too much
when you call it can be really hard to
open up to people and I get that and it
can be scary and you're in this really
really vulnerable position but so are we
you know when when people call I'm not
gonna just say all these medical terms
like if their way of coping is watching
Parks and Rec I'll talk about Parks and
Rec with you for as long as I can until
you start feeling better
do not ever feel ashamed that you're
calling us I wish that I knew that this
was here I just wanted to make sure that
you guys know that there is an option
healing is a process and you know we
want to be a part of that process with
them and we're there 24/7 all the time
someone's there we have sex
I'll put all the links below all the
information you need and yeah I'll be
thinking a lot about Kate Spade's family
I hope that if you guys feel like you
have been thinking about suicide you
self-harm you have a friend that you're
concerned about don't be afraid to call
we're not pissed off when people call
we're there because we want to be I wish
you all the best to stay happy and
healthy yeah and please don't think that
all these videos will be sad like this
this is actually a hopeful video if you
have any more questions ask below and
I'm gonna do my best to answer all right
you guys are great bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
