now and I'm so excited because we're
gonna get into the factory of how that
function of beauty hair care is made so
I'm really excited for all these factory
porn shoots and getting to see like I
know that this is so nerdy but I'm so
excited to see how shampoo and
conditioners made so I'm really excited
and I'm glad that I get to show you and
share the experience with you so yeah
let's do it guys
hi I'm Sahir dasa I'm a co-founder and
CEO of function beauty today we are
standing in our new headquarters in Soho
and I'd love to show you how functional
Beauty works the way it all works is
this magical film machine
behind me we basically start with our
hair quiz online where you enter in your
hair type your hair goals your
preferences and all the other pieces of
information we need from you in order to
make a perfect formulation
I've got wavy hair I would say it's of
course now I feel stressed because like
it irritated but deep position anti
frizz color protection there are
multiple changes
I actually know all the scalp I'm gonna
go for feeling fine apple okay and then
go into a computer oh then you hand it
to me okay I take care of it
bones are so once we collect all that
information we have a fancy algorithm
that spits out specific amounts of
ingredients that we need to fill your
individual sets below here and give you
a sneak peak we have high pressure eyes
ingredients blends and we basically mix
and stream all of this in line in
combination with these performance
blends to make your shampoo and
conditioner formulation and we also
shake your bottle so that they are nice
and homogeneous and ready for you to
start using wet early
Wow
it's beautiful like it's fine oh it is
it's like when you get stuff right out
of the dryer
hi my name is Joyce Thomas and I am the
senior formulation chemist here about
function of beauty at our new
headquarters in 7er
okay so I hear about sulfates and
parabens all the time in my shampoo and
how to avoid them and why but I don't
really know what they are basically
sulfates are part of a family of
ingredients known as surfactants or
surface active agents as the longer term
or the longer name Brett and these
ingredients basically are responsible
for the cleansing of the detergency
basically your shampoos your body washes
anything that basically phones or
cleanses they are really really great
cleansers but because they're so clean
they clean everything which means that
they clean your hair of the natural oils
that basically help it remain shiny and
healthy so they can't really tell the
difference between what's a bad oil and
what's a really good oil parabens are
basically family of ingredients that act
as preservatives and your products so
turbines however have in the past found
a bad breath because it's questionable
whether or not they can penetrate your
skin and a long time ago basically in
2004 there was a study that was done
that found parabens in breast tumor
tissue hmm so why while that doesn't
demonstrate a causal experience a causal
relationship between parabens and breast
cancer it's kind of something that we
don't necessarily even want to expose
any of our customers to and then your
colors so how are the colors made and
mixed is that like an awkward question
it's like a nerd question for me is it
boring boring it's okay so a lot of us
use heat on our hair and you said that
it's basically all summer but
unfortunately heat when applied to hair
you have an ambient lower level of
moisture that exists on hair strand and
when you basically apply intense heat to
it really really quickly it kind of
flashes off it causes the hair strand to
kind of flex and Bend and so that
flexing and bending compromises the hair
cuticle
if you must use heat on your hair try to
use a thermal protection this is just a
personal question if you had to give one
piece of advice for someone looking for
healthy hair what would you say diet dye
your hair oh damn it I was like because
my hair I used to bleach it
it was bleached and now I'm trying to
kind of go back to being that healthy
hair so is there would you recommend
Google blow up okay thank you treated it
with a whole bunch of different frog
sides in order to kind of like replenish
it like I would do like a bunch of oil
treatment steaming to kind of hopefully
that
so just be kind to your hair and less
heat even like in like less tension
dumar oh hey everyone welcome back to LA
welcome back to my apartment it's not as
cool as New York bow whatever that was
my experience at function of beauty and
I actually really had fun and nerd it
out with all of the science that went on
and everybody had really good hair so
that's a good sign yeah I wanted to give
an update to about you know how my hair
how my personal hair life is going if
anyone wants to know but I've definitely
noticed that my hair has grown faster
and that it's slowly healed over time
because one of the big things I've
learned which I do a lot of is heat and
color so it really puts a strain on my
hair it was cool to ask all those
questions from a hair expert and really
hear what is true or false
but yeah I really liked it and now all
my friends are on it and I'm giving it
to my friends and everything but I don't
know like lush it's lush it feels good
it's it's nice the only thing I will say
is that whenever my mom comes out here
we have complete ly opposite hair
profiles so she can't really use my
shampoo and conditioner but I guess
that's a good thing cuz nobody can take
it I also have that same offer code
below if you really want to try it you
get five dollars off I recommend at
least trying it and I got the new
feeling fine apple scent which is
pineapple duh and I really like it I'm
on the Hibiscus train though I really
like the hibiscus one I hope you guys
learned something I actually learned a
lot if you guys like this video please
give it a thumbs up you know say hey in
the comments let me know if you've tried
this I really want to know if you guys
have tried this you know I'd be curious
to find out but yeah I hope that you
guys have a great day and
and I guess I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
