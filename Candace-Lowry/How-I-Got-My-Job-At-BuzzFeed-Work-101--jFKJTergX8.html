happened next will absolutely make your
day I'm such a bitch hello everyone
welcome back to my channel and to all
the new subscribers what's up thanks for
coming by
okay we got Mugsy here oh my goodness
little mug dude we don't know who's here
okay I don't think he's enjoying this
hold on whoa okay I put up a little bit
today I really wanted to talk about how
I got my job at BuzzFeed and then later
on I really want to talk about why I
left but I made these videos to be
separate because they both have really
valuable information about getting your
dream job or getting your job after
college and then how to really work up
the courage or the skills to use when
you're going to leave a job that you
really care about I want to be able to
help you guys in any way I can
in achieving your dreams so I guess you
could say bit little baby Candice little
baby side pony was abroad in Germany a
broader Germany like having them but
okay she see that he's meowing she was
growing in Germany and she discovered
this website called BuzzFeed back in
2011 and she really liked it and I think
for a lot of us you know BuzzFeed is
really a part of our everyday lives and
it became a part of mine before the
quizzes started and everything like that
when it was big time list I was super
into it and I was sending things to
everyone and I was like how did these
riders like understand my white girl
problems and when I was navigating
through school
I majored in film but I
knew that I wanted to write a little bit
and I know some of you might say that
you know BuzzFeed writers aren't real
writers I get that but I really wanted
to work there one of my three sisters
Ashley for as you might know she went to
Pepperdine with me we were both DJs
we I noticed that she was a writer and I
really just wanted to talk to her and
grab coffee with her and really
understand what it was like to work
there and know if it was someplace that
I wanted to be and this is really
important because a lot of people say to
focus only on your grades in college
focus on getting that 4.0 but look I'm
going to be honest with you unless
you're going to law school or graduate
school having a killer internship and
knowing about you people and networking
way Trump's a 4.0 GPA on your resume
when you want to get a job in media or
other places that aren't like Sciences
or she's like that that's if a magnum I
was talking to Ashley and she agreed to
have coffee with me and that was so kind
of her if you're watching Ashley you are
the reason why I got my job at BuzzFeed
thank you so much I said how can I get a
job here I want to work here I feel like
I understand these people these people
understand me I don't have a writing
journalism background but I really love
social media and I have a film writing
background and she just said you know
look at the content study the content
know the content and write your own
pieces so you can be a community writer
community contributor on BuzzFeed and
write your own lists or articles or
quizzes and there's a team of moderators
that can choose to select your content
and put it on the front page and so I
set up an account as a little baby
Candace and I just started writing
things that
made sense to me at the time so I wrote
stuff about being a college senior I
wrote things about going to Pepperdine
even or about being from Texas a couple
of them got selected to be put on the
front page and I was so excited you get
a little email from the team that's like
congratulations you're going on the
front page and it was like every night I
would hope and pray to God that I would
get one of those emails luckily I did
also have internships at places like Fox
and Sony and so I had this well-balanced
resume which is what you really should
be looking for don't put all your eggs
in one basket you need to be able to
have internships but also have good
grades and really be a go-getter and
self-starter jobs do not come to you
that is one thing you guys should know
people say you're so special you're so
great you deserve everything that might
be true you might be a specialist person
in the world but the employer doesn't
know that and you've got to prove it to
them and that's what I did I was like
look Alex who was my boss I can do this
I'm gonna do this I'm gonna kick ass and
that's what I did
so I applied to be a fellow and actually
hooked me up with the boss and I wrote
in all my pieces had my resume shoved it
in his face like look I know that I
don't have a journalism background but I
promise you I have the voice in it I can
do it just give me a chance I ended up
getting an interview probably because
Ashley knew me honestly oh thank you God
and I was so sweaty and I was so hot and
I really think i overdressed because I
was in like a blazer and a dress and
heels and I walked into BuzzFeed and
everyone's in like jeans and a t-shirt
and I was like oh ride up so I got down
and in Rio I was like sweating like I
already have sweaty palms
I'm sweating I'm sitting there trying to
cool like I'm really excited we're here
I love it it's good
yeah one of the first questions he asked
me was
tell me one thing about yourself that
makes you completely different than
anyone else applying for this job and I
was sitting there and I was like I said
that I hate a lot of orange foods and
here's my laughs it was really funny
because I'm sure he was not expecting
that I'm sure he was expecting me to be
like I found it that's one company yeah
I was being myself and I think that's
what helps me is that I just as soon as
I let my guard down and said these
embarrassing thing about myself it
really helped
I was also annoying as hell after my
interview I was calling and emailing and
falling up every day being like thank
you so much the opportunity so excited
to work with you pretending like I had
just freaking job basically and I just
wanted it so bad and I wanted to make
sure you knew that it was me in the
interview I'm waiting to hear back
I actually sprained my ankle attempting
to run the class crossing a crosswalk
and I did it in front of like a hundred
people and it was really embarrassing
and I never want to think about that
again I had like a little bit of
painkillers I get a phone call and it's
like well is Los Angeles number and I
was like this is it this is my seat for
after graduation I picked up the phone
knowledge this is Candace agent he was
like hi this is Alex from BuzzFeed I was
just calling about you know your
application to to work with us sounds
like shoot I didn't get it this guy
sounds so depressed right now and he
said I have some news and I just want to
let you know and I was like it was like
a little bead of sweat dripping down and
I was like I have I break my other ankle
and he goes you got the job and I was so
excited it was like the best day ever
got hired as a fellow an editorial
fellow and I was so excited and my class
had three other people in it
it was me if you guys know Christian
Zamora hobby and then one other girl was
in there with me
and it's basically this entire process
of like college all over again where
you're trained every week and you're
challenged every week to write new stuff
and it's a little competitive because
it's basically a trial run and BuzzFeed
hired me onto the fellowship and it's
like you have three months to prove to
us what you've got and then you can get
hired full-time it was pretty stressful
I was pimply everywhere by the end I was
sweating I'm eating on this is where a
lot of my weight gain came in yeah so I
started at BuzzFeed and I worked as a
fellow and I thank God I got hired as a
writer and it was two and a half years
of my life and it was some of the best
years of my life and I want to talk
about in my next video just so this
isn't like 30 minutes long my decision
to leave why I left I'm not there
anymore obviously but in the meantime
Sofia made a really really great video
about her time at BuzzFeed and why she
left and I'll leave that below in the
comments I hope this helped you learn
about you know the hiring process at
BuzzFeed and a lot of you probably do
want to work there I hope you guys don't
think this is reviews I just want to
help you get acclimated with what to do
after school and that it's all gonna be
okay and that you just gotta focus on
what you want and be determined and be
motivated and stay motivated yeah
alright you guys until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
