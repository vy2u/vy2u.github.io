I mean a meme I saw and by once told me
I mean I read it yesterday was I wish
everything in life wasn't easy of
getting fat and that is so true before
we get started I just want to say like
this is not to encourage anyone to like
lose weight or do anything like that
this is about treating your body well so
today I'm going to be talking about how
I lost 25 pounds three dress sizes and
nearly ten percent body fat
over the course of like eight months and
it is not easy because I love food
this special food who doesn't love food
when people are like I ate a grain of
rice and I'm satisfied it doesn't work
for me I need to be eating probably um
like every two hours like minimum every
two hours I started work the day after
graduation and from then on I ended up
grazing on a steady diet of pop-tarts
popcorn and I don't know salads but I
was sitting in a desk eight hours a day
and when you start to work when you
start the real world the last thing you
want to do is get your ass on a bike or
on a treadmill like I'm sorry I noticed
that I slowly but surely started to gain
weight and it wasn't good because the
things that came with the weight gain
were I was like an emotional bitch all
over the place my relationships did not
end well I didn't feel good my stomach
was hurting all the time and I didn't
fit into my clothes and I love clothes
okay so I had what I guess I'll call a
kitchen floor moment I feel a lot of
youtubers on the kitchen floor like
crying a lot my thoughts go out to you I
don't know what your problem is but like
everybody has to break down on a kitchen
floor I was in a bathroom and so I had
this moment with my mom where I was like
I so fat like I'm so chubby I can't fit
of any big but I was serious like it was
bad I wasn't fat okay like I'll say that
right now I wasn't fat like I was fluffy
and nice and chunky like I probably had
like a good marbleization on me I was
pretty squishy
I was huggable though you know I was
desperate I did not want to admit to
anybody let alone myself that I had
failed at something I was not doing a
good job keeping up with my fitness my
eating lifestyle anything like that
I started blaming everybody but myself I
was like it's my thyroid it's my
hormones it's birth control as soon as
it's that it's it and at the end of the
day I got all those tests done and it
was on me the whole time I started a gym
membership and I came with two free
personal training sessions and I was
like this is like they just
want money out of me I was really wrong
because I had tried everything I was
going all these classes I was doing this
and Matt but at the end of the day when
I learned through my first body
assessment the difference between your
BMI and your muscle mass and your fat
mass and everything like that there's so
much more to you than just what you eat
it's so much more complicated than just
like doing some skinny fix because at
the end of the day a 21 day fix anything
like that is not something that's going
to last forever and this body is the
only body you get and that's what I had
to realize the hard way
I started out like like at 34 percent
body fat you guys like that was not good
that is not good for a 22 year old at
the time and so um
I guess I'll show you my before picture
Yo Gabba Gabba
there it is alright that's my before
picture and this is my after picture
wasn't it pretty good I ended up
training working out it was a complete
body haul I was working out six days a
week but I was under a strict guidance
and I was on a eating plan that did not
take away anything from me I wasn't
restricted this is fuel that you put in
your body and it's like you know a
pop-tarts not gonna do that much for you
like MIT is pretty good but at the end
of the day I'm not gonna feel good so I
cut out alcohol for a little bit not
that I'm an alcoholic but like that was
really hard I wish I had a better
explanation that I was like I breathed
in this skinny tea and this work and at
the end of the day it was I worked my
ass off and it feels so good when you
accomplish something like this looking
back I couldn't even like you a proper
lunge and now I'm like lifting heavy
weights like I'm doing really cool
like I'm sorry it's pretty cool
I might view a couple tips is long story
short this was too long you're like
can't you're so boring like I just want
to know what to do the first step here
is just admitting to yourself that this
isn't an easy fix this isn't something
that's a miracle thing that you can just
do in a day and everything's fixed you
might see these people on Instagram
they're like let's do skinny T but it's
like it's that's not the way life works
like I'm sorry I'm going to be honest it
is a complete lifestyle change and
that's okay because change takes time
and permanent change takes a long time
the second one is look at food like fuel
look at it like this is what is fueling
my body for the day and the thing the
third thing I do is I eat very clean I
try
you go to a grocery store you look at
the middle part of it and take that out
don't you go along the grocery store so
you're going to start with the
vegetables then dairy then it's the
medes than all of your fresh items the
fourth thing I would say is that you
need to be forgiving of yourself you're
not going to be perfect every day nobody
is the fifth thing I think it's a damn
fun right the fifth thing I would say is
that do not restrict yourself from
anything you can't be like okay I'm
never going to eat this again like this
bitch loves fried chicken ice cream pie
all of that and I've probably had those
things with in at least the past like
few weeks
don't tell my trainer it's like number
six is that you have to find something
that works for you at the end of the day
this is a long-term health thing and if
it takes me spending money to actually
do it I guess that that's the way it's
going to be so in my ex 7 I think I'm a
felon I don't know you should be doing
this for just you you shouldn't be doing
it for anybody else and that's what I
had to realize was that I grew up with
this body this perfect body image in
mind that I will never be and that's the
way it's going to be but I love the work
that I put into my body and the change
that I've seen the only person that this
way or should affect is me number nine
is just that that feeling that you get
at the end is just fantastic knowing how
much work you put in and how hard it was
in the great payoff you have it'll
change the way you sleep it will change
the way your emotions are if you're just
feeding your body and treating your body
the right way then I guess number 10 we
die do ten and I do you so so much bad
ass clothes to work out in like I have
some cool that I workout in and I'm
excited I'm excited to do it because I
get to like be a fashionista at work and
it's
thing ever I don't know I really hope
that I'm helping you kind of look at the
way you see weight loss a different way
the scale is not something you should be
looking at only it is more about how you
feel how you're sleeping how your
clothes fit you know the confidence that
you have and it is really just a
lifestyle that is permanent and that's
hard you guys have any more questions or
like want to see what I eat in a day or
anything like that let me know I feel
eat carbs
I love carbs umm I love cheese you know
I love a good cocktail just know that
you're not alone and a lot of people
just struggle with just wanting to be
healthy and that comes in all shapes and
sizes I don't know I guess if you liked
this video and give me a thumbs up if
you hated it like you can get out of
here and then if you want to subscribe

with any questions seriously I'd love to
help out let me know um as a former chub
