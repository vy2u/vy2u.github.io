right now I'll be honest with you it's
one of the most terrifying parts of life
but you know what you can do it you've
got this under control and under my wing
right here you can do it
hello everybody welcome back to my
channel sorry you might be able to hear
laundry because I'm an adult and I'm
doing laundry right now today I'm super
excited to be partnering with Adobe
because I'm gonna show you how to get
your dream job I'm not gonna lie I got
my dream job if I got a job I wanted I'm
not that great I'm a very average person
you can get your dream job because I'm
sure you all are very smart and a very
capable of doing exactly what I'm doing
let's start with number one clean up
your resume and although tailor your
resume to every single job you apply for
a lot of companies are now using
computers to look through resumes and
they actually look for specific keywords
implement them into your resume but
please don't lie because I said that I
know Excel and then now I've been doing
Excel and Excel is very hard all right
make a business card and I am gonna show
you how to make a business card this way
you can learn how to make your own
business card just by using Photoshop
don't freak out don't be like oh my god
I've never used Photoshop I gotta exit
out of this video right now I'm gonna
show you right now I'm gonna make a
business card when you get into
Photoshop go over to print and you'll
see all these different things make a
t-shirt whatever and then you'll start
to see that there are business card
templates so I'm gonna click the marbled
business card and I'm gonna press open
I'm just gonna not deal with the fonts
because I'm gonna change them anyway you
have your whole entire thing right here
you even have instructions and then you
have your layers down here my name is
definitely not John Smith so you're
gonna double click the team
and I'm gonna go into some international
and put Candice Lowrey cool going to
make that a little smaller here not that
small and just drag it up you didn't
even need to know Photoshop and then I
have a picture of myself cuz I'm full
myself this looks a little too like I'm
a fitness expert so I'm gonna use
avocado girl I'm gonna copy this layer
and I'm gonna paste it in here and I'm
gonna leave it like this
JK people will always know who I am and
remember me we're gonna go to the back
of the card here and then I'm gonna put
my phone number you got you you were
gonna get my phone number well that I've
got my name and everything whatever it
done I'm gonna go in and add my social
icons I'm gonna go and move this up a
little bit you can go ahead and download
these for free so let's copy and paste
these over here and once again you just
hold down shift to move this alright
once I've got these about where I want
them I'm gonna go ahead and just
duplicate this hold down ctrl click and
you're going to duplicate the layer and
let's just call this Instagram Instagram
I'm just gonna change the font and do
this for every single one of all there
we go we've got it all right here and
you can always if you're a photographer
you can change out this marble
background I just made a business card
what under like 10 minutes I guess okay
welcome I kind of scary hope that didn't
jar you Photoshop is really really
important for a lot of creative jobs a
lot of marketing jobs I also want to see
your cars and I want you to send them to
me and show them to me and I'm gonna put
them on my Instagram I want to see them
I want to show them off to the world and
I want to show people that I'm connected
with I want to show them your business
cards and let them know like what
awesome people you are you get that
exposure
to other people and it shows me too that
you guys really want to work hard and
you know I'll do what I can to help you
guys out join facebook groups I know
that sounds really weird and creepy and
cat fishy but there are so many Facebook
groups that I'm a part of from BuzzFeed
from my friends from graduates that I
knew from school and it all is about job
posting we post jobs because we want to
hire people we know and that we trust
don't be afraid to shout out and be like
hey I'm looking for X Y &amp;amp; Z I like
petting animals do you have a job that
involves petting animals
number three reach out to somebody you
look up to you could reach out to me
seriously reach out to somebody who has
the job you want I got my job at
BuzzFeed because one of my sorority
sisters Ashley Perez was working at
BuzzFeed and I wanted to know about her
job I wasn't just just there to ask for
a job I wanted to hear about her job and
learn about the company and see if it
really was a good fit for me i
straight-up said hey what does it take
what do I need to do to get a job here
because this is what I want and you work
your ass off a friend can get your foot
in the door but at the end of the day
your job relies on you and your success
relies on you make a customized cover
letter if I see to whom it may concern
or to hiring committee or whatever and
it's like on Times New Roman 12 font I
just like don't want to deal with it
especially being a creative you want
something cool i rambled about spongebob
in my cover letter for BuzzFeed and then
in Fox I talked about how like I
spiritually aligned with Peter Griffin
your cover letter is a way to express
yourself
and to show off your personality don't
let salary scare you away my first job I
was making $10 an hour
full-time was it 12 who's 10 or 12 10 or
12 in Los Angeles is like a zero you
move up so quickly I moved up so quickly
and I was comfortable and I worked I
worked towards that next promotion
sometimes if it's such it really sucks
sometimes because entry-level jobs pay
like nothing and you're already like
help me I'm poor I'm out of college I
don't have any money I've been interning
for free for four years I get it look
you can be bold and talk about and
counteroffer a salary the next thing is
try if you're at an internship right now
and you want to be working there set up
coffee with the hiring manager at the
company I was interning at Fox like
Family Guy Simpsons Fox in LA and I
reached out to the vice president of HR
and hiring managers and they actually
brought me into their offices and talk
to me about possible positions and I was
a little small like 20 year old being
like please hire me even if there isn't
a position readily available for you
this hiring manager knows who you are
and knows how badly you want to work
there and when that position does come
available they'll be like oh I know
exactly who I need to hire also send
them a thank you letter when you're done
talking to them number nine ask
questions in your interviews my favorite
thing that I always love to ask is does
the company culture match up to what you
expected because I want to know if they
actually do enjoy their job a lot of
people feel like they're being
interviewed and they need to be seen as
worthy for their job but that company
also needs to be worthy of you and you
need to remember that please have some
questions ready for your interview now
the interview is over
follow-up I didn't get my first job in
college because I didn't follow up and I
was way more qualified than the other
guy it's so important to follow up
within the next 24 hours with an email
don't sound like desperate okay don't
get like don't get like brown nosey and
send like flowers and stuff just be a
good person
don't be a brown-noser just be a genuine
person finally my final piece of advice
is do not get discouraged when if the
job doesn't go your way or you don't get
the job I don't want to be cheesy here
but you kind of have to know that
everything happens for a reason and your
path is you know not defined by that one
moment so that's like big sis Candace
giving you a pep talk everything is
gonna be okay I'm glad that you guys
listen to this and I really hope that
you guys design these really cool
business cards even if you just give it
a try do it get a feel for the program
it's also great to put on your resume
yeah
I just want to thank Adobe so much for
you know having me work with them on
this and you know Photoshop is a lot
easier than you think
I use Creative Cloud every single day I
will be using Adobe Premiere to edit
this video and I'll be using Photoshop
to make a thumbnail yeah you guys are
great and you're gonna have so much
learning experience and you're gonna
laugh you're gonna cry you're gonna ask
why you even got yourself into this
situation but it's all amazing in the
end don't forget to send me your
business cards you can send them to my
email right here and I will come over
and yeah don't forget to Like and
subscribe if you have any more questions
about the job interview process let me
know down below thanks guys you're great
