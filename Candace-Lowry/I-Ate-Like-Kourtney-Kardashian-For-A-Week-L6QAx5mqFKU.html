let's blend it up wait what hello
everybody I'm fresh I'm clean and I'm
ready for our new diet for 2017 I sorry
I'm sitting like this I don't know I
tried to like start something new or
like be different or be fun it's also
nighttime and my roommates are watching
TV out in the living room and I don't
want to be like um I have to film for my
YouTube channel back to the point of all
of this so I really was interested in
another celebrity diet I chose a
celebrity some think they're talented
some think they aren't I will not weigh
in on the subject I think that a lot of
people are fascinated with the
Kardashians and think that they are
really interesting for some reason I
really wanted to try out one of their
diets they're under so much pressure and
under a microscope for how they look and
even if they gained one pound it's like
oh my god did you see Chloe she's
letting herself go but I thought that a
really good starting point would be
Kourtney Kardashian and the reason why I
say that is because she seems like she's
pretty much stayed at this really steady
like very good body there really hasn't
been that many like accusations of her
changing her figure by going under the
knife or anything like that her kids
have the same diet as her so that kind
of said something to me like okay this
could be a diet that's actually
sustainable she is dairy free gluten
free and all organic they say on the
show a lot of the times that Kourtney
just says she's gluten free and has a
gluten allergy just to say it but they
don't think she has one so that's yet to
be determined she fasts one day a week
just drinking bone broth
and I'm not gonna do that just for
health reasons and you know what I'm
doing outside but that's also part of
her diet also a thing I read is that she
said she's really bad at cooking so I'm
gonna put that to the test
she actually posts a lot of her recipes
online so I'm gonna chronicle everything
from recreating some of her recipes to
trying this diet you know in an everyday
setting with people around in social
settings and then also kind of making my
own recipes along the way and
chronicling how I feel so I'm excited to
get best going and maybe I'll get a
little vocal fry as well all right see
on the flip side look at this we've got
lactose free dairy free soy free and
gluten free so we're on the right track
she typically has for a breakfast option
avocado pudding so that is one cup of
unsweetened coconut milk half a novel
and honey but I'm not really a fan of
honey so I'm going to use some organic
pancakes scissor okay after tasting it
I'm gonna go a little off script here
and add a little bit of cocoa powder
it's not that natural calories so I'm
gonna add that give it a little more of
a flavor as of right now it's very
earthy that is so much better up your
auto game core
all right I'm having my lunch on the
beach
beach view got a salad here
eggs and turkey a little bit of bacon
you know it is I can't really eat the
dressing suppose dairy in it so
continue to read me the menu of things I
can't have gelato croissant croissant
stuff with gelato gelato cookie sandwich
gelato between two chocolate chip
cookies espresso over a scoop of gelato
of your choice I guess I'll get women so
I just got done with a workout um I
actually started drinking this shake and
I was like oh my god I have to film this
so that's why it's half drank but it's
not a Courtney recipe however it's one
of my favorite easiest recipes you can
buy this shape or make it yourself
it's literally a hemp milk protein
powder and ice and it's so good all
right I was in a little bit of a hurry
today so I had to stop by I got a gluten
free sandwich from Starbucks and then a
coffee with coconut milk in it so I feel
like I'm doing okay so it's lunch time
I'm just going on a walk right now but
I'm about to make Courtney's signature
salad which I kind of like her style
because she's very minimalist and uses
ingredients that are very easy to find
so her salad is basically half an
avocado mozzarella cheese two
hard-boiled eggs and tomatoes which I I
really can't stand so I'm gonna sub that
out with either carrots or red bell
pepper and then she sprinkles a little
bit of salt and pepper and olive oil so
I think that's a very easy salad to make
I really do wonder why she just doesn't
put it on a bed of greens um you know
the salad kind of looked weird people
were like what are you doing there but
tasted great so I'm not complaining all
right it's another morning I am going to
make Courtney as a signature morning
smoothie it is spinach of course
avocado coconut milk banana and it seems
pretty easy enough because I'm me I'm
probably going to add a little bit of
cocoa powder just to add
little more flavor I love how I've
actually really enjoyed how she tries to
incorporate avocado and greens into her
breakfast having fat in the morning
helps you kind of stay full through the
rest of the day so I've really been
enjoying it all right here we go a
moment of truth it's good definitely
have some avocado and ground undertones
but another pro tip about this smoothie
don't let it get warm
okay so despite everyone getting sick a
lot from Chipotle Chipotle's my jam
so it was on the menu for lunch today so
of course I got it but I actually made a
pretty nice salad out of it which I will
show you
so Courtney said her typical dinner is a
lean protein and a ton of vegetables and
occasionally brown rice so I'm gonna
make this really good kind of shrimp and
tofu and vegetable stir-fry with just a
tiny bit of olive oil I didn't add soy
sauce because that does have gluten in
it shoutout to my aunt with celiac
disease who taught me that good job
Candice it is like literally so good
looks like we made it no I don't know
the word I'm gonna give a special
shout-out once again you know who I'm
gonna shout out to to Squarespace but if

slash canvas alright you guys this is
the end of the week and I think I did
pretty I I think I did pretty well it is
a very sustainable diet it really felt
kind of like a lifestyle change and I
really liked that about it I'm gonna
have to give Cortney the big pass on
this her recipes were very cheap and
easy it's it was clear that I mean
except for being organic everything it
was clear that these recipes are really
meant for anyone really anyone who can't
cook can really do a lot of these things
I mean as you saw I was amping up the
spice and adding extra things even
though I'm white as hell even I was
seasoning this stuff the breakfasts were
very hearty which I really liked
and they kept me energized throughout
the day and I really wasn't starving so
yeah you guys that was the diet nothing
too crazy but I really liked her recipes
so I wish I could say that I hated this
diet but pretty big fan as always if you
liked this video please give it a big
thumbs up and you know subscribe for

diet you want me to investigate next
because it's always fun in my space and
