right Alexa how long do you cook
scallops hello everyone and welcome back
to my channel I need my phone where all
right welcome back I am so excited for
today because I get to eat like Megan
Marco
she is like so crazy perfect and there's
like beautiful skin and great you know
clothes and I'm just I'm proud of her
for infiltrating the you know British
monarchy and she's gonna kill it anyway
I was very interested in her eating
habits her lifestyles I've heard that
she is a huge foodie and like bitch I'm
a huge foodie
hit me up Megan I mean I know your royal
and everything but like you need people
to keep you grounded so hit me up
instead of doing her typical like
pre-wedding diet I'm doing her ideal day
of food so she had a recent interview
where she talked about her favorite
foods what she loves to eat and like I
think we could be best friends I found
this article
I think it's vogue or Harper's Bazaar
she likes having a very holistic diet
which is not that unexpected an ideal
day of eating for Markel looks like this
a claim cleanse vanilla shake blended
with frozen Ontario blueberries for
breakfast a Nicoise salad and a glass of
rose a with some Grey Owl goat cheese
and a baguette on the side for lunch and
a leisurely dinner leisurely of seafood
and pasta and a Negroni to cap off the
night I mean I'm down carbs wine and
seafood and I also love bloops you guys
know I love blue and I'm excited because
this is not one where I'm just gonna be
irritable the whole time she gets a lot
of her stuff from Canada
I've been LA I can't get things from
Canada I'm sorry I'm excited to look
like a royal like I feel like I do a
good job I'm gonna show you the recipes
on the way so join me let's do it
I just realized I'm getting out of the
shower if you've ever been to a place
called Thirsty's and gotten their
blueberry milkshake
it's exactly what it tastes like I'm
loving Megan's recipes I guess I should
try to dress like her today she's very
preppy zero preppy things so I'm gonna
do black jeans some sort of button-up
polo and then some cute Timmy's yeah I
am Megan Megan is me sorry Megan I put
on a sweater because I'm cold I ordered
my favorite Tuna Nicoise salad from this
place called tender greens and on its
way because a royal does not go get
their food so I paid $5.00 for postmates
delivery it's on its way I got my
baguette I got my fanciest held goat
cheese it even has flowers on it I got
my rose a so this girl's ready to have
some lunch
i honest to god feel like I'm living my
best life I am I'm so good
cheers to Megan you know yes yes yes for
good wholesome food the goat cheese and
the bread complements the salad so well
you're gonna go on a protein a lot of
fresh veggies and then who doesn't want
to just treat themselves you know okay
just got home from grocery shopping and
um I'm about to make her favorite
seafood pasta super amped I love seafood
I'm basically a pescetarian I also went
to Whole Foods because I feel like she's
kind of a Whole Foods kind of girl but
at the same time I just spent $50 I this
better be good so I think this should be
fairly easy right Alexa how long do you
cook scallops
what wrath get started but first wine
this is for me No
cheers to all the peasants you know to
swirl non nudes mmm oh I think I did a
good job oh you killed it set a new
standard here oh I'm still so full so we
did it I think you took their Magadh
Markel journey with me and it was
actually really nice like this is the
face of somebody who just ate real well
but that's 24 hours she's very much a
person that is all about eating in
moderation which is a really great way
to go about life and go about eating to
really like take time to enjoy food and
to really enjoy the process it was
really nice to just kind of let loose
and cook a little last night I really
enjoyed that
so her everyday eating habits she
doesn't like to cut out all carbs which
I'm like you go
Megan honestly it wasn't that it wasn't
that unhealthy
it kept me full like I didn't need
snacks throughout the day which I was
really surprised about don't you dare
hurt Prince Harry he's my favorite one I
wish you all the best I really hope you

other celebrities or monarchs under
