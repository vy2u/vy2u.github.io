to do five days of only gwyneth paltrow
goop recipes now if you don't know what
goop is it is this brand started by
going to the Paltrow it's more like
lifestyle food but very much known for
using really expensive ingredients and
having a very expensive gift guide at
the end of the year I'm gonna be doing
only her recipes on the website and I'm
actually excited because after looking
at them it utilizes a lot of fermented
foods and it's a lot of protein I didn't
see very much fruit or dairy so this
will definitely be interesting and I'm
excited to test these out because
they're so like she's known for making
things so expensive and I guess I'm I'm
preparing myself for that and it looks
like so far a lot of the recipes make
about four servings so I'll be
overlapping recipes throughout the week
just because I'll have so much food and
I don't want to waste it she uses a lot
of like weird mushroom stuff a lot of
green tea a lot of very weird herbal
ingredients Jony egg we did the sex test
and now you know I got to do all her
recipes so I'm coming for you goop let's
get started
good morning it is 40 oh I just drop
something up I bet I don't know what it
was today we're gonna be making a kimchi
omelet
I live in Koreatown so I have endless
kimchi two eggs a sliced scallion a
little bit of olive oil and kimchi it's
pretty easy and then you just mix
everything together in a bowl and throw
it into the pan and cook it like a
regular omelet I'm kind of freaking out
at how easy these recipes are so forth
okay I forgot that organic food is
actually kind of expensive I am going to
start the evening off with chicken and
brown rice and it's a pretty simple
recipe it's called chicken with brown
rice mushrooms in time so this makes
four servings so I'm gonna usually kind
of have a little bit of this throughout
the week as meal prep but I'm excited
because it's a one pot meal also this
recipe calls for white wine so I'm cheap
as hell so I got some boxed wine mm-hmm
looks like we're drinking on the job
today you think my roommate has enough
garlic Hey
just seared my chicken and now throwing
in the shroom ease with some butter
Gweneth thunk it smells fantastic right
now it's looking I think it's gonna be
good
yikes hopefully my roommate doesn't come
home
mmm that's really good I thought that
there was gonna be way too much time in
it but too much time not enough time
very good I'll cheers to that Gwyneth so
I realized that I forgot to vlog my
lunch yesterday I only took a picture it
was very good just grilled chicken and
kimchi a little bit of pho soy sauce and
you roll it up into a nori wrap and
you're done
you're good to go also this morning the
oatmeal was bomb you know I love oatmeal
every morning so I can't really complain
but it was packed with fiber and I was
full till lunch hey everyone welcome
back so I'm with Jack we're gonna make
the sausage onion apple thing and it's
all in one pan it's a skillet what it
means no it's made in a skillet they say
it's like a one pot meal okay damn look
at that beaut look at that beauty
what as 200 I gotta admit I think it
looks a lot like the picture I did add
some Brussels sprouts for extra fiber
ready
good morning everyone
I am meal prepping my lunch and I'm also
going to make this breakfast smoothie
make the kale guacamole califor
I'm going to be making the cauliflower
black bean kale guacamole Bowl hot for
lunch and a green like detox smoothie
I got a good-looking Bowl right here
this was not that hard to make
you just got your cauliflower your black
beans and your homemade block and I have
a lunch that's ready to go
and now that I'm meal prepped my lunch
I'm gonna do this smoothie I don't
really have very high hopes for this one
it's very goopy um it is basically
spinach bananas lemon ginger and some
weirdest ingredient Sun potion tacos
vitamin E um I'm just assuming it's just
straight-up vitamin E okay again this
literally happened in my last video
multi freaky
okay I'll be honest with you I'm really
not sure how I feel about this one it
just smells like ground
it's okay
hi okay life update
I accidentally doubled the amount of
vegetables that were supposed to go in
there so I'm hoping that that's the
reason why it tasted like ground okay
that's more like it
I made the tahini sauce it actually
looks pretty good let's taste it hmm
does not taste like Nutella but does
taste pretty good it just tastes like a
little sesame chocolaty goodness I like
this recipe it's so easy so I'm about to
go into moon juice it is a brand
applauded by Gweneth Paltrow if you
remember Michelle and I did the sex dust
but she didn't go quite well for me but
I'm gonna go in there see if they don't
see through to my middle-class casual
core and try to get some juices and get
a couple snacks
it's like really though $7.00 for some
chips with seeds in them oh I'm not
surprised I'm not surprised
they'll probably taste good and the lady
will work their complement in my hair so
this is one of the mini donuts I bought
it's made mostly out of oats and honey I
guess cocoa powder and then topped with
quinoa and tumeric so not really anyone
in all right so I'm gonna be traveling
home to Dallas so I got you know the
couple things at the moon juice store
yesterday and I got the drink that's
very close to Quinta the PAL Joe's
favorite smoothie and the reason why I
bought it was because it uses some of
these crazy-ass ingredients it uses Ho
Xiao Wu reishi mushrooms and shilajit so
didn't want to have to buy those in bulk
but this I've already had a few sips of
it and oh my god it's good I really wish
that I didn't like it because this was
like $12 hmm it honestly tastes like a
rich man's Nesquik it's 260 calories to
the whole bottle but very low in sugar
the fat comes from the almonds and
there's a lot of fiber and a good amount
of protein so hopefully this will keep
me full enough if not I have the snacks
that I bought yesterday to round out so
we all right guys sorry my voice is a
little soft my family's here and I don't
want them to think that I'm upstairs
talking to myself
hello everyone and welcome back I'm a
little holiday festive because it's
Christmas time around here
just ignore that I'm done with the five
days I have to say I am very pleasantly
surprised it was like I don't want to
say that I loved it but I really really
enjoyed it
she focuses on a lot of like
anti-inflammatory foods very much so as
you see again that it was a lot of
fermented foods so there was a lot of
integration of kimchi and pickles and
then making your own kind of
fermentation on that anytime you had
fruit you either had a protein to go
with it or a green so like this all of
the smoothie recipes have at least some
sort of vegetable in them I will say
though like the moon juice store was so
expensive I wish that that was a little
cheaper but I loved that smoothie if I
could have that chocolate smoothie every
day and not have to spend $12 each on
them totally there are recipes that are
like what is this root that's I'm
putting in here and what is this
ingredient but there's also a ton of
options for people that are really busy
and are on a budget which I was shocked
to see I hope you guys enjoyed this I'm
gonna put the recipes down below just so
you can see them if you guys want to
make them I highly recommend again the
sausage and I mean the chicken and rice
and mushroom blasted me a long time I
hope you all had a wonderful holiday and
a happy new year I love you all so much
and I'm so thankful for you so be sure
to like and subscribe and let me know
whose recipes you want me to see whose
recipes you want to see me do next all
right see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
