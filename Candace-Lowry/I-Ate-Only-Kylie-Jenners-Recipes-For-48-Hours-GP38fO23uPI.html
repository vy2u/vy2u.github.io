oh my god is so good
hello everyone good morning it's Candace
what's up you probably already knew that
I'm going to try and experiment where I
eat only Kylie Jenner gainers I eat only
Kylie Jenner's recipes for 48 hours now
the reason why I say 48 hours is because
she's only made enough recipes for 48
hours from the recipes I've read they're
very simple and they are not at all what
I expected
Kylie Jenner is always sharing her
recipes on snapchat on her app which
like I don't really want to have to pay
for on her half and people go crazy they
freaked out by seeing it I'm like this
bitch is just adding butter and garlic
salt to her ramen and people's faces are
melting off so you know maybe it's worth
the hype maybe it's not but everyone
loves to see what kind of food sheets so
I guess I'm jumping on that train I am
going to try these see how they taste
you know just experiment with it and
then also look at the nutrition because
some of the recipes like doing an
overview a lot of the recipes are just
kind of carbs and meat which on one hand
I'm like you know go Kylie for acting
like a you know college student and just
eating whatever you can find but on
the other hand I'm like wait like how
how do you not have hypertension like
why are you still so like fit and then I
mean she's rich so when you're rich you
basically look however you want let's
get into it
let's eat like Kylie for 48 hours we're
gonna start the day off with Kylie's
go-to breakfast which is jennie-o
sausage
rice and eggs and on the recipe on our
page it doesn't say how much of each so
literally it just says eggs of rice and
sausage so there's not much to this it's
pretty white because there's not any
seasoning she said you can click on
exalt if you're feeling spicy we've got
a hundred percent of my daily amount of
cholesterol 50 percent of my daily
sodium and some carbs I just got in the
car to go to work and it's it's sitting
in me like a rock right now
Kylie baby it was good though I can't
complain for having that breakfast like
come on so I'm making Kylie Jenner's
ramen I've got the ramen the egg the
butter and the garlic so hopefully this
is enough butter excuse me what did you
just say okay now the garlic salt up
wouldn't when should I stop here we go
ready there oh I'm gonna have
hypertension honestly okay I added my
egg
I'm not mad you have to love something
that's just covered and swimming in
butter so I just got back from the
grocer's and we are making her shrimp
tacos
however she includes cilantro and
tomatoes in her dish and I'm like hell
to the end oh I hate both of those
things we're gonna get through this the
recipe what is this on my chin the
recipe for this is relatively simple it
is frying up your own tortillas shrimp
Old Bay seasoning onion powder onions on
three Funyun some sour cream and some
homemade guac that's about it it's
organic compared to the ramen I just ate
I've never fried my own tortillas before
so pray for me all right I'm not gonna
lie this looks pretty damn good right
now um okay I am chef Paula candy right
now I'm gonna fill up my talks here's
the finished finished taco right here
we've got our cheese our sour cream our
little veggies in here and our shrimp
and these stayed folded and crispy I am
a ready to try these I'm actually very
excited
oh my god okay Kylie you might have won
on this one holy shite
this is good yes yes continue what
you're doing yes oh happy dance my tummy
is full and happy I love them uh-huh Oh
Kylie I don't know
we don't look like but I'll be your
friend now I understand why Kylie Jenner
eats these every night she says she eats
shrimp tacos every day I might be
concerned about her cholesterol level
but like might be worth it hey hey
everyone good morning we are having I'm
here with Brittany
aka brought and we're gonna be making
Kylie Jenner's Saturday morning
breakfast feast which really frosted
flakes to make the crusted french toast
we've got the skillet sausage healthy
skillet play some turkey bacon and some
eggs so we're working on the bacon and
all the potato mix but Brittany he
failed to tell me that her roommate took
her pans with her when she left
so currently you get one band in a pie
sorry I'm not adult enough to own and
actually I burnt it a little bit but
we've got her french toast coated in
frosted flakes our eggs
well-seasoned our two pieces of bacon
and our potato mix there's just like um
a hangover his champion breakfast you
know still I will say there's so much
sodium I just got out of the shower I
will admit that that breakfast was a
little much and has been tiding me over
for a while so I'm gonna make
smoothie I wish that I could say it's
some crazy-ass like kale bullet does
have killed some crazy maca powder
something like that but it's literally a
just strawberries pineapple blueberry
orange juice and kale and spinach
it smells like Jamba Juice you know that
Jamba Juice you smelled Jamba Juice has
when you walk in
that's what smells like it became really
thick because there wasn't a lot of
liquid in it but hmm tastes like Jamba
Juice hopefully this little kind of
detox me from that prick what's up how's
it going hey so I am going to make Kylie
Jenner's
famous teriyaki sliders they it is
ground beef garlic hamburger buns white
cheddar butter teriyaki sauce Lowry's
season and pepper I usually shop at a
Korean market near me they didn't have
white cheddar so I got Swiss and then
these buns are bomb I have no
self-control cuz they already ate one on
the way home I've got my beef got my
teriyaki sauce got my ketchup because I
am making a meal for one hashtag lonely
and I'm going to put this into little
balls and then save this for later right
now I have my buns on some but right now
all right we've got two beautiful balls
right there oh hell yeah
they laid some cheese on here like they
do in the Food Network so they're almost
done
all right I got my mustard my ketchup on
there my cheese looks so good and melty
ooh that bun that crunch that crisp
uh-huh
yes these are great it could benefit
from a crisp of lettuce
I think bacon would be a good addition
again super easy to make are they're
super good for you
not really but we're enjoying it I feel
like I'm having just two good old cheat
days right now and I'm loving it but up
hello everyone it is day three I've
woken up from my Kylie experience the
general experience well no that sounds
like Kaitlyn okay but whatever these
recipes were unique I enjoyed a lot of
them I did and I will as much as I like
shat on the fact that it was they were
very simple and they were a fatty I
actually applaud Kylie for making these
recipes that are just like everyone else
she never really got to have like those
I'm in my 20s I'm gross I just want
pizza face which I feel like with this
food she's able to go through that I
will say my favorite is a toss-up
between the shrimp tacos and the sliders
those things were so good I just wish I
had like vegetables to go with these
recipes are fun and I'm sure that you
know a couple of them are in moderation
but it sounds like she eats a lot of
these every day is Kylie workout or did
she just have a metabolism up like a
teen still here's my ranking system here
so we've got the ramen at least favorite
it was just kind of like mmm I wasn't
very full after it I just felt really
puffy then the smoothie then the day one
breakfast then the day to breakfast then
the sliders then the all-time winner is
the shrimp tacos make up make them this
is not sponsored by Kylie Jenner
she does not need my money I mean I let
me know if you want me to try anyone
else's recipes I quit peltro anything
like that it's just always fun to cook
and do things like this but let me know
if you like this video please give it a
big thumbs up I'll see you next time and
thank you so much for watching and stay
cool out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
