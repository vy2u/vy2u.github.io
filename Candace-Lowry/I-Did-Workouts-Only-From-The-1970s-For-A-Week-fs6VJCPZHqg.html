to my channel today we're gonna be doing
something pretty groovy we're burnin
daylight so I'm gonna go as fast as I
can but I'm gonna be embodying the 1970s
this week just in terms of working out
the 1970s were just a great time of
post-war chill vibes a lot of flare
jeans I think that people in the 70s
were like whoa
I've gained a lot of weight from the
munchies from all this pot I've been
smoking it's time for me to workout the
1970s were all about like Jack LaLanne
is starting out with using bikes that
were not moving so station do you got
Farrah Fawcett you've got face exercises
and there's actually the dawn of the
Jazzercise started in the 1970s and
we're not gonna forget the fact that
Arnold Schwarzenegger was huge in the
70s and that's really where he got his
fame with bodybuilding every day I'm
gonna do a completely different workout
I'm gonna do face yoga an Arnold
Schwarzenegger bodybuilding workout with
just light weights because I don't want
to kill myself an intro to Jazzercise
and then just some various things I've
seen in like Cosmopolitan magazine all
that from the 1970s I want to have a
special shout-out to audible for
sponsoring this video
Oh audible has shows news books
everything that you would need on all of
your devices you can listen on your
phone laptop iPad iPod if you still use
those and the cool thing is is that you
can be listening on one device pause it
then go to another device and start
playing exactly where you paused it on
that device you can also listen to a
book at a speed slower or faster to get
a free audiobook and a 30-day trial all
you have to do is go to audible.com
slash canvas or you can now text so you
have audible.com slash Candice or
texting Candice to five hundred five
hundred not that hard I'm also putting
everything in the information below in
the description I listen to a lot of
Chuck pal nuoc he wrote Fight Club snuff
invisible monsters they're all really my
favorite books also audible members get
a free audiobook regardless of price
every month and if you don't use it it
rolls over to the next month and the
thing that I really like is that if you
really want to start a book and it's
just not doing it for you and you don't
like it you can always return it so yeah
thank you audible so much for sponsoring
this and I think we're ready to get
started on our first workout
all right so I'm here in my apartment
gym and I'm about to do the Terminator
workout
what's up good morning um feeling pretty
good after our knees workout it was
actually I kind of difficult okay that
was really rude because it's a freaking
bodybuilding workout it should be yard
and I used the glider weights I really
feel like we're easy as just because I'm
way better with legs okay so I'm about
to get ready for my day and I'm going to
start off with some facelift exercises
now these are really meant to pull back
the skin tighten the skin get the
muscles on point and just you know make
you look like you had plastic surgery
when you did it
apparently this lady worked with a
plastic surgeon to get the right
breathing exercises and facelift
exercises down based off of her look
right now and what the video is paused
on I'm a little concerned look like this
by the end of these exercises it starts
with a low Oh will then accompany it
with sticking your tongue out you can
see the stretch we will then look up so
we can work underneath the eyes
and we'll hold our breath for a count of
eight
what okay next stop demon possession
here we go
I hate everything about that if I really
we just did the lion and now I'm gonna
do the ugly face perfect feel the
stretch
then you're gonna tip your head back
stick your neck out and you'll feel a
tremendous stretch from your chin all
the way down why is it so intense so I'm
gonna do these a couple times get my
breath it's very dramatic Wow it's thank
God no one's here to see this except for
all of you that was fun so I'm about to
do a workout specifically for skirts and
pants suits because a woman in a
pantsuit has to look all girl okay so
this one is called the miniskirt I don't
know
they all look so flawless once child's
play that's on my boob but do not show
that I don't really see how this one is
well I guess this is more of an ab work
this one's her pantsu
oh my god this is getting me ready for a
swimsuit god I wish workouts could be
this easy do I've write it oh oh because
I don't have a dowel in my house with a
bucket of daisies I'm just gonna show
you this one and do some arm curls that
was fun
now I think I'm gonna wear my pant suit
today
I did a few of the exercises from a
magazine that you're supposed to do at a
desk today but I'm about to head into
the gym and do the arms and shoulders
part of the bodybuilding Arnold
Schwarzenegger workout so let's see if I
can film some of it I hope so
fingers crossed
oh hi I'm just living in 1976 or any
other year in the 70s that was really
lame I thought about that and I was like
should I do that
so at the end of the week I am wearing
my amazing jumpsuit right now and I had
a really good time I think it was fun it
is crazy the more and more I do these
workouts the more I see how much our
fitness routines have diversified but
also gotten a lot more intense
especially for women and I think my
favorite thing was seeing those insane
face workouts you know I kind of wish I
could see some like before and afters
from people I also looked her up she
looks pretty good I felt one with Arnold
Schwarzenegger not really because he has
like kids with multiple people anyway it
makes me appreciate all of the great
advancements we have today and all the
technology but yeah I am excited to see
what else is out there maybe I can find
some workouts from like the 40s or
something I was sore from the are knee
workouts which I guess is to be expected
