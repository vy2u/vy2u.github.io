everyone welcome back to my channel I am
so excited for this week's video it is
sponsored by Poshmark I've seen people
do makeup from different eras dress from
different eras shout out to Soph for
doing all of those videos where she
dresses from the you know 70's 80's 90's
for a week and I was like hmm I wonder
if I should just try doing workouts from
the 1980s for a week because the 1980s I
feel were just like peak aerobic
exercise and everybody had such tight
butts every boy had like a bubble butt
and everyone looked so good and everyone
seems so jolly in these workout videos
and I'm really excited because I've
never done one before and it always
makes me think of that video where it's
like dananana na wait that's not right
Dona nanana wait no no no no no
look at my clean laundry right now I
need to fold that also look at this
pimple anyway so I figured to do these
80s work out I need some 80s clothes and
I am going to use Poshmark to find this
because Poshmark is basically your way
to buy and sell clothes and you form
your own closet and you can sell all the
things you don't want and shipping is
all super easy and it's quick they have
really great brands honestly like Louie
Vuitton Michael Kors Nike you can also
follow friends you can follow me I'm at
candy Lowry and I'm gonna be putting up
a lot of clothes that I've been wearing
in previous videos and things like that
so everything that is in my closet that
I will sell from this video will go
directly to the American Foundation for
Suicide Prevention so please check me
out
follow me I want to follow you Bex so
I'm gonna look on Poshmark and see if
there's any 80s workout clothes oh my
god this girl has like 0-6 rd KNG
whoever you are you have a good
selection of 80s clothes I'm gonna go
into her closet I'm gonna buy these too
I think these are perfect you know I'm
gonna have these shipped to me and add
them to my workout clothes throughout
the week because you got to look you
gotta look the part people also you can
pay their venmo
which I really appreciate the 80s were
really all about aerobic and light
weights for women so it's not gonna be
you know those hit workouts that I'm so
used to there we go
okay so my my first workout is gonna be
Jane Fonda's lean routine I've got this
high-waisted base with some legging I've
got this sweat band that I took from
someone at the office who
tried that Hot Chip challenge so shout
out to you let's get into workout number
one I already have a wedgie from this
where Jane looks so good oh my god
they're all so happy and ready to dance
what could I just did a cartwheel a
roundoff to get in here these people are
already out of my league
okay I did enjoy that that was nice
it was about an hour of just aerobic
exercise where you're not super out of
breath but you can feel your heart
beating you're sweating a little bit
but nothing too high intense it felt
like a very white Zumba class so today
we're going to be doing any targeted
workout where we'll focus on waste buns
and thighs and there are a lot of
shirtless men in the thumbnail so I'm
excited okay let's wait wait
this is overtly sensual this lady's like
whispering okay whatever there's no way
this is real here goes
the AB video
um okay now that I just recovered from
that it looks like I'm doing piledrivers
oh my god
that's really hard
Kyle driving is hard you're wearing
something unitards right now they're so
hairy there's so many bulges okay that
ab workout was really hard but I saw so
much pain and so much nipples that were
super hairy that was weird
good morning all right
today we will be doing Cathy Smith's fat
burning workout now this is the
quintessential Jazzercise workout that
I'm gonna be trying
everyone's hair always looks so good in
these videos got my galaxy pants on down
my melon color top my classic swept in
and a little 80s workout my bra already
I really like how everyone's in these
fun bright colors and then the one dude
is just in gray and black I don't know
honey check to make sure that we're
breathing here she's really good
like Chicana me throw up on what these
video starts just marching you how happy
big yeah alright here we go
whoa and the snap so parts in just a lot
of great binding
actually the stretches are pretty close
to what we do today not gonna lie
not very sweaty but it was fun it really
tested my coordination this is really
making me feel bad about how good I have
it dancing
all right it's got my package from
Poshmark probably already male oh my God
look how cute she wrapped on them and
everything and put a little thank-you
sicker okay here they are in all their
glory but let's just take a look at the
but on this looks like I need to try
these on get a few of my workouts in and
you know have a good time q workout
montage
I don't think pastel flowers are my best
look
pretty I'm also staying at my
boyfriend's family's house right now and
they're gonna see me in this stuff and
be like what is happening oh are you
dating hello what's up welcome back I'm
wearing my shiny jacket to look a little
80s I I actually had a lot of fun this
week and I think that for the first time
like going into a workout I was just
really goofy and looking at it as
something like entertainment which I
think we've kind of lost touch with a
little bit I guess I missed that about
workout culture now all of the weight
requirements were like 1 to 2 pound
weight but there wasn't really an
emphasis on building muscle or anything
like that everything was about losing
fat some of those videos were a little
corny feeling it is crazy to see how
much workouts have changed especially
for women I also loved getting to choose
my outfits I was really happy Poshmark
came through with those really genuine
1980s workout gear maybe I'll put them
up on posh my Poshmark closet if you
guys want them but yeah let me know how
you guys feel about this video I think
it was a good time but um alright see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
