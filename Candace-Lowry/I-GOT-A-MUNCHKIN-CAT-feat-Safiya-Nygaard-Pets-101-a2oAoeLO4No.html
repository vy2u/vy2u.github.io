hello everyone and welcome back I am so
excited for today's video because it is
the story about my little nubby munchkin
Mugsy the man the mint the mugs my
munchkin and Ohio story about how I got
him he's ten years young and he has no
front teeth but that's okay because his
heart is gold and his nub is strong so I
really wanted a cat but the last time I
brought my cat from home out here like
hammam in Dallas his name of Harry and
he was a mess he pooped in front of my
roommates making eye contact with her
multiple times
talk about a shitty situation so I take
him back home to Dallas and now he's
chillin there being perfectly normal but
I really wanted a cat and I wanted an
elderly cat and a little guy who could
just be my stuffed animal and so I was
looking around on the internet I really
wanted somebody and basically oh
basically this is not at all what I like
hi guess I'm looking for a cat of a
certain variety and oh what it ordered
what kind of cat um have you ever heard
of a pusheen a pusheen cat it's a it has
really small legs not fit for its large
body
it's very round very athletic in its own
way it likes to eat or you don't have
those oh okay
so basically I was looking for the
perfect little kitty and I had heard
about a munchkin and I knew they were
basically unattainable and a rare
they're like
the unicorn of cats I was on Craigslist
one day just scrolling this girl grew
and I saw adorable munchkin home needed
and I was like I I was like talking to
my boss like I go now
I've got to pick up this guy I've got to
meet him he's going to be the one and so
I contacted the lady and I was like
please the munchkin still available is
he still there and she texted back and
said come see him tonight and I walked
in and I saw this beautiful blue laying
on the couch and I just had to have him
he was perfect we've locked eyes he got
on his back put his little legs up for
me I rubbed his belly and I took him
home that night I was like you know I
need a cat that self-cleaning a cat that
is very handsome one with a great walk a
cat that is very athletic and a cat that
lets me use it as a pillow and he met
all those standards and I think it's
time that that you meet him okay well oh
yeah everyone was the key baby
oh this is my baby mug
oh here's I like to be held here my to
be held but he does love me I promise so
that's basically the story about how I
got him he's a Craigslist baby don't do
what I say or what I do or don't don't
do what I do but do what I say and what
I say is be really careful on Craigslist
I made sure that my roommate had my
location at all times because who knows
I could have been stolen but I had soft
the via and Tyler come over to see Mugsy
give me a little advice he was a little
shy with them but
I'm sure that you guys will enjoy seeing
their reaction to seeing Mugsy but he's
the best he's the best but I deal
looking like a mom oh are you excited
you excited to see soft today alright so
I stopped and Tyler here they're about
to meet mugs we're here to meet the
infamous must be crimes awesome movie
we're here to crawl into a closet trying
to meet a cat he's right there we see
them you looking at us yeah we got cause
if you can see you didn't have teeth oh
so now we're gonna play my face even the
Raptor
it's know he's looking menacing though
he is looking medicine mugs come on you
did all of a tree oh my god he's fat he
should want it well he refusing loves
he's writing nothing most people try to
like feed Ryan Gosling I can't do it
he's cereal Gosling look at his face
she's a get away from me I was gone and
now and he says that he's the boys to
men of cats don't look too much into
that yes this is our one of mugs watch
so some reason he's not coming out I
mean time is trying to get him to come
out but it's just not really happening I
don't understand what the problem is I
mean I feel like I want to be accepted
and loved by him he's just he doesn't
want to come out here and hang out with
us but that's okay meanwhile I got this
wedding shot of time we've got some
great like boxer shots of it oh do you
have them there he is
okay mom he's gonna try and go back here
now anymore get out here
Oh he has my BuzzFeed on my cousin for
mugs
it's okay but I love how much Tyler's
trying to like love him oh my god oh oh
my god is that where you show to do what
I do
Oh Oh bathroom that is not him crouch
walking that's how me
oh yeah attempt oh where you going no
Pharaoh what is happening exactly see
like trucks came and stopped halfway
through he was like trying to crawl away
I just plopped him on my lap and you
this chill he's chillin right here daya
started I think you mug I mean he
letting me do it like I don't really
know if it means that he's like just
giving up on life or if you look into
this you know mother he's like who is
this so what have you done this isn't an
eye catching me from head to the moon
with mom agree show that things are
gonna get better look the book so I've
given up really much you hate this all
I'm doing is petting him and showing him
love and he's like fine you can pet me
whatever don't understand my torment you
look like a little whale good like a
little like seal she looks good feel yes
yes yeah okay soft about to break right
because I mean you're meddling I up
Vicki sleeps like on the little circle
and this cat is like free yelling I want
CQ she wanna the portrait of a woman and
her cat said I'm just thinking you
served Mugsy the thing is like I I think
that I am a stressful person to cat I
don't think that I'm a calming presence
I'm here to harass mostly the time here
I'm here to talk calm of the cat yes off
stretching it out
this isn't funny out because while
you're saying that he's literally
following the plate can we look at this
whole situation right now hello there
the body language is mirrored maybe like
Tyler kind of lying like Mugabe is lying
how are you feeling right now so
Halloween I don't want to wait full mana
have to be Ola so what do you think of
mugs do the right back
I like green tea yeah he's oh my short
list of cat no one steals people yeah
okay well I'll be locking my door I mean
I like loving speech I just do I'm
saying that most you like I'm clearly
hide his legs yeah because there's an
inkling of self-conscious with is it
short arms and when he hides them it's
like they're almost like kangaroo arms
how can you what can you say that's bad
what what bad words you have to say
about Muncie once we got Mugsy out of
the closet that's true well love me I
knew that my obesity is that my only
critique of my life that's how you say
it
once you got mugs yeah the closet my
only critique of of the experience today
was that Candice wasn't really ready to
manhandle her cap yeah it wasn't
Candice like don't pick them up and it's
like just take them out of the closet
Candace I can't wait to hang out with
monkey more just a morbid excuse for us
to just come over drop by
Candace we just want to you know hang
out hey we just wanted to hang out with
you not mug yeah all right mozzie do you
have fun no that's okay yes
my dreams of owning a pusheen in real
life have come true and it's a life over
wedded life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
