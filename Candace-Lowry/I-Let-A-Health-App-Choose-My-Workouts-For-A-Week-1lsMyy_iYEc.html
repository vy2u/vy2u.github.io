look at that check that out we're
getting ripped we're getting shredded hi
everyone what's going on how's it going
welcome back to my channel I am really
excited for this video because it's a
week of workouts and I don't have to
choose them so what I'll be doing is
trying out this app called 8 fit and it
basically is your personal trainer your
nutritionist your cheerleader all in one
app my main goal here is to really look
at what kind of fitness program they're
gonna put me on and if I really like it
I think I might just try it for 30 days
and then come back and show you all the
results I know Michelle has tried this
before and a lot of my other friends and
they really liked it so I'm gonna try it
and have a dictate my workout for a
whole week the main thing I'm excited
for about this is that this app really
promotes like a healthy active lifestyle
and it's not just all about like losing
weight or getting super skinny or
anything like that I'm gonna take all
the little questions for signing up ok
so what's my gender well I'm a female in
case y'all didn't know where you were
questioning my main goal don't want to
lose fat get better of gain of muscle
mass I'm gonna say that I want to lose
fat and then oh this is cute this says I
want to lose fat so that dot dot and
then you answer I'm gonna answer so that
I can lean out and feel good how tall am
I
five six my weight 145
and then Oh estimate your current body
fat I think I'm about at 22 or 23
percent I think that's about where I am
and then I want to be let's say say 20
20 he's not bad the girl on the 20 looks
pretty pretty ripped so you can choose
your progress so you can choose how
quickly or how slowly you want to go
this is this is really great for people
who don't know where to start and feel
really overwhelmed I really wish I knew
about this once I started and this seems
like it's a lot of workouts that don't
have a lot of equipment to use so
apparently it looks like there's more
than 500 recipes on here
oh and it gets you shopping list so when
you go to the grocery you like know what
to get that's really nice and I think it
is cool that it creates these meal plans
based off your dietary needs you know a
lot of like meal plan books just have a
standard thing and this is like I love
this because it's all customized to you
and your body and it has these meals for
you I'm gonna try a couple of the meals
out see how they taste okay so my best
program match is premier which is six
sessions two weeks and I'm a level six
and oh I'm gonna do advanced hit
workouts
I love hit workouts I was so scared it
would be like we're gonna give you yoga
or we're gonna give you running miles
forever which is the worst to me okay
I'm down with this I'm down alright I'm
about to do my first workout it's a hit
workout
it is only 15 minutes which really isn't
that bad and it says that I should burn
about 300 calories which is like oh wow
okay I was just getting started on it
and you can choose your muse
which is pretty cool I have like a
little lady with me who does it I'm
gonna call her Jen so I just finished
the 15 minute hit workout and I did I'm
freezing heart I just had to do burpees
that I every so much and the only
equipment I needed was a yoga mat and a
chair so I just used my office chair
here off this chair I'm going to move on
to a 15 to 20 minute yoga session get my
Zen on
I like this plan a lot because I get
bored easily and I love to bot on hit
because it's just a bunch of different
things and crammed into a little bit of
time so that's nice I don't want to look
out I'm cozy and I just did the time
interval workout which is look at this
hair
six workouts that you do over and over
again until the 12 minutes is done so
it's just doing as many exercises you
can within 12 minutes and I listen to
the 90s playlist on there which is
pretty good y'all this ass right now is
grass getting into this car my glutes my
glutes are on fire right now I think
it's from those 150 squats I did so we
are about to get into Tabata for the
third workout
I'm excited about this because it is
going to be basically 20 seconds on 10
seconds off you just go really intense
for a little bit rest for an even little
orbit and then keep going at it and keep
doing it until the time runs out and so
I think this one is about 20 minutes
long and I'll show you some of the
exercises so come on as you can see I
did a great job I did a great job
that was my god I have a hair phone now
was 18 minutes and I'm not a sweater
honestly I'm not a sweater but like I'm
already you you can already see the
sweat forming on my back it consisted of
a boat exercise which is basically like
tearing like a little boat and then step
ups and then a military press so it's
almost like doing push-ups in down dog
and then it called it a four count but
that was a Burpee
it was a freakin Burpee and that was
eight rounds of 20 seconds of burpees
which I really kind of felt like I was
gonna die but that was a really good
workout for 18 minutes so I'm gonna make
a dinner from my meal plan I'm excited
about it because it's salmon and rice
and spinach and it seems really easy and
the thing that I liked was it you can
choose how lazy you want to be with
meals you can choose like max
ingredients in Max time so I wanted more
variety so I said a little more
ingredients but let's see how this goes
I love how this recipe called for a cup
and a half of spinach and literally this
will be down like this big in about one
minute alright here is my salmon and
spinach and rice actually looks pretty
good you know I might have burned with a
garlic a little bit but that's okay
that's okay
as they would have said a geico so easy
a caveman could do it
I think it's Geico let me know in the
comments if it's not Geico good morning
everyone it's time for workout number
four and this is a paleo run and I was
very concerned because I hate running
but it's more so getting in just a bunch
of cardio at once so I'll be doing I
like a strength exercise or a core
exercise and then going into cardio
which is one minute of running jogging
or jump roping so for example I'll go
ten push-ups to one minute of cardio to
twenty iron crosses which is an ab
exercise to one minute of cardio to
inchworms
to cardio so you get the point
20 minutes later alright hey leo Amelia
Bruns over I will say that that was my
least favorite one why because it was
endurance cardio and you might be being
like oh my god endurance cardio is like
four miles or whatever but like it's
just a minute lasts a long time when
you're doing high intensity stuff but
definitely feel burned
I enjoyed that one but it probably is my
least favorite I'm gonna make some
brekkie right now I saw this recipe that
looked really good it's maple apple
french toast bread maple syrup butter
apple one egg how hard can that be oh
hell yeah I think I did it does it look
like the picture does it look like the
picture I think it looks pretty good hey
everyone how's it going this is the end
of the week it's already here and I'm
gonna admit I really liked this it's
totally based on your body and my whole
thing is like there's no one specific
way to get fit or to lose weight I think
the biggest takeaway from this is that
your program might not look like mine it
might not look like Michelle's like you
know when I was watching Michelle try
this app out it's like a totally
different thing I love the fact that
these workouts were very quick and they
were very intense and so you kind of
pack in 45 minutes
of just kind of like a run or a static
workout basically and you cram it all
into 15 to 20 minutes with a bunch of
different muscle groups and I think I
noticed that after these workouts I felt
more energized and I felt more awake
doing them in the morning I was like hey
I'm here the only thing that I wish that
they had was suggested snacks for right
after working out overall I really liked
it I loved the visuals of it and I think
that this would be a really good plan
for someone that wants to get started on
a fitness journey and they don't know
how in terms of weight loss I mean my
goal was to lose like half a pound to a
pound a week so we're not gonna really
see a crazy difference during the week
but I definitely want to continue this
for 30 days and see how that goes you
should be able to see if you want to
like go back in the video you can see
all of the workouts I did you guys
probably think I'm like saying all these
positive things because I'm supposed to
but I'm really not I just I think that
this is a really good thing to do if you
guys liked this video please give it a
thumbs up
you know subscribe for more fitness and
nutrition content I guess and please let
me know what you guys want to be seeing
more of and I don't know I love hearing
