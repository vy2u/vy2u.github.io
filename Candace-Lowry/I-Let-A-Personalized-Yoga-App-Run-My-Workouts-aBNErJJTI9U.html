like thirty minutes straight I almost
started crying
I think it's because I'm about to start
my period but hello everyone welcome
back to my channel today we're gonna be
doing something that I'm not dreading
I'm only like having a hard time about
it because I'm so bad but yoga reached
out to me and they're like hey do you
want to do a video with us and I was
like sure then I'm like oh wait I'm at
all like honestly this is me it's really
sad first of all it's wise so needless
to say I need to be working on my
flexibility and strength I'm excited for
this week because I feel like I never
give yoga the amount of time and the
chance it deserves when I was on my you
know fitness journey to getting to where
I am now I was constantly reminded by my
personal trainer to stretch and do yoga
and because I'm me and stubborn and
don't listen to people I didn't do that
much so yo kya is basically a yoga app
that has all of these great like live
classes recorded classes and I'm gonna
have it kind of dictate my exercises for
the week when I think about yoga I'm
like I'm gonna hold this plank for like
an hour and I'm gonna embarrass myself
because I can't touch my toes and I'm
just gonna get frustrated with myself
but this really seems
like there are classes for every level
it asks you for your goals which I
really like because then it can help you
narrow down the classes that you're
gonna do I clicked on strengthen and
tone increase flexibility and calm and
focus the mind because I'm constantly
anxious I also chose the intermediate
level because I've done yoga I'm just
not good at it I did I'm up for anything
because I think there's a lot so I can
explore especially this week so I just
put in my email address and password you
can't see that if you guys want to try
this out yourself you just do the code
Kandace 2018 I don't put it below as
well so I have like over 15 classes that
I can look out right now but then
there's like hundreds of classes just
from the previous days you can join a
live class so a dude in London or
someone here can be doing a class and
you can join with your camera and they
can give you pointers on how your forms
supposed to be or anything like that
when you're so self-conscious small
marshmallow like me the teacher can only
see me and I can only see the teachers
so like you don't see everybody else in
your group so I'm excited to try that
out every single day I'm gonna do a
different type of yoga class I also
wanted to participate in this too
because it's like the only live
interactive yoga app out there and I've
never seen anything like it so I was
like well I'll do it it made me feel
happy because they said yo guys for
everybody and I'm like a little weakling
when it comes to this like I could
literally lift weights and run sprints
all day but you told me to do yoga and
I'm like I don't know what I'm doing her
so I have all my stuff and I'm ready I'm
excited for you guys to go on this
journey with me and I'm excited to just
give yoga another shot
all right welcome to my first practice
I've got my blocks my mat my strap a
glassy baby and candle responsibly lit
I've also got some essential oils going
on so I'm gonna get started on my my
very first yoga thing
so it's the next day and I'm actually a
little sore um but I slept really well
which is great but hopefully this just
keeps me going and keeps me stretching
everyday and gets me in a routine but so
far feeling good I just had to pause my
athletic flow tonight it is hard it's
like holding a plank for like thirty
minutes straight I almost started crying
I think it's because I'm about to start
my period but oh my arms man we don't
give enough credit to people who do yoga
so I'm about to do something called a
yoga nidra which is a yogic sleep so
hopefully this will help me you know
relax and get ready for bed and it says
that I'll be lying on my back
withdrawing the senses and allowing
myself to connect with my internal world
in this class will leave me relaxed
de-stressed and calm that's really what
I need
to cry even more let it go and
it's the next morning and I did
something embarrassing I fell asleep and
I woke up on the floor and I was like
what where am I
what year is it what's happening so
needless to say that yoga works I got a
real nice night sleep and yeah if you're
gonna do that yoga maybe do it in bed
okay today I'm gonna be trying the hit
workout I saw that there's a 15 minute
yoga hit and I've never done that before
as that I'm gonna get to sweating fast
with this energy-packed class so I'm
excited let's see if this is cool
oh my god the two
I'll just chill here honestly okay that
was cool that was really nice because
Yoga is so focused on breathing this hit
workout reminds you to breathe and when
to breathe and that breathing is
important it was cool cuz a lot of the
moves were variants of basic yoga moves
and it was a lot of core work I liked it
I'm down to do it again okay so I'm
about to head home and do the yoga class
that is all about anxiety and stress
early because all I do is having diet II
I'm gonna get on that
so here we can be connected to all right
all right now we can able to rest out
please
hey oh my god
this dudes my favorite what's his name
Craig you're doing God's work you're
doing a real good job buddy it was 45
minutes but do not feel that long at all
it was just nice to table my thoughts
for a little bit I know that a lot of
you guys get anxiety and it's hard to
really turn off those thoughts and there
was something about the practice the way
you're so focused on your breath
that it felt really nice to just kind of
get in check with my body close your
eyes feel how your body moves and it was
actually like very zen I do feel bad for
pusheen though I used it as a pillow and
like really squished baby that was
really nice
all right everyone it's a recap time
recap huh how was my week um I'll be
honest with you it was a lot harder and
more intensive than I thought it would
be I think sometimes people tend to
think that yoga is just like this boring
just kind of stretching and it is so
much more than that and I think that the
biggest takeaway I had from this was
that there's so many different types of
yoga practices I would totally recommend
this to someone who doesn't know if they
really feel comfortable doing yoga yet
but at the same time like super advanced
people can do it as well like can I do a
crow pose no will I ever be able to I
don't know to be honest it was it almost
got to the point where I was like really
excited for the next one just because I
felt so much better afterwards not just
with my body but also mentally as well I
was sore in parts of my body that I've
never been sore if you want to try it
yourself remember you can use my
for code below for a free month no
strings attached and I really think you
can do it I really think that like
anyone can do it and I will say I had a
favorite instructor and he was British
and likes really cute I really I enjoyed
it I feel a very xin right now if you
guys liked this video please let me know
give me a thumbs up if you're a yogi out
there let me know your favorite classes
and some more concepts I should explore
but yeah thanks so much subscribe
love you guys stay happy and healthy bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
