hello everyone hi this is Jack oh my god
he isn't a video with me um because
adore me asked me if I wanted to do a
video with them and I said yes and I was
like I have the perfect idea I'm gonna
have Jack choose all of my intimates and
underwear and pajamas because he has not
really liked these recently every night
this all shoot wear to bed I think
they're cute
yeah maybe the first 14 times well and
then it gets you know you got a you got
worse I'm different the hair that just
comes out of it all day
um what happened so you texted me I was
on a walk on my lunch break and you said
do you want to pick out ten items from
this website I'd never heard of before I
got back to my computer and went to a
website I didn't really feel comfortable
browsing at work in public everything on
the site there's like athletic wear -
pajamas - cozy clothes again not
suitable for YouTube items I figured
that you could get an array of things I
think I did a good job oh I know you
like cozy for sure I started there but
the ads were you know it's selling me on
the other items okay so I got a couple
boxes in the mail I have no idea what's
in there
I don't really know nightwear fashion or
anything like that I'm solely just
picking off what caught my eye so you
can say goodbye to these forever
well did you give me a sleep Club we'll
see I don't hate them that I'm just
happy there's maybe a little bit more
new rotation of night where okay
so here's the first box okay so far so
good
do you remember picking me I think so
what makes them big by lot up to you
well they kind of got like the big butt
oh they like wrap around the cheeks so
much so far this is very me this is cute
I like this little set I would
definitely wear this chalked it up as
one for one I was expecting like some
sort of ribbon that just run around my
nipples and just wait

point for you got it thank you

speaking before you even take it out of
the pack this is actually really this is
fun good job so far
