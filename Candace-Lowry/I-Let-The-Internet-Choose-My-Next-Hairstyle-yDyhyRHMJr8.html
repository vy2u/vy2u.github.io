start this video there are some
important things that I need to say one
I'm not gonna deal with any pettiness
right now because I'm sure some of you
guys are like hey didn't Soph just do
this video the answer is yeah she did
and I talked to her and I established
this I have two jobs an anxiety problem
and a boyfriend who needs my attention
so I don't have time for pettiness and
I'm just gonna squash this rumor right
now that my husband shut down I just I
know that this has happened a lot with
like ladylike and there's been a ton of
like YouTube drama overtaking ideas so I
just wanted to confront that right now I
just didn't want there to be like no
explanation but maybe because I'm
explaining I'm like guilty he's back
fine I had people choose my vegan
recipes and then I was like what else
can I do now that I'm kind of doing
these diets for 30 days at a time I
can't really have people choose my you
know meals so I was like oh well I
changed my hair all the time so why
don't I just have them do my hair well I
asked a bunch of people a couple weeks
ago you know what should I do to my hair
cuz it's like puffy it's nasty right now
so I figured you guys would choose my
next hairstyle a lot of people said go
ahead and cut it shorter right now it's
like down to my left boob so everyone
agreed on shorter and then I asked you
know I gave them a couple options I was
like okay what kind of color do you I
mean what kind of cut do you want me to
do actually the most popular choice was
this like ashy lilac but the cut that
that was this blue hairstyle so I'm
going for like an ashy ombre and then
the cut from the blue picture I am
excited
I'm a puffball right now I am fuzzy it
is hot let's do this I also want to show
you guys how much work goes into dyeing
dark hair it's
3:45 right now I don't expect to get out
until probably 6 6:15 alright here we go
this is my favorite part I told my mom
found out I was doing my hair she was
like today your hair day if so send pics
Brown I said please don't uncle
she hates when I call her my hair all
right this is puffed up to the max right
now there's my hair now it's I've always
say I haven't done anything to it but
here's what it is now a little fluffy a
little dead it needs a big cut needs to
be brush just started the bleaching
process
I have a cut am I gonna get bleached so
that made of itself probably took about
an hour but
coming together baby cut a little more I
don't know you can see here that it
licked it actually pretty well it lifted
pretty quickly too so everybody's hair
sometimes becomes like a different kind
of blonde and you have to tone it a
little bit to get the right color and a
little toning it up right now so it can
be real gray 50 shades of violet gray I
don't know I'm just tired
creeping on my hairstyle
okay so this is my new look even got a
nice like ashy purple going on alright
so here's the look three hours later we
did it everybody yes welcome back to the
apartment everyone this is me Jack like
loved it and to be honest my mom also
loved it so Thank You Theresa
a few quick things you might see that my
color is a little bit I would say um
Pinker than the color that everyone
chose and that's because it's really
important to know that your type of
blonde might be different than the color
you want to achieve people keep like
bleaching and bleaching over again until
their hair just falls out and it breaks
and it's horrible I hope it's not too
sad that it's not super pale but that
will probably happen as I continue to
wash my hair a little bit more and it
fades out but I'm happy with it I
definitely want you guys to choose my
makeup for a week so if you have any
favorite makeup looks or any makeup
books you want to see me attempt even
though I am god-awful a makeup let me
know and I guess I'll see you guys next
time alright bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
