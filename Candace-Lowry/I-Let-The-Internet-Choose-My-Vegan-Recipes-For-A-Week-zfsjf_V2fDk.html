really hurt my feelings last time but
hey guys what's up you know we need to
talk about something I made a huge
mistake
and you're like oh my god you Candace
you're perfect and I'm like I know right
but I will admit I did a video not too
long ago where I tried to be vegan and I
really up here's the deal I tried
the vegan diet for a week I got
destroyed by a lot of vegans and people
were not happy with me I'll admit I
messed up that was a lazy approach to
veganism it was also very uninformed but
I think the main mistake I made was that
I looked at veganism as a diet rather
than a lifestyle I could have done it
better I was on a very tight deadline
and I think I just kind of threw it
together and it was a very bad subject
choice to do lazily I say that here's
the deal I know I forked up on the vegan
thing so I'm gonna try to get and this
time I'm letting the Internet choose my
vegan recipes I know that this is a
lifestyle change it can take time for a
lot of people I really want to give this
another go an honest go at it I want to
see what foods I was missing but also
learn about how to work with food and
make it you know taste like what I'm
used to I think that I came off a little
negative and I shouldn't have and you
know that's on me but hey you know what
people make mistakes and I could be
doing a lot worse things out there
honestly
okay pull so I sent out my Instagram and
Twitter blurbs about trying to find some
recipes and I got some good ones so this
is trying veganism for a week part two
alright so I really should be working
out right now but I just don't want to
I'm gonna make the vegan breakfast bars
that someone recommended to me and
they're supposed to be really good
baking is greater than working out so
I'm reading this recipe and it's like
pretty in SFW it says how the is
Nature Valley still putting crumbs in
bags and selling them as breakfast bars
this is kind of true but I love Nature
Valley
y'all I just ate so many of those bars
this morning
I really cannot so for lunch I had a
basic like Buddha bowl a lot of people
wanted me to try a bootable it was
really good really easy to put together
and now I am about to make a recipe by
pinch of YUM which is basically making
curried vegetables with tofu and it's
gonna be super good and I'm excited
a little spicy though look at me now
vegans good morning everyone
it is day 2 and I am going to be making
a tofu scramble I might sneak a little
bit of the strawberry bar because it's
really good
I'm not I'm not really sure how this is
going to taste just because of the
things that went in it well hopefully I
didn't make the I mean the eggs the tofu
too overpowering with the tumeric
because I know that that can be a really
powerful flavor
mmm actually it's not that bad and I'm
living for this nutritional yeast I love
it I love it so much I put in everything
I would say that it is pretty close to
the texture of eggs it tastes pretty
good and I think it's gonna keep me full
which is important well my hair looks
crazy cuz it's windy outside thought
y'all I just went in at this hotdog
place in Koreatown that has always been
recommended to me they have a pretty
killer vegan dog apparently and I just
want to show you what it looks like I'm
about to go in bomb oh my god taste so
bad I'm so sorry my mouth's full I love
hot dogs and this does not taste vegan
shout out to you sumo dog and shout out
to all the people who suggest this place
all right so I've been doing workouts
with my vegan food and I am very
surprised at how full I've been I have
not really been hungry and I think it's
just the fact that I had people give me
advice a last time I was eating a lot of
empty carbs I wasn't really sure what to
eat you know I wasn't that educated and
I feel like with the help of people who
are actually vegans I've been able to
eat a lot better and a lot more
purposeful so I mean honestly I feel
like my energy levels have been way high
and great so far and it's only been a
few days so this morning Jack was so
sweet and already had some chia seed
pudding for me this morning
so that is checked off of my list
it was just made with coconut milk a
little bit of chia seeds obviously some
blue
a little bit of sweetener and I mean
that's really all that goes initiate
 into chia seed pudding I just ate
some chestnuts as my snack I know you're
gonna probably like the Candace
what is a chestnut snack but it's just
roasted chestnuts and now I am about to
embark on making a vegan sloppy joe it's
made with chickpeas and then I got some
sloppy joe seasoning we're gonna mash
them up cook them have a little bit of
fruit on the side and it sounds pretty
easy so here's my finished product I
think I did really well this was super
easy to make now you're probably
wondering why I don't have bread I'm
just kind of trying to stay off of you
know a lot of that right now so I made
them more into like a lettuce cups
that's really good I think I should have
mashed up the chickpeas a little more
but the flavors of this Avi Joe are all
there and I think that this is gonna be
really filling because chickpeas are a
great replacement for meat your meal
prepped for a couple days so good job
for the person who suggested this so one
of my friends who I worked with at tasty
her name's Caroline she suggested the
vegan chocolate chip cookie recipe
looking good so far
little messy but it's looking good
essentially it's a chocolate chip cookie
without eggs and the milk is replaced
with non-dairy milk so I wouldn't say
it's um healthier let's see what these
babies look like mmm
yeah baby yeah baby I can hear them
sizzling the hardest part is waiting for
these to cool taste test time
mmm-hmm you can't really hate this
because it's literally sugar and fat so
I'm gonna take these to work tomorrow
definitely recommend making these just
woke up and I'm about to make a thin
mint smoothie that someone suggested to
me on Twitter it's spinach mint I think
a banana I gotta look it up but I just
made this bad boy it does taste like a
thin mint well hopefully this keeps me
full but if not I might have to have
snack so I have made some vegan cookie
dough as a pre-workout snack and this is
just chickpeas peanut butter little bit
of Nilla extract and that's about it and
I put a little trivia in and then some
vegan chocolate chips and it's a really
good you know protein packed snack I'm
gonna be making some dinner tonight I
just got out of the shower that's why I
looked a little sucked on I'm gonna be
making vegan alfredo sauce this it was
much requested by a bunch of different
people I'm gonna do the three ingredient
version which is nutritional yeast
cauliflower and tofu and so I'm gonna be
putting those all together you cook them
and then put them in a food processor
and then it should taste like alfredo
sauce kind of isn't that cool but the
consistency is great I've added some
sauteed oyster mushrooms and spinach and
I'm gonna top it off with a little bit
of truffle salt but I use these noodles
um they're really low calories so I can
just eat as much as I want guys
I was just about to get everything
together and do my final recap and I'm
an idiot
and deleted my last day of meals which
was this amazing white bean soup that
someone suggested and gave me the recipe
and now the footage is gone and so now I
can't show you but I'll show this
picture so you can see what it is
well after that sob story I'm back I am
going to save right now I was wrong I
misjudged veganism I think the biggest
thing was that I was just going into it
completely blind to the first time and I
really didn't know the tips and tricks
and what to do I thought I could just go
without meat or go without animal
products vegan recipes can be super
simple but you can also make really cool
things if you know how to use
ingredients correctly and that's really
what I learned and I think being able to
have a bunch of vegans recommend to me
their favorite recipes it kind of helped
me avoid those prepackaged vegan meats
and things like that and I think that it
went really well hopefully people think
that my favorite thing I think I will
say was the Alfredo that blew my mind
and from now on I will be using
nutritional yeast on everything I mean I
still I still miss fish to be honest
that's just me being honest that's not
me being a dick having people tell me
what to do and having people who already
are really well versed in veganism
instruct me on their favorite recipes it
completely opened my eyes up to a new
thing of food I'm really thankful for
everybody who was up for giving me a
second chance I really hope that you
guys liked this video I really want to
do a lot more content with
guys telling me what to do I'm gonna
have the Internet choose a lot of things
for me once again I got nominated for
shorty so please vote for me
