it's been called addictive and it's in
almost everything we eat the added sugar
sugar what's up everyone wait that
sounded very much like prank invader
what I've been doing this and I don't
want to be associated with that so let's
talk about sugar sugar is a huge part of
our lives it's not necessarily a bad
thing
but when we talk about added sugar it
can get pretty scary and I read your
guys's comments a lot of you guys wanted
me to do more longer challenges so my
first challenge is Candace goes 30 days
without sugar I will only be eating
natural sugars and you know we are in an
epidemic I'm gonna be dramatic so that I
can get more views so much sugar is
being added to our food they'll see that
you have a lot of added sugar in Cheaper
peanut butters a lot of protein bars
have upwards of like 15 to 20 added
grams of sugar the average person is
really supposed to have max 25 grams of
added sugar per day and you're probably
thinking whoa that's a good amount wrong
there's a lot in salad dressings ketchup
all processed foods a lot of like frozen
dinners it sucks because it's a lot of
the times in Cheaper foods and it kind
of gives flavor to cheaper foods and
another trick is that a lot of low fat
foods actually replace their flavoring
with more added sugar and I worked at
BuzzFeed one of the writers went on a
weight-loss journey but she also did 30
days without added sugar and I really
want to try that too because it's been
scientifically proven that sugar is an
addiction and can be an addiction and we
can crave it and it can have a
psychological effect on us and really
affect our mood
have looked at all the snacks at work
and I can't have anything the one thing
I can have is cheez-its so shout out to
cheez-its for not having added sugar
there's over 60 names for added sugar
I guess I'll put a little blurb here but
I think this will be a challenge and I
am going to really focus on no sugar
desserts special grads
snacks look at recipes for that as well
and overall I just wanna see how I feel
did I forget to mention that no sugar
means no sugar alcohols grip' halo top
no quest bars I can't have gum
technically or mints okay I've talked to
you're off here we go
oh look added sugar oh look added sugar
added sugar and then actually Larabars
did not have added sugar at this peanut
butter added sugar well you've got these
little chips down here added sugar BBQ
sauce added sugar I hate everything I
finally found a protein powder without
added sugar if it's this designer
protein designer wet it doesn't taste
too bad I don't know man I'm just like
it's weird it's like my head hurts I'm
irritable I didn't realize how reliant I
was on my daily like little sweet treat
and now that I can't have it it's like I
don't know it's affecting me emotionally
which is so stupid I knew that this
would happen is that your body's kind of
like resetting
I'm just kind of like down so I'm in the
process of making this no sugar apple
crumble and not gonna lie
it looks pretty bomb all it is is apples
cinnamon almond flour crushed up almonds
and coconut oil and I think it's gonna
taste pretty good with you know all the
sugars are all naturally right here
Jana's can't have my cake
it's Britney's birthday today and they
have a really cool cake and I can't have
it it's a pineapple a peanut boule I'm
currently in the process of making note
sugar added a Greek yogurt blueberry
lemon cake and it smells real nice right
now and I'm really proud of myself cuz
it's looking pretty good hopefully it
tastes good and it is looking good firm
juicy you bought me this you don't want
any of this this is amazing but how good
this is so I essentially just made a wet
log aka my only personal energy bar
let's so ugly pistachios coconut oats
and a little bit of olive oil I don't
know what this is gonna taste like okay
it does look better let's see what it
tastes like
bottoms up
Exilim not that bad it tastes like an
unsweetened oatmeal cookie mixed with a
mounds bar - the chocolate or weight
week 3 ok abs coming through well not
really but pretty cool right
I think the cravings are finally
subsiding it's amazing I have so much
energy it's bizarre don't have that
weird crash in the afternoon and I no
longer really crave you know that after
meal chocolate or anything like that and
I feel really good and I'm like I'm
starting to get really proud of myself
I'm feeling just more clear-headed which
is very bizarre oh one more thing
also I have a facial today and I am
popping a piece of gum I'm sorry I know
it has you know added sugar alcohols but
I do not want stank breath up in here I
am making some great food right now I
made some salmon and then I made some
noodles and vegetables with a tomato
sauce that was no sugar added so I'm
gonna put that right here which is
pretty rare I've been eating this
breakfast in the morning which probably
sounds really gross to you but it's
called a banana egg pudding
maybe I'm getting desperate here is eggs
banana and I think I go a little bit of
cinnamon and nutmeg and that's all you
do and you whip it together and it kind
of turns into this custardy soup like
I'm working with what I have
hello everyone welcome back this
lighting is nice I'm digging it we made
it I made it I don't know did you make
it 30 days with no sugar
damn I did it I feel very good I'm
really proud of myself
I no longer craving it and my energy
levels for working out are great and it
essentially just kind of made me start
clean eating and so I took
before-and-after pictures here's my
before here's my after and I really saw
a big difference yes my underwear is
pulled up a little bit in the other
picture so you know what however you
might say that photo by manipulation but
I lost an inch and a half in my waist
and two and a half inches in my hips
which is overall it really forced me to
get to know my ingredients and get to
know what is in my food there's so many
like some things I was looking at had
five different types of added sugar and
I don't know why it's kind of scary that
they find ways to sneak in added sugar a
great thing that has been happening by
the FDA I'm seeing it more in California
cuz everyone's like freaking all healthy
and liberal out here not not that that's
bad
on a lot of your food labels you'll
start seeing total sugar and then total
added sugar so you can take that into
account I really challenge you guys to
try this I think it's definitely worth
doing and don't like kill yourself over
it counting every calorie and everything
but it just made me more aware of how
much sugar was actually ingesting per
day and that's what was so scary because
it's like getting too bright
it's it's really starting it's scary
because of how diabetes is on the rise
in especially youths youth in America
and it's it's pretty big that we need to
kind of look at what goes into our food
and look if you want to enjoy a piece of
cake you enjoy a piece of cake just
don't have it every day because then
you'll probably not feel very good all
right am i excited to eat a little bit
of halo chopped after this yeah
well I probably get sick after eating
some sugar again probably I also want
you guys to let me know what you want me
to try for 30 days it doesn't have to
just be a diet it can be an exercise it
can be even a beauty routine and look at
how bright my breasts are getting okay I
guess that's my cue to leave
ya guys if you like this video please
give me a thumbs up please subscribe
stay happy and stay healthy and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
