channel I kind of had to back up my
space because it is allowed I think
because it's raining and people don't
know how to drive in LA when it rains
and then they get loud and BP one of the
biggest reasons why I started gaining
weight after college before this fitness
journey was because I was sitting at a
desk I was constantly naturally being
active and that all came to a screeching
halt with my job which I loved but I was
also sitting around eating snacks filled
with bubbling fat all day
my posture started getting bad you know
I was constantly being like wow welcome
to my BuzzFeed lair this company called
flexi spot sent me their desks which are
like active desks and they had one which
is a desk bike it is literally a desk on
a bike I want to do this for a couple
weeks and see how this makes me feel see
if it keeps me active and I saw this
article that was like your chances of
dying early increase really really
rapidly when you sit all day and I was
like thanks thanks for being happy news
I'm gonna try this bike desk bike bike
desk hybrid and we'll also get some
advice from my boyfriend Jack Jack deep
et/pt CSCS to give us some tips on how
it actually helps to have a standing
desk or bike when you don't want to be
peddling it makes you stand so I'm
really interested to see how long I can
be on the bike you know what I mean
without being like a lazy piece of poop
I'm excited I think this will be fun
it's Mighty Morphin desk bike in time so
when we're sitting at a desk we tend to
kind of hunched over
and type and type and type but sitting
on the desk by hopefully it'll pull me
back up and have me standing well
sitting upright and kind of keeping my
shoulders back and keeping that good
posture because I don't want some mass
to form here and then me stuck with the
old lady hump at 25 at a 12 page booklet
on how to get this made
earning it actually looks
one week later life update after week
one hold on to your buds because I have
a couple things set number one I'm
really enjoying it
because you can see how many calories
you're burning throughout the day how
many miles you're going and you can
adjust like how hard you want to go like
if you really want to work up a sweat
like more power to you but like whoa
number two I'm starting to be shamed for
not people passing my desk and they're
like I don't see you peddling Candice
you're not trying and I'm like are you
kidding me you sit all day number three
I had to wear a t-rex costume for
something at work and let me tell you it
wasn't too bad it still worked and I'm
proud of that
alright about to get on my flex moment
here
yeah
how's the workout Candace look strong
so yeah I'm talking in about 200 250
extra calories a day which isn't bad and
instead of you know sitting constantly
I'm forcing myself to stand and observe
and stretch which is nice
the only issue I'm having which is
really on me is that I am like I burned
calories at work I don't have to go work
out now bitch that's not true
I'm moving offices got my flexi sutton's
I'm back ok so Jack couldn't make it cuz
he had to work they ask you how you are
you just to say that you're fine and
you're not really fine you just can't
get into it because they would never
understand but instead I'm gonna use his
advice and pass it on to you so when
you're sitting at a desk you're
typically supposed to sit like this but
we all end up sitting like this you're
supposed to have your back up straight
your arms hovering over your keyboard
your legs a little farther away from you
and everything's fine and dandy by
sitting like this all day you end up
having a lot of back pain back problems
and you're not utilizing those muscles
that you really should be throughout the
day however the problem with this is
that we always end up s-- lunging over I
don't know if launching is a word but
we're also not remaining active
throughout the day so with something
like this flexi spot bike when you're
pedaling you're kind of forced to use
your core and stay up straight but also
stay active throughout the day and if
you get tired of sitting you kind of
have to stand up and it forces you to
really move throughout the day and keep
all those muscles active so Jack let me
know if I did well babe ok so sorry Alex
snuck in a room to get away from people
so that I could vlog so let's talk about
the experience let's get down to brass
tacks here if you work in an office if
you work at a desk I mean obviously if
your student you can't just like roll
into class with a flexi spot bike you
know what I mean if you work from home
if you have a desk if you have really
anything like that where you're sitting
for long periods of time at home or at
an office I highly highly highly
recommend that you guys at least get a
standing desk
I loved this flexi spot because it
forced me to either be pedaling while
sitting or standing and
it really helped me with my posture and
made sure that I was getting up and
moving around the main you know thing
that could probably be a little scary to
people is that this will run you about
$400 if you spend so much time there you
should really really consider it and a
lot of offices actually are helping
people pay for their standing desks I
think that that's really important some
people are like you have to have a
doctor's note and I'm like life is my
doctor's note I don't want to have bad
back problems and I don't want to have a
hump and you know I'm here doing work
for you I think it was really fun and as
soon as I built it and walked right in
people were like where's this from how
do I get this where can I find this I
want it so a lot of people really liked
it and enjoyed it and I was really
worried that my butt would get sore but
it really didn't I will say also another
thing that really surprised me was that
it was very easy to put together I was
very scared of that booklet and I was
like this is IKEA nightmare all over
again but you literally just popped on
the desk onto the bike and then put on
four little wheels so I think it was fun
and I loved being in my t-rex outfit we
got to fight obesity gotta fight the
obesity epidemic people but yeah if you
guys like this video please give it a
big thumbs up
you know if you've worn the t-rex
costume before you know let me know give
me a shout out part of the t-rex fam but
uh I guess I'll see you guys next time
all right
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
