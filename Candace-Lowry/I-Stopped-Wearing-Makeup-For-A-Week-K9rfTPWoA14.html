darkened my hair a little bit it's like
a dark blue now if anyone cares so as
you can see I'm not wearing makeup
because this entire week is going to be
dedicated to a skin detox I have fallen
into this trap of wearing a ton of
makeup and reapplying throughout the day
and just kind of renting it off at night
and I've noticed that my skin has kind
of not declined but it's not the best I
want to see if we can really make a
difference in my skin in just a week so
every day I'm going to be doing
something new whether it's like a
natural face mask under eye circles like
whatever and we're gonna see if if you
know taking a break from makeup can
really change your skin I'm gonna take
some before and after pictures as you
can see I've got a pimple wait what does
it look like I have a black eye I wake
up every morning you know being afraid
that people are gonna see me without
makeup and that they're gonna see by
pimples or that they're gonna see my
dark spots or my COG pores and I know
that that's like such a petty thing but
I think it's something that a lot of
people go through you can see that I
have these little pimples here I popped
one I know that's so bad you can see
this you know I have some little red
dots and it's like irritation from all
of this makeup and these products I've
been using and I really want to get back
to the essentials and my skin just being
able to breathe I'm going to start the
week off with a basic facial I haven't
gotten a facial in like like
years let's get into it here we go
alright alright so another big part of
this challenge is that I'm gonna be
using kind of all natural moisturizers
and all natural deodorant
actually the people over at native
deodorant send me some deodorants and
this is actually something I'm like semi
passionate about native actually sent me
four different flavors uh smells I guess
and I'm gonna be wearing um natural
deodorant throughout the week and I'm
gonna start with pumpkin spice latte
today because you know I'm basic and you
know I love pumpkin so we're gonna be
using these and these are paraben free
aluminum free talc free and cruelty free
so no animals were harmed in the making
of this video you can actually try this
out yourself and get 10% off at Candis
Lowry using that code the reason why I
like these is because with natural
deodorants sometimes they're like kind
of slimy and my armpits always feel wet
and but these these are more like the
traditional like stick that you put on
so you don't feel very sticky like a
gross little monster hey
so yesterday I got a facial for the
first time in like two years and she was
just like digging in there just getting
that and it was really nice and I
got a peel that had salsa good salt salt
acid that would help with my acne and my
breakouts so let's hope that this works
I definitely want to try some homemade
stuff tonight and see it test out some
like natural skin hacks to see if they
actually work I got ready so fast today
but it does feel a little weird and like
I'm letting my guard down with not
wearing makeup to work okay I'm also
going to be trying the coconut and
vanilla flavor today mmm it smells like
a good
and Allah bath and Bodyworks good
morning everyone it is morning 3 and we
are going to make some homemade
under-eye circle thingies that I've been
seeing on Instagram and it's basically
cornstarch any caffeinated beverage and
I think that's it and apparently you put
them on your under eyes and it
immediately works but like does it you
okay I don't have something cool to
apply this one so I'm applying it with a
frosting I'm gonna put this on can keep
Boop feels nice I feel like I'm I'm
already getting Instagram famous oh my
god but it's just it's coming so
naturally I'm gonna keep these on while
I'm getting ready but I'm not putting on
makeup and I don't really have that much
to do to my hair so I might just have to
sit for 20 I don't know if it made a
difference I don't know Oh still looks
like a baby threw up on me
did it brighten I don't know it felt
good on that's for sure I'm gonna have
to look at the pictures I'm gonna put
them up and then you decide so I'm going
to dinner with a couple of my friends
tonight a few of which are friends with
my ex so I was like I'm just gonna cheat
a little bit put on some mascara you
know whatever and then I was looking at
my makeup bag and the good Lord somehow
took out my mascara and I can't find it
so I really am gonna go makeup free to
my day dammit
day four and don't worry I'm gonna tell
him I have semi-closed phone
when I was at UM dinner yesterday all my
friends were like your skin is looking
so good like what are you doing to your
skin I'm like being a goy today's task
is to make a pore tightening mask I've
seen these a lot of places it's
basically just an egg white and sugar so
we'll see if it works you like whip it
up real good
give it a nice talking to and then you
apply it and wait about 20 to 30 minutes
until it dries and apparently it's just
supposed to just suck those bad boys up
just suck up up it's kind of looking
like snow hi this is an arm workout all
right so I'm looking pretty sexy right
now and a little bit dripped into my
mouth and bundle butter so we'll see how
it goes
wait I'm not gonna say that that worked
but I think that that worked my skin
looking pretty nice it's very soft good
morning everyone it is the last day and
I would say my skin has completely
changed in seven days and I think it's a
combination of all of the natural beauty
remedies and really really taking care
of my skin but also kind of giving my
face time to breathe and time to you
know go without makeup and I really
think that it made a difference and I
took photos every day so I'm gonna put
them up and you can see kind of the
progression of my skin throughout the
days I started getting compliments
throughout the week that was like what
are you doing your skin looks so good
I'm like not giving a about what I
look like you guys I'm so embarrassed
first of all I have
my pajama shirt on inside-out
second of all I have a huge deodorant
stain on my shirt so I apologize I'm
very sorry that just shows how tired I
was last night oh my god
all right so sorry I had to switch
cameras because uh it ran out of battery
again I know I'm horrible
I felt like my confidence changed
throughout the week I was very kind of
nervous and I shouldn't say this but I
was very self-conscious about you know
going out places without makeup now I
feel like I'm totally fine without it
and I feel a lot better and I'm really
proud of you know the progress my skin
is made in just a week like I can't
imagine what it would be like in you
know two weeks or three weeks without
wearing this and now I think that from
this point forward I will be taking a
lot better care of my skin but at the
same time I love makeup and I'm gonna
continue to wear it and there's nothing
wrong with wearing makeup but I think
that giving your skin a break is clearly
something that can really help I think I
think this was a success actually so
yeah I mean I challenge you guys to do
this definitely recommend the egg white
mask if you guys liked this video give
it a thumbs up subscribe do all that
stuff
thank you native deodorant again for
sponsoring this video and kind of
helping me get out of my shell and wear
