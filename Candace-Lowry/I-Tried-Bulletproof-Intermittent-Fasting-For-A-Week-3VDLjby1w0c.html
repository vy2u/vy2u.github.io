it's 8:40 and it's for jackie and i
can't have it so pale
I guess we'll just go with it I'm very
pale right now okay
tried to fix the lighting a little bit
please excuse if you hear any noise
they're working on my street outside and
I cannot escape it but I have been
really excited to do this video one
because I just get to eat a lot of fat
ah - because I've heard about it for a
very long time that video is the
bulletproof intermittent fasting diet
and I'll be doing this for a week and
you're like but Candice what's
bulletproof coffee I'm glad you asked
so bulletproof coffee is essentially two
tablespoons of grass-fed pure butter or
ghee you put that into your coffee as
well as MCT you put that into your
coffee as well as MCT oil and MCT oil is
supposed to help promote you feeling
smarter you feeling good you feeling
like you can take on the world whatever
when you're doing the intermittent
fasting version you don't eat anything
from 8 p.m. to 2 p.m. now because I'm a
little bit of a beginner at this I'm
gonna give myself a little bit of leeway
you essentially have the coffee in the
morning and supposed to tide you over
and make you feel like a freakin
superhero and it makes you feel like
you've taken adderall
even though I've never taken adderall
for purposes of I've never taken at all
actually
so essentially we they give you is a
green a yellow and a red guide to your
protein starches vegetables and it's
very typical of like a way of eating
healthy so I mean I would say I love
what I'm looking at right now I love the
fact that it's so simple and it's so
easy to follow and then it tells you
exactly what kind of
to eat what to avoid so this diet is
very protein and vegetable heavy but
this is very less so about recipes I
feel like in this video and more so
about the strength and the mental
stability yet to you know keep it
together while I can't eat for this long
I think that the intermittent fasting
portions interesting because I did do
that with Michelle if you've seen that
and it wasn't bulletproof way I remember
Michelle and I felt really foggy during
in her minute fasting and like all we
could think about was food and maybe the
adding the bulletproof coffee will
change things but I'm excited ok let's
do it so I just bought my oil and butter
here I felt like an idiot because I had
no idea where to find the oil but I got
it
so together the butter and oil will cost
me about 21 dollars so it's not cheap
I'll tell you that
okay here we go first bulletproof copied
down the hatch down it's not bad very
buttery I wish I could give you a better
explanation like I have very heavy cream
in my coffee it's not sweet I don't like
sweet coffee and it's kind of giving my
lips a nice gloss a nice little
hydration boost umm okay right off the
bat I don't want to be TMI here but the
coffee will run straight through you
which I guess is a good thing if you
want to stay regular but uh just be
aware but that might happen yeah okay
just for shoots and giggles I'm gonna do
a timed math test before and after a
bulletproof coffee just see if it makes
a difference in my focus
I got 23 done in a minute that doesn't
sound right we'll see what I can do
coming up I guess with the copy
it's 846 right now and I am a star being
with surprise veggies and they meet
everything requirements and some Evo oh
I really hope I'm parked don't worry I
really hope that this bulletproof coffee
comes through for me today
cuz I'm really hungry and I have nine
ten eleven twelve I have more than five
hours to go until I can eat a meal what
did I do
so I took the math test after I had had
coffee for a while one of these days and
I got 10 more questions right in the
amount of time so the first time I got
what was it like 23 questions done and
this time I got 34 questions done so
either I just got better in math in a
couple hours or it's actually making me
focus more also I made a big no-no
and I didn't have a blender at at work
and I had to whisk my coffee the reason
why people tell you to blend is because
if you don't use something like a
blender food processor all of that fat
sits on top and it's really kind of
masked to drink just straight-up melted
butter so that's why they typically say
to blend and not whisk but I just kept a
whisk on hand and it was fine I just
started macking on some cheez-its and I
just realized I have three minutes to
eat so I will be funneling these in
my mouth get to work okay all IDO may
ever I want wasn't that from this extra
crispy open your mouth
wait it's 50 degrees in Los Angeles
today so I'm low-key dying right now I
realized something after in a minute
fasting for the weekend is that it
doesn't really go with my sched you
really have to be devoted to this or
plan accordingly because I'm not gonna
lie I might have had a drink or two on
Saturday and I just really wanted
something to eat at night just a
late-night snack and I couldn't have it
and Jack had to hold me back from from
my pantry but I did it you can't really
be spontaneous and you got to really be
the type of person that really has a
strong will and sticks to their schedule
the weekends make it very hard all right
let's talk about how we're looking right
now sorry my room is D sky sting but I
mad at this right now I'm mad about
what's going on here so I'm waking up
and I'm feeling a lot less bloated and I
noticed that and I don't know feeling
good okay so the construction noise was
really bad today so I ran out to my car
and decided to do the wrap-up video here
did I feel less bloated in the morning
did I feel good in the morning yes I
slept better as well however it was
really hard for me to be social with my
friends on the weekends in terms of you
know being able to make spontaneous and
late-night snacks or being able to wake
up in the morning and go with everyone
and eat breakfast now you can shift your
time of eating just as long as you eat
for six hours but then it really
eliminates either breakfast or dinner
kind of watched Jack and my friends eat
and I'm like okay cool Gus yeah an
intermittent fasting part it was hard
however I will say that you can do
bulletproof coffee and not interment at
fast the bulletproof coffee a hundred
percent kept me full up until about noon
and then I was like I'm really I'm
really hungry right now I could kill
someone but you get this weird euphoric
feeling when you eat it's bizarre and I
was very worried about overeating and
binging and I didn't and I think that's
because of the coffee I have a picture
of a deck I was working on without the
coffee and a deck I was working on with
the coffee and you can see the
difference in like how I was thinking
analytically if you're gonna do
bulletproof coffee watch your fat intake
because you get so much in the morning
from the coffee I think it was fun and I
want to say if you're thinking about
intermittent fasting and you're not an
adult yet please talk to someone please
talk to a doctor because there are so
many things happening in your body
before you reach you know full maturity
physically but yeah let me know what you
guys think I thought it was very
interesting and I'm excited to hear your
thoughts on it but yeah thanks so much
guys be sure to like it subscribe let me
know down below what else you want to
see all right you guys are awesome see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
