god Candice what have you done to me
hello everyone welcome back to my
channel we are doing something very
different today but I am super super
excited so I've been seeing this trend
go around where youtubers are trying
other youtubers makeup tutorials I was
like I'm not great at makeup slash I
don't have that many products well the
one thing I do love is cooking and I do
love sugar but I can't have sugar right
now so I'm gonna make a little bit of an
exception for this but I figured that I
could do a Rosanna pansino video and I
love her recipes but I also love
spongebob so we're gonna be doing her
spongebob lemon bar tutorial recipe
thing so I've got my butter my sugar my
salt my flour my X my lemon juice and my
lemon let's go ahead and get started all
right I already stuff I uh I tried to go
the fast route and microwave my butter
and I microwaved it too long and now
it's melty and unusable so stay tuned
one stick of two sticks of unsalted
butter mix it up okay Candace here we go
get it together
why am I like this god now that butter
all over my hands okay um towel towel
just lotion it's lotion essentially
we're gonna blend we're gonna mix these
you said that the butter should look
pretty fluffy let's see if I've achieved
peacful oof I would say it looks pretty
fluffy similar similar to what she did
step one complete now I add my half cup
of a sukar
he says add a little bit at a time and
Mick
okay starting it looks like hers so I'm
not mad you can't really hook up butter
and sugar right okay we're gonna add our
salt and I'm gonna do exactly what she
did and now we're gonna slowly add in
two cups of regular white flour where's
the flour two cups of white flour can't
even get the damn thing open got it
don't want to have let it explode in my
face
I'm a little concern because it looks
very dry right now hopefully that's
right
oh thank god our buckets look the same
so what you're gonna do is grease your
pan this is a 9 by 13 shaped I forgot to
preheat the oven I came back hopefully
it won't take that long so she is
greasing up her pan got my pan here dump
all of this into the pan and press it
down
I put the butter packaging up against my
baking wear so that I don't have to get
greasy fingers getting fat on a Friday
don't know the words of the song hey
candy getting fed and your friends are
so I'm gonna just pack this down and
make a nice firm crust here they acted
beyond flammable under the sea
oh she's a goofball ah good give my rage
out here by the time I pack it down
hopefully my oven will be heated once
you got your dough already we're just
gonna put this in the oven for 20
minutes at 350 I got my crust done and
I'm gonna put this in the oven the onion
is on a 3 Funyun while all the stuffs
cooking for 20 minutes we will make the
filling
Alexa put a timer on for 20 minutes 20
minutes starting now
thanks girl and now I'm gonna take my
limos lemma yes that's the entire thing
into a bowl children at home if children
watch my show be careful don't zest off
your fingers
you like on MasterChef I'm ready
I wonder if spongebob like lemons I just
remember the villain every villain is
lemons one omens and now we're gonna
make some lemon juice 2/3 cup of lemon
juice okay
three and a half fresh lemons ohh
hopefully let's hope for the best oh
shoot she is a manual juicer I just had
my hand whoa she's really getting into
that I know okay I'm earning my my bars
I don't want it to get in my eye Oh Oh
my hands are dry Oh
oh it's burning against Magan that took
about five hours but all the lemons made
it into 2/3 of a cup I don't want my
hands are still on Daniel one cup of
sugar and half a cup of flour now I add
four eggs and then I put in my Limone
and my zest mixture I don't like this
noise I don't like this not a fan smells
good though smells real nice cool oh my
god I like sub thank you you can stop
okay Alexis stop oh okay just got this
out of the oven it looks very similar to
hers you see people in Great British
Bake Off do this all the time so I'm
gonna do it so you just pour it in okay
here we go
whirring that
and pop it into the oven for 20 more
minutes
Wow a little belly is that okay looking
good so now we just leave this to cool
and then she said put it in the fridge
okay I've been cutting these out it's
been 24 hours in the fridge and I
couldn't really make a wall look at the
same so some are gonna be fat
SpongeBob's and some are gonna be slim
for life spongebob so we're gonna try to
ice these bad boys here uh okay so we're
gonna start with the white icing to make
some eyeballs I'm gonna I guess I guess
it's okay okay this is what we've got
this is what we've got so far
mmm don't know if I'm making her proud
yet okay now we're gonna take our blue
cookie icing and make a little girly
part of his eyes they're gonna take pink
icing to make his cheeks just do a
little nose right next to me so I was
putting on the blue dots here and this
this one who looks terrified he's like
oh my god Candice what have you done to
me okay I'm now gonna be doing his
cheeks
I feel like this is the hardest part
here it is the eyelashes and the smile
with black once you go black you can't
go back in terms of icing Oh Fran
spongebob that's put on way too much
mascara
it's like spongebob from middle school
who didn't know how to use his makeup Oh
y'all Oh y'all I just put his teeth on
he's looking weak it's fudge right now
oh man this is not Rosanna's bulb this
is all my fault
okay I did it I did it you decide thank
you or are they not
I tried my best here and that's what's
been doing sugar and I'm licking my
fingers I tried my best and I think
that's what's important and I think
Rosanna would be proud of me from that
standpoint our tutorial was very easy to
follow I think I'm just weak
artistically and I can't draw anything
like what is this you know I think if I
keep trying
