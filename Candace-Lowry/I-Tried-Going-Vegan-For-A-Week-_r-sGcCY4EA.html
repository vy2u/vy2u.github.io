hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so this week I'm gonna be vegan I'm not
sure how I feel about that because being
born and raised in Dallas meat was a big
part of my livelihood I've never really
been a vegetarian I've never really even
been a pescetarian so I think that this
will be very interesting a lot of you
guys have probably heard of the
documentary of what the health that's
going around I watched about ten minutes
of it and then I got really nervous and
uncomfortable which I think that's what
it's supposed to do but you know it's
the food industry is really complicated
and scary sometimes and especially with
climate change and things like that you
know I think a lot of people are pushing
a plant-based diet and things like that
and you know I figure why not try it I
eat meat every day the one thing I do
make sure of is that all my meat is
usually free-range and organic because I
like to know that um my animals were at
least happy as being someone who has
recently gotten really heavily invested
in fitness
you know as you know chicken and rice
becomes like a livelihood so I'm
interested to see these protein options
that I can make I actually work for this
part of pop sugar called Glo shameless
plugs which is a lot of vegan recipes
and a lot of wellness and self-care
things that we do and I research these
things on a daily basis so I feel like
I'm pretty well-versed in veganism I've
just never really tried it myself I'm
really excited to see if I feel better
what's going on and a lot of you have
asked me to do this so here you go I'm
gonna do this for a full week and try to
see any struggles any positives that
come out of it and really kind of see
what's going on I think that vegans get
a really bad rap sometimes as being
super annoying
people I have read both sides of the
argument will see my energy how I feel
but yeah here we go
bye all right
first day of being vegan let's do this
all right y'all being vegan is expensive
like no wonder why so many rich people
do it nuts are very expensive per ounce
compared to chicken or any type of meat
and I'm slowly realizing that I just
bought vegan cheese made from almonds so
we'll see how that goes
I was checking out and I was like excuse
me how much is that sir
I can't afford that we'll see how it
goes I'm about to make some vegan pizza
watch The Bachelorette boo boo oh come
back with you come oh God I'll check
back in with you later
tonight's the Bachelorette finale and
here are my friends pizzas and here is
mine sorry
look at this cheese right now i way
overcooked my Aruba oh look at this
cheese isn't it neat No
oh one of those pepperonis so bad one of
my concerns however with cheese that's
vegan that's already packaged is that I
looked at the ingredients and it's just
a lot of binders and oil I mean I'm sure
that's no surprise but I think you know
when you make your own cheese at home it
at least has yeast and cashews or other
nuts and this just kind of seems like
oils and fat so I don't think it's
necessarily healthier than regular
cheese at all I'm about to make some
smoky tempeh
smoky tempeh strips I've already had a
few they kind of look like dog treats
but they taste pretty good then we're
gonna make a tofu scramble with some
veggies and then have some coffee the
secret to good tempeh bacon is to
slightly burn it because then you get
kind of that smoky bacon taste still
kind of taste like a dog tree though so
I attempted to make rainbow nice cream
that I saw on glow and I kind of messed
up because I got impatient and bought
the wrong type of coconut cream and it
kind of looks really weird but it tastes
really good here's one thing I learned
today that things that don't even have
dairy in them could be a derivative of
milk or it could be processed near milk
and it says caution derivative of dairy
or it'll say like may have traces of
dairy and I'm like what does that mean
did a cow sneeze on it what happened how
did we get here hey guys I'm going to
lunch I never realized how much I took
cheese for granted until today
like shout out to all the cows who let
me have their milk honestly I'm really
missing cheese anyway that's my leg
so there is for sure one thing I've
noticed which is that I haven't had as
many stomachaches I don't get as many
belly aches so I'm wondering if that is
the dairy not sure could be a placebo
effect but yeah okay everything I've
been looking at I'm sorry I got a
self-tan I'm very Brown so I was at work
today and they were doing some
marshmallow taste test and I was that
person and I was like are these vegan
and I totally thought they were and then
she's like oh they're actually
with beef gelatin and I was like hey
that does not sound appetizing to put
into a marshmallow guess who's back it's
me hi um I'm a little tan because I'm
about to go to Hawaii so I finished this
week I am happy to be eating meat again
I'm so sorry you guys I know that I
wanted to be like full vegan coming out
of this but it did change me in a few
ways I also realized that it's pretty
hard to have a lot of different protein
options as a vegan I know that some of
y'all are gonna say that that's not true
but for me it was very hard to find just
like grab and go protein things that
didn't have a lot of oils and chemicals
in them it was very interesting and I
did feel kind of like this shame having
to tell people that I was vegan or ask
for vegan options and felt like I was
being a burden to people I think that I
could probably be maybe a vegetarian or
a pescetarian but man I missed my fish I
didn't realize how many things I eat on
an everyday basis have meat or some sort
of animal products in them and I found
myself relying on fruits and eating a
lot of bread and carbs which I'm not
really that used to being in LA we do
have a ton of options because basically
everybody likes to say their being here
and it's the cool thing to be but in
places like Dallas where I'm from
there's really not that many like hip
vegan restaurants I just assumed that
everything vegan is healthy and that's
really not the case I mean Oreos are
vegan so I definitely do give props to
vegans
I did feel better a little bit but I
think I'm definitely gonna stick at
least to a vegetarian or pescetarian
diet here are my top takeaways
wait what are they Oh first of all it
was a little more expensive than I
thought
so much like a regular diet make your
food at home don't go out to eat b12
shots are not for me I don't do needles
so I'm gonna have to get my b12
elsewhere which means I'm gonna have to
eat something from an animal tofu is
your best friend my tummy hurt less
I hope you guys learn from this I hope
it helped you know definitely again if
you're gonna try to be a vegan try to do
it step by step and kind of ease into it
let me know what diet you guys want me
to try next I love that you love these
and always remember that I'm doing these
under a control environment even though
this isn't a crazy diet just know that
when we do things like in a minute
fasting or military diets people know
that we're going through these and our
trainers know and doctors that we have
so always remember those things if you
guys like this video give it a thumbs up
subscribe to me because that's what
youtubers always say and I'll see you
next time guys thank you so much for
watching all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
