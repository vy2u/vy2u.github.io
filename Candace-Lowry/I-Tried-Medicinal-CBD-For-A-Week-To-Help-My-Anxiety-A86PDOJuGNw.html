ha why does this happen to me every time
welcome back to my channel it's Candice
and I am currently about to go into a
West Side caregivers and so a lot of you
actually in a lot of different videos
have been asking for me to try CBD the
hard part for me was you know doing it
the right way without coming off as like
someone who's encouraging people to try
medicinal marijuana or they're not I'm
telling people they need to be smoking
or anything like that I've always wanted
to try CBD I hear so many great things
about it I will emphasize the fact that
I am in California I am over 21 so this
is all completely legal I think that
this will be a very fun experiment and
definitely a learning experiment just
for me and you guys always always
research where you're going I know that
the owner and the manager has been
studying this stuff for so long let's go
my name is Jesse we are at Westside
caregivers
you're a creatio property inclined
collective in Van Nuys California THC is
the cannabinoid in the cannabis that
gets you high while CBD is not
psychoactive there's many different
extraction methods and when you're
looking to extract CBD particularly you
want obviously a high CBD strain so
there's a CDC Harlequin specialist train
to think are specifically for high CBD
compared to THC so ratios are really
important they're discovering that
that's the that that's really where a
lot of the specific medicinal benefits
as far as curing certain ailments or
clearing certain diseases or for the
actual effects you're looking to you can
get with the ratio but the thing is
everyone's different it really has to do
with the desired effects in the person
themselves so for instance twenty to one
is kind of the bear like the line for
non psychoactive or psychoactive that's
20 milligrams of CBD to one milligram of
THC the more you go towards one to one
so if it's in 1801 fourteen to one
yeah the product is becoming more
psychoactive can a bit a knowledge is
CBD and THC they're actually catalysis
for each other so you can get a lot of
benefits from THC with a little CBD
where I rather than having none or vice
versa if you have CBD by itself it
actually won't be as beneficial as if
you introduced a little THC terrific so
for instance if you were dealing with
anxiety and depression 20 the one's
gonna be a great ratio because you're
not going to be getting high from the
THC but you are gonna be getting the
benefits of the cannabinoid with the
catalyst effect of the THC but all we
want to do is help people when you're
using cannabis cannabis is something
that you can use daily you can use
safely it's healthy and it's a very safe
way to eat either deal with an ailment
or help you get through that ailment my
phone is always on and I'm never not
working I get calls at 2:00 in the
morning someone's about to medicate
maybe it's their first time maybe
they're not sure if they're taking the
right amount and what they should be
taking doesn't matter we're always
available to our patients so that sets
us a step above definitely and we have
the best staff in the world fun friendly
shop
whoa and now getting into what you are
giving me I'm all of these products will
not get you high but they do have
incredible medicinal benefits as far as
medicating with it for a number of
ailments but I kind of put together a
little anti-depression kit whose IDs in
here this is Kara by designs 18 to one
ratio and we were talking about ratios
this just stepped over the line from 20
to 1 to 18 to 1 so there's a little bit
more THC in there to help with the
catalyst effect but these are incredibly
beneficial and these are just like any
other pill you takes if we take them
swallow them and with
thirty minutes to an hour you start to
feel the effects dolls twenty to one
tincture take one dropper to the tub
some lingual tea maybe throughout the
day around lunchtime take another one
and again at night EMU is a medium
that's used to get CBD into the skin to
get through all those layers your skin
requires a better medium to actually
carry the CBD through to whatever that
pain may be let's move on to vaping now
the two best obviously any different way
you would take cannabis of the longest
absorption rate it's going to be topical
the fastest is going to be to actually
smoke CBD because it goes right into
your capillary row Reserve is this is
their custom battery and their vape pen
it actually you have different levels so
you can have medium low and hot
temperature now let's move on to CBD
concentrates this here is a pure CBD
isolate this is a great great way to get
high doses of CBD into the body
this here is cents each you cents each
you has given more people quality of
sleep than I can even explain or take a
sixteenth of this which I'm going to
dose for you you're gonna have the best
night's sleep in life and here is your
tip again this comes in the weekend box
we're all day maybe very excited you
came through candies yay I'm excited
yeah yes I'm nervous yeah so I'm
lounging here about to get ready for bed
I am contemplating taking the spray
right now but even in the directions it
was like take only 15 minutes before bed
so I like really think that this is
gonna help me go to sleep
it's very hard for me to shut down at
night and not
turn off that part of my brain that just
keeps worrying I don't know why I'm
pissed so this is a mix of CVD and
melatonin all right uh-oh it says to
shake the bottle I didn't shake the
bottle it's it's weird so I just took
that CBD oil right well I turn on
Netflix and there's new episodes of the
Great British baking show and now I
can't watch it cuz I'm probably gonna be
asleep I fell asleep very quickly I did
not think that would happen it was nice
because it wasn't like you know if
you've ever taken
ambien or something like that you have
this weird feeling these weird anxieties
and this was kind of just like okay I'm
tired today is vapenation out to h3h3
and also I'm gonna try a topical patch I
am relatively sore from all the workouts
I've been doing humblebrag you put this
on it is a four-to-one CBD THC topical
patch and it's 96 hours today has just
not been a great day it's so frustrating
but it is it is true that it's hard to
talk to people about this and I think
that's why I wanted to share this part
of the video nobody's perfect and that
everybody has their own struggles but
part of the disappointment comes with
guilt of the fact that there is
literally nothing wrong there are good
days and bad days and sometimes you've
just gotta be upset for a little bit
well today I'm going to be trying CBD
through a gummy version and this little
thing has four servings in it you'll see
me struggling a lot with these packaging
because they make sure that they are
child safe and a lot of the times
they're also Kandice safe and here we go
does not taste as bad as the other one
tastes pretty good I just got done with
my workout into the shower and I'm gonna
try the tranquility tonight to see how
it tastes it's chamomile and lemon
myrtle with CBD
it smells pretty good smells like
regular tea it's not like whoa man it's
a weed this is what it looks like it's
just a little sexual with all the herbs
and spices in it
it tastes like tea it doesn't have any
weedy taste to it a little sweet but I
like it
I fell asleep pretty well it did take I
didn't really feel sleepy for at least
30 minutes I fell asleep
it was perfectly fine and I had some
crazy-ass dreams though so I don't know
if that was from that or if I'm just a
really weird person this is just a quick
update I've noticed a huge difference in
my focus at work and my ability to get
things done and you don't feel anything
it's not like you know that you're
taking something it's just kind of
helping you get your thoughts under
control who knew I'm about to head out
and I have this extract so today is
extract day just use one to one and a
half drops of this I found on my thumb I
don't know what to do now I just love it
doesn't taste like anything that's nice
I guess I go about my day now alright
hello everyone it's the end of the week
and I think that it actually helped I
think that this is a great alternative
for if you're just feeling a little bit
of anxiety it's kind of I know that this
sounds weird but if you've ever taken a
xanax and they kind of just shut off
that anxious part of your brain that's
basically what CBD was doing for me I
could feel the biggest difference with
the sublingual dropper and then with the
nighttime things I got some of the best
nights of sleep with the nighttime stuff
I think it gave me a new appreciation or
active of the cannabis industry
there's no absolutely I did not feel
high I did not feel out of it at all and
you know when you take some sort of
anti-anxiety pill medication you have
this come down which is really bad and
you feel foggy and you feel out of it
and there was absolutely none of that
you know I think that I would continue
to use some of these products obviously
not every day you really need to look up
your dispensary or whoever you're
talking to and know that they're gonna
give you something that really is gonna
help you and then they're not just there
to I hope this helped you guys let me
know if you guys have tried CBD before a
lot of you guys were asking about it so
I really hope that this helped just know
that I am here with you and this is a
constant ongoing battle and that you are
not alone if you like this video please
like if you want to subscribe go ahead
and do that let me know if you want me
to try any other products and I guess
we'll see you next time okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
