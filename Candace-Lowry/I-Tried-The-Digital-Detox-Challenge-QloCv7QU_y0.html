probably sounds like I've been drugged
but I'm just I don't know I'm just
really relaxed
hello everyone welcome back it's a
beautiful day this is hi
all right so recently at work I was
doing my little like trending report
thing you know looking at what's going
on across the internet and in the health
section I noticed that people were
trying what's called a digital detox and
I was like I gotta know what is this and
it's actually this organization that
puts on what's called like a digital
detox camp
however it's starts at seven hundred
dollars so your girl don't have seven
hundred dollars to spend on a weekend
without a screen I decided to go off of
their program as what they do and kind
of do it myself it's basically just
throwing your phone your computer your
TV anything with a screen out the window
for a weekend and you basically just
focus on yourself I realized I needed
just a weekend to escape the comments
escape TV escape news and just kind of
live in the moment which is actually
like kind of sad that I think about we
have to go through these digital detox
is to remember that there is a physical
world I will make an exception to have
my camera here but also I will have my
phone on me because hurricane Irma is
coming through and it is a place where
my close cousins live so I really just
needed to have that point of
communication on me in case something
did happen but you can trust me I will
not be doing anything I'm investing so
much in other people's lives almost more
than my own so says the youtuber right I
noticed that my mood has been changing a
lot you know I it's
it's a little a little more depressed I
guess a little more anxious when I'm
constantly looking at the news I'm
constantly looking at comments and I
don't know I feel like this would be a
good thing for my mental health as well
let's see I'm gonna read the rules to
you that they say I love how I'm also
looking at the digital detox rules on my
phone the rules are no digital
technology no networking
no phones internet or screen no work
talk which would be so nice no clocks no
boss no stress no anxiety and no FOMO
which is fear of missing out
you know meditation writing mindfulness
reading reflection and yoga so I'm gonna
try to do a little bit of yoga or
exercise and really meditate I'm gonna
spend this time to read write work on
some recipes brainstorm and just take in
this beautiful world that we have I
challenge you to do the same so see you
on the flipside guys bye so I'm staying
at this hotel you can see at the beach
over there it's very chill very relaxing
so hopefully I can be one with nature I
have my reading material um a little
more upscale than these you know but you
gotta have a good variety based on how
I'm feeling so I found this dog that's
experiencing nature I think we're having
a moment I wouldn't have noticed this if
I was looking at my phone but now I'm
having a moment with car dog so I went
to the beach today I'm still here as you
can see wow those waves are loud it
feels really nice it feels relaxing I'm
not worried about my email hmm choked
again I'm not worried about my emails
I'm not worried about you know things
happening
or what people are saying online or
anything like that and I think that it's
kind of alarming how used to just being
on my phone I am and I'm definitely
already seeing a big difference 24 hours
in in terms of you know my mood and just
observing and really being in the moment
and really being present I also found
the most perfect smoothest rock ever so
that's also I just woke up and I had a
really good night's sleep I had a really
solid night and that could be from no
screen time but we'll see I had some
crazy dreams though so that's weird I
just made it home back in LA and I'm
gonna ride my bike go to the farmers
market try to chill as I bike I don't
know we'll see
I'm noticed it's a lot harder to avoid
getting on my phone or my computer once
I'm back in LA because everything's like
so crazy here and you always want to see
what your friends are doing and things
like that so yeah Kona bike ride
so I'm sitting alone at a cafe right now
by myself eating a bagel cuz I'm awesome
and it does feel weird to not be looking
at my phone constantly but it's nice
because I'm really into people watching
right now and I feel like it seemed like
five famous people so I was
eavesdropping accidentally of course but
I forgot how much I enjoy listening to
other peoples conversation OTT not in
not in like a creepy way but in my gay
you know what's going on what are other
people's lives like baby rad with me
romantic
okay I also um I've realized that I have
a lot of random ask questions throughout
the day I guess I used Google a lot more
than I thought because this whole
freaking day I've been like who was the
guy in the original it
he played nigel thornbury he was the
original penny wise he was in clue
he was the really rude hotel manager and
home alone - I feel like Andy in episode
of the office where he's like break me I
have a visa that mmm-hmm I have full
sauce and I'm like who is it Tim Curry
that's who it is
I remember now oh my god yes I didn't
have to use Google all right now I just
have to figure out if parrots sweat
hey guys it is Monday morning I am
feeling a very zen
right now I feel really good and I think
that everybody needs to do this and I am
challenging you to do it let me know
please if you guys do I really think
that this is important for anybody's
mental health and it really kind of it
puts you back into your reality and your
physical world and I know that sounds
like really hippy dippy right now but I
didn't realize how much screen time was
hampering my creativity I really just
got comfortable with being with myself
and I've always had a problem being
alone and being comfortable being alone
and just being with me myself and I so
it really forced me to do that are the
biggest things I realized is that by
looking at my phone and looking at the
news as soon as I woke up that like
dictated my whole entire mood for the
day I know that I kind of had a hard
time being like shy take out all news
and all that you know but I think it was
worth it even just for a short time you
know it was good to get away from the
negativity and it was good to just be
with me and be with my friends and just
live in the present and be present I
really hope you guys like this video I
know I was like a little different but
it really helped I don't know I feel
very chill yeah if you guys liked this
video please give it a big thumbs up let
me know down below if you've tried this
before I would love to know or that if
you're going to try it

feel better and I think I should do this
