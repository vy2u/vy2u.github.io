what Oh feel that I'm coyote Peterson
basically all right what's episode no
just got a nasty Bowl so I hope I don't
have any stuff in my face what's up mom
about to do something possibly really
stupid but it's good of yous right I
recently saw a couple of special guests
at the GUP conference of Gwyneth Paltrow
when I say saw I mean I watched a
youtube video I had one of these
speakers was Miranda Kerr and she talked
about leech therapy leech therapy is
attaching little bleaches to your skin
to help with inflammation blood clots
acne anything like that so I'm like
should I try this obviously it was a yes
so because I'm terrified of all things
slimy squiggly and things that suck your
blood I made sure to do a little bit of
research and also find the lady who does
Miranda Kerr's leaching I'm very scared
right now I'm very nervous I look a
little grubby because like maximum grub
right now because I'm not supposed to be
wearing makeup during it and I was
supposed to drink a lot of water
beforehand I have adult acne that's very
hard to get rid of and it's very
annoying it's like why am I still having
acne at 25 years old
I don't know guys I don't know okay
all right I guess I guess I'll see you
in there
I'll take you in there all right let's
go guys
okay so my name is Ravina borovsky and I
am a clinical hypnotherapist I'm also
licensed vocational nurse and then to
collective work for 21 years since 1996
material therapy helps invited to
rejuvenate to take your information and
any information in the body and also the
blood thinning effect it also creates
before year after the treatment that
person will be in a lot of lymphatic
fluid which stimulates in your system to
produce new or abrasive side so there is
a boost for medication which is a
wonderful for reproductive system male
and female for infertility issues and
what they eat is very good waves
hypertension and injustice just be
younger to be moving for her more
beautiful skin also very good for
athletes very good for migraine
headaches any kind of headaches it does
in the beginning you feel like tingling
and then because Alisha's relief were
seen like substances in their body in
the cold body so the person doesn't feel
delicious disabused for medicinal
purposes
push it from the biopharm's where they
raise strictly according to the
standards they kept for four months for
currenty to process everything in their
body and then only allowed to be soaked
so lady the turkish buying Hungary which
is ready for work so I was in commented
with few issues and they change it will
first of always vary from the jawline
second of all we should get work another
which is improved in production of
collagen so the skin can be more like a
baby screaming slap in my face or head
no separate from our body plate maybe
one or two on your body and around
okay are you ready I'm ready I guess
okay sorry perfect
oh and I can show you like so this is
absolutely delicious
okay so so we've had a run attached you
felt that no but I can we see I mean
it's time to really buy tissue so it's
not going to happen right away so there
is nothing to really freak out okay I'm
sweating I'm scared being copped right
now Oh what feels like tiny little
suction okay okay don't you love did you
see you right away she run there what I
will leech on me right now
oh it feels like a little like I can
feel it's like little teeth almost oh
god here goes another one what to say
God what what is happening oh I feel
that oh it's very beneficial just cool
it was another one
oh there girls big eul's and they
sometimes moody sometimes they mostly no
long time these girls are moody know you
feel that whole feel that little girls
suck in my blood it's almost like
tingling all over my face like I could
feel it's kind of pulling down a little
bit I feel like I got a facelift
do they like each other or no oh yeah
they probably they cuddle
Hey oh ho ho super machine presents
better that's it from the yeah I'm the
kid thanks little wasting uh i impact
not bad and look it looks a lot worse
with it it got a nice little pat on I
think I'm looking good yeah alright can
we just talk about how it actually looks
like I've been shot I'm going to be
releasing this throughout the evening so
I guess I'm just gonna have to eat some
popcorn and watch Netflix
oh well alright it's the morning after
please look at my chicory all right I
just took all the dressings off it's
8:30 in the morning
so total bleeding time was about 10
hours I needed to sit lay low and change
these dressings but I'm feeling good I
don't know we'll see
it is currently day four five
it is currently day five and I must say
I have seen a change in my skin I'm
going to put a little picture of my skin
at the beginning like right here the
redness has gone down the new pimples
has definitely gone down like I don't
want to say that it works but it's been
really helping me I still have some
marks you know but to me the biggest
change I've been seeing is my skin each
leach was on me they were on my stomach
for about 40 minutes they were on my
face for about 20 you will be bleeding
for hours and I do not recommend this to
people who can't handle a lot of blood
although it's not solely blood coming
out of you
a lot of fluids and just red and it
looks like you're dying and you're not
I felt really tired that evening I had
no idea that this would be as big of a
deal as it was I was very surprised at
how calm I was if they're very soothing
and calming and the people who give you
these leeches are very connected to
these parasites I know that sounds so
weird but it's true would I recommend
doing this if you have the money if you
have tried a lot of skin care options if
you are very holistic and if you're okay
with blood that's okay
yeah so um also you can choose to take
them home if you like otherwise they're
like released but I really hope that
this was informative I really wanted to
have an open mind with all of this I was
very skeptical going in and I think it's
something you know worth trying if you
guys liked this video please give it a
big thumbs up subscribe because I'm
going to be making a lot more content
like this if I grossed you out I'm sorry
I gave you a warning at the beginning of
the video so you can't get mad at me
comment down below what you'd like to
see me try next and I'll see if I'll do
it
I don't know but alright guys thank you
so much for watching okay see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
