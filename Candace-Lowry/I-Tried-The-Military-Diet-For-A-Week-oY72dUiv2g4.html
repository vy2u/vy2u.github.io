eat - hello everybody and welcome back
to my channel I'm wearing some happy
lipstick because what we're about to get
into is going to be miserable so a lot
of you guys have asked me to try the
military diet I had never heard of this
before and I thought military diet that
sounds cool that sounds great I feel
like if it's something that people in
the army do it should be safe boy was I
wrong it's only called the military diet
because only the strong survive
you might be thinking three days is dumb
I could do three days so easily a lot
can happen when you're hungry guys and I
get hangry and after looking at this the
three days look a little scary so each
day will go from 1,300 calories to 1,200
calories to a 1,100 calories and then
you have four days of a 1,500 calorie
diet plan so that's pretty simple but
the goal of this diet is to lose up to
10 pounds in seven days which sounds
totally sustainable oh God but I mean
I'm amped to try it just because I want
to see what this is all about the days
are very strange a diet has a lot of
tuna bread coffee and ice cream and eggs
so I mean in terms of how much you have
to pay for to get this diet it's pretty
simple foods that I feel like are very
easy to find you know I've never really
had a cup of ice cream in two hotdogs
with no bun as a meal but we'll see no
need for strenuous exercise or expensive
pills
a pills what like this diet though the
people that fail on the military diet
simply don't have the drive and
determination to do what they can
that's like kind of rude this is
bullying people into a diet enough man
alright military diet up coming for you
and I'm going to get you I am coming
home from work not driving I am about to
leave work right now and I'm just gonna
say my head is killing me I don't know
if it's that I'm kind of doing a detox
of sugar I don't know what it is but I'm
starving and I can't wait to have my cup
of ice cream so I'm ready for that it
was a struggle I feel really tired
my head hurts and I'm irritable
I'm military diets come in so rude right
now I got my medium a rare steak and a
cup of green beans and I still get an
apple half a banana and a cup of ice
cream so I'm feeling better now
all right here is breakfast day - we've
got one slice of toast one egg and a
banana and I gotta get my cup of coffee
is this this right now
what is that all right it is day two I
just set my breakfast I'm feeling pretty
good
I'd actually filled me up a bit but my
lunch today is a cup of cottage cheese
an egg and five saltines so we'll see
how that goes
steak you of a military diet kind of
milder done and this is what I would
stare at all day
drop my broccoli hehe well here's my
monster okay we need a jr. meal here's
my boyfriend's me although so good I
can't have it your bed did look better
though like your veggies predators mine
out about the hot dogs
well yeah they do but that looks like
jambalaya roll
how you open up Oh gravely now I watch
cap to announcer are you forcing me to
eat a coconut
on my last day cos it's the last day
laughing left alright this is day three
I'm about to head home to eat dinner
I'm very lightheaded today this is the
final day in you eat less and less each
day so today I think I'll clock in at
around eleven hundred calories just to
put it in perspective
my basal metabolic rate is about 1,700
calories so I'm very hungry I'm very
irritated
and I'm just tired I'm so lethargic
right now
this is stupid as I'm about to devour my
final meal I've learned there's nothing
more delicious than ice cream and tuna
whoo why haven't we thought about this
before the Victoria's Secret diet has
nothing on this and don't call me a baby
until you've tried this my mood I could
cut a bitch right now y'all I feel like
such an old person because I just hit
oatmeal for the first time of it and I
am so happy and I'm so happy this is
over plus up I love food
hi everyone it is a beautiful day
because I am NOT on a diet and I'm so
excited you guys look I get that the
hardest part was only three days and
then the four days are just kind of like
regular diet self-talk it was not fun I
do not recommend this to anybody I don't
care how skinny you want to get how fast
it was weird my dinners were bizarre it
was a combination of meat and ice cream
which sounds good
but during the day you're limited to
like one slice of bread and one egg and
I know that there will be people in the
comments that are like you just ate more
than I eat in a day and I can't believe
in being a baby
it was hard okay it was really hard and
I just feel like the nutrition was all
over the place and weird and wonky and
it was like you know in the morning it
was very car behaving and then you know
protein heavy but there was rarely you
know a balance of vegetables and fruit
and you know I was so surprised that the
lunches were like a slice of bread and
tuna and not something that involved a
lot of nutrients it was very strange and
I found myself getting like emotional
about things I slept really poorly I
just didn't feel good and my head hurt
all the time that might have been from
the detox of sugar but it was also very
strange that you're drinking so much
coffee on so little calories so I felt
very hyper all the time I felt like the
world was going to end and it was like
super anxious did I lose weight yeah I
mean a couple pounds but the problem
with diets like this is that you're so
restrictive
and you can't have certain things so
when you're off of it all you want is
the thing you couldn't have so then your
weight just goes back up again you know
what I recommend this for no you know I
wouldn't recommend it I would rather
just you know count my calories and eat
a ton of vegetables and a low-fat diet
that's the secret I was tired all the
time
and by the third day when you're at
1,100 calories is your total as your
total and I'm used to 1,800 calories as
my total it's exhausting you're tired
and you don't want to exercise let me
know what what you want me to go through
mix something in Pippa Middleton's diet
or Beyonce I don't know um yeah let me
know you guys and I hope this helped I
hope it's shed light on what this diet
is like it makes sure to LIKE this video

interesting and subscribed because I'm
going to have a lot more diet content
