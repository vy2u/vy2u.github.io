god um you're probably wondering why I'm
talking to you from my car today and
that's because I'm right outside this
place called shape house it is
essentially going off of old sweat
lodges but it's a safer better way of
doing it I guess and my friends have
always done this and I've always been a
little scared because you're in this
tight little cocoon and you're sweating
you're sweating out everything and it's
a hundred and seventy degrees in there
and you're in there for 50 to 55 minutes
I've heard about all the benefits you
can have from this which are you sleep
really well you detox you can lose
weight and you kind of get rid of stress
and I have all those things right now
mostly I've just been feeling really
under the weather really sick I want to
see if this actually helps okay so I'm
backing up rude I took measurements of
my body to see if you do see any weight
loss because I think that a lot of
people say they just go to sweat or they
do a rap which will make them skinny and
I kind of want to show that that's
really not necessarily the case
essentially I'll be going in there drink
a lot of water beforehand and wrap up in
170 degree burrito cook myself from the
inside out and then come out feeling
better hopefully
I feel really worried sometimes because
they seem not unsafe but you're in a
situation where your heart is racing
you're sweating you're in a place that
could be potentially harmful if you have
something like you know it's of asthma
heart problems pregnancy anything like
that so
just just as a forewarning if any of
y'all are thinking about doing this make
sure you are an adult or you have adult
supervision but this isn't like some
sort of like janky place out in the
middle of nowhere it's a nice place I
just want to make sure you know everyone
knows the precautions are going into
something like this so let's get sweaty
let's get sweaty
y'all holy moly that that was a little
intense
at first I was like this is nice I feel
like I'll Chipotle burrito or some queso
on me I'm doing pretty well and then
like 30 minutes in for the last 20
minutes I was like this is it's getting
pretty hot I got out and it was just
like you just opened a tomb that I had
been in for like years and it was just
like I was worried because I was pretty
light-headed at first and that made me a
little nervous but as soon as you're
done they kind of snuck me into this
little room that was all red it's all
red and I got some orange slices and
some tea and I actually didn't cough at
all when I was in the sweat bit sweat
bad when I was in the sweat bed and I
had some relief from my cramps
that's probably expected cuz it was nice
and warm but I feel very relaxed very
zen we'll see how I feel later tonight
hi everyone
alright it's the next morning so I don't
have any makeup on I like literally just
before we get any further in this video
I want to thank Squarespace for
sponsoring this video it's a great place

great place to host your resume or your
portfolio or actually even a store and

slash Candace and that'll be all waiting
for you so I couldn't really talk in the
space because we were divided up into
like micro rooms within a giant room and
it was separated by a sheet I was just I
didn't realize that I would be in full
clothes
so I was in head-to-toe clothes from
them with socks and they zipped me up
and they are like good luck we'll see
you in 20 minutes I was like oh my god
what have I done
so the first 10 minutes I was feeling
pretty good I was like hey I'm warm I'm
like a cuddly little koala in a pouch
right now they came in and they finally
gave me this like cool towel and it
smelled so good like lavender and she
pressed it on and had it on me and it
felt really nice and then I was like
okay I just got to make it this last 10
to 15 minutes Candice and I kind of was
like I should get cold air under be like
but in the end I made it so I did sleep
very well I didn't wake up in the middle
of the night I almost out slept my alarm
but I've woken up and I'm feeling better
I don't know if it's the medication or
the sweat but I'm also just feeling like
detoxing cleansed my cramps aren't
nearly as bad but I just did the
measurements again it's like little to
no difference I think there was like a
quarter of an inch different I know that
you know a lot of like wraps and things
like that
promise that you're gonna lose a lot of
weight quickly and most of the time
obviously it is water weight don't feel
like you need to be going to these sweat
places to lose weight fast or do
anything like that do you last ten
minutes of that was really really hard
and you your heart starts racing your
heart starts beating pretty quickly and
you kind of have to like play this
mental game of being chill being like
people are doing this I'm okay
everything's okay quick rundown candy
verdict is the sweat lodge experience is
great if you just want a detox you've
had a crazy weekend I don't know I'm not
gonna judge you I don't know what you do
or you're just kind of trying to
recharge and feel better but now I just
wanted to pull a burrito
cuz I was in that burrito the whole time
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I know it was like kind of a
bummer that I couldn't really talk in
the shape house place but I didn't want
to disturb people and I didn't want
people to be like is she talking to
herself in the bathroom my video of
choice was the Lady Gaga documentary I
actually really enjoyed it so I'm really
sad but it kept my mind off of the fact
that I was sweating my ass off but yeah
please like this video subscribe well we
know you guys want to see next let me
know if you tried something like a sweat
lodge or those wraps I don't know
sometimes these get fit quick things are
a little crazy but thank you so much
guys love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
