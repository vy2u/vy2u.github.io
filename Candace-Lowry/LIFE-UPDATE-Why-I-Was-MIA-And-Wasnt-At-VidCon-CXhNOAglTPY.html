and I could say that like I got any huge
fight with another youtuber and we've
had so much drama together and it's
unbelievable and I'm going to make a
diss track and then they're gonna make a
diss track and I'm going to get so many
subscribers but I'm too old the Lord it
has been a for you weeks it is been a
minute since I've seen you guys I am so
sorry I have just been all over the
place
I felt like before I release a new video
even though it's been like a week and a
half of a two weeks like calm down
Candice it's not like you've been on a
life journey for like three months but I
just wanted to explain why I've been a
little m.i.a I've kind of been you know
not releasing videos frequently as usual
and the fact that I would have been
conned so how do you guys but okay so as
you guys know I have a full-time job and
I work at pop sugar which is great but
over the past few weeks I've been having
my yearly review which is like very
scary
but I'm still employed and if it will
I'm happy about that but I also have a
great new show that we've been working
on and it's called poor decisions and we
have a little drink with some friends of
mine including soft and Shannon beverage
and Kingsley and Gabby and Alison and
all these really cool people and we just
get real and we talk about you know
certain problems a lot of stuff this
month has been LGBTQ Qi you know LGBTQ
for education content and we just isn't
advice show and we have fun and I'll
give you like a little link I you always
have see like a little eye with a circle
around it like up here and we're all put
what is called poor decisions and it's
super awesome and it's on PopSugar Girls
Guide so I've been working on that and
getting all that stuff done and then I
decided to dye my hair purple here's it
looks like it's a little fluffy I'm
going to show you a picture because um
this is what it currently looks like
because I just woke up a few minutes ago
but um I took four hours to four hours
to dye my hair purple I went to a
wedding with my boyfriend and that was a
long vacation that we took and then I
had my mom in town and my cousin and my
aunt and they were in town during VidCon
so they were in town like all the way to
that Wednesday through Sunday so I
couldn't see you guys but you know I got
to show my mom West Hollywood I got to
show her that life she wants to see
where all of her favorite reality TV
shows are made but I just wanted to give
you guys a quick life update and tell
you that I'm still here and I have so
many cool videos coming out this week we
have something with Jordan if you
remember her from BuzzFeed if we have
some stuff with her I don't know one
thing we like me it's just me you're
like I'm just in my room um and then my
military guy videos going out this week
so I'm going to try to get a lot out
this week and then continue to my once a
week video schedule and just want to
give you guys a life update and I've
never done this before
I've just been reorganizing with work
and making sure that you know I didn't
want to get fired I like my job and
working on this new show poor decision
so I'll put the link below don't worry
I'm not being paid to say that
well let me I guess I technically am
because I worked there but wasn't I
going to add that whatever um and then
I've just been really grumpy to those on
my military diet but yeah there's a lot
of good stuff coming thank you guys for
being so patient
um you guys are awesome and I'd really
love to know what you guys want to see
in more videos it was really cool to see
you all of the food swap videos because
a lot of you asked for more weight loss
and healthy eating tips so I want to
make sure that I'm giving you all the
content you guys want but as you kiss it
