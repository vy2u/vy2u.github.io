eyes with a baby wipe you might have
heard of them from an artisan store
called the CVS but I wipe them down just
to get a really clean palate on my eyes
the grub is off and we are ready to get
started to stream my hair I use the
vanity planet flow straightening brush
because I'm lazy and I want to brush and
stream layer at the same time it looked
pretty cool this is what it looks like
it heats up to 370 makes my hair nice
and straight it has a swivel cord so I
travel with it a lot yeah you can
actually grab one below for 50% off so
you're welcome
so vanity planet actually reached out to
me to promote this and I actually really
like it and I wouldn't promo this if I
didn't find it to work so grab one try
one let me know what you think so I get
to straining my hair every morning it's
just so hot I sweat at night and my hair
curls back up so I'm able to kind of
brush my hair and straighten it as I go
also because my hair is color treated
I'm very specific about the types of
stringers I use and I don't want to
further damage my hair so I like this
one just because it has those smooth
blades on it and I'm not I'm burning my
hair into a million degrees so once my
hair is presentable I grab my arresting
Beach face bag pretty clever
so I use this HD makeup forever
serum that some lady at Sephora made me
buy basically like a moisturizing primer
I guess okay so then I apply it like all
those girls on YouTube and then make a
funny face for a good thumbnail rubbing
that in and getting more
ready for my foundation I would be using
my custom makeup but I'm a little tanner
because of the summer so I have the
Maybelline fit me matte foundation I'm
going to put on and I also use this
super fancy brush which I got for
Christmas which makes me feel like a
real makeup maven it's also very squishy
and soft so I enjoy it I'm then using my
concealer with CC cream from it
cosmetics and it's very important that
you use your ring finger to apply it I
use I remember this tip from an old
Michelle Phan video so I just apply that
with a finger I'm not fancy I don't have
any special brushes remember I am NOT a
makeup artist I have a bachelor's degree
from a liberal arts school in film so I
know really nothing special about makeup
I just enjoy it
alright looking less tired okay so then
I'm just going to put on a little bit of
powder that I use which is also makeup
forever and it's the pro finish powder I
actually really liked it it has a good
mat I hold on I can't open it
okay anyways so it has a nice matte
finish to it I really like it I'm just
using this brush that I really honestly
been using for a long time I just like
it it gives me full coverage my mom gave
it to me I really like it so I'm just
going to add all of this powder on my
saw next up I'm a little reluctant to
save it I'm using a tightly Jenner
highlighter this one's a little dark so
I kind of like to use it as a bronzer
on my face but the colors just really
good so I'm going to put
that on give myself a little high
cheekbone action now I'm just going to
add a little dollop of blush because I
don't know
makes me look happy makes me look alive
so we're just going to put a little bit
on each cheek and then we're going to
move on to up okay a lot of people have
been asking me about this and everything
what kind of eye makeup I use and it is
the modern renaissance palette by
Anastasia Beverly Hills it is the best I
got it for a birthday present and it is
absolutely wonderful so I start off my
base color with using a little mix of
two colors and then I just apply it to
basically my whole lid for an all-over
base I really like this because I barely
tapped on the eyeshadow and I get so
much color so it's really good because
it'll last a really long time I did go
in and add a darker shade into my crease
line and I really like this red that
they have and I put that into my crease
line and I guess that's how you do it
because that's how I saw it on Instagram
from a girl that I really like who does
makeup I think go in and blend it all
out just so I don't look like a crazy
person who really doesn't know how to do
my makeup and then if I'm feeling a
little extra sassy that day I'll grab
some of that red and put it on my lower
lash line looking good so far ladies and
gentlemen and now we're moving on to
this Physicians Formula liquid eyeliner
that I like swear by it has pheromones
that apparently make you smell sexy to
people I don't know if that's true I
just thought it because it had a really
good applicator
I'm going to create my cat I I have been
doing this for about five years now so I
would say I'm a seasoned hat iron you
got to make sure you got to take your
break after you've drawn the initial
line and then you go back in like a
champ and I do an initial line I connect
them and then I fill them in everybody
has like their own way of doing it but I
found that this is kind of the perfect
way for me to get that cat eye now that
your anxiety has reached peak levels you
got to go in and do the second one and
it's harder to take a break and relax
because you got to make it perfect like
even and make it look as good as the
initial one I would say this one this
one's looking pretty good I like it you
know pretty even you'd have to really
look close to see how uneven is it I
didn't go in and curl my lashes
sometimes I'll heat up my eyelash curler
to make the eyelashes really stay curled
but you know that's always optional I
can just use the Maybelline Great Lash
mascara I actually really like it and I
swear by it I'm going to try to do like
a little Instagram yeah no I'm not fit
to this so I apply the mascara to the
top and bottom lashes and then we're
we're really almost done you know I got
to do a couple glamour shots I got to
show off my work for the day so you
could see it all in all honesty I really
don't do much to my brows I just kind of
put a little gel on a brush and brush
them out I wish I could say I did
something cool but they're already
already pretty bold in the first place
so I just I let them do their own thing
I'm then going to apply the G Ella
custom lipstick that I got I've really
been enjoying this and I have a really
good creamy finish
and it's that too too bold so I'm just
going to quickly put that on and then I
think we're done all right guys as you
can see this is my final look a lot of
you guys were asking about what I wear
for makeup and kind of what my eyeshadow
is and now you have my secret I really
hope you liked it a little different
than what I normally do but a lot of you
guys were asking about an everyday
makeup routine so if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up don't forget
to a subscribe because I'm going to be
here for awhile and I guess I'll see you
next time
all right guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
