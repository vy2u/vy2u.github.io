didn't have liquid glue they only have
these glue sticks and the main part of
the face mask is glue go on that same is
just going to work or like it's good for
you I just saw it and it looked cool so
we're going to melt down these glue
sticks and then color them and it's
pulling a little aloe vera cuz I get the
best light good for your skin even
clothes good for you
even though we're putting clothes on and
then you just peel it off yeah okay it
is acid free let's go oh there we go
okay so we're going to do some of those
big melt them down add some coloring add
I guess a facial serum and then a little
bit of aloe vera and then we're gonna
paint our faces Oh see you boom there we
go there's our glue it looks like
mozzarella oh my god we did it

consistory and now it's getting sawed it
again this is why you use liquid Elmer's
glue oh hi this is why I don't do DIYs

okay I all want me to note that I'm
using some eye makeup brushes I make up
my might be on there
I don't smoke someone peed in his line I
have a stream of feel really homesick
what's getting in and out guys like oh
there's no way this is good maybe we
should have painted each other's faces
oh oh yeah
first a little better it feels good like
I kind of feel like a magic ball right
now it does feel like a spa experience
it kind of looks like baby doing on your
baby so now we're going to go rinse this
off go get another color moving on the
color too
Ballu Chrissy I feel like I'm getting
ready for war I'm getting ready for war

regular lawn knife I look good
red oh I'm loving this I'm living for
right now I look nothing like the girl
who did this on YouTube she was like

definite looks like slime from a
Nickelodeon and a nice color green

starting to come together
