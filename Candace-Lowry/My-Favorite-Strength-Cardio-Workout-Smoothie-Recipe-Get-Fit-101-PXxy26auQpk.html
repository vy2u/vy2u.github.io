to work out say well well hi everyone
welcome back to my channel thanks for
joining
I got a lot of questions asking for
another workout or a workout that's a
little bit harder or one that I do and
my famous protein smoothie so I'm going
to give you all of that today this
workout is something I'm currently doing
I do this one once a week and I do a
little bit of variations of it two more
times a week and it is to participate
everywhere it is to strength circuits
which you do four times so there's three
moves in each circuit it's a little hard
you guys it's a little hard it's hard
for me but this was given to me by my
trainer you do those circuits and then
you move on to about a 25-minute run
cardio burst whatever it's instead of a
steady-state cardio
it's more of an interval and I'm going
to show you little tips and tricks on
how to do the moves correctly without
hurting yourself because I don't really
want any lawsuits on me I really want to
help you guys and I hope that you guys
can make it through and do this workout
with me this workout does include some
equipment but I will give you kind of
some pointers if you need to do
something a little bit less intensive or
I mean if you want to go more intensive
cool hmm
but I shot myself at the gym and it's
it's like kind of creepy because there
are some people behind me so just be
prepared for that but let's see if you
guys can do it let's do it together and
be sure to stretch please get some
stretches on I'll provide you in the
description below some stretches that I
do as well
oh here we go here we go one time
Bugsy's kneeling but oh my god you could
I just went down to my apartments gym to
try to do some reshoots of proper form
and I went in with like all my equipment
and my camera it was like a sea of old
Korean people doing yoga and I
interrupted their flow so I'm gonna have
to do my uh my representations and
instructions in my room so please don't
judge me for that I didn't want to throw
off old people's grooves okay alright
everyone get your spongebob socks on and
slip them into any flat shoe you have I
like the Nike metcon - got them on sale
now the equipment you'll need is a 30
inch box a 12 pound ball and a 20 pound
straight bar the first move is a squat
to push press with your straight bar and
what you're going to do is go down into
a squat and with that momentum coming up
push it straight up in the air and bring
it back down you can go at any pace on
this just make sure your knees aren't
coming past your toes so here's a little
visual representation I did of it you're
going to come forward and push your bar
up and come forward and push your bar up
just pretend that your butt is scraping
against a wall like in that last video
and just push up and you're going to do
this 20 times people the next exercise
is lateral ball slams you're going to
grab that ball and throw it from side to
side almost hitting your toe basically
so in this exercise you essentially want
to grab the ball and bring it all the
way up with straight arms and throw it
back down and go the other way and
you're going to do this 20 times the
next exercise is just your classic box
jumps do 20 of these and make sure
you're landing on that box with your
full flat foot so that you can stretch
out those hips
now that you've just done four rounds of
possibly one layer of hell we're going
to go on to another one obviously so
keep that straight bar grab a kettlebell
and grab a yoga ball because we're going
to be getting into those the first
exercise will be just a simple barbell
squat so get that straight bar I went up
from 20 pounds to 30 or you can just
stick with 20 and we're just going to go
ahead and do some squats 20 times feel
it burn you guys now this one was a
little hard to show but what I'm doing
is a pike to a push-up with a yoga ball
so you do a Pike by thrusting your hips
up and then go down into a push-up I'm
showing you here on a chair just so you
can see the movement that you need to do
so you're going to pull your hips up and
it'll bring the ball towards you and
then press down and repeat this 20 times
now we're going to get into kettlebell
swings please do not do these if you've
never done them before and you're
uncomfortable as you can see it's a
little scary and you don't want to break
windows so what you would do here is
bring back the ball a little bit drop
your hips pull it towards you and with
the momentum momentum momentum of your
hips you're going to pull it forward and
bring it back and swing 20 times as well
oh look we're not done we have the
treadmill of death here so thank you
cardio what I usually do with intervals
so I'll do seven miles per hour and then
I'll go to 6 miles per hour with a 4%
incline and we're going to do this for
about 20 minutes and you're an interval
back and forth and so I'm going to put
in the time and go ahead and put in my
weight LOL jk not showing you my weight
good make sure you have some water with
you as well and now I just put my
to my happy place and try to get through
this 20 minutes of help alright guys
just got that workout in as you can see
I'm dead but I I want to show you the
kind of protein shake I make in my
favorite protein smoothie it's pretty
easy
so get your notepads out alright this
totally looks like an ad by the way I
put things out but like I wanted to be
cute so here's what I do for my smoothie
I do 1 cup of almond milk 1 cup of blue
frozen a tablespoon of PB Fit powdered
peanut butter which you can find out at
Costco for a really good price
all these half of rows in banana to get
it a little creamy a like serving of
your favorite protein powder this one is
a leftover designer whey I have it was
on sale I usually use the Trader Joe's
one it's pretty cheap and then a
tablespoon of cacao powder and you blend
it all up and it's pretty hewed right so
in goes my powder and part of the reason
why I use frozen blueberries and frozen
produce is to just kind of eliminate the
need for ice it makes it a little
creamier rather than having all these
like chunks of ice in your mouth so I
put all of the wet ingredients and the
frozen stuff in first and then I put in
my powder and just um blend away
all right and that's how it's done
that's how you make the world famous
Candace after workout protein smoothie
