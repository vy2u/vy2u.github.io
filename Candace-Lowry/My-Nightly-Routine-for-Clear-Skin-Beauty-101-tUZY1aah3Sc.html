like a hardcore made-out with a clown
everyone welcome that oh it's a little
echoey yo I'm sorry about that I'm in my
bathroom right now because I think it
would be weird to wash my face in my
bedroom but I wanted to show you guys my
daily skin routine for clear skin Anna
pretty cool but you still do have seeing
problems as an adult you know on top of
like the acne you get like the wrinkle
the dry skin in but it's awesome if you
know how to take care of your skin right
on shoot days I'm a little you know I am
a little tired looking a little tired
I'll commit to it so I use this like
thing from vanity planet it is a like
core version over Clarisonic basically
and it looks like very old
it looks very advanced in terms of its
technology like it looks like it's
straight out of a sci-fi movie and it
looks very rich but it comes with three
brushes I really like because I have
very sensitive skin so that is real soft
one that I picked it's like okay they're
difficult use and actually a brush heads
come off very easily
just remember to wash these bad boys
every time you're done with them because
they can get some stank it also comes
with a rougher head
that sounds very inappropriate it comes
with a rougher brush head that you can
just pop right on I'll use this one
occasionally like it's like buffing out
at car oh so don't get it like near your
hairline really close because it sucked
up some my baby hairs so but that's just
me being reckless so you can take this
mop and then I really like
rubbery one it like goes against the
grain a little bit you can pop this on
it like looks like an old man's short
hair it feels really good it's really
good at deep cleaning yourself you're
that speck of polish I use this every
night because I'm lazy and I want
something that clay my skin for me so I
really like it and it's like a more
affordable version of Clarisonic and I
actually have a link in the description
below for like 70% off which is insane
which is basically like 40 bucks for
this thing so be sure to check that out
I want to know what you think as well
especially if you're like a Clarisonic
user because I really like this and you
just pop batteries in instead of having
to charge it all the time I guess I'll
show you what I do right now for me a
lot of people like to remove their
makeup first but you know I sue me to me
in the comments so I put on this ninja
hat I'm just kidding I put on this thing
to keep my hair back I've gotten that
like TJ Maxx for like a dollar they all
do the same thing when you like pull my
elf ears out make sure they're exposed
and then grandma panda Carol and I just
begin to apply face wash my face i use
Neutrogena face wash it's very soft on
my skin and it is very mild cleanser
which I really like because again like I
do up sensitive skin and if you're out
there with those sensitive skins let me
know alright well let's get started and
look at myself in the mirror give myself
a little pep talk I kind hi it's Mark is
beautiful and then a little part of me
is like why did you put on all this make
and now you have to spend 30 minutes
taking it off but it finds one let's get
started do all this pretty alright out
this is where I have that fear so I
either close and so on behind me is
going to murder me
alright so look I have a secret
ingredient here
it's called coconut oil and it takes
your makeup off like a freaking champ
you don't need any fancy stuff you know
you don't need to be blindsided by
brands and all that stuff you really
just need good old-fashioned cocoa nut
and it actually works wonders for other
things but I kind of don't do look like
that snapchat filter of that girl crying
in the rain if you guys know what I'm
talking about I mean this works really
well you can see the difference here and
this is not an ad for coconut oil I just
really enjoy it and I don't think you
should waste money on fancy makeup
removal products but that's just me I'm
not a beauty guru comes idiot aside and
then we'll move on to my mask now I
don't wear a mask every night do not
wear a mask every night makeup free I
use this shield
Oh got some fake lashes suck on it
I can clear this keel rare-earth deep
pore cleansing which is basically the if
you seen that intense power and clay
mask it's kind of a step below that or
if you have your Caden skin or anything
like that but it just sucks out I was a
really gross noise it just sucks up all
that dirt and really makes me feel
better about myself now I apply this
with my hands because I'm not fancy like
those bloggers who like want to dirty up
another brush
I just want to have clear skin I look
straight out of the sleepover scene in a
90s movies now we wait for to dry suck
up everything from my skin all right I'm
going to wash this off now with some
warm water and hopefully your reveal
some glowing skin ahh so we're feeling
the faux rash you guys we're feeling
good
the final step here is really just some
under eye cream because you really need
to start doing this in your 20s I know
it makes it makes you seem like a really
old person but I apply anyway I put just
a little any eye cream really you can
use I put a little under my eyes I just
do this at night and you might see my
skin getting a little red sometimes it
go get irritated if I've been wearing
off makeup that day and then what I use
is this jela day and night serum I
really like it because it has the right
amount of glycolic acid just for me and
you should really kind of pay attention
to that and what level your skin is okay
using because it can be an alternative
so like you cover mitt mmm
I like it a lot and you can just massage
this into your face I go out just
because I heard an urban myth on
Pinterest that that helps reduce
wrinkles but I don't know I do have one
pimple though I'm sorry hormonal I just
show how real I am you guys so this is
typically my nightly routine on big
shoot night alright everyone it's the
next morning I figured that I should
show my skin in daylight after I've been
scrubbing and it's had time to relax
overnight and
I just want to recap that I'll use my
little scrubby system from Vandy planet
every night coconut oil from the grocery
store
Nigella serum with the right light
glycolic acid and once a week all use a
mud mask and I like to keels mud mask so
let me know what you guys think in the
comments what are your favorite skincare
products I'm always on the lookout you
know when you get to be a certain age
you realize skincare is actually very
important and you shouldn't sleep in
your makeup and then you question all
those decisions you made but it's okay
yeah you guys oh also let me know what
your stance is on on washing your face
one time a day or two times a day
because I feel like that's a hot topic I
was told by our dermatologists that I
only needed to wash my face once but a
lot of people say twice I don't know let
me know be sure to LIKE and subscribe
for my channel like this video if you
didn't like it I'm sorry I wish I could
help but I hope you enjoyed it it is a
little different than a typical like
beauty routine I just wanted to be as
real as possible and let you guys know
that I'm here on the struggle bus with
you to heart hey hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
