me so I was reading a comment I saw that
you guys wanted a workout so I am going
to give that to you because I am so
giving I'm going to give you this body
full body workout that literally anyone
can do I got it at the beginning of my
like workout plan you don't need any
weights you don't need any equipment
nothing like that so you basically have
no excuses so I'm going to send you
through that right now because you want
abs like these you got to follow my plan
okay so we're going to start with
circuit one what you're going to do
three times ten low bridges ten glute
marches and ten shoulder taps so let's
get into the glute bridges you're going
to plop yourself right onto your mat or
towel and you're going to land your back
lift your hips up and lower them down
lift and lower lift I think you get the
point now we're going to move to our
glute marches lift up and lift each leg
slowly up and slowly down and you're
going to do ten on each side and then
you're going to move on to shoulder taps
not going to do that
don't do that and don't do that keep a
like a nice straight line you're going
to tap one by one eat with each arm and
try to keep your hips down as much as
you can
I'm a little tired so like forgive me
okay then we're going to go into circuit
two what you're going to do three times
20 squats and ten push-ups so let's get
into squat shall we you're going to
stand hip distance apart and come down
like you're singing chair and
and back up keep your weight in your
heels not in your toes this is a dance
class so let's see it from the side
now rub your butt against the wall
basically and stand back up
do not let your knees go past your toes
if you do that you will injure yourself
and do not go like this whatever that is
so sit and back up do this 20 times get
a little dance
okay now into your push-ups get into
plank position go all the way down and
keep your hands right below your
shoulders don't put them out like that
and look like a weirdo and don't lower
your butt down if you can't do it
regularly don't worry you can go on your
knees I'm not going to tell anyone it's
fine
it was still going to work out okay
circuit three you're going to do 15
reverse lunges on each side twenty five
tricep dips and twenty five jumping
jacks again you're going to do this
circuit three times before moving on
getting into the reverse lunge just step
back and pop yourself back up keep your
posture really strong and keep your core
tight and don't go forward all right
grab a chair bed whatever and you're
going to do your tricep dips so sit on
there and hold on with your arms make
sure you're not straining or anything
like that and just dip oh the water is
too cold stiff oh the water is still too
cold twenty-five times we're going to
get into jumping jacks just do I guess a
typical jumping jack I don't want to see
little nubby t-rex arms you're going to
go all the way out and back in twenty
five times for your final circuit you're
almost there circuit four you're going
to do side planks and twenty seconds on
each side fifteen bicycles ten leg
lowers and then twenty five
mountain climber getting in to your side
plank you're going to stack both feet on
top of each other and keep your elbow
strong hand on your hip and wait until
you're deaf if you want to go a little
bit harder you can reach up with your
arm and down and up moving onto bicycles
put your feet up 90 degrees and point an
opposite arm opposite elbow don't go
crazy all out like you don't know what's
happening like so just smooth
transitions now for the leg lowers
you're going to put your hands
underneath your tailbone if you have
tailbone issues and slowly lift and
lower your legs try to keep them as
straight as possible
last one here mountain climbers pretend
like you're running away from something
super scary really fast in plank
position and then you'll be done run
away from all that pain hey guys nice
job you made it you made it through it
um I just realized I forgot to film an
outro so like new Buller but I really
hope that you guys enjoy this workout
it's a really great no equipment workout
if you're in a situation where you just
want to get something out of the way
and it's really great for beginners all
the way to people who work out everyday
if this was pretty easy for you just add
an extra 20 minutes of cardio and then
you're good to go but tell me what you
think ah give me a thumbs up if you
liked it if you didn't I mean I guess I
could take it device um but yeah try it
out let me know I'm going to put the
written workout in the description in
case you need it
this was kind of a visual aid for you um
but I hope you liked it let me know um
and I guess until next time I'll see you
