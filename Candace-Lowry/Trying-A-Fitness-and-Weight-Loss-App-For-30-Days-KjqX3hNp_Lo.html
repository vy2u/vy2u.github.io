started here - hi everyone welcome back
to my channel I you don't remember
because you weren't paying attention if
you remember I did a weight loss app for
a week and it was called 8/5 I'm hot
which is basically a completely
customizable health and fitness and
weight loss app I did it for seven days
a lot of people were asking for 30 days
so I thought to eat fit they were super
amped about doing a 30 day challenge
with them
so essentially what the challenge will
be is 5 days of their workouts all of
their meals and I get a one cheat meal
which I will be taking pictures of
because I think that is a very important
balance we're gonna start this journey
and by the end I really want to rank it
on a couple things which are
accessibility affordability is it
flexible and really how difficult
challenging is an 8 fit is a completely
customizable a fitness app just for you
just for your body and they give you all
your recipes they give you all your
workouts tailored to you I think there's
like 700 recipes out there and the thing
that I really also like to us time was
that all of their recipe meal plans are
all about your dietary restrictions so
it works for vegan vegetarian
pescetarian any arian they also give you
a grocery list which I do not see with a
lot of things and I am all over the
place with my groceries I get
sidetracked
I want to grab like random things that
aren't a part of my meal plan also if
you guys want to join in on this 30 day
challenge with me I have a link below
and a link across this screen for you
guys to join as well
so much more affordable than a gym
membership it's basically like you get a
dietician and a personal trainer on one
app so there's really no denying that is
good the other thing that I really like
the last time that I think will continue
is that all the workouts are different
and they changed here not like doing the
same thing over and over again and
they're super short so I will be
updating you on this journey and showing
you guys some of the recipes I'll be
making some of the workouts I'll be
doing so my meal plan that I'm doing is
I'm a standard I eliminated carrots pork
and tomatoes because I don't like those
things I'm gonna do quick preparation
simple affordable and meal prep so
you're my meals all right let's get this
30 days started I feel like I'm gonna be
very sore let's go to the grocery store
oh sweet outlet are
this week is burrito bowl week so oh my
god oh okay I'm I'm really garbage
looking right now it's just making your
own burrito bowl at home and it's pretty
simple it's just like a cleaner version
of Chipotle I really like this because
it's avocado salsa and corn then we've
got our lean ground turkey our salad
that we can put on top and some black
beans
okay side note rice sticks so boom easy
peasy lemon squeezy all right I am very
sore right now I just woke up from a nap
but pretty sore pretty pretty sore okay
if you remember I had those sugar free
bars from my nose sugar dime I had
thought were pistachios and I forgot
what what else is there I'll post the
recipe right here but um that's when my
snack that week and I loved them and so
far I've like honestly been shocked at
how not hangry I've been like if this
girl gets angry and I've actually been
feeling pretty good I did have a couple
days of two snacks but don't tell I've
been having to travel for a 2 out of 4
of these weeks and it's been like
impossible to follow the exact recipes
it's been a lot of like pressure feeling
that I like have to get these workouts
done and I have to eat like this which
I'm not very used to alright I'm about
to take my grubby ass the gym right now
but I wanted to show you guys an example
of oh I wanted to show you guys an
example of a workout that I'm doing so
my workout program has Tabata a paleo
run and
then what else do I have reps time
intervals Tabata and paleo run and I'm
going to show you a reps workout today
just so you can kind of get an example
of the type of program I'm doing and you
can watch me die
but booties kind of pop in it's kind of
lifting kind of lifting oh okay I just
finished my one of my workouts and I
will say through the last couple of
weeks these workouts have been so so
easy to do like anywhere and so it's
kind of bad cuz you like no excuse but
at the same time it's great because you
really don't need a ton of weights or
anything which is what I really like
boom sore okay also I was like feeling
myself and wanted to take a picture up
on the roof of my bod I was so
embarrassed and wanted to be like an
Instagram person and I was like or
whatever his landscaper came around the
corner and he was like and then I was
like and we're both kind of like it's so
awkward and I'm never taking pictures
again life update my legs might be
falling off due to excess lunges it's
cool that I'm sore but like is it going
to end I think it's just cuz the
workouts continually shift once you're
done with each program on the nutrition
side I think that my fish oil levels are
at an all-time high in a good way I've
been living for this breakfast toast
every morning
avocado toast with a little bit of
prosciutto on it recently in my grocery
store ran out of prosciutto so I've been
having to use just a really clean ham
but I'm into it
hey everyone welcome back I'm a little
quiet cuz my boyfriend's sleeping right
now I just did my results and they look
pretty good
I can definitely see more definition in
my ABS and more definition in my arms I
think when we were talking about it like
a couple weeks ago we but when we were
talking about I was showing that like I
saw lift in my butt which was kind of
cool I've really never seen that change
before it is I would say it is like a 5
out of 5 accessibility because you
literally like need your phone I'd say
maybe like a 5 out of 5 for expense
because it's way cheaper than going to a
gym every month and you're eating a lot
of meals from home so you're not eating
all out a lot but then in terms of
flexibility that's more where it's like
a three just because I'm super super
busy when you're traveling and when
you're you know running around it's kind
of stressful to be like I have to eat
exactly this but at the same time there
are a ton of ways to make it very close
the meals were so simple and easy that I
could probably recreate it on the run I
am pleasantly surprised by the results
I'm also still shocked about that mashed
potatoes being dinner that was pretty
crazy to me that I still enjoyed that
and it still filled me up I highly
highly highly recommend this like last
time I highly recommend this for someone
who wants to get back on track you know
get back into shape and the fact that
it's customized makes me feel like it's
really working for my body and
specifically yeah I want to know if you
guys have tried this if you guys have
