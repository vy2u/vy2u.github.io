working with what we have we're here and
we're tasting baby food I love it I find
so much such an Indian I don't know no

so my boyfriend gave me his bandanas but
they're a survivalist be continued
I'm just gonna break this down I have my
manicure boy here which couldn't have
been a better help open one of them

give us a spoonful of each of us and
then let us decipher any of your kids
hate well my daughter needs everything
okay my son is like yeah did you know
you're popping my um my collab cherry
haha here we go
alright I think you look at me I am
frightened oh why do I'm smelling it it
tastes like squash it's gritty and all
the clothes we do I kind of like a
veggie medley mm-hmm leaving this film
about that is not cute I do have that
got butternut squash almost it's not
what's a one-point campus you heat up
beat no no you become a mom you're
allowed to call me and I know like I
need help
I honestly I've never changed a diaper I
know
alright I'm gonna come up I can feel it
I guess so there we go this one's chunky
I'm gonna go with some peaches up in
this mug they make the baby food like
thicker so that the child like getting
used to eating later in life
wow I'm learning so much okay I think
it's like a spiced peach it's good huge
fan but it's plums and Emma brown rice
oh my gosh ground right what I would
have never thought neither this one
actually I'm smelling peach again
wait it's like a sweet vegetable and I
don't like it I'm gonna go apricot I'm
gonna make security I like a kale oh man
there's baby okay it's peace finish
anapa Oh what I'm gonna give you the
point on that because you nailed it on
the spinach but called it kale that
still really close and I've heard of a
baby food diet you should totally do it
all right that would be so fun and I'm
like what is this it's baby food
typically expensive I mean it's like
your pig less than two dollars per meal
skip fed babies don't even know how they
have it yeah I heard Anaheim soiling
mother let's just try this okay let's
just a little bit louder look at the
background yes this also tastes like a
juice on a juice cleanse I think it's a
beat it tastes be beating of yes I'm
gonna go with beeps and it's super sweet
and compared to a beat so I'm gonna save
me I'm gonna go with an apple
I'm gonna go strawberry or mixed berry
beat apples blows wind beats you know
your baby food it was that for me yeah
it kind of what I add you're gonna meet
two one oh this one's no squashy oh my
liquidy Oh No
the week the vacuum everything happening
a buzz
is it like wet paper
I know it's crazy she said it tastes
like wet paper and the setting is I
totally know what that tastes like and
it tastes just I have no idea do you
know I have no clue I swear no potato I
know I would never take something I'll
go with cauliflower it's coming to land
it says summer vegetable dinner what

M&amp;amp;M challenge on my channel all you
gotta do is check out mini mama calm and
I have the lovely Candace joining me on
this mini yeah M&amp;amp;M challenge which is
way better tasting than whatever we're
shoving in right now it smells very acid
II like not a potato like I would say a
sweet potato or smells like I need to
taste it chunky no I think it's like a
sweet potato or a yam it's sweet potato
in the chicken dinner
watch again chicken visit you got what
it's tuna - we gotta do a tiebreaker now
oh oh did you taste / - oh okay do we
smell like ground well it took a graze
my lips oh oh good is there some sort of
brain in it there's like a penny in
there there has to be rice in here or
something Apple rice and
I'm gonna go with something I'm actually
gonna go with your original guess of
like kale something-something roughage
Apple spinach of rice like or like a
grain Gokhale crap and out of the both
of you you were mostly wrong about
everything you did Terry you said pee at
one point of seeing what it's dqe Piron
