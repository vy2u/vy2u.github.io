wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies I'm
so effing hungry oh hello everyone hi
you're probably like where are you right
now I'm at Michelle actually hey this is
Rochelle you've probably seen her before
she's super awesome
today we are going to be trying the
Victoria's Secret diet and I feel really
bad for bringing Michelle into this I'm
so nervous
it's pretty crazy um we're going to do
like a couple of days leading up to what
they do to the show so we'll be like a
normal day diet with them and then the
extreme things that they do like okay
well they do nine full days of just
protein through these powdered eggs and
a gallon of water while working out they
work out sometimes the day a day so I
figured Michelle would be perfect for
this because she's done the victoria
secret workout before this is not going
to be sustainable so no yeah but I mean
if I get ripped quick by all means
okay they asked a dietitian on shape as
a dietitian and it said I wouldn't
recommend this diet to a dietitian set I
don't recommend what I'm giving me yeah
and he said but there are better ways to
get the same results okay Adriana Lima
this is when it came out a couple years
ago she said the nine days before the
show she cuts out all solid foods and
consumes only liquid while
simultaneously amping her workouts to
two times a day then 12 hours before the
show she doesn't consume anything
including water
this is genetics partly - it's like I'm
never going to be 510 right and super
brave but this diet won't make us taller
the first like daily menu is not too bad
so this was by their dietician of
Victoria's Secret models the breakfast
is models eat
old-fashioned oatmeal egg whites
vegetables cottage cheese and fruit
pretty nice okay right doable yeah and
it says they need to eat a good
breakfast with carbs because they're at
castings all day I won't be what I'm
going to guess take lunch suggest salads
with chicken and fish and then the
dinner is Fushimi with brown rice how am
I going to eat I was like where of snack
before about the in between breakfast
lunch and dinner it's basically giving
you the diet and then being like oh well
you don't look like them so don't you
pick chocolate we're going to show
Victoria sauce this week I'm going to
grow ten inches and look at the end of
it okay so Thursday Friday will wake up
have a protein smoothie have some
powdered egg whites have water have
another protein smoothie have some egg
whites have some water and then have
another produce to do the egg whites and
water
you only get one day we're doing this
for you seriously like don't try this at
home
well yeah video yeah I'm gonna see what
my trainer says she's gonna be a you are
an idiot
yeah pretty sure that I'm just not gonna
tell anyone that I'm doing this all
right I'll see you on the other side
guys
by okay it is the morning of day one of
the Victoria's Secret model diet
challenge and I am about to make my
oatmeal and egg whites I am really
surprised at the breakfast and the food
plan in general allows you to have dairy
like the cottage cheese and yogurt I
wasn't expecting that but I'm not going
to argue with it because in general
isn't a lot of food and I will take
everything I can get I have some egg
white my food some oats with a little
bit of powdered peanut butter I think my
new strategy is just to put off eating
as long as I can and I'm worried that
I'm going to be starving so I chose some
just Greek yogurt that's totally plain
and I'm going to save that as a snack
because I don't have anything else to
eat until lunch I'm just trying to like
stagger that throughout the entire
morning so that feels like it's more
than it actually is all right well the
award for the most boring dinner of the
night goes to me Lee I'm going to go eat
this and cry so today is going to be a
really really long day for me I'm doing
two training sessions an hour and a half
of khonsu in a couple hours of parkour I
am nervous to say the least about having
enough energy to get there today got my
lively vegetable salad honestly I'm also
thinking about how farty does not make
cream like there's a lot of veggies to
go in me
I think I've only had 800 calories today
I'm just already looking forward to
coming home and having dinner looks like
monkeys gonna join us for some dinner
okay I've got my salmon zucchini green
beans and right so I just had my dinner
and I'm about to indulge in to some 70%
cacao chocolate I am tired
just really really tired because on this
Victoria's Secret diet can't really eat
the things that I want to eat after I
train I want to reward myself and I
can't reward myself and instead I'm
cooking vegetables right now first next
so I guess that's just the life of a
model so I just woke up this is day 3
it's um all the good diet day I actually
got really sick to my stomach and threw
up last night it's actually um you know
nice timing to be on a lighter diet
today I'm sorry Michelle you're probably
dying it's pretty bad I am tired of
drinking my food I am tired of the taste
of chocolate protein powder and I don't
ever want to look at a powdered egg ever
again in my life I I just feel a lot of
like frustration and I have to like come
out of my body and remind myself self
this is because you are starving it is
not because your day is actually
terrible
hi welcome back from our week from hell
well I don't know was it yeah yeah I was
that was hard but I feel like I was at a
little bit of an advantage for one of
the days because I got sick one of the
nights so I was like oh I'm fine having
smoothie is all thank you all I could
think about was like on that day I was
like oh God Michelle's probably dying to
pick a shuttle the first two days which
are the regular diet days were very
manageable in my opinion the breakfast
was bigger than most breakfast I usually
have it very front loaded um a lot of
variety with things I can't pronounce
like Weasley Oh muesli muesli didn't
know well now I sound like Anita Cano
and it's nothing like that
I was a little nervous about no snack
I just want to yeah I think it was funny
how they're like you can have one square
of chocolate to curb your ice cream
cravings it's like one square chocolates
not going to stop me from eating a bowl
of ice cream I was very much like
screaming how much I wanted ice cream
the entire week but then days three and
four oh I love no energy they stand for
so hard it it was really about survival
I guess I have never gone like all
basically all liquid and egg whites yes
for a day which was incredibly
challenging because we had to continue
working out on top of that yeah I have
trouble sleeping - oh that one hungry
yeah I have a hard time falling asleep
because I was like all I could think
about was what was in my fridge and it
was just like but the whole time all I
could think about was how does somebody
do this for nine days nine days it's
like I could barely do liquid for - I
don't know how they do it for nine it
just doesn't feel sustainable it's not a
healthy way to lose weight
it's strange to me that like not only is
that just so unhealthy but no one in
their right mind is acute as well like
no one is a regular person I think would
go through this and these models are
supposed to represent the people who are
buying the clothes who are regular
people yeah and I remember like Victoria
Secret models are a big influence on me
as like a high schooler yeah and I was
always like how do I look like that what
can I do and then if I mean if I saw
that diet as a kid like I would try it I
would not recommend - no I think that's
the first part of the diet the everyday
diet is a great base for healthy eating
but the liquid diet is just entirely
unrealistic and just not fun just Mardin
lose any of the above once you go off of
something like this you're just going to
get it all back and your metabolism
could potentially be damaged or
something else and your mental state
could be a little bit like this will and
you will be damaged it's fun kind of
debunking beef diet
yeah for sure I think like we've been
lucky to kind of experience diets that
work for us and weight loss the genes
that work for us but it is always fun to
like try like oh I wonder I wonder if
what these models do we'll be like even
crazier yeah and it was crazy I hope you
guys enjoyed the video I hope you
enjoyed the struggle honestly I'm glad
we struggled for you so you don't have
to but please give this video a big
thumbs up subscribe for more videos like
this you might see more Michelle she's
going to probably be more videos yeah
and we did an awesome video with sex
dust on her channel so I get excited
about that and check out all of her
socials here gonna perform in front of
your face I don't know we're talking
about
and then you can see all my photos below
in the description box so I guess we'll
see you later I'm gonna go eat a good
meal yes a lot for doing it all right hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
