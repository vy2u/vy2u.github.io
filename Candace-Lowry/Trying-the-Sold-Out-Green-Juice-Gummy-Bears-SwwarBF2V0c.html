is sugar
oh hello and see you there I was playing
best fiends but in all seriousness thank
you best fiends not friends I thought it
was friends I thought I had a problem
reading for a second thank you guys for
sponsoring me so I actually did start
playing best games and now I can't stop
playing it is free okay so before you
get mad at me it is a free game that's
fiend is a super cool adventure game
where you have a group of fiends and you
destroy these nasty-ass lugs with the
nice little puzzle games where you match
all these similar colored objects today
they're going to boot camp and it's a
really actually really well done
animated short called boot camp that's
actually pretty entertaining and you
should check it out watch the video and
then you can actually play the game it's
pretty fun you can download the game for
free below I have a little link for you
and you also get five dollars worth of
spending cash in the game moving on so
seeing these green juice gummy bears pop
up everywhere and I was like I'm young
I'm basic I'm not a bitch but I gotta
try these things so I traveled all the
way across Los Angeles to try to buy
these things and everywhere is they were
sold out and then I finally finally
found the Promised Land of the
headquarters for sugarfina in Beverly
Hills at Belle Fuji as hell but I found
them and I got those $6.99 bad boys and
now we're going to try them
I actually saw these when I was at work
doing her trending report and I couldn't
tell if they were real or not but it's
actually true that it was an April
Fool's joke and then they decided to
make them but I thought it was
interesting that a lot of people are
buying these and thinking that
a our multivitamins or that they are
really good for you and the only gummy
that tastes really worth it to me that's
good for you is a Flintstone gummy
I'm going to compare these green juice
gummies to like a typical gummy bear and
see if they actually do have any
substantial value to them but I also
want to know what they taste like and
they also come in this nice bag when I
was buying them I was like damn like
what am I getting here so they come in
this little bottle of that looks like a
green juice bottle that you would see if
you've ever been depressed it's like a
juice store like very overpriced that
says did you know that they were
initially in April Fool's joke and then
people wanted to buy them let me just
say that that is the most la thing is
that you see a April Fool's joke about a
green juice gummy and then he actually
wanted this look seven dollars like it's
a cute package and all the like seven
bucks for gummy bears
I could go to 7-eleven and get Harry
bows for like two bucks oh oh you know
these do smell like multivitamins
they've got the cute little gummy bear
oh god I probably just waste it that's
like 40 cents these little guys look
like typical gummy bears should I eat it
should I carrot limb from limb or should
I just take its head off Oh
hmm they weirdly taste like green juice
you wrapped an apple and spinach and ate
it and then poured a little lemon on it
that's what it tastes like I'm just so
confused because like this is a really
cute fun idea but like I would rather
have a cherry or a pineapple heree bow
okay so it has green juice concentrate
so when something says that it's from
concentrate it just means that the juice
has been squished down to its most dense
form and all the water's taken out and
then you can freeze it and then
reconstitute it but has apples lemon and
spinach and then ginger so nutrition
facts wise 14 of these little gummies is
132 calories it has 17 grams of sugar
and 20% of your vitamin A and 20% of
your vitamin C you're getting some
vitamins right well let's just do like
her Evo gummy bears
so I grab the hurry bow gummy bear
nutrition facts so they are a hundred
and forty calories for 17 pieces
there's 18 grams of sugar I just want
you guys to know this isn't a healthier
version or alternative to a typical
gummy bear they're they're fun they're
good they're squishy I could see these
performing well on Instagram
you know I could see Kylie Jenner
promoting these they do taste good they
taste good but they kind of just tastes
a little like grass and ground there
100% bears which makes me kind of upset
well you guys let me know what you want
me to taste next this was interesting
and it's like I got one of these and you
didn't I hope you have a good day I hope
you enjoyed this video sorry I'm a
little sick if you like this video give
it a big thumbs up don't forget to
subscribe if you want to see more from
me I really love your comments on the
depression video and it was really sweet
and I've been reading every single one
of them
