my first unboxing and I'm doing a summer

wellness when they contacted me I was
like me like seriously am I on The
Bachelor right now so it has fashion
beauty Fitness food it's full sized
products I don't like these weenie ass
like tiny little samples and you pay so
much for just little samples these
fabfitfun boxes are $49.99 a season but
it has over $250 worth of stuff in it I
can't say no to free stuff if you guys

go to the beach and like 40 this is cush
it feels like yoga almost like a yoga
towel
I like this I'll take a picture of this
and like put it here of what it looks
like oh I really like this because this
is also something if you've ever felt
those towels that you put over a yoga
mat this is exactly what it feels like I
mean he knew an enzyme peel I'm really
into that hope I get that
or a hair protectant treatment spray ooh
oh this is the hairspray and of the hair
protectant spray as you can see here
this you put on wet or dry hair I'm
gonna smell it it has up to four and
fifty degree heat protection makes it
shiny yeesh I actually really need this
because my hair is colored and it just
just gets destroyed during the summer
got that I'm gonna get something tart so
it's gonna be the highlight or contour
palette or the sex kitten liquid liner I
think I got the pro glow oh this is
perfect for summer Oh
for some reason Tarte stuff smells
really good oh my god I'm smelling again
this is the palette it has mirrors and
there's three shades here almost like a
creamy cream contour there the other
side has a little lighter highlighter
and some bronzer as well I think I'm

body caviar okay or aromatherapy
de-stress muscle gel oh dang I got the
Mojo you know what that means

god jack has to give me a massage
rosemary black pepper lavender and
ginger to de-stress your body I'm gonna
drive it tonight a face rejuvenation
a sports loop resistance band or a
little wallet oh this is cute
put a few little cards in here and stuff
when I'm going to the Grove or something
I don't know why I just smelled that
it's just something that you can put
your cards in and almost put this in
your pocket like when you go somewhere
and you don't want to take a purse so
that was nice

Pier one Imports a little oh this is
cute
I'm gonna put all my drugs on here just
kidding my medicines at night I need a
little dish to put them on I know it's a
ring dish but like hello I think I'm
gonna put my tums and stuff on here okay
let's see sunscreen will the sport
classic sunscreen oh and white tea you
know what this is vegan too I have a
weird thing about smelling things I
guess it's actually very important to
put sunscreen on before you go outside
every day even if you're just in an
office it kind of reminds me of those
aromatherapy lotions from Bed Bath and
not Bed Bath and Body Works
I like this it doesn't Oh what is this a
straw a straw um
this straw saves marine lives oh don't
use regular plastic straws guys oh my
god the last thing is the foreo for Heil
for oh the foreo oh my god I'm so
excited for this okay I see these
everywhere in like every magazine all
over random websites - and I'm so
excited that I finally got one of these
at first I was like oh my god is that a
vibrator but it's not it looks like a
little dude is taking a picture of you
well okay maybe that's creepy I don't
know but it has these little oh my god
don't look at my nails and it has these
little bristles on it and it vibrates
while you wash your face but it looks
like it's coming out with an app where
you'll get your skin age Oh tell you
your cleansing routine okay I guess I'm
gonna have to try that too I guess
that's it
is that it honest to god like this is my
honest review this is something that
actually has things in it that I will
use and I feel like sometimes when you
get a subscription box you don't really
know what to do with a lot of this stuff
but I think so far I mean this is my
first one but I really liked that their
actual full-size things that you could
use and it's like a total variety of
things that was my unboxing I really
hope you guys liked it again if you guys
want to start your fabfitfun little
journey here you can get $10 off your
first box with canvas I think these are
definitely things that also like
encourage you to stay healthy and keep
an active lifestyle that was fun well
I'm so glad you stuck around for this
and you got to see all what I've done
here and I am gonna go probably take
this to my yoga class even the literally
mid for the beach but I like this
