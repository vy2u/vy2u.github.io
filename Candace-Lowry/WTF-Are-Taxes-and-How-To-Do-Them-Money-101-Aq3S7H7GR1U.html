paycheck it was so wonderful I opened my
letter I smelled it it was beautiful I
looked down and then I realized a third
of it had been given to the government
hello everyone today we're going to be
talking about your taxes which you
should be doing and you shouldn't avoid
I don't care who you are I don't care if
you're paid in turn the President of the
United States god you gotta pay your
taxes you guys because the IRS will find
you and they will kill you and they will
pull the omission on your ass okay so
just wouldn't something done each new
taxes alright when I graduated I really
had no idea what taxes were I was like
I'm paying for a park I don't know but I
also didn't realize why things was being
taken out what they were being taken out
for it I feel like honestly it's still
really hard to figure out like where
it's all going and like what the hell
return is so today I'm going to give you
the dumbed down version which I
personally need of doing your taxes and
what taxes are and what you do with them
if you see a cat box behind me I just
get a new kitty
and his name is Mugsy and I'm slowly
moving him out from under the bed so
don't be like this bitch is gross
what exactly are taxes all right let's
just what do they pay for where does my
money though why does the government
want this everything you see around you
that's free is expert paid for by the
American people
so parks prisons yeah your local library
everything like that is paid with tax
dollars and public schooling which is
why public schooling is very
controversial when people talk about
their taxes because your money go to a
lot of different places and it's tough
because you wish you had a say in where
it goes right really sorry it's like
very hot in this room I don't know if
it's because I'm talking about losing
money or what it is so I put my hair up
classic candy okay so I'm going to be
talking about two specific types of
taxes which is your payroll tax and your
income tax some people also have a state
income tax which is great no it's not
it's just another thing that people pick
out so like California will pick out
money and New York will take out money
a couple things like that how about your
payroll tax is it sanctuary what you see
when you get your paycheck and it says
like Medicare taking out Social Security
taking out and things like that your
income tax is what combined state and
federal money that you owe basically to
the government and this is very
important when you get hired you can
sometimes get an option that will be
like hey don't take the full amount out
of my paycheck or do take the full
amount amount of your paycheck you
always want to take the full amount out
of your paycheck otherwise you run being
really screwed over at the end of the
year and realizing that you haven't been
paying your taxes the whole time and
you've got to quickly gather all this
money that should have been taken out in
the first place
believe me a lot of people do it and
I've seen it screw over a lot of people
so always be better safe than sorry
because at the end of the day you want
to be able to have that income return
because we all want to tax return and we
all want to go and cruise and a fun
vacation okay
the government takes enough when you do
get hired you're going to be given a w-4
and you want to make sure that you fill
it out correctly because this will
calculate your withholdings via tax
withholdings
are basically what is going to be taken
out of your paycheck
each month and if you file that w-4
incorrectly you could all the government
a lot more money than you think at the
end of the tax season which is not fun
and you don't want to have to owe them
anything so the government can reward
you for giving money to charities or
giving it to
good cause and that's like a tax
write-off but if you have to take money
out of your 401k a retirement fund
you can get penalized by the government
for that so please be careful please
save your money correctly I know that's
really hard I like to spend my paycheck
as soon as I get it and that's not very
smart all right so let's talk about taxi
then which I hae okay there are a bunch
of different ways that you can file your
taxes at the beginning of the year up
until I think the deadlines which are
like February 28th
you should get either electronically or
by mail your w-2 and with your w-2 you
can either use an accountant H&amp;amp;R block
like something like that or software
which a lot of my friends use like
TurboTax or things like that each of
them involve payments and each of them
have different accuracies when you're
younger single like you don't have
multiple all these multiple income
anything like that I think that
something like a TurboTax can't help and
then if you make under a certain amount
you can do it through IRS gov as they
can help you as well
so as you start to make more money you
will start to be taxed a higher
percentage which there's a lot of the
reason why people get angry because they
get a raise but the government will take
more money out of their paycheck so what
exactly is a refund and you're like oh

like I got some money here so a refund
is basically that you've been paying
government too much which is a great
thing because you can get it all back so
you guys I'm just gonna show you like
the end if you're doing this on your own
through the IRS I mean it basically
shows you a a what to do your name
address what does the top you're going
to fill all of that out so if you can
get the top part done you're like a
quarter of the way there once again
though like if you're doing TurboTax or
going to race on block like you don't
really need to know
these things they can just walk you
through it let's talk about who can help
you do your taxes if you have someone
that's a moderately successful adult
talk to them first okay
Darren talk to someone who has done
their taxes before then look at the
irs.gov and don't look at someone who
hasn't paid their taxes yet this is
common with a lot of rich people this is
common with celebrities or people who
just got really rich so don't don't
listen to those people but if you're
ever questioning your taxes just make
sure you're not suckered into something
really expensive or someone says they
will help you do your taxes and they
take a huge chunk of your return or they
have a huge fee well I was recording my
video and then my battery went out so
now I'm dressed completely differently
like I was saying I let's do an
information okay so what did we learn
about today we learned about the types
of taxes that there are and the types of
taxes you'll probably be dealing with
the type of taxes I deal with I don't
know yarn stocks and all these different
types of things but you got to make sure
you have your w-2 form you're going to
get that from your employer okay and if
you have multiple employers you're going
to give multiple w-2 so you're going to
need those if you do need to be late you
can always file an extension a lot of
people don't talk about that but that's
the way to go so you know where you're
Texas are going you know what gets taken
out and you know like what forms to use
finally what are you going to do when
you have all that together so like we
discussed you can use an online platform
or you can use an accountant if your fam
we use as one now you can just flip
yours in really quick because it's
probably really simple or you can go to
a place like H&amp;amp;R Block but just remember
there are fees there's always a fee and
not being free in life I hope this helps
a little bit textures are really amusing
you guys I don't even know 100% what
they're about so you know and that's
okay because you're going to learn as
you go and as your job gets more
complicated so is life and that's the
oil axes so I'm gonna leave a couple
links below which can help with your
research and kind of be like a
straightforward thing about what you
should do when tax season comes around
which it is so I hope you guys make
those dolla dolla bill deal that was
very wide of me I'm so sorry I still
apologize alright until next time guys
let me know what else you guys want to
learn about and hopefully I know enough
about it alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
