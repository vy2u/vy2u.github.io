tag with the two women who trained as
MMA fighters for 30 days oh it's candid
and I'm out ladies are fit where we're
gonna do laser tag class and I have two
special guests that's me Michelle in
Georgia hey so we're very sweaty already
and for all but that's the bird we're
gonna feel the calories just we're gonna
sweat a lot I'm gonna eat up she's
already thinking about lunch perfect and
she already ran a 5k today suffice
casual barely but I think down we're
gonna be doing this awesome workout
that's like all based on laser tag and
I'm really excited I'm so excited I
think it'll be fun you ready
get very ready yeah okay goodbye
all right
so you invented later of it yes my
husband and I but five six years six
years ago we are playing visa time it
was really really cool it was really
really fun and I can't put him away and
I can't just because I was running so
much and I was doing lots of exercise
but I just didn't realize so we start to
think about it I would like to use play
we're gonna put into play so we starting
between skatepark park floors of the in
one level when people need to keep
moving all the time and the equipment we
wanted something very lights and you can
actually move into it so you designed
those yeah thanks
whoa I actually checked people that
helped us designed to hold festive movie
so it's everything we made ourselves
this is amazing thank you
yeah because when I put up when we were
coming us I was a little bit nervous as
I've done regularly yeah before and the
equipment is not very turn off there's
no kids here into younger like 13 years
old so we made very precise we may be
bright like this and you have to be on
target actually hit the target so it's
much more strategic much more precise I
read that you can burn like 200 calories
for 10 minutes
why is that it's 100 calories why it's
different
first of all when you get hit
when the growing bread and the only way
to reactivate your transactionally Queen
yeah yeah
it's our job it's our movie keeps on
running
you'll get reactivity
are you in focus boys in a bucket is it
okay I stopped to film for a little bit
but that was like that was a warm-up
this is your handle this allows you to
shoot at people to do so if you want to
trick you want to push this it is
precisely who you eating that going like
this it's not going to help you
we need to be on it we will see who shot
you and where it anymore
after you mean without your to
reactivate the cardia really kicks it to
avoid being tagged you need to move as
much as possible
this is or Gowen
oh my god workout done for the day

it good any better because it's every
man for himself
