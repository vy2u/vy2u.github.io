it I'm gonna have to see how this how's
that one again oh no mystery bandit
sizzling hi everyone
guess who I have with me today Michelle
so that means we're putting our body
there's something really stupid
haha and now just for Michelle flasher
or what we're going to try the Jade egg
Gwyneth Paltrow swears by this along
with other celebrities and it is just
putting an egg up in your vaginal canal
a Jaden a Jade egg specifically our kids
not am i rude is not a chicken Michelle
has one my therapist told me you'd be
good to use one yes so I got one getting
naked they're very cute I would say
mines in the mail yeah I've heard that
you put floss through this hole so that
it doesn't get lost in there and you
have an escape valve yes
and do they said a horse like stamp what
does that look like it's just like
standing like normally like it's like a
daily routine thing but and then you
kind of just oh and this they said that
you can recharge it with a full moon
when is the next full moon in Los
Angeles California it apparently makes
you love yourself more and makes your
kind of feminine hormones come back into
balance and turn oh I'm here for that
and prevent uterine prolapse on that
like old-people problem and develop a
clear Chi pathway to the body these all
sound like great things if this thing
works also placebo effects I don't care
if I like myself more activists more
power to this incredible oh when you
first get your eggs boil it for a few
minutes to make sure it's clean
hard-boiled Jaden it better not be
anyone elses space onyx place it on a
beautiful piece of fabric light a candle
burn some sage
and imagine pure light flowing between
you and the eggs become one with your
eggs I think this is going to be weird
this is objectively weird I look forward
to strengthening those muscles but I
don't do particular work outside
involved bathroom wall buildings muscle
building I really do hope that I enjoy
this I think that I have a problem being
open with myself that makes sense yes
and so I feel like it might help me be
more comfortable with my own body also I
think I'm more open to this because I
know people who aren't you miss Paltrow
didn't enjoy it so it gives you make you
excited to try it for sure
alright here we go there will be no
vagina shop see on the other side guys
bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum Lilly is
currently taking a picture of my yoni
super fit can't wait to sure bullet I
think I'm like a medium-large
Philip I love the millennial pink I
think it's very on trend for summer also
they're fun for the whole family to come
and fill your room I'm about to go to
bed and I feel like this is the moment
when you want to do the JTAG the I don't
know in the middle would went in the
middle of the day I would do this I am
looking at these right now and I'm like
Who am I
it's just like a starter pack or is it
like I've never had sex before and I've
had a baby I'm very nervous it's just me
and all of you two but on my cozy robe
on I got Rick and Morty queued up so I
can just chill here we go the egg is in
I think
we have liftoff it's actually a lot
heavier than I expected it to be feel
like every night should probably get
easier I'm even like scared just like
bend over in this position with it in oh
my god I think I'm doing it wrong so if
you can see the moon so I'm going to
have these charged up in the moon
I don't really know if it's like a
hundred percent full moon but it's
technically we got around us a full
situation so I'm going to charge these
bad boys up like charge em up
are we looking only charged up are we
charged up and ready for insertion J
three of JTAG I am back in my bathroom
for some reason with this thing I feel
like I have to do with in private I
think I feel a little bit of like
weirdness and shame when it comes to
this thing I realized because the only
things that we see in the media and just
like in life in general that are
supposed to go in your vagina
our period related or sex related there
I've never like even thought about
anything else going in there for any
other reason I really think everyone
should do this though to just be like
okay with their bodies being like my
brain in the heart I'm like just saying
like oh it's like there for me it's
there for my health it's there to build
up the muscles so I've actually been
reading about the backlash that GUP got
from this when they published their
story one of their readers who's just
like an everyday woman felt you know
really disheartened by it it's really
about becoming one with your body and
kind of spending time to know your body
without it being something sexual or
like deviant these aids before and after
by like feminist revelation
yesterday I would like screw it I'm
going to go to the gym and I'm going to
put in the Jade egg and I'm going to do
my J data exercises in the gym I'm just
hoping that like the egg doesn't fall
out dropping my eggs to be boiled next
to my roommates cube mama bear papa bear
and baby bear going in
double bubble boil and toil know what's
the beginning part o double bubble nope
double double true double double toil
and trouble I'm about to eat a bubble
okay I'm back I definitely knew that I
was a little too bold with it maybe it
started flowing out a little bit but
also like nobody noticed so I don't know
why I needed to be a big deal I realized
like I really one that's ever making
this a big deal do I feel sexier I don't
know I just feel better like I've
explored my body more but this was
interesting alright guys welcome back ah
I give up one you've got one by those
guys this week definitely brought to my
attention
how much lack of exploration of my own
body I've done because I think society
does not - alright like you said I felt
like I'm so modest with myself yes it's
like nobody else is around and I should
be able to just do this for you Lee but
it was like it was this weird level of
like I shouldn't be doing this I found
it difficult on the first few days to
get it in you have to like relax and
really just be like okay this is
happening you can build up an endurance
to it but I feel like after doing it
it's important to have this especially
if I want like kids in the future
I need all the help I can get and no one
talks about like how to change your body
and you know fix the inside of it after
or before that happened when we without
bonus outro talking about this I don't
think I would have ever really thought
about it right you know so I guess when
it you have points there yeah thanks for
joining me on another birthday we do a
lot of vaginas that we have like vagina
think about you know your own body
confidence with yourself but yeah you
know
