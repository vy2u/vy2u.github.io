go hard life hi hey oh god I gotta turn
off the arrow anyway hello hello welcome
I have Jordan with me today and we're
gonna be smoking air and Lael please um
so I saw these things on Instagram
they're called monk and it's like
vaporizing essential oil but it's like
very cute it looks like a piece of chalk
this is like an alternative for helping
anxiety being nervous genuine sadness
Thank You general sadness it else dad
but they come in like different blends I
guess and this one has been so this is
specifically for anxiety and it's
supposed to calm you you know they said
that this is an ancient tradition basing
official wild you reflect through that
tiny holy shit
hahaha no this one has frankincense
which awakens the spirit and balances
the mind so he's okay and then we love
orange classic orange which is a classic
we should check which up lifts our
spirits you lying you're lying
I like connecting that right I don't
know I got roasted on my other video for
always canals hurry bow gummi bears
oh yeah Madagascar hmm
the orange is from the United States
classic this one creates a soothing
effect
oh it's known to cite stress okay and
relaxes the body there was instructions
but I threw them out well why trade in
through your mouth without inhaling into
your lungs you two three gentle breaths
two to three times a day
mine didn't come out my nose mMmmm is it
weird but I kind of like it we should
have gone I was like we should go to
like a base back he was our special one
okay check it out vacation yeah so I
think we're going to use need for a
couple days
of a week yeah because I feel like I
have peaks and valleys yeah exactly like
I'll have good days and then I'll have
that yeah so it's hard to just like do
it one time and yeah we'll see we will
see all right guys see on the flip side
I'm getting ready to go to bed and I've
been sleeping very terribly lately so do
my little essential oil of eight before
bed hopefully it helps me sleep better
because that would be nice
this isn't a real cat to pusheen um so
my anxiety comes at night like this
little scary nocturnal creature it's
very chill during the day and then I get
my thoughts and everything at night so
I'm going to try to smell fish that
sounds like weed so far it relaxed me
but I'm not necessarily sleepy that
makes sense so I just woke up it's the
morning after day one and I actually
slept pretty well last night I only woke
up twice as opposed to just constantly
being awake and tossing and turning you
know it could be coincidence it could be
the essential oils but I guess we'll
find out as the week goes on well Jesus
and my vape better take the wheel
because I overslept and I'm gonna have
to change at work because my alarm went
didn't go up so I guess that this vape
has been working because I am late for
work the first time ever they take the
wheel
take it from mothers I slept pretty well
again last night
it's not like it's working a miracle
like I'm not having an awesome night of
sleep I'm just sleeping better than I
was before I felt a potential bad day
situation it was just kind of like this
low level hum that the essential oils
seemed to calm a little bit okay so I
just pulled this out at work and people
looked at me like I was the biggest
douche of all time they're like why are
you gaping in the office and it's it's
just a social oil kind of wanted to use
the vape but I feel really weird about
doing it in public I think that I would
get some weird looks if I just like
whipped out a vape at the gym especially
at the gym I don't know some things are
starting to get to me then like for no
reason obviously this is another night I
just wear the same sleep shirt every
night but I've noticed that this pen
helps you breathe slow breaths that
you're supposed to do to prevent a panic
attack and remind you how to breathe but
I think that that's really the furthest
it's going to go and kind of help you if
you're in kind of a little anxious mood
but I think if I was in a situation
where you know I'm having a really
really bad day this really wouldn't do
much I kind of felt a bit of anxiety
coming on and I mean for no reason but
because that's how it happens I've taken
like five breaths now kind of just
waiting for it to do its job but it's
not really doing anything for me right
now I still feel
um anxious she's kind of sucks because
it's like the last thing you want to do
is have to like take medication or
something and feel that there's
something wrong with you or that you
can't handle it on your own so yeah I
mean it reminds me to take deep breaths
and stay calm but in a situation where
you really lose control at it I don't
think it's gonna do anything really to
help stop you know of an anxiety attack
I just had a pretty bad attack so like
as I'm calming down on my own if it
helps me with that process I didn't grab
for it during the attack and honestly it
was not even on my mind but I think the
same will help help with that process
welcome hi doodle welcome welcome back
it's a week um you know I've had a lot
of judgment I feel a lot of people
speaks excision a lot of people assumed
I was like actually vaping yeah like
getting into base culture like I do that
work people like stopped and looked at
me like gave me the once-over and look
did you face now it's hard to explain
that it's a completely different thing
exactly which is why I just avoided
doing it in public you know it does feel
it is your run saying nice day mmm you
know and I am one day where I slept a
couple I completely slept through my
alarm oh and I was like please God like
a smokey on the way to work me like
don't look baby look I enjoyed it too
I found that I would do it like right
before bed was laying in that I would do
it and it helped I feel like it helped
me fall asleep a little bit you're just
like chilling yeah I just kind of like
let me like reset at the end of the day
like okay time to chill and I'm relaxed
and now I can solace if I felt good and
I think it was funny because my mom and
my cousin and my aunt were all here and
they were like Candace what is that and
they and I was like it's so like you
said it's so hard to explain to me like
this is not tobacco it's not like
nicotine are you having like I literally
just like yeah plant and they look like
little kids they were like running
around the farm be like look at me I'm
smoking I'm in the 1930 smoking and they
were like running around like these 55
year old women at hilarious definitely
not like this is going to save me from a
panic attack no it's not a miracle bite
and
yeah but I didn't really expect it to
it's essential oils like it can only do
so much and you can only expect so much
out of it yeah so it did keep you thin
but yeah I mean is it a cure-all no I
definitely had some bad days and it was
like completely useless and I wanted to
throw it against the wall ha ha ha 5 her
anxiety I'd give it like a 2 point 5
