week where this has fully dried before I
had to put it back on hi hi how's it
going good how are you
they can't answer anyway I have Jordan
here with me today we are going to try a
Kardashian approved waist slimmer the
reason why this is happening is that I
see a lot of influencers using this to
promote weight loss and so Khloe
pre-pregnancy I will save pre-pregnancy
yeah she's got that real tight yeah so
she put this real tight like right at
dawn her way out
and she says finally at waist gang
society is giving me what I've been
missing the sweat band is a super easy
and comfortable band that I can wear
while working out this band makes me
sweat more in our tummy areas so it
gives me that extra boost when I'm
feeling a little bloated I love how my
posture is in the gym and it's even
better due to wearing it
hashtag add I was able to get two of
them that were very similar they're all
like made of the same things like
neoprene it's not breathable I think
that's the point yeah this is it
basically promotes additional increase
in circulation sweating and motivation
if I had a jail that would get my ass to
the gym so I think it's supposed to
shape as you sweat okay and then I get
belly fat so you want to do it very
tight so it I don't think it'll mess up
our organs right but before exercise
adjust your waist trimmer to desired
position and wrap it comfortably around
your abdomen using a wet cloth and soap
wipe down interlining several times do
not wash or dry as it may melt the
fabric we're gonna do this throughout
the week it looks like a sash that like
a Miss America what if I am Miss sweet
sweat hi we're gonna be doing this for a
week a week a week or all of our
workouts for the next week and I feel a
little bad for Jordyn because she's
gonna be walking into like this crazy
ass CrossFit gym that's intense and
you're gonna be like hey everyone we're
gonna still take pictures before and
after cute look at this punch me all
right guys we'll see you on the other
side all right got my waist trainer on
feels feels nice and snug it almost
feels like a little a little person it's
just hugging me real tight I'm gonna do
a dance cardio workout by Simone biles
right now and I really hope I don't get
smelly every part around the band
he's like soaking wet like the band of
my shorts right now kind of feels like I
peed my pants it's definitely like you
start to really feel like radiating heat
coming from your middle can you guys see
this right now just the glistening sweat
just from 40 minutes of cardio it's the
first day I'm gonna put
hang on I'm gonna just like listen under
my shirt and hope that nobody notices
I'm wearing it but I don't know how
that's gonna go
I'm actually feeling a really
lightheaded and kind of dizzy during my
workout I could really feel myself
overheating I was really hot
you know I kind of wanted to pass out I
felt like I was gonna pass out a little
I don't want to say this but I'm gonna
say this uh this is still wet from
yesterday and you're not supposed to
wash it so I don't know man
I'm thinking that because of the nature
of this belt and what it's designed to
do that it maybe is not the best
accessory for high intensity workout if
I'm pushing myself that hard this belt
could potentially be kind of dangerous
but I'm gonna see how the rest of the
week goes almost died oh oh it's like
just a rush of cool icy air hitting your
belly man I'm sweating more than when
Tanner mojo was watching content Cup it
just never ends it's so gross
it's so gross I didn't use it in my like
high intensity cardio workout today
because the last couple times I've done
that I did not feel good but I did use
it in like some of my other like
strength accessories skill work stuff
and like it's fine I just don't get what
it's doing I've noticed that the hit
workouts and be more intense workouts of
my week have been harder and not like in
a good way if that makes sense I feel
like the band is constricting me in a
way where I feel like I'm like melting
from the inside it's that feeling where
you are pushing yourself too hard to the
point where it's just not really helping
your body I wore it again
during some light cardio stuff I don't
like the way this feels especially when
I'm doing like cardio stuff I just I'm
not a fan of how restrictive it is I
don't want to say it's dangerous but I
don't think that it is in everybody's
best interest I'm just I just AM it it
almost makes me panic a little bit
because I can't breathe as deeply as I
want to or have to or normally do maybe
that's just something I have to get used
to I don't know
I'm also not seeing any changes and I
don't think I've seen it make a single
difference in my body I'm still
skeptical just as skeptical as I was in
the beginning all right hey what's going
on I just took my after picture and it's
like basically the same we we tried to
extend it by almost two weeks to see if
that would make really any difference
but the problem is you're really hot and
you're really sweaty and you're losing
this water weight and you feel really
skinny the next morning and then as soon
as you get back to eating regularly it
just goes back people will always think
there's a secret to super fast weight
loss and this helps you feel really thin
really quickly but there's no long-term
effects really maybe there's a little
bit more definition but that just might
be because I've been working out more
and it feels like you're working more
but it definitely didn't make me like
miraculously a mess I think over time
maybe it could give you a little more of
an hourglass shape but I really don't
think that's the case I think that
that's just plastic surgery or corset
you don't need to be doing that
there's no miracle diet product there's
no miracle workout product and I think I
think we've debunked this one I've been
nominated for a shorty award so please
look at the link below and give me a
vote it would always be cool to see the
little guy win in this situation but you
guys are awesome if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up subscribe and
yeah I guess I'll see you next time I'm
sorry Jordan for making you go through
this all right guys stay ripped stay fit
stay healthy love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
