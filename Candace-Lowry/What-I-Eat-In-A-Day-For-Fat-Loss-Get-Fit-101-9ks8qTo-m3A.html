and there were these little girls
selling girl-scout cookies and they're
like you want some like I'm sorry I
can't my metabolism doesn't allow it
oh my god who's got a new camera I did
that's me
I didn't actually get a new camera I
actually just left my camera in
Freddie's car for like four months I
thought I lost it I was close helpful um
welcome to my living room floor I don't
know the lighting was good I just sat on
the ground we're going to be talking
about healthy eating and what I eat in a
day we're not going to be talking about
dieting because diets work and then you
get sick of them so this is more about
just eating healthy and eating clean in
general and I'm going to take you
through a day of what I eat when I am
trying to lose fat so it's maintain and
gain my muscle a lot of people think
that you're going to get that or gain
all this muscle and become this giant
ass like ripped woman by lifting weights
and eating a lot of protein and that's
literally so far from the truth it is so
hard to gain muscle and to get like
giant honestly so it is I guess trainer
approved and it's very high protein low
sugar low cards a lot of vegetables a
lot of complex carbs so brown rice seeds
things like that there's not a lot of
fruit I'm so sorry I wish I could say
that there was I'm going to get real I
don't be as with people here the first
thing week of eating healthy is
literally hell on earth it's like
where's the pizza like where is the ice
cream I hate every big a grumpy I just
want sugar but it's going to pass but
you will start feeling really good and
energized and I'm not gonna lie like
sometimes I take
between deeds on my day it's fine
you know try to eat things that are
packaged with five ingredients or less I
mean I guess you could technically be
like well like budge has five
ingredients and it's like sugar and fat
and whatever but you know I mean okay
the thing I really like about this
eating plan is that it's very accessible
it's pretty easy there's no like find
this like matcha powder at your local
store that's for billion dollars
nothing like that not a chicken you guys
how much chicken
I'm so sorry little chickens I've been
eating so many of you let's get started
so for breakfast I've made two egg
whites with one egg and a third of a cup
of oats and then I add a tablespoon of
cocoa powder to my oats and then a
teaspoon maybe teaspoon and a half of
peanut butter to my oats as well it kind
of makes it less sad and then if you're
feeling salty at a little Truvia if you
want some sweetness and life pour that
over and then enjoy yourself in front of
the TV and have a good time and watch
the news and please be sure to put up
your dishes otherwise your roommate
might kill you and we don't want any of
that happening here so that's the
breakfast alright so I just got out of
the gym don't worry I'm not driving and
doing this at the same time I'm Park
within 30 minutes you better have some
sort of like quick protein powder drink
every once in a while I treat myself
with this $5 shake and it's literally
just hemp milk and a really good protein
powder and ice just try to avoid any
high sugar protein powder so aim for a
protein powder that has less than 5
grams of sugar per serving my favorite
one is Trader Joe's chocolates actually
really good but this one's like
super bougie but I treat myself because
I deserve it
so yeah this is my post-workout and I
act okay it's Coffee time I have a
little bit of milk to my coffee
um and then I sit there sip on it and
wait for snack time which involves
regular Greek yogurt with a little bit
of fiber and a teaspoon of jam just to
treat myself and then it's not the most
appetizing looking thing but it tastes /
it a bomb so then I make sweet potatoes
toast which are cut off the end of the
sweet potato and slice it like toast and
then I prep one half an avocado and once
the toast is out of the toaster I add
some salt crushed red pepper and mash up
that avocado I put it on top and then
garnish it with a little bit of pepper
spicy and then it looks like a little
avocado toast but instead of bread
you've got sweet potato and okay stuff
very good
so yeah pretty easy alright well I
messed up a little bit here because
people made homemade Twinkies in the
office so I just kind of took a bite but
it's fine here comes the chicken yo my
lunch grilled chicken and yams that's
right all right making some salmon for
dinner with some vegetables I'm really
in the article part
we've got peppers here and my favorite
allow me to show the brand this is not
Brandis is cauliflower rice so ranked
cauliflower it's a great substitution
for bright so we're going to like salt
sauce salt pepper pepper pepper and then
cook up this stuff and I'll say yeah so
I have my pan here with some salt and
pepper and some garlic it might be a lot
you're like I live up there garlic
um so we're going to let that heat up a
little bit and put our veggies in and
then really it with salmon try and get
wild salmon you guys I know that that
sounds kind of weird and like it's
expensive but wild salmon is a lot
better for you for the environment and
there's no color added it's really one
of the things that I for John is salmon
being wild or really any fish hmm
check out that sizzle alright so while
my veggies are the crossing a little bit
I'm going to take my Salamone okay
I'm going to take my cellphone put it on
medium-high heat and you want to hear a
nice sizzle hear that okay
now that each bigger vehicle comes
across with a little I'm gonna add one
cup of my colors alright to the mix here
and add a little more seasoning alright
and there you have it
Gordon Ramsay would be proud actually he
was probably not care and hate it but
this is great because it's a lot of food
you can say like your finance it's a lot
of food for low calories because like a
girl's gotta eat
alright you guys this is going to sound
weird but this is what I make - it's
like hot chocolate it's called golden
milk and you're going to see the
ingredients me like ah this is gross but
it's actually really really good
and I really enjoy it so what I usually
do is take some almond milk a full cup
and then a teaspoon of turmeric a little
pinch of powdered ginger half a teaspoon
of cinnamon and actually a pinch of
black pepper on that brings out all the
flavors and also you got to make it so
you're going to bring your full cup of
almond milk and your tumeric which is
about a teaspoon if you're not used to
probably do half a teaspoon and then
half a teaspoon of cinnamon in your
little bit of pepper and put it over a
medium heat in a saucepan and you're
going to wait for it to just about boil
and then let it simmer for 10 minutes to
kind of get those flavors all in there
also if you need to whisk everything
together or you can put it in a blender
but like I'm pretty lazy so okay so
after you've let it simmer for a bit you
are going to unveil it and it should be
this really interesting bile color I'm
just kidding it tasted really good so
you can like whisk it around some people
strain it I don't but if it's a little
too Gendry for you you can add a little
bit of Truvia I'll taste better it kind
of tastes like a chai tea latte it's
pretty good yes and I pour it into one
my favorite cup and then I eat it with a
couple pieces of dark childhood pretty
nude you know it's getting towards the
end of the night and sometimes I get a
little hungry
sometimes I don't it's oh my god
I almost choked I almost choked up
chocolate anyway sometimes I get a
little hankering for something and I'll
just make some air popped popcorn or
another good snack is an apple and a
little bit of powdered peanut butter I
really like that too but yeah you know
this is my typical day of eating when
I'm trying to just bring out a little
and I don't know maybe I'll make some
air popped popcorn
