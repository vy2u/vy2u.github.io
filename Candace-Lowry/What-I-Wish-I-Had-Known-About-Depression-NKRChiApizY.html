I always thought that it was just
somebody who is sad for no reason and
they needed to just suck it up until it
happened to me hey everyone welcome back
to my channel today might be a little
more serious I just wanted to talk about
depression and suicide and things that I
didn't know about depression before I
had it and before I was a suicide crisis
counselor I hope this video is able to
educate anyone going through depression
or having suicidal thoughts and I hope
this also helps anyone who knows
somebody who's going through this that
might just not understand it and that's
perfectly normal I will never know what
it's like to be a dude but you know I
try to sympathize I think after watching
13 reasons why I just really felt like I
needed to make this video and make
things clearer I loved the show honestly
I love the show but there are some
problems I have with it so I guess
getting started the first thing that you
should not do is base all of your
knowledge on suicide and depression from
13 reasons why yes I'm very happy that
it gets the conversation started and yes
I'm very happy that it shows that in
such a raw way but at the same time it
made suicide appear to be something that
can be vindictive and vengeful the
second thing that I wish I had known is
that depression is an illness it is not
a phase it is not being sad it is not
something that you know people just feel
like having it is an illness and if
somebody tells you otherwise
you better crack open a book because
it's all about chemicals in your brain
it is something that a lot of people
can't control and don't have control
over and I think a lot of what I've been
getting that makes me really upset on
some of these suicide calls is that
people's parents think it's stupid it's
not real it doesn't exist and if this
helps you realize that it is real and it
is something other than your teen just
being Moody I hope you can see that and
understand that and know that having
depression is just like having a sore
throat or having a stomach virus there
are medicines that help and if you go
too long without helping your sore
throat it's just going to get worse
antidepressants are not an easy fix and
do not help you very quickly
antidepressants take about four to six
weeks to start working and in that time
is when it is most valuable to be
supporting others going through it you
get on these pills and you're waiting
for yourself to get better and you all
you want is to just wake up and not have
these dots and there is a day where you
wake up and you can finally breathe
again
it's like you're back to being a
completely normal person and those
things take time and I hope if any of
you are going through that or I've
recently started taking an
antidepressant just know that it will
take time and that sucks because the
last thing you want to do after getting
help is having to wait more and having
to wait longer the third thing that I
recently learned is that you don't
commit suicide you die by it nobody
commits suicide I know that you know
especially being a spiritual and
religious person I grew up thinking that
too
side was the worst sin you could ever
commit there are some times where people
- - in their lives and they're just not
in the right state of mind it's not of
being selfish it's not out of being a
bad person it's just that the weight of
the world or their thoughts are just so
bad that they feel like they can't go on
anymore it's not thinking rationally and
that's part of my job is to help people
rationalize and to gather their thoughts
and to feel like they can have a way out
and they can do something better the
next thing is that depression is a lot
more than being sad you are tired all
day you are crying for no reason you are
either eating a lot or not eating
anything at all and the last thing you
want to do is get up and do anything
depression is feeling almost nothing
it's just this empty feeling of
nothingness and all you do is cry that
mades me to my next point which is that
depression is very misunderstood still
and it is extremely stigmatized and I
didn't realize that until I started
working the suicide lines that there are
so many parents and friends out there
that just don't believe it's real don't
believe it exists and that breaks my
heart every day and I want anyone to
know who is going through this that this
is a very real thing your feelings are
valid and you need to know that there is
a way out and there's always somebody
willing to talk to you anybody can get
depression there are higher rates of
that or depending on your demographic
information but just because you have
all the money in the world and you have
a great family does not mean you can't
get depression I felt so guilty every
day that I was so sad
and so empty and I had nothing to be sad
about I felt like a super shitty person
because I had a great family I had a job
I had everything I needed and yet I woke
up every day and felt like everything
was meaningless and you start to feel
really guilty about that through the
process of having it though there are
things that you can do you can find
things that just keep your mind off of
what's going on but I know that sounds
so dumb because people are probably like
it's going on constantly everybody has
their own way to heal and mine was
listening to comedy shows and listening
to books I don't know why I don't enjoy
reading them I'm sorry I also fell in
love with a book called the diving bell
and the butterfly which sounds very
bougie but it's actually very good
having any kind of audio book or
stand-up special was a really good thing
to have on hand in case those thoughts
started coming in my head I could
immediately play something like that and
just get wrapped up into a new story or
book if I know that I've helped at least
one person that's all that matters and I
really hope that this was able to help
you I know that this is super sad now
but it's not about being sad this is
about adulting and it's about learning
everything from getting fit eating the
right things
comparing ice cream trying Victoria's
Secret diets but also taking care of
your mental health and a lot of people
forget about that I really feel like I
look like Tana mojo tan among good kata
Medea I don't know her name okay I just
don't eat ana keep this video big thumbs
up if I helped if I didn't let me know
if I got something wrong well I get that
enough already but what the hell I will
also include the number to the suicide
hotline in case there's anyone you know
who is going through suicidal suicidal
thoughts or depression or if you are
going through those things the people
you talk to completely
animus and it's just someone to talk to
and have someone not judge you see you
next time it will be a much happier
video but subscribe click the Bell
button and I guess Burke and I guess
check me out on Instagram Twitter
everything like that
so love you guys see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
