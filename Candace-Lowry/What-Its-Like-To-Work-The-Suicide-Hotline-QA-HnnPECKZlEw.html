I'm sorry my room is really messy right
now I just got back from a trip to
Boston and I'm putting everything back
so after recent events ranging from you
know logic song the Logan Paul saga and
recent suicides in the news I figured
that this was a good time to talk about
what I do on the weekend I'm a suicide
hotline operator so basically I take the
suicide hotline calls you know what you
hear at the number you hear in the logic
music video the National Suicide
Prevention lifeline is where I'm at
essentially I do this in four-hour
shifts every week and I work with an
incredible group of people and I just
wanted to answer the most common
questions that I get and you know any
questions people have when they call
because it's a very scary thing to do
and it does require a lot of courage
what I do is I'll pick up the phone I
have no idea who's gonna be on the other
end and it is absolutely terrifying and
you know it can range from a two-minute
to 50-minute call you know I think my
longest call was a little over an hour
it can be anyone who is just calling
about their friend and they don't really
know what to do or someone who is
actively acting on a suicide the first
question I always get asked is how did
you get started I was really interested
in helping people going through suicidal
thoughts loss of suicide and depression
everyone always asked me like what my
personal gain is from this and I'm like
I just kind of wanted to do it to help
people
like is that so weird and you go through
this pretty rigorous interview process
and it's well it was about ten weeks of
weekend training noob ranges from just
learning about mental illnesses how to
pick up the phone
HIPAA rules and then just getting into
practice calls and you learn so much
about how to help people who are in this
state and you know I went through a
serious bout of depression and I still
get bad days but I was never truly
suicidal the biggest thing when someone
you know is feeling suicidal is to talk
about it and to ask them about it and
not try to help them with all the
answers the truth is is that there is no
one single answer the most important
thing is to help people in the darkness
and be in that darkness with them and I
think we as people get so afraid that
someone's gonna immediately act on it
that they're gonna like go do something
crazy and that's seriously not the case
when someone is suicidal they just want
to talk to someone without feeling like
a crazy person so the next question is
what happens on a call the biggest thing
that I think people don't understand is
that we're people too and it's scary for
us too and we're just here to have a
conversation and this is to help people
in immediate crisis and my goal is to be
someone that you can talk to completely
anonymously
without judgment and about anything some
people think I'm gonna be like your
personal NSA agent and I'm gonna write
everything about you and I'm gonna be
you know knowing all these things and
reporting all these things and it's it's
really just about talking to you and
getting you in a safe space and finding
a way to help you feel better and just
provide momentary relief I'll calculate
your risk based off of answering
questions you know I'll figure out if
someone has a plan
you know their method has the time or
someone could just be thinking about it
and those are two vastly different
situations the most important thing is
to listen and not be providing all the
answers the call is not about us I could
sit there man oh well you know I was
depressed for a while this and then that
but that would take away their
importance and my job is to make you
feel better and to help you a lot of
people have been asking me about the
logan paul controversy and it was an act
that stemmed completely from immaturity
and ignorance I can't speak for the
Japanese culture I'm not Japanese you
know about what he did in the city but
in terms of what he did in the forest
was unacceptable I saw that video not
only as something that was super super
insensitive but also you know Jeff Japan
has such a high suicide rate and and
that was one person who didn't have
someone to talk to and didn't have
someone to rely on and to help them and
that was what really made me sad was
that you know that person experienced so
much pain that they were blinded by the
fact that there were possibly people
that could help him when you get hit
with depression it completely blinds you
from everything good in your life and
that's what I think people don't realize
is that depression is not just being sad
it's like you know you don't feel and
it's so tiring and you're so exhausted
that the only thing that you think can
cure it is dying by suicide the next
thing that has been insane is logic song
we see a thirty to fifty percent
increase in calls from the logic song
it's really cool what he's doing and
I think that he didn't realize it would
have such an impact that you know our
call center would be like oh my god
there are so many people calling right
now but I think he will finally felt
like there was some sort of glimmer of
hope people often ask me what the
hardest calls for me to take are and
that is teens who have parents who
neglect them there are so many teens who
call and they need someone to talk to
and I am literally the only person that
will believe that they're going through
what they're going through
it shows how broken the mental health
system is in a way and the stigma with
mental health and you know I'm able to
provide them with resources with therapy
with teen line that they can talk to but
I mean if you're a parent please don't
be afraid to talk to your kids people
fail to realize that there is so much
good that needs to be done in this world
and they just hope that the universe
will provide it and it's our job to use
the free time we have to be a good
person and to help people and it's made
me a better person it's made me
understand meant my mental illness more
I hope that this video helped I know a
lot of people are really nervous to call
the hotline and I hope that this helped
you feel a little more familiar with it
you can always call this 24/7 someone
will always pick up and someone will
always be there to listen do we get
pranks yes it's really annoying
and it's really rude but I believe
Karma's a bitch so the hardest part
about all of this is not taking it home
with you there are so many people that I
have stopped during a suicide attempt
that I have had to intervene with there
are people who were abused by their
parents there are people who didn't have
any friends who were big strong manly
men
we're crying on the phone to me and I
think about them often they have to
trust that I did my job and I have to
trust that I gave them enough resources
and that they'll be ok and I hope that
this wasn't boring and that it was
educational but you could always ask me
questions below and I will try to answer
as many questions as you have please ask
them in the comments and I hope this
helped if you guys want to be a suicide
hotline or crisis hotline operator I'll
also include that information in my
comments below and you know I hope that
this shed some light on what it's like
to actually pick up those calls and to
be there for people I really hope that
this opens up your mind to how to
approach someone who is feeling suicidal
and yeah I love you all and I hope that
you guys have a good day and I know this
was a downer but my next video I promise
is happy and you guys are great and I
don't know what else to say but bye guys
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
