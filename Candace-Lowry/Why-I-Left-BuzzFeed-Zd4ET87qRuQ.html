will not be as good as Chris's video
okay so if you're expecting something
cool to happen I'm so sorry it's just me
and bugs here okay so in my last video
will not last video I kind of like
dropped the ball it's like a couple of
years ago the weeks later I told you
guys how I got my job at BuzzFeed and
now I'm going to tell you how I left and
why I left so I was at BuzzFeed for two
and a half years and I started out as a
writer and then I moved on to the video
department where I was working as kind
of like a liaison between edit and video
and bridging the gap between the two I
worked on helping producers brainstorm
and finding new ways to bring our
editorial post to life in video as well
and a lot of my job was also okay let's
see I'm filming a video if you think a
lot of my job was brainstorming a ton
and working with people on Misty at Tacy
topknot and then eventually the ladies a
lady like so I kind of have a different
background story I guess I was never a
producer I was a social video strategist
and then eventually a senior social
video strategist but I also got to be in
videos as well which was really really
fun and it was really awesome to see
fuzzy redone
okay come here anyway like I was saying
hey it was really cool to see all of
these videos and producers ideas come to
life and I got to kind of see every
single part of it but eventually you
know I got a little tired but I really
wasn't looking for a way out I wasn't
actively searching for a job and
PopSugar came to me and actually
recruited me to come work for them and I
had a really hard time figuring out what
to do because I was at BuzzFeed for like
I said like two and a half years and
some of my best friends were working
there Oh everybody gets really really
close to each other in these videos and
making these videos and seeing things of
work and we're brainstorming all day and
God bless the producers they're there
24/7 and they work so hard and it felt
like I was graduating college and I was
leaving all of these really great
friends and I was stuck at this point
where I had to decide if I wanted to
kind of move on to get this promotion
and really see if I can grow a page
without the backing of BuzzFeed or if I
wanted to stay a BuzzFeed and continue
to grow a BuzzFeed and it was really
really hard and I think I I wanted to
challenge myself and I wanted to see
what else was out there and I was dying
I will tell you right now I dread it
having to tell my boss that I was
leaving and put in my two weeks and it
was horrific and I was shaking and I was
crying and it was really really hard to
leave and I know that every single
person who had left has had a really
hard time because BuzzFeed is very
unique in that it
it almost feels like a secret club it
feels like almost a lot of people say
cultish but it's that you know you're
always told that you're the best of the
best and the brightest of the brightest
and then when you're faced with another
opportunity it's like is it stepping
down it's not the right thing to do am I
already at the highest place and you
kind of playing mind games with yourself
and you know I had to take that leap and
try something new and go somewhere else
and it was really hard and a lot of
people told me I was going to make a
huge mistake
and a lot of people told me everything I
was going to do wasn't ever going to
amount up to what I was doing at
BuzzFeed and it was really really tough
and if anything I want this video to
teach you that you know what you think
is your dream job or what you think is
the best thing in the world might not
always be your path and that's okay and
sometimes you want to leave and
challenge yourself and that's totally
normal and ultimately what I had to do
was follow my heart
I can't which sounds so lame but I
really had to bring my decisions and I
left and I actually left a year ago next
month which is insane it's insane to me
and afterwards I've been seeing like
softly Chris left right before me Jordan
and then staff was gone and Michelle was
gone and it's all these people that are
kind of forging their own paths which is
incredible and you know it's scary
because people sometimes act like there
is no hope without BuzzFeed there is no
life after BuzzFeed and there really is
and that goes for saying that any
company but it's terrifying gastly
even you know I loved everyone at
BuzzFeed and I made some of the best
friendships that I still have and I
still you know you see me working with
people that have left as well but you
know to be honest it was really hard to
face that reality that other producers
couldn't come out and create content
with me and soften there was this
there's been this weird opera myth since
a lot of people have left and you know
there's this divide I love where I work
now and it's been really great and I
feel very valued and I really appreciate
the opportunity that I have now and it
it was really a tough decision because
I've never quit a job before you know
quitting is awful like I thought that
getting your job was awful quitting is
so hard especially when you don't want
to disappoint someone that you really
care about I just wanted to talk a
little bit about you know other people's
reasons for leaving if I agree with that
what's going on because I'm sure a lot
of you guys are asking that as well and
I'm still getting asked if I still work
at BuzzFeed and it's been a year and I
think part of it is that I don't want my
identity to solely be Buffy you know I
want to be able to create this own path
and to be able to collaborate with
anyone everywhere and to have creative
freedoms you know when you're a producer
you do everything which is an incredible
learning opportunity because you learn
how to edit manage sound direct produce
do the lighting you know you learn
everything and it's something I would
definitely recommend people to do
because you're just given equipment and
you can go do whatever you want but on
the flip side yeah you're not allowed to
collaborate with people or have outside
projects which that can be really tough
and
that's something that people struggle
with it's a little different at BuzzFeed
compared to like a lot of other
companies because once you're on camera
you really can potentially gain this
online presence and then you have a
brand and then people are kind of set
with this dilemma of what do I want my
personal brand to be and you really want
to be in an environment that's very
nourishing and encouraging and
collaborative and you want to be in a
place where you are really valued and
it's really hard to do that at a place
like BuzzFeed because everyone is so
great everyone's so good and you can
feel like you're getting lost in the
shuffle a little bit and you want to
prove that you are more than just
someone at BuzzFeed and I'm going to
admit right now of course without
BuzzFeed I would not have a social
following like this I would not ever in
a million years have the opportunities
that I do today I tell other people I
see BuzzFeed us as like a Saturday Night
Live of YouTube of the Internet and you
get to do all these creative sketches
and everything like that and sometimes
like Amy Poehler Tina Fey not that I'm
comparing myself to them like all those
cast members and stuff they got to
create their own projects and they're
embraced for that and I think that you
know people who leave BuzzFeed should
feel the same way sometimes there isn't
that encouragement and sometimes there
isn't that support and feeling like
you're approved to move on I guess which
is a little understandable by BuzzFeed
is that you know they have great talent
and they don't want to lose them of
course but then when you're able to
create all these things on your own and
have all this freedom a lot of people do
decide to leave it's been weird seeing
everyone leave and seeing the reactions
and seeing all that happen but I'm proud
of everyone who works there and I'm
proud of the people that last and I'm
proud of myself for getting out there
and just know that no one can control
what you
and ultimately when it comes down to
your career you really have to do what's
best for you and what's best for inside
who's your art you know mentally
physically anything like that in terms
of what I'm doing I'm kind of doing both
right now I'm working full-time and I am
allowed to have this channel on the side
which I'm very thankful for right now
I'm working on a show with them called
poor decisions and that's on top sugar
Girls Guide and it's so fun and we've
had a bunch of great people in I'll put
the link in the description below but
I'm also really thankful really thankful
I'm allowed to post on here and talk to
you guys one on one as just myself you
know I'm really happy to show you the
mills who's going to be on this channel
and all the fun things were going to do
and yeah I didn't get fired a lot of
people think I got fired
I did not but yeah I hope that's really
shed some light on why I left and what's
going on you know I'm a pop sugar check

Thursday sauce gonna be in an upcoming
