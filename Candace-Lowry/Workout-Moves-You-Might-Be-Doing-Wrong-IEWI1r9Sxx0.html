today I'm gonna teach you some oh my god
my boobs
whoo today I am going to teach you some
proper and improper exercise forms
because form is so important and I've
noticed that as I've kind of shifted
away from personal training and gone
into these group exercise classes nobody
is really paying attention to your form
24/7 and you can really injure yourself
if you're not doing it right and if
you're going too fast
I've noticed that some people think that
going faster means it's gonna be better
and they're gonna get better results but
that can actually screw up with your
form
I just compiled a couple common
exercises that I do that I see in the
workout classes a lot and kind of gonna
show you the right and wrong way to do
this at home I like to use my dumbbells
my yoga mat and then a couple other
strength things like a jump rope and
things like that but I usually buy
everything online and this video is
sponsored by honey it's a totally free
extension to you guys I use it everyday
because I love saving money and it
basically compiles all the coupons for
every website out there and then applies
it to your purchase at checkout and you
can save a ton of money and it runs
through all the coupons and that's
really what I do when buying fitness
equipment because it can be so expensive
and I love free money
who doesn't love for your money so honey
is 5 million strong including me as one
of them if that helps you it really has
been life-changing for me
so you just download it it's on Safari
Firefox Google Chrome I'm not gonna
judge you or what you use unless it's
Internet Explorer I'm just kidding so if
you buy any of this exercise
equipment or you want to start your own
kind of home gym so you don't have to go
to the gym everyday be sure to add honey
and I'll link a little code below that
you can do it and again it's totally
free all right let's get into judging
your farm let's start with a proper
push-up form you see my bodies in a
straight line and I'm just slowly going
down be patient with me I'm working on
my full pushup
here's with your knees down and be sure
to keep your hands right below your
shoulders not this where your body is
basically curved upwards it makes it
look a lot easier than it is and not
this please don't keep your hips down
it's gonna hurt your body and I see a
lot of people doing this make sure with
a bicep curl that you have a weight
that's appropriate for you and feels
right you don't want to strain too hard
getting that weight up there and make
sure that you kind of twist your wrist
as you come up to the top to make that
full transition as you can see my core
is tight and engaged and I'm slowly
moving up and down here and nothing is
too hard for me
now the improper way that people do is
they try to get the heaviest weight
possible and they throw their hips into
it which really hurts your form and it
also isn't really being that effective
so don't be scared if you start out with
lower weights moving on to a simpler row
you want to make sure that your spine is
aligned and it's flat and you keep your
neck in line with your spine as well and
you want to really work on pinching that
shoulder blade together with the other
one so avoid rounding your back and kind
of pulling that up all across your whole
body because really doesn't look that
great here moving on to a standard lunge
you want to make sure that you are
standing upright your shoulders are up
and that knee does not come past that
toe so let's show it one more time
sanding up right and I have a great
90-degree angle going on with that foot
now the wrong thing is to lean that knee
in front of that toe I don't know why I
did this to myself and a lot of people
tend to be off balance as well which can
kind of hurt your knees and cause you to
wobble a little bit and have our getting
up okay
and just make sure that your core is
engaged like so so that you can even
grab weights and if you're it's not
engaged you're gonna turn all around and
really kind of hurt your knees and your
body as well moving on to a tricep dip
you're gonna basically turn yourself
into a reverse plank here and hold up
your body with your arms and you're
gonna want to dip down by bending the
elbows and try not to bend your legs and
keep yourself so far away from that
chair or bench to where you're really
straining and keeping those shoulders
above your ears moving onto a standard
plank just like in the push-up you want
to make sure that you have a pretty
straight body going on there and that
your arms are right below your shoulders
make sure that that booty is not up in
the air because we're not gonna get
results with that alright and we also
don't want to keep that torso down there
cuz it hurts even more so let's do a
wall sit here be a little sexy up
against the wall make sure that your
knees are at a 90 degree angle and that
your back is flat and relaxed and you
know you're just gonna want to stand
there and die and you're gonna hate
everything but it's okay so we're gonna
chill here make sure that again
your knees are feeling good all right
this is not good not good form here you
guys you want to engage in there and
some people think that this is engaging
it's not make sure you're all the way
down there but don't go too far and look
like you're pooping okay
all right finally we're doing a deadlift
here you want to make sure you have that
flat back when you're going down and
keep
that neck engaged with your spine as
well and make sure that you're not
bending over like so and using your back
to pull yourself up you're gonna want to
pull your hips forward this is all about
a hip hinge and you don't want to round
your back and just kind of fall down you
want to make sure that your hamstrings
are almost feeling tight when you go
down and make sure that that booty is
just not popped forward like this yeah
you're gonna you're gonna hurt your back
okay I literally just ran into a wall oh
my god okay anyway I hope you liked this
video and I hope I helped you with a
couple workout moves and just remember
everybody's different my mobility is not
great in my hips so you might not see me
bend down that much but it's all work in
progress and I promise you're gonna be
okay and every day is a step to success
okay I'm done being cheesy but yeah I
really hope you guys like this video I
know it's like a little short and kind
of just like hey here's something to do
