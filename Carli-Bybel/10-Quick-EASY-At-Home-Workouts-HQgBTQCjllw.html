now I'm one of my favorite exercises for
the legs at least is the three tricep
lunge
the first lunch probably gonna keep her
but that's not lunging tense in the back
just going to put all the weight on your
toes and she's going to come forward and
lunge is going to work out her
excuse me quads hamstrings or butt
ladies your butt
Bela's her butt and enter cap this is
really good for the house if it's like
you have to have weights you could be
actually right used to
for the second part of the lunch I set
Carly's me to do alternating regular
lunges with five pounds in each hands
like sup now I know what the reason is
you got me think about third part of the
lunge try set that's kicking us off it's
going to be the hardest one we have peak
throwing up okay so she's going to lunge
forward step through and come up with
your other leg and curl up and then you
go back down and back up
right then you alternate ups just going
to come through like this dropping I'm
right right up squeeze the ABS I'm right
down the same time it's working the
bicep even a little bit of tricep
working your core jump it
and now I know what the reason is
okay so the fourth workout we're going
to do is a form a squat one of my
favorites
ladies group obviously if you don't know
about it will become your favorite work
with me I promise you're going to get
into a ballerina type pose we're going
to get up on your tippy toes
put the weight above you like Pat and
you're a squat as low as you go is
better or go to your conformity
you know don't tendency to stay on your
tippy toes the whole time you're tensing
your cast but at the same time gonna
work the rest of your leg lower back but
we all love bucks
hey go Lutz and Carly will show on the
side
oh yes everything
I gotta be ready just the last of my
favorite work has to do at home is going
to involve one of the chairs from the
dinner table if you take any chair
doesn't matter
the first exercise gonna be one of three
in a continuous motor is going to be a
side lateral raise with the leg which is
going to do an oblique crunch and then I
kick back side lateral raise oblique
crunch perfect kick fast how many other
side no you do go through one two three
and you get five reps and use the same
other on the other side actually or two
great five reps once we were pressed
what's the three bobrucz Hey yesterday
was bad but I moved on without it
thought I lost my way about it have to
tell myself
there's always tomorrow Hodgins now we
can be moving on to my favorite
exercises and these ones are definitely
a lot in here and the first one you're
just gonna take a chair you can also use
your couch or sometimes twin ball yeah
he's met before and I actually like
doing this in front of the TV so while
you're watching TV instead of just
sitting on the couch move to here and do
this weekend so all you're going to do
is your arms oh yeah you know all that
stuff but it's really good for your
tricep your forearm also touches a
little bit of the shoulder also the
backlight shoulders and you continue
this for 3 sets of 10 so I'm like that 2
sets of 10 whatever is easier few ladies
fellas honest so just watch this good
I made
about it it's a new
the second thing that I'm going to be
doing is also using the same chair and
these are just nice the shops you can do
it all for but I like to see the thing
about these is that it's going to be
able to work tricep provides are the
best thing you can do it on any easy or
keep your body straight above from here
straight line it's a new day
the next exercise is going to be with
his ball and I've had this forever I got
to 10 a.m. on Jan 25 bucks all I'm going
to do on these are crunches and I'm
confusing at 8:00 per week she'll also
sell on Amazon but with Trimble uneven
type on books and I'm going to hold it
to my chest and oh is it amazing
sorry always change and supported if you
like stable every time you come up you
want to breathe out and punch you pen so
you tense your abs breathe in as you go
back without as much as you fare best
you've got to change the way and looking
at the pages problem second row gotta
move it out as no one invented Linder
these are crunches one of our other
favorites so she practices when she has
to punch me in the face
come on basically and you punch the
props he's going to work the obliques at
the same time from back elbows in arch
cross across the back elbows in punch
got mean right up
the
so the final exercise today is gonna be
a little bit funny everyone makes fun of
me and my friends every time they're
over let make fun of me and play with it
but i legit bought a shake weight and if
you guys haven't seen the commercials
they're just like i don't know it just
was an easy way for me to work out
without having to go to gym so I got
this for like 1995 and I've had it for
like two years and I swear whenever I'm
bored or at night I before I go to bed I
just sit there and I do it in the mirror
and I'll show you like two of my
favorite ones comes with a couple
different exercises but all you do first
is you hold your hands like this and you
just shake and I promise you you feel it
like in your arms a lot just like this
and you're supposed to do it until I
just do it until I get really hard to
then wants it hard to couch like 10 and
then the other thing that I always do is
behind my head and this is good what
muscles this teacher tricep choice is
good so you do the same thing and you
have to tense your elbows and shape so
it's super easy if you do get the shake
weight it comes with a CD with showing
you the different exercises and I
believe there's different videos on
YouTube showing your exercises so that's
going to be it for my exercises I did my
favorite five of my favorites and then
five of grunts neighbor stuff we've been
doing together and you have so that's
basically it for my exercises I wouldn't
change it up every two weeks and lucky
for me I had a friend to motivate me and
push me just without him I would still
be sitting around so um go check out his
channel and I'm going to put the link
below and expect a lot of new workout
videos from fret and maybe I'll pop in a
few
