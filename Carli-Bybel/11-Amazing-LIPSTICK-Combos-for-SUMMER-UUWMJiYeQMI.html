and try
sure
he's just outside
hi my love thank you for watching I'm
sorry it's been forever since I've
posted a video if you guys follow me on
any of my social media you probably saw
that I was in Minnesota last weekend I
had such an amazing time and it was too
quick of a trip but I'm finally back
home and I wanted to film today for you
guys today I'm gonna show you my top
favorite lipstick combinations for
summer I'm gonna show you guys swatches
on my lips of every color instead of on
my arm because I think that'll be a lot
better
I actually met someone in Minnesota and
they suggested this video idea and it
kind of just stuck with me also I can't
stress it enough that you can mix
lipsticks together to get a very similar
color so I'm gonna take you through a
couple different lipstick combinations
so if you want to see what they are
please keep watching for luck number one
I'm going to be lining my lips with my
favorite lip liner which is the tawny
and then over that I'm applying peach
stock lipstick by Mac and fer gloss I'm
using the nude by Gerard cosmetics and
this is my go-to perfect nude lip for
the summer time it's a perfect color
nude for my skin tone so I love this
combination for look number two I'm
lining my lips with the color pink lady
by motives and right over that I'm using
Bobette by Lime Crime and this is going
to give you a perfect nude pink color
grabbing my silly lip liner by Mac I'm
going to be outlining my lips and
shooting them in a bit
the difference between this look and the
others is I'm going to make it have an
ombre effect so applying this lighter
pink NYX color on the inner parts of my
lips and then I'm taking the lip liner
and then I'm going to slowly blend it
into the lip color and this is going to
give it a really pretty ombre look this
is also going to make your lips appear
larger by having it fade from dark to
light
for the next look I'm using the same lip
liner in the color silly side note it is
so bad but you could see my eyelash glue
so I do apologize because it's very
distracting but I didn't realize it of
course until after but back to the video
I am wearing the color and passion on my
lips and I think a nice bright pink
color is perfect for the summertime and
I love these two mixed together next I'm
using the color tangerine dream by Mac
and this is gonna give you a yellowy
orange color and I love orange for the
summer this year I'm using my makeup
forever lip liner in this peach color to
align my lips to finish it off and this
is going to give you a really nice
simple orange lip
then I'm grabbing the color laughing
sensation by Mac as well and I'm going
to be outlining my lips with this look
I'm also going to be doing an ombre look
so I'm applying this nude color by NYX
right on the center of my lips and then
I'm doing the same technique that I had
done previously
so the next one is definitely my
favorite out of all of them I'm using
this NYX pencil to line my lips and then
over that I'm using the color coy by
dose of colors this is the perfect
perfect the light orange color and I
absolutely love it and then right over
that I'm applying the color coral craze
gloss and this is going to be the final
result next I'm lining my lips with this
cherry colored lip liner and then over
that I'm using the color sweet nectar by
Milani
and it's gonna give you a nice bright
red-orange II colored lip and I think
summer is the perfect time to experiment
with bright colors and oranges are huge
this year so I thought adding a red
liner instead of an orange liner would
give it a really fun bright looking
color that I definitely will be using a
lot this summer quickly I'm just wiping
off the orange lipstick and then I'm
just applying this red lipstick by
covergirl right over that because since
I already use the red liner there's no
reason for me to read outline them but
it's gonna give you the perfect red lip
and these two combinations are available
at your drugstore which is perfect for
those of you on a budget this next look
was one that I posted recently on my
Instagram I'm using a eyeliner actually
as my lip liner this one is by Jordana
and then I'm using the NYX macaroon
lipstick in the color violet and then
I'm also mixing in those of colors in
the color dark secret and that's gonna
give you this really pretty purple look
and then the final look is also one of
my favorites I'm using this new lip
liner that I got from Kiko cosmetics and
then for lipstick I'm using by coloured
raine cosmetics the color lavender rain
and then I'm gonna do the ombre effect a
little bit as well a mist look and it's
gonna give you a really really pretty
light purple color and again this one is
amazing and perfect for summer and I
will definitely be using this a lot
so that is it for now I hope you guys
enjoyed these lip combos it's a little
different instead of swatching them I
wanted to try them on so you can see how
it actually looks on but I love all
these colors for spring in the summer
time well I guess it's not really spring
anymore but for summertime I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and until next
time I'll see you guys later
swill die
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
