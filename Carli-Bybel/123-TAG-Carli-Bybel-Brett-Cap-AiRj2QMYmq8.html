biggest yeah Carly knows me guys no I'm
just kidding
um okay ba go ahead you didn't know it
well you know sup Shawshank Redemption
but recently we've seen it on TV you
didn't see the movie it's obviously an
awesome movie right what do you think
Shane yeah I watched the whole movie
multiple times number nine a meteor just
hit you saved everything important
what would I go back to get everything
important meaning like pictures
documents okay
like your pets what we don't pass like
everything like necessities so every
wise when I come back for ya okay ready
one leash I gotta think about it's
really really tough
why you gotta give the most obvious one
cuz you know that I already took all my
cards and my box of stuff that I got
from my peel box and all my favorites
like all those are in play cuz your
clothes going no I use your makeup god
no is your your shoe collection god no
closet gone what would you get your

cheat makeup okay looks like a type of
makeup she look just well cause I just
take every I just yeah sure literally
just close it up on her back she was
just carrying I could probably hold a
lot of stuff though but all right and
then what would you go come back for
find everything gone and right molding

right
no no you know I should let those burn
all right yeah this is I want this okay
here we go
one two three gennadi shoes yeah baby
cuz she gave them to me so for my first
present so it just has sentimental value
I think I got nine out of ten you really
did well alright we have one last
question
number 10 the saying the same opposites
attract is true because me and Carly are
opposite at ok ready 1 2 3
going to sleep with the TV on that's
true
got one I said height yeah yeah give it
one was the same person okay you you
know that you hate when we sleep with
the TV on yeah so they're not really a
half question to that so you have to do
one for you too and what else are we
opposite at think about it what are we
differentiate and there's a few things
not many there's a few things and
they're they stand out don't hang too
hard don't think too hard you don't have
to it's not it's very you never even be
like whoa one two three music

shut off the radio every single time we
are even if I'm driving she goes not
true
today we listen to three I heard jay-z
Alicia Keys you heard is easy today your
honey over a Rihanna song it's only
reason it was accepted because it was
our favorite country music is

for your mood but you need to meet me
halfway
I'm not saying oh my god yeah hey wait

who actually told you to do that and
then all of a sudden you take all the
credit for it whenever in the car so
