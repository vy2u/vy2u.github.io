today's video I'm going to show you guys
two holiday makeup looks the first look
is what I'm wearing right now and the
second one is a bit more dramatic for
those of you guys who want to step
outside of your comfort zone
Smith hi find my angel did you oh yeah
I'm filming a video I'm gonna show you
look oh look a camera say hi I tell
everyone your name I was school today
you had a party was it a holiday party
yeah oh okay so yes why you guys makeup
on cuz I'm filming a YouTube video for
my makeup Channel ya know I miss you I
just got my two little cousins iPod
Touches for Hanukkah so every single day
around the same time I get my nice
little FaceTime call from my five year
old cousin Brooke and she's just my
favorite princess in the entire world I
love her so much so it's just so funny
so if you guys want to see how I got
these holiday makeup looks please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
using by NYX the infinite shadow stick
I'm applying this all over my eyelid
using my Maybelline nudes palette I'm
grabbing this matte brown shade and I'm
applying it with a large blending brush
right into the crease be careful when
applying this because we don't want to
get it too far down on the eyelid we
want to keep the eyelid as white as
possible grabbing this darker brown
color and a smaller blending brush and
then very lightly blending that into the
crease of my eye and blending it up into
that lighter brown shade
next I'm going to apply a mineral veil
on my eyelid because I'm applying
glitter and I want something for the
glitter to stick to I'm using this
glitter by obsessive compulsive
cosmetics and the color PHA and it's so
beautiful and it's so sparkly and then
I'm going over my eyeliner just because
I wanted to darken it a bit after I did
the sparkles so next I'm applying my
mascara and then it comes false lashes
I'm using my new Carlie lash by the
lower lashes if you guys want to hear a
little bit more about them I posted a
video a few days ago talking all about
it so I'm just adding a little bit of
eyelash glue and I'm just plopping them
on
taking this dark brown matte shade and a
smaller blending brush I'm just adding a
little bit more into the crease to
finish off the look and in the inner
corner of my eye I'm using by Mac the
pigment in the color vanilla moving on
to blush I'm using this darker pink
shade from my new elf blush palette then
I'm grabbing a little bit of the
lightest shade for my contour palette
with my contour brush
for lip liner I'm using by Mac the color
vino and I am just outlining the outer
parts and I'm filling it in a little bit
to give it an ombre look
Oh
highlight I'm using by Becca in the
color opal and I'm just applying this
with my fingers
so this is the final result for look
number one moving on to look number two
this is another sparkly look but it's
super dramatic so I'm just taking a
makeup wipe and I'm gonna try and take
this off as best as I can
so first I'm grabbing my Rimmel
scandaleyes and I'm applying it all over
my eyelid I'm also applying this on my
lower lash line
next I'm grabbing this deep teal color
by Sigma
you
you
you
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed these two makeup looks from
both of these looks I used my new Carlie
lash by velour lashes for those of you
guys who didn't hear about my launch my
previous video talks all about the
lashes also I show you how to apply them
correctly how to care for them and how
to make them last up to 25 times they're
great for a more subtle look or even a
really dramatic look like something like
this so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you guys have an amazing
Christmas and for my fellow Jews out
there that I've been celebrating
Hanukkah for the past week I hope you
guys have an amazing rest of your
Hanukkah as well I love you guys so much
and until next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
