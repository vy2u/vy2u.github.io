is fall Fashion Week here in New York
City so I wanted to do two looks for you
today this is the first look it's gonna
be a little bit of a lighter glam look
and then I'm going to be doing a more
dramatic smoky eye with a nude lip for
my second look and I think these makeup
looks are so perfect for fall fashion
week and fall in general because I think
the dark purples and the cranberries
again I believe are really really big
this year and this first look is for
anyone who doesn't like heavy eye makeup
and they wanted to try something a
little bit new this color on my lips
right now I think is so perfect for fall
and plus it matches my nails and yes I
did take my nails off which it looks so
weird and I'm trying to get used to them
but for a little bit I'm gonna keep the
natural nails because they need to grow
and get healthy and yeah I don't know
it's just a lot easier doing so many
things so if you guys want to learn how
to get these two looks please keep
watching so for the first look I'm going
to be adding lashes with my mascara
sweetly I would pull you to matches as
you cried about her lips I'm using by
Jordana it's the Cabernet lipliner and
it actually is the same color as my
nails I didn't plan that or anything and
I'm just gonna be lining my lips and
when you're using a darker lip liner I
definitely suggest taking your time with
it and using a mirror super close to
your face
you feel
have faded in my reality like leaves
that turn the dust fell asleep inside a
fantasy and I left like this
yeah just cannot escape I wish you had
words what do I say what do I do to show
you all the ways my heart is slowly
shattering
the first color that I use is rebel and
it's more of like a purpley and over
that I'm gonna be using dark side which
is a more maroon color
and then I'm gonna go back to the
lipliner and make sure it's perfect
so if you're not a fan of just a plain
dark red lip
I showed this last year I believe I have
this covergirl double-sided lipstick and
I take the gold side and it looks really
really cool if you just add a little bit
right into the center of your lips
from my new glamorous blush palette I'm
going to be taking this dark pink blush
and just adding a little bit onto my
cheeks
so this is the final results for look
number one and now we're going to go
into a more heavy glam look with some
cranberry eyes so if you want to learn
please keep watching
this is gonna be going all over my
eyelid somehow so grabbing my melon
pigment from Mac and a little bit more
of that liquid I'm gonna be applying
this on my eyelid right over the last
color then moving onto this cranberry
color from my 120 palette I'm gonna be
applying that right on my eyelid and
right under my crease and I'm gonna be
dragging it from about here and then up
into my crease
I'm also gonna be picking up a little
bit of the black to make it a darker
cranberry
grabbing my mac 217 brush I'm going to
be applying these same colors into my
crease and I'm just gonna be picking up
a little bit on the brush and then very
lightly blending it up I just like to
say
I thank God grabbing my Mac 224 brush
and this light beige color I'm then
gonna be blending my crease up into my
brow bones shoes
taking my Mac 219 pencil brush I'm gonna
be grabbing a little bit more the black
and I'm gonna be doing my outer-v
like
that's the blending brush blending it
out
this right
beauty of this
me
when you allow a new home and he needs
some time to decide with the Australian
whether you should give up
as you stand next comes the false lashes
of course if you want them it does give
it a more dramatic look for the lower
lash line I'm gonna be using the same
melon pigment and I'm gonna be applying
that color right in the middle part of
my eye and then in the outer part and
dragging in the middle I'm gonna use
that same cranberry
in the shackles
julen
line my lower lashline I'm going to be
using this thick black liner
tweeted Lacey
this look since it is so dramatic I do
recommend a nude lip with it
it's a good day to be laughs when you're
out on your roll so this is the final
look and I really really love this look
it is super dramatic but it screams fall
in my opinion and for all my fellow
makeup artists out there and makeup
lovers this look is definitely gonna be
fun to try out so I definitely suggest
you try it for Fashion Week this year I
will be attending to fashion shows which
is so exciting because I've never been
before one of them I know is an earlier
show and one of them is later so for the
earlier one I'll probably pick look
number one and the later one I'll
probably do something like this because
I absolutely love this and I think this
is a perfect excuse to wear a little bit
extra makeup so for anyone who wants to
try the second look I do recommend this
for of course a night out or anything
like that so I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and hopefully learn
something new and I definitely dare you
to go out and try it because this look
is definitely I think to date one of my
favorites that I've done so far so I
hope you guys enjoyed and I will talk to
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
