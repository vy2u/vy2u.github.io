thank you for watching I am so excited
to be filming today I think around like
11 maybe 10:30 a.m. we hit four nines of
Skyler's here on YouTube which is just
absolutely mind-blowing like 4 million
people
what if we're like people even look like
I always get mushy with you guys and I
always play guys how much I love you but
I'm just seriously blown away it's been
about 4 and a half years on YouTube and
finally we just hit 3 million it's very
weird to be sitting here saying 4
million but I just wanted to thank every
single one of you you guys are so
amazing and I owe everything that I have
in my life to you guys and I promise I
will never stop making videos for you
guys I mean I will only you don't want
to see them anymore but hopefully that
won't be the case because I really
really love this and I love filling for
you guys and teaching you guys new
tricks and I'm just so excited to be in
this position so thank you so so so much
I'm gonna plan a huge giveaway are
hitting four million like super super
big plus I owe you guys one from the
holiday so I'm just going to combine
them and make it just the biggest
giveaway that I've ever done yet
so stay tuned because I will announce
that as soon as I get back from my
vacation we do leave Saturday morning
for a 8 night
nation I'm actually really excited it's
gonna be so much fun but it is a very
long trip usually when we go away we go
away for like four or five days and
that's usually enough so we'll see how a
full night's go but I'm sure it is gonna
be a blast fun I am going to be a my egg
for a little bit but I'm going to bring
on my filming stuff and try and film
like a tutorial or something while we're
away because it's like to have the time
but I love you guys so much thank you
again for 4 million and as you see how I
got this hair tutorial as well as the
one from my Valentine's Day makeup look
please keep watching so normally when
I've done this look in the past I had
woken up from sleeping with my hair in a
braid so I already had some big loose
waves in my hair I would just have maybe
like a couple wait with a curling wand
but today my hair is pretty straight so
I'm going to just go through and put
some big waves in my hair you guys have
seen me do this a million times so I'm
just going to speed this part up that
way we can get right into the braiding
part but I just wanna let you guys know
today I'm using the new york old
guerrero lawn by Bellamy I'm so excited
it finally came in the mail today
congratulations Nicole it's freaking
beautiful I love the black and the gold
and it also says 1 for 3 on it which is
so cute
I'm using a smaller head that comes in
the kit and I'm just going to start
putting some loose waves in my hair I'm
not even going to clip up my hair
because it doesn't need to get perfect
curls I'm just going to kind of grab
random pieces and start curling
weird is the second time in the past two
hours of the song came on my dad song
on the same Pandora station - that's why
it's weird
next I'm using in my eyes Richards a sea
salt spray by dry barn it smells amazing
I'm spraying this into the hair
scrunching it a little bit and just to
keep it like scrunched I'm just
scratching it up and then with those two
clips that come and that seem kid I'm
just kind of flipping it up just don't
stay is curled by to the other side
this is like the best breakup song ever
I remember listening to this all day
stampy OCU paper receipt anyway I'll
tell my face
so usually these curls took like not
even 10 minutes so super easy okay so
next what you want to do is figure out
where you want to part your hair I'm
going to do it in the middle maybe like
off the middle like a drop I'm just
going to part it back and then you want
to take up the front section of your
hair I like to keep my little baby hairs
out so I like to do it like right
underneath and then take the piece from
the top like that so once you at the one
side clip off the back of your hair that
way you don't pull any from the wrong
side we are going to do a little mini
Dutch braid so if you guys didn't watch
my Dutch braid tutorial I will link that
right here for you guys you can go check
it out I have a nice in-depth tutorial
on how to do it we're just going to do
two little mini ones instead of two
bigger ones with a small section of hair
so I will show you so we're going to
start with a little section of hair I'm
going to take the three sections we're
going to put the left under the middle
and then the right under the middle my
right here left and we're going to grab
a piece put it under the middle type in
same thing grab a little piece put it
under the middle I am
peace good under
some things it's a lot quicker and
easier because you're only using such a
small piece of hair
and then once you've gotten all the hair
you're just going to continue to braid
this piece
read it as far down as you can go and
then we're going to secure it with a
little elastic these you can get rid of
your drugstore and then I'm just going
to loosen the braid make it stand out a
little bit more so that's one side super
easy
literally took me three minutes not even
I could even do it quicker when I'm not
um like filming trying to show
everything so now we're going to do the
same thing on this side
so make sure that the piece is even with
your previous piece
for the front pieces of your hair I've
done it some times and it didn't look as
good so you just want to like hold it
back and kind of see where it's gonna
lay and then see if you need to pull any
pieces like I have these weird pieces
right here that if they're not pulled in
it look weird way to hang so so same
thing we're going to tie back or clip
back this side of the hair that way we
don't have any mess-ups and we're going
to do the same thing we're going to
start with a little section of hair
we're going to split it into three three
we're going to take this one put it
under the middle and then we're going to
take this one and put it under the
middle
take a little piece of hair
and with these since they are much
smaller breeds than the other Dutch
braid tutorial you want to grab smaller
little sections as you're pulling that
way it looks like a braid and not just
um a random thing in your head because
sometimes I do braids it doesn't look
like a brain is it why have a braid if
it's not going to look like
last piece tuck it in
we're just going to continue to braid
we want to just see where the other
elastic is and put another elastic and
it seems spot then you're just going to
go back in and take whatever pieces are
a little messy looking and just go back
over them with the wand
you know sandy let me show you ping the
finger ha ha for the face oh wait the
poor look at my big girl named Cindy who
booth next I'm just taking this comb and
I'm just gonna backcomb it a little bit
just to give it a little bit of body and
some texture and it's coming all soaking
with the kit
then you can do a little bit more the C
spread
like this
okay so now if I look number two from my
gallon pens that makeup video are you
ready for how hard this is so we're
going to take these two braids and we're
going to grab a extra hair tie and we
are just going to tie them together and
back and that is how you do the other
look so it's so easy the exactly thing
you just add a little hair tie and it
makes it kind of like a half-up
half-down
type of look I think this hairstyles are
super easy to do super cute and I think
they're also really romantic I think
they're perfect for Valentine's Day if
you guys are going out and you want your
something new with your hair trying to
sound let me know how you guys like it
I've been loving it lately I think it
just is something different and it keeps
your hair off your face which is nice I
know sometimes when I wear my hair down
I'm always kind of playing with it and
like pushing it out of my face so it's
just a nice simple way to get it off
your face without being like too slick
that it looks a little bit silly so I
hope you guys enjoy these tutorials
thank you guys again so much for 4
million it's honestly mind blowing I
don't think it'll ever actually sink in
I think I'm still waiting for like 1
million to sink in and over at 4 so it's
just absolutely crazy
thank you all for believing in me and
for being my biggest supporters who have
gotten me through the hardest times of
my life I love you guys so much thank
you for watching and
next time I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
