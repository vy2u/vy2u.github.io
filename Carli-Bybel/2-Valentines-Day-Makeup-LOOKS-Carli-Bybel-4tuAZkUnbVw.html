controlling global your hair oh oh
you can hang out Amanda hi everyone
thank you for watching I'm so excited to
finally be back I miss you guys so much
I was in LA last weekend and our trip
got cut a little bit short because of
the crazy weather that we've had here on
the East Coast we were originally
supposed to stay till Sunday and then
with the snow and everything we ended up
changing our plates on Friday morning so
we got home Friday Bret was sick
Saturday and Sunday and then I guess I
caught whatever he had and I was sick
Monday and yesterday so finally back
today and I've seen a ton of people
requesting some Valentine's Day lows so
I think instead of just doing one I'm
going to show you guys two different
options that way you don't like first
one hopefully you guys like the second
one this year for Valentine's Day I'm
actually going to be on a cruise with my
entire family so I'm not sure which look
I'm going to do yet I guess it depends
on what outfit I'm going to wear but I
really really love how this one turned
out it was super super simple and I
think it looks a little bit more glam
than expected this was kind of my more
simple look but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you want to see how I
got these two Valentine's Day makeup
looks please keep watching to start off
this look I'm picking up this light pink
shimmer shade from my Carli bybel
palette I'm applying this all over my
lid before I started this look I could
do my full face routine so I do have
concealer on my eyes which is going to
double as an eyeshadow base
next up I'm picking up this lighter
mauve shade from my palette as well and
I'm applying that very lightly into the
crease picking up the eyeshadow shade
and the color metallic pixie dust by
Stella I'm then applying that all over
my eyelid right on top of that light
pink shade to give it a really pretty
shimmery bright look using the light
pink highlighter shade from my palette
I'm then applying that right underneath
my brows to highlight
For Lashes i'm using the whispies by our
dell i wanted to keep this look pretty
natural i wasn't going to do an eyeliner
but then when I applied the lashes it
looked a little silly
so after lashes I am using the Kat Von D
tattoo liner
with that same light mauve color and a
pencil brush I'm blending that on my
lower lash line
highlight the bridge of my nose I'm
using that same pink color that I used
on my eyelids so bronze up my face I'm
using the face glow in bronze by Gerlach
tech now this has like a shimmer to it
so you don't want to do too much
because I don't want my face too shiny
I'm just going to go in with this BH
diva matte bronzer
four cheeks I'm using this blush by
Kardashian beauty I believe it's number
five 14 I picked this one up at Ulta
first time trying it so we'll see but
it's like the perfect pink color so it's
definitely not that pigmented you need
to keep blaring it but it's okay because
we don't want it to be too too dark
anyway next I'm gonna be highlighting my
Cupid's bow and then right here even
though some of you think it looks like
snot I personally like it for now we'll
see maybe I'll hate it in like a month
but let's bring a little bit right here
to finish off this look I am using
Westy lip liner by color pop so now for
this lip color feel free to use whatever
you're comfortable with I personally
want it to use a go light pink gloss but
I don't really like how glosses look on
me so I'm gonna do the liquid matte
lipstick as usual i'm using the color
blush by Anastasio beverly hills just a
little bit
first I'm picking up this new shape from
my Carli bybel palette I'm applying this
all over my eyelid
with this black pencil from colour-pop
I'm just applying that on the outer V of
my eye
working where my eyeliner was next
grabbing this black color from the
makeup by Camila palette I'm applying
that right over where I had just done
that black then I'm just grabbing
something with a flat edge to make sure
that the line is perfect that way I
don't get any fallout on my face
with the same palette I'm picking up
this dark brown shade and I'm just
blending it into the black with my
blending brush in this orange shade I'm
blending that above the brown grabbing a
little bit of that dark brown again and
I'm just going to keep blending until it
looks good
For Lashes I'm using Lily lashes in
Miami I have a coupon code which I will
list below for you guys while I'm
waiting for the eyelash glue to dry a
little bit I'm picking up that dark
brown shade from the same Sigma palette
and I'm applying it underneath my eyes
I'm picking up the orange brown and I'm
applying in the inner part as well
for blush I'm gonna mix in a little bit
of shimmering peach by Tarte putting
that over the pink that I already have I
don't know whether to do nude or read
these nails when I do red lips
even though I probably wouldn't wear red
lips on Valentine's Day so originally
the thought was I was gonna do like a
hombre a dark to lighter red lip but I
was thinking about what I would really
do for Valentine's Day and as much as I
love a good red lip
I feel like Valentine's Day is just not
the day to wear it unless you don't
really care and you just want to wear
anyway go right ahead but I feel like
for me I know when kissing Brad so I
don't want to have to reapply two
million times so I'm just going to do a
nice nude because can't go wrong with a
good nude and below I will list the red
lip combo that are we going to use for
this video I'm using button lip liner by
color cop and then I'm using pure
Hollywood by Anastasia Beverly Hills
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed both of these looks and
incorporate them into your own routine
for Valentine's Day or for just a
regular occasion doesn't really matter
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
will be filming again this week so
please comment below and let me know
what you guys want to see I can't wait
to be back to my room filming schedule I
know I keep saying that but I feel like
matter how many hours I spend putting
stuff away there's just so much more to
do so thank you guys so much for being
patient with me I'm happy but I didn't
forget about me I love you all so much
and until next time I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
