some time to decide whether you're
strong enough
whether you should give up a try as you
stand on your own he is hoping you find
it's a good day it's a good day to be
alive
hi everyone so I'm not gonna bring my
camera inside a Walgreens because the
makeup I was really open and I don't
know I can film in there might be a
little weird
boopa he's laughing and trying to hide
from the video but so we're gonna go
inside and try to find everything to do
with twenty dollar makeup challenge
sorry thing let's get this cuz these
aren't a friendly challenge mmm
just they put them all together to make
it look so pretty up her bed to night
idea
2:29 they raised a princess I'm gonna go
with this the fabula
hard
this fulfillment
this is a $12.99
do you have your phone in here I need a
calculator no you forgot the burning in
her purse I'd mix books so 229
okay 10:57 but i can't buy this
foundation
stressful I can't find a cheaper
oh here's chica hi everyone thank you
for watching so I literally just got
back from vacation like 1 o'clock last
night and I know it's been a little bit
since I posted a video so before I even
unpacked or did anything you can wash my
hair I decided to do this video for you
guys I know a lot of you have been
requesting the $20 makeup challenge I
went to Walgreens which is I think maybe
a little bit more pricey than say Target
or Walmart but I spent 20 dollars and 16
cents which is not too bad if you asked
me I just really quickly wanted to say
thank you to every single one of you I
hit 800,000 subscribers over the weekend
and I was honestly so astonished I was
looking back on my facebook page from
not even two years ago when I started
this whole thing and I was posting that
I was so excited that I finally hit like
a thousand subscribers and that wasn't
even that long ago so it's so crazy and
I'm honestly so blessed and so thankful
for every single one of you and my next
video I will be announcing a big
giveaway in celebration so definitely
stay tuned for that you guys want to
learn how I got this entire look for
twenty dollars and sixteen cents please
keep watching so I just left Walgreens
and I spent twenty dollars and sixteen
cents so it was a little bit over twenty
dollars but honestly I was walking for
about a half hour and this was my final
combination and I wanted to do a full
face routine for twenty dollars
so for foundation the cheapest one that
I could find at Walgreens was Rimmel and
it's the match perfection foundation and
I got mine in the color sand and I'm
just gonna be applying a little bit of
this all around my face and later on
after I finished my eyes I'm going to be
applying concealer under my eyes so I'm
not going to be applying this dark
foundation there
don't never use this foundation before
but we'll see how I like it
so right at the end I ended up finding
by wet-and-wild it's this new specials
$2.99 and it comes with the eyeshadows
and mascara so that was awesome because
for $2.99 for both of those that was
just ridiculous so of course I'm going
to be trying them they had a couple
different colors and you know I have a
low battery in my smoke detector so it
keeps Bing heard it all last night to is
really great so this is what it looks
like and these are cool because it shows
you what goes for your brow bone what's
on your eyelid and what's for your
crease then I'm going to be taking the
brow bone color and I'm going to be
applying it underneath my brow bone and
also in my tear duct
one of the reasons I did pick this
palette was because I did have the brown
crease color and I was thinking smart
and figured since it does have a brown
crease color we can use that for our
eyebrows to contour and also as a dark
shadow color so I'm going to be using
first this 224 Mac brush and the brown
crease color and I'm going to be
applying it right into my crease like I
said we're going to use it to contour as
well so I'm going to be applying a
little bit right into my cheekbones and
because it has a little bit of a shimmer
to it you want to be careful how much
you're actually using for your face and
also your eyebrows I'm just going to be
adding a little bit just to darken my
eyebrows because the foundation tends to
lighten them so I'm going to take a
little bit and again apply it on my
eyebrows
next we're gonna go to eyeliner this one
I've been using forever and I did buy a
new one because mine did dry out but it
is by Jordana and it's called fabula nur
and it's only 229 which is ridiculous it
looks like a felt-tip pen and this one
is again very cheap and it works really
really well if you are a beginner with
eyeliner I do recommend these because
it's a lot easier to control where your
line is going to be going so moving on
to mascara I'm going to be using the one
that came in at little $2.99 packet the
wet and wild one and I know I'm going to
be here for like 10 minutes applying
coat after coat after coat because I
love clumpy lashes and with the
telescopic that I always use you only
have to do a couple coats to get them
really full and thick looking and these
brushes just really don't work for me
but since we are in a budget we will be
using this so just bear with me
so now that I've applied my mascara I'm
going back to the same palette and we're
going to use that dark brown color and
line my lower lash line
for concealer I found this one by
wet-and-wild
and it's called the coverall and it's in
number 801 and it's these ones that look
like the lipsticks but this was
definitely the cheapest one in Walgreens
so I'm going to be applying a little bit
right underneath my eyes
and then I'm just gonna be blending it
in with a smaller foundation brush
so now we're just gonna take our
bronzing brush and we're gonna take a
little bit more matte Brown and we're
gonna contour in our cheeks and then
we're just blending in that line that we
had done previously for blush I'm using
also by Wet n Wild it's called mellow
wine and it's like this peachy color and
see how it works
anything bitch you might be lost
pigmented work cheap blush
you'll find inside it's good day
so the final step is going to be lips
and one thing I've been doing forever is
using my Jordana cosmetics lip liner and
it's in the color tawny and it's pretty
close to your skin tone so what I do is
I apply this like a normal lip liner and
then I shade it in and it gives your
lips a really really pretty color and
it's very natural and a lot of times
I've seen when I've done it a lot of
people ask what color lip gloss or
lipstick I was using and it was actually
just this lip liner
tell me that I'm wrong
it's a good day to be like when you're
out on your own
alright so this is the final result I
did the entire look for under $20 will
actually no twenty dollars and sixteen
cents I'm sorry that is the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed and I love you
guys so much I learned it's a good day
it's a good day to be alive
