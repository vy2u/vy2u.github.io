yes I I feel lovely the way that I
hi everyone thank you for watching so
today I'm going to be showing you three
of my favorite looks right now for the
holiday times for your lips there's one
red one plum look and one nude / pink
look and these are my favorite for the
fall / winter time so if you want to
learn how to get them please keep
watching for the first look I'm going to
be using by Jordana cosmetics it's
called tawny and it's a lip liner and
it's like a skin tone color you can get
this at Walgreens and I believe they're
only $2.99 so I'm just going to be
outlining my lips the lipstick color I'm
using is by Mac and it's creme de nude
and this one is definitely my favorite
new color I believe it's the only nude
lipstick I actually have so if you guys
have any other favorites let me know
because I'm in search for another new
one and then I personally don't like a
just plain nude look makes me look like
I have no lips so over this color I'm
going to be using this light pink color
by covergirl and it's number 365
so one thing that I always do is I
highlight my Cupid's bow which is the
arched right on top of your lips and one
thing that I always use it's a perfect
thing to highlight whether for your
cheeks your eyes or even your lips it's
by Mac and it's a mineralized skinfinish
and this one is called soft and gentle
and I'm just going to be putting a
little bit on my finger and then dabbing
it on
and then if you want you can even put a
little bit right in the center of your
bottom lip and that's going to make your
lips up here bigger so this is the first
look and I love this this is perfect for
daytime or even a night out I think if
you do like a nude lip with a pink eye
you can do something kind of natural
like what I have or you can even do
something a little bit more dramatic
when I do red lips I try to stay away
from the darker eyes or the sparkly eyes
just because I feel like it's a little
bit too much with the lips and the eyes
so yeah you can really do the pink with
anything to take this off I'm just using
makeup wipes these ones were like $5.99
um I don't even know what brand they are
but they all work the same so everyone
has their own way of doing their perfect
red lip mine is pretty much stayed the
same I've been using covergirl hot
passion for a while but I actually just
got this new one by Ben Nye and it's
called Marilyn and it's because it's
named after Marilyn Monroe so I'm
obsessed with this red so this is the
red that I've been using and it's
perfect for the holidays you can get
this if you type in bend eye makeup you
can find websites that sell it online
and for lip liner I'm using also by
Jordana
I love these ones they have the best
colors and they're only $2.99 so you can
really try all the colors this one is
called plush plum so when you're doing
the red it's really important to do a
lip liner because it makes it look more
perfect and it just makes your lips look
more defined also when you're using the
red be careful because if you mess up
it's hard to get it off of your face so
bear with me
so that is how I do my red lips and it
does help if you go back over with the
lipliner and it kind of gives it like a
faded look so it blends better I love
red lips for the holidays I think it's a
perfect excuse to try it out if you
haven't tried red lips before this is me
daring you to go out and try it for this
holiday season go to the Walgreens go to
Walmart try covergirl they have a really
good red one hot passion like I said or
if you want to try the Maryland one
which is the one that I love that is the
one that I'm wearing right now washing
this one off and then we have one more
but this final look this is something
that I just started doing recently and I
love the plum color for fall I know I've
been talking about rebel a lot but I
mean it's one of my favorites it's like
a purpley red and I've been also using
this pretty shimmer gold so I'm going to
show you what I've been doing and again
it's perfect for the holidays and this
color is definitely really in the season
so line my lips I'm using Cabernet also
by Jordana and it's like this dark
purpley cranberry color and again you
want to be careful with this because it
is dark so if you do mess up it's really
hard to get off your skin so just do it
very slow take your time with it and
then I'm taking rebel by Mac
so for the full time this was my
favorite look this dark plum color but
just recently I found this new thing by
covergirl and it's called
blast flip stick and it's a blendable
lip duo but this one is what means is
this one is called stunner and I use the
side that's gold so this is what it
looks like and if you just add a little
bit of gold to grey in the middle on the
top and the bottom you'll see
and that's just gonna give it a really
pretty shine different look to it so
those are my three favorite holiday
lipstick looks right now I hope you all
enjoy and don't forget just because I
used all the Mack you can find drugstore
alternatives so if you guys know of any
drugstore alternatives that are equally
as good as the ones I use feel free to
list them below and then try them out
and yeah good luck to everyone so I hope
you all have an amazing holiday and I
will be posting another video soon
see you later but you have to realize
I can be all these things you project on
me cuz I'm you
all to me
yeah doesn't that mean a thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
