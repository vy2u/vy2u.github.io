for the rest of my life I'm gonna be
crazy baby crazy for you
hi everyone thank you for watching
so I'm sorry it's been a little bit
since I posted a video I was in LA for
beautycon last weekend and it was
absolutely amazing
meeting some of you guys and I really
really really had such an amazing time
and I'm still editing my vlog so
definitely stay tuned for that today I'm
going to be doing three separate looks
and I don't really know what to title
this I said a summer look transitioned
into a fall look and then a more
dramatic fall nighttime look which is
this one right now so I think this video
is going to be good for all ages and all
people because the first look is perfect
for an everyday look it's very very
minimal makeup the second look is a
little bit more makeup and then the
third is more dramatic for my fellow
makeup lovers out there that love to try
new things and love to get dramatic with
the makeup look so I apologize for those
who have been complaining about my
neutral looks that I keep doing them so
this one is especially for you guys so I
hope you enjoyed this video and stay
tuned for all three makeup looks oh
quick side note I am still looking
through all the video entries so I will
be announcing the winners I'm gonna say
Monday but I'm going through them all
and this is gonna be super super hard
and I'm loving every single one so far
also really quickly if you can see it's
very very subtle but I got some brown
highlights put into my hair and I don't
know what this wedding if you can really
see but they're just very again subtle
just to lighten up the dark dark brown
and I also got the keratin done which is
amazing I'm super excited for it I've
been going to a lady who has done the
keratin and the Japanese straightening
and anything like crazy highlight wise
for about seven years and she is
hands-down the only woman I trust and
that is why I know if you guys have been
following me for a while you know that
I'm very anal with my hair and makeup so
if any of you guys are in the New Jersey
area and you're looking for someone
who's amazing at everything to do with
hair I will be posting the salon below
as well as her phone number and
everything like that so that's my update
and enjoy the tutorial
so before I start this quick summer look
I just wanted to mention these amazing
earrings that are handmade in Brazil by
ludora boutique I have mentioned them
before in numerous posts because she
always makes the most beautiful jewelry
so I like matching my jewellery with my
makeup looks if you guys are interested
in purchasing these earrings or any
earrings you can check the information
box below because I'm going to be
listing a 10% off coupon as well and her
jewelry is just unlike any other and I
love them because not only on they're so
different but there's so many different
colors in them so they inspire me to do
different colored makeup looks so I'm
gonna say for about a year now I've had
my signature go to look whether I'm in a
little bit of a hurry or I want a more
natural look for the day time and since
we do have a little bit left of summer I
will show you guys this quick last look
and when I was envisioning it in my head
I figured since a couple of you were
unhappy with my previous back-to-school
tutorial and they you thought that the
eyeliner was a little bit too much this
look I think would be perfect for a
back-to-school look because again it's
gonna be very minimal makeup but it's
gonna just have a pop of color and yeah
so let's get started so before the
tutorial I did already apply my
foundation and I contoured just a little
bit but those steps are optional if you
guys want to do this look with no
foundation or if you are lucky and you
are younger and you don't need
foundation then you can skip that step
and then just follow along with me the
BH Cosmetics palettes
I'm absolutely in love with I mentioned
them in a bunch of tutorials and not
only are they super inexpensive but
they're also super easy to travel with
because they are already in the palettes
and they're really pigmented I'm gonna
grab this light pink color and apply
this right on the apples of my cheek
when applying blush I always like to do
a little bit at a time
because
I like to apply it in a precise location
and I like to apply right along my
cheekbones and then when you smile just
like about half of that circle
so if you don't blend it in its gonna
just look like pink cheeks so I always
take my Mac brush and this one is the
188 and I like to just very very lightly
blend it in so I just do small little
movements like this and it just very
lightly blends it in with the foundation
when I like to do a pink cheek like this
I usually use skip the bronzer and the
reason I skip the bronzer for this look
is because I believe it gives it a more
fresh open wide-awake look now that I've
applied the blush I'm going to be
applying my mascara
next I'm going to be using this white
eye pencil and I'm gonna be just
aligning my inner lash line with that
and this is gonna help give my eyes a
more white rounder look which is going
to make you look more weight
the final step for this look is going to
be lips and I'm gonna do baby pink and
the lip liner I'm using is by Jordana
and this one is called silver lilac
so usually in order to create a perfect
light pink color I tend to mix lipsticks
and I have all different kinds I have
Mac and I have different drugstore ones
for this look I'm going to be mixing so
I'm gonna be mixing myth by Mac and that
one's gonna go first
and then I'm gonna take this Revlon
so this is the first look I love doing a
natural look like this and then having
my earrings my lipstick and then my
blush all matched because it gives it
just a little bit of pop of pink
everywhere
and again this one is a little bit more
summery so I know fall is coming up and
I don't really care I'm sure I'll wear a
pink light pink lipstick any time of the
year if I wanted to wear it but this one
again is more for the summer transition
into fall so moving on to look number
two again the earrings are ludora these
ones are just insane and they inspired
this makeup look as well so this look is
gonna be like medium with the makeup or
this look I'm gonna be adding a black
eyeliner and I'm just gonna be adding a
little tail and extending it in the
inner corner of my eye as well
next using this gold pigment by Mac and
a small angled brush I'm going to be
applying this right on my lower lash
line so for lips for this look I'm going
to be using the color that's in the
earring and I'm absolutely in love with
this color and I know for fall it's
gonna be super super huge and what you
can even do if this eye makeup look is a
little bit too dramatic for you you can
use the same color and do my previous
look which was with just the mascara and
it's gonna give you a nice fall look
and the lipsticks that I'm gonna be
mixing is rebel by Matt which is this
nice deep purple color and I'm gonna use
that same pink that we had just
previously used from the Revlon so I'm
finally done with look number two and if
you guys want to see look number three
then just keep watching so the third and
final look are for my ladies who love
playing around and like trying something
a little bold and different I know I do
once in a while it's fun to just play
with your makeup and add on do different
colors that you're not used to so this
one is for you guys because I know you
guys get bored of those plain old
everyday looks whenever I do use
pigments I tend to use the fix plus
which I dip my brush in first and if you
don't have fix plus you can also use eye
drops as an alternative I just like
getting the brush a little bit wet
therefore it sticks the pigments and it
doesn't end up all over your entire face
when you're picking up a dark color like
this I like to start as close to my
eyeliner as possible because eventually
we want to blend this out and we don't
want a thick black line otherwise it'll
just look really silly if you don't have
a black pigment I will list options but
you can also just use a regular pressed
shadow for this look if you have like a
black sparkly shadow it will give you
the same look or you can just do all
black depending on what you like to add
a bit of color I'm going to be picking
up this dark green color from my BH
Cosmetics palette and I'm going to be
applying it right over the black and
it's just gonna give it a nice little
bit of pop of color
then picking up this light beige color
I'm going to be applying it with my Mac
224 right into my crease with a very
light hand
grabbing this darker brown color I'm
Megan might be applying it deeper in my
crease and blending the black with the
brown
you're then going to lower your lash
line with either a dark black eyeshadow
or an eye pencil whichever you prefer
I always prefer the shadow because it
tends to last longer whenever I do a
darker smokey eye I do like to wear
bronzer as opposed to blush and that's
because the smoky eye tends to drown out
your face a little bit so that is it for
the eyes and moving on to the lips I'm
going to be doing a nice nude color I'm
going to be using myth by Mac and my
lips are still a little bit pink from of
the previous lipsticks so it will
probably look a lot better if you don't
have a dark lipstick on before I think
whenever you're gonna stick with a
dramatic look like this a nude lip is
definitely recommended in my opinion
just because any other bright color
would kind of make it look just way way
way too much and I'm sure for some of
you you're probably like oh my god that
is way too much makeup but as you guys
know this is a beauty Channel and I love
makeup and I love playing around with
different colors and I thought this
would be a perfect more dramatic look
for the fall time so I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and until next
time I'll see you guys later Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
