she
they can baby
yes
see hi everyone thank you for watching
so yes you caught me last time I was
filming in my bathroom and yes I'm still
in my bathroom filming and I'm sitting
on my toilet there is nowhere else for
me to really do it right now
my vanity still isn't here so if you
think that's weird I'm sorry but it is a
perfect seat and I've a really comfy
like kinda material is this I don't know
but the toilet seat cover is really
comfy so I don't mind it so onto the
tutorial so yesterday I had bought a new
memory card and after I had filmed my
first tutorial I was going to do one
yesterday and then one today it crashed
and it's Aleta the video and then I
wasn't able to do anything with it so
after I had done both my eyes crazy
dramatic it's decided to crash so it
actually worked out better because today
I decided to do instead of two different
looks I did three different looks so I
did this one that I'm wearing right now
which is a little bit more natural so to
say for the New Year's look and then I
did two more dramatic ones so I hope you
all enjoy and I hope everyone has a very
safe and happy new years and I will see
you guys next year so weird to say that
bye guys
