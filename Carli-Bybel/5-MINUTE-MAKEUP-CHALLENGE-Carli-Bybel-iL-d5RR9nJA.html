those of you guys that are no my name is
Carly and today I'm gonna be trying out
the 5 minute makeup challenge so the
goal for this challenge in my opinion is
to get as much makeup on your face as
possible in 5 minutes
so I have everything out in front of me
I'm feeling very stressed and nervous
but I'm just gonna see what happens I've
never done this before
at least not that I remember I have been
on YouTube a while but I don't think
I've done this before so I'm gonna get
my timer ready we're gonna set it to 5
minutes
I'm we're gonna start right right now
this color is definitely too dark
no no it's empty
my arm already hurts so not only I don't
even use a brush but I felt like this
would be a little bit quicker to blend
anyone with concealer this is the shape
tape I think it's like medium could be
wrong but you know after concealed
I'm gonna go in eyebrows by light and
brushing them up
that's as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna set my under eyes with my
shooting light palette the light is she
you
bronzer bronzer bronzer same kid gonna
bronze I feel like I have gotten ready
like maybe not in five minutes but like
at the speed before which really
stresses me out it reminds me of like
when I used to go to school there was
one time where I went I was rushing that
the door and I forgot to do one of my
eyebrows so I was in the car and I had
to turn it back around because I had one
eyebrow down and whatnots on and there's
just really nothing you can do about
that so I fix it act I'm gonna go out of
the lips because it's important
gorgeous I'm gonna go in with my palette
I'm using this shade right here and put
that all over I love this shade honestly
it goes with this lip color actually
really perfectly and that wasn't my plan
um we're gonna go in with the orange how
much time do I have left I really really
wanted to do lashes so I have these of
course Michael is freaking dry
minute and 35 left
when you blush well that's drying I'm
going to do lining my lips a little bit
because these look Haro
you gonna pluck these on
just too wet half blew my eyelids
burning oh that hurts
thirty Seconds Scarah
to little more blush
ow first of all my eye oh and I got glue
in my eye I feel like if I actually took
my time with this book I would actually
really like it I like this I shadow with
this lip color so yeah it does not look
great
I forgot highlight so I'm gonna grab a
little bit of the gold for my palate
because this look almost looks from far
away I think it almost looks like it
could be something maybe right no do you
see this weather right now like this
crazy nor'easter happening but yeah
so I think I did a little bit better
than I thought obviously my ears don't
match my face my chest doesn't really
match either but that's because of
course the foundation that I chose it's
like empty that would happen somehow I
got these lashes to stick so I'm a
little bit proud about that
so this was definitely a really fun
challenge I highly recommend you guys
trying it out usually if I have five
minutes to get ready there's no way I'm
putting on false lashes or even
eyeshadow most likely I'll just kind of
focus on the face do a little bit of
mascara some chapstick and maybe a
little lip liner and call it a day but I
just was curious to see like how much I
can actually do in five minutes so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I dare
you to try it out just for fun make sure
you use the timer because like you feel
that pressure but if you guys do find
yourself struggling with time in the
morning I would definitely recommend
trying this with some of your normal
products you don't have to go all crazy
like I did
and watch the more you do it and the
more pressure you feel if you're
practicing you will get a routine down
super quick so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and make sure to check back on
my channel on Sunday for sorry my eyes
are like sticking together be sure to
check back on my channel on Sunday at 10
a.m. for another new video thank you

much and until next time I'll see you
