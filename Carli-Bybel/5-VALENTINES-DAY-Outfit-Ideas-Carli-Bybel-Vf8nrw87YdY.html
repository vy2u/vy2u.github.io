for watching today I'm going to show you
a few Valentine's Day inspired outfits
my first one is this two-piece set from
Naked wardrobe I just wanted to let you
guys know I have so much of my stuff
some boxes so I kind of had limited
options here some of the stuff that I'm
wearing is sold out but I will list
similar options on my blog my jewelry is
from Princess Pea jewelry I do have a
10% off code for anyone interested to
baby I love you love you love you so for
most of these looks except for this one
I didn't have jewelry or purses because
they're still in my old apartment
waiting to be moved out but I did
recently get these so it did match the
outfit which I think jewellery can
really make an outfit so I apologize if
I didn't go a little over the top with
the outfits you know usually I always do
but once I'm all unpacked I will
definitely do more of these videos if of
course you like them these are my
favorite nude pumps I think they make
any outfit a little bit more fancy you
can also throw on a pair of sneakers or
flats and keep it a little bit more
casual the ear cuff is from Nasty Gal
and the necklaces are from Princess Pea
also my bc earrings are from Kirsten
Bogota
so for the next outfit I have a pink
poncho which I'm obsessed with I love
these ponchos they're just so easy to
throw over an outfit and it makes it a
little bit more fancy you can also wear
flats or sneakers with this look and
keep it more casual I just threw on a
pair of heels just for the video I
actually have a darker pair of pumps
that I wanted to wear but they're not
here yet either so I threw on the Sarah
Jessica Parker heels I do believe they
are sold out but the ones that I wanted
to wear I will link for you guys so you
can see what I was planning on wearing I
would probably wear like a nude or a
gold purse with this and yeah I think
these little braids in the hair make a
very romantic Valentine's Day look so
let me know if you guys want to see a
hair tutorial
Oh
so of course I had to throw in an Allred
outfit I feel like red is the perfect
color for Valentine's Day of course
everyone has their preference but I love
this two-piece that I got from Zachary
the label this piece is also sold out
but I will try and find something
similar for you guys I wore this top
before and I paired it with a bright red
lip so I think you can either do your
lips or red lips or something like this
I paired it with my nude pumps some gold
jewelry and I'd probably use either a
nude or gold purse as well little
darling it's been a long cold morning
with little darling it feels like you
since it's been when I was filming this
video I knew I wanted to wear something
called white of course it's very cold
here in New Jersey so if I were to wear
something like this I would throw on I
have a good boy you trench coat or any
color coat over it I think would be
really cute you can also wear a white
blazer or a white long blazer
little darling the smiles returning to
the
Lewton darling for lips I'm music by
Anasazi a Beverly Hills American doll
liquid lipstick and that is really Kim's
now I hope you guys enjoyed this video

love you guys so much and until next
time I'll see you guys later
