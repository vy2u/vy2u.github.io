Thursday I had posted a picture on my
Instagram letting you guys know that I
was sitting down to film a inner-beauty
video and some of you guys I know I've
been waiting for it like what the heck
is taking so long and I guess I just
wanted to make me fill you in a little
bit um Thursday was just a really bad
day for me had some family things going
on and I kind of let my bad mood consume
my entire day I tried sitting down to
film and I just got so sidetracked I
couldn't think straight and I just
couldn't get the video out on Thursdays
so I had every intention I'm filming one
type of video but after having just a
really bad day and seeing how much my
mood affected me I thought it was a good
time to maybe sit down and talk about
ways to get through a bad day um
sometimes it's easier said than done but
I feel like if I had someone who just
sat me down and maybe told me a few
things and maybe I could have gotten
through my bad day a little bit easier I
don't think I've ever really mentioned
this to you guys but the original reason
why I had started my inner beauty
channel was because I was going through
a lot at that moment and I have always
felt that if you're going through
something and you're having a really
hard time with something the only way to
really make yourself feel better is to
help other people and to spread
knowledge of different things that
you've learned and try just helping
other people get through their problems
so that was really the main reason that
I started it basically every video that
i sat up here talking to you guys about
certain things it was all things that i
had recently learned and just things
that i was constantly telling myself
because let's face it life is really
freakin hard and when bad days come it's
like you just feel like there's never
going to be a tomorrow and it just
really takes over so much of who you are
and it's just not a good thing so
basically I'm just gonna talk about a
few different things that have helped me
get through my band
and then I hope in turn it somehow can
help you get through your bad day
because let's face it we all have bad
days we all have crap going on in our
lives you are not alone we are in this
together and I just want to share some
of my knowledge with you so if you guys
want to hear a little bit more about it
please keep watching so the first thing
that you guys have to do is figure out
what it is that's actually bothering you
so I mean for some people you may be
like duh this specific thing happened
and it's just completely ruin my mood
and I just want to lay in bed all day
and not do anything but for other people
there may be a fight with somebody or
there may be a smaller issue that went
down that you are exploding in your mind
when in reality there's really something
deeper and bigger going on that's been
affecting your mood to begin with so
this may be a little bit confusing so
let me try and break it down let me give
you an example so sometimes when I have
some family is she going on that I
haven't talked about to anybody um Brett
will do something and I'll just kind of
snap on him or I'll just take it out on
him and be really mean to him and then
I'm fighting with him and then I get
even more upset and then I just kind of
am in this horrible mood and I just
don't even know what the cause of it is
so the first thing that I recommend
doing is realizing what the real
deep-rooted issue is don't take it out
on other people because other people
aren't the reason for it so once we've
addressed the problem and we realized
what the real big issue is the next
thing that I want for you guys to do is
to either write it down or talk about it
with someone that you trust that is bias
that will listen to you and not judge
you so some people may not have that
person in their lives and if you don't
don't worry it's okay I'm sure
eventually you will find someone that
you can really trust and confide in but
if you guys don't then I recommend
sitting down writing it out in the diary
writing out whatever you're feeling just
get it out because if you keep it all
bottled up inside I swear you guys are
just going to go crazy and I know you
already know this because you've all had
bad days before and yeah I just feel
like you need to let it out somehow so
whether you're speaking about it to
someone whether you're writing out
how you feel with no hesitations write
down on a piece of paper do either of
those things because just letting it out
will help immensely my next suggestion
for you guys is once you've let it out
once you've talked about it is to just
let it go so now in certain scenarios I
know certain things can't be let go you
need to talk about it if you're fighting
or if it's a issue you need to be
resolved obviously do all that first but
one thing that we all need to realize
because some of us get so lost in our
own problems that we just forget about
anything else is we are living on a
planet floating in outer space and you
are a little tiny speck of a person so
maybe that's not the nicest way to put
it but guess what like we are all living
on this huge earth our tiny little
problems are nothing no matter what we
do no matter what we think about it's
not going to change the Sun coming up in
the morning and the moon coming out at
night and the earth to keep spinning one
thing that people don't realize is
stress and anxiety can consume you it
can over time it can literally change
you as a person if you're not letting
your stuff out if you're not talking
about it with somebody if you're not
asking somebody else for help you're not
writing it down and then just letting it
go you are going to be holding on to all
these issues all of this pain and it's
gonna just keep building up inside of
you let me just give you guys a quick
example for some of you maybe that
aren't following along because I really
don't have any notes written down I'm
just kind of rambling and then seeing if
this will all kind of come together um
so think about a old song one of your
oldest favorite of songs say that one
song reminded you of that one person in
that one moment of time where you first
heard it and no matter how much time
passes you know all the lyrics you know
all the words and if it just randomly
will come on five years later does it
not take you right back to that moment
do you have that song or you have
something like that where no matter what
happens if you hear it or if you see it
it'll just instantly take you back and
you'll just feel everything you felt and
you'll just be back in that moment do
you guys understand what I'm saying have
you guys have something like that
because if you do
and this is just an example of how all
of your emotions are literally deep down
inside of you if you're not letting
everything go it's just building up so
all the hatred all the anger all the
anxiety all the depression everything is
just being stuffed inside of you
literally just waiting to erupt so one
little switch of your crazy little
neurotic brain telling you like oh my
god this happened now the world's over
and I need a lay in bed and I'm
miserable and I'm depressed and what was
me guess what that is never ever ever
gonna solve anything I promise it really
is not going to solve anything
so again we're gonna figure out what's
bothering us we're gonna address it
we're going to either talk about it with
somebody that we love and trust or we're
going to write it down in a diary that
no one will ever see just to kind of get
it out get it off your chest
then we're gonna let it go and by
letting it go I mean just realizing that
you do not need to hold on to this anger
there's no reason for you to keep it
inside of you you need to realize that
nothing that you're holding on to is
worth it the keys to living a happy and
peaceful life is not ever going to
happen by changing things on the outside
it's all about working on the inside and
then everything else will kind of come
together I know some people are still
very now reminded in the fact that they
think they need every make up product
every nail polish every this or that and
then all of a sudden life is going to be
so perfect and better well let me be the
person to tell you that yes I have a lot
of crap I have way too much stuff if you
ask me but it does not solve any any any
inner problem that I've ever had I still
have bad days yes I just told you less
Thursday I literally was depressed I was
just in such a bad mood and I let my
emotions overcome me so I just want some
of you younger girls to really
understand that it's not material things
that's going to make you happy it's not
anything that you're gonna change on the
outside that's going to make you happy
think about it how many times have you
said oh well if I could just get a new
house or if I could just move out or if
I could just get this that I really
wanted or if I could just change
this that everything will be better well
guess what it won't be better believe me
I had that mentality to I don't know if
you guys watch my draw my life video but
when I hit like rock bottom of my life I
felt all I needed to do was move away
and all my problems would go away so I
moved and literally packed my entire
closet up put it all in my car and I
drove down to Florida by myself from New
Jersey to go live with my dad and I just
thought you know start a new life start
over everything will be better and
little did I know that all of my little
issues all my little problems that have
been inside of me not just on the
outside came right down with me to
Florida and nothing changed nothing got
better because it's not anything on the
outside world that's going to help you
it's only you working on yourself
so now that I've rambled on about some
of my steps on how you can get through a
bad day I just wanted to also add that
of course obviously saying you're
talking about it is a lot easier said
than done some of you guys may be like
alright well I did all of that and I'm
still having a bad day I'm still letting
my thoughts consume my mind so the next
thing that I recommend for you guys
something that I personally love to do
is to just kind of distract yourself
from everything that's going on
for instance what I like to do is I like
to listen to country music and I like to
drive around and I like to blast my
music and when it's warm around I like
to put my windows down and for me that's
just like my therapy right there like
just letting everything go just getting
consumed with the music just driving
with nowhere to go and that's just
something that has always gotten me
through say a bad day other ways you can
distract yourself is by having some
quiet time reading a book taking a bath
lighting some candles just kind of
setting the mood getting some quiet time
for just you and yourself to let go of
all your problems to not think about it
and it'll help calm you down so whatever
way you find that works best for you to
distract yourself I recommend doing that
take some time for yourself
pamper yourself do something that you
wouldn't normally do on an everyday and
just take a little extra time because we
are fragile we are human beings and we
have
so many things that are going on every
single day and so many horrible things
that happen to us that we can literally
let consume us and take over us but that
is not the goal the goal is to be happy
and to be peaceful and to have peace of
mind and to just be okay and content
with who you are and where you're going
and just know that everyone has bad days
we all have horrible days some days are
better than the other but one of my
favorite quotes and I think I recently
posted it on one of my videos it's
actually been my Twitter bio forever now
is just because today is a terrible day
doesn't mean tomorrow might not be the
best day of your entire life you just
have to wake up and get there so
basically the whole message of this
video and my message to you guys is I
totally feel for you if I could just
come through this camera and hug you and
tell you it's all gonna be alright I
wish that I could but this is me sitting
here letting you know that we all have
 going on starting to curse but we
all have something going on every single
human being on this earth has something
going on in their lives and you have to
realize you're not alone everybody is in
it together whether you realize this or
not and just know that it will get
better whatever you're going through it
can get better and you don't realize how
much power that you have it's all within
yourself so I just really recommend
getting a couple books if you guys are
looking for answers to certain things I
recommend the untethered soul there's a
few other ones that I have that I just
recently bought that I haven't got
around to reading it so I will let you
guys know about that but I just mostly
wanted to sit here and let you guys know
that we all have bad days it's just all
about how you as a person can get
through them for yourself we all want to
be happy we all want to live a peaceful
life and the number one way to do that
is to work on your inner self first so I
have so many other videos that I will
link below from my inner beauty channel
if you guys want to go check those out I
mainly just wanted to talk about today
just ways to get through a bad day
because some people maybe just haven't
been told this in a while or maybe some
people just never
to learn certain ways to get through it
so I hope this video helped for some of
you guys I hope you don't mind that I'm
kind of combining my inner and outer
beauty channels but I just think it's
really important for everyone to know
how important it is to work on your
inner self before anything else can all
come together I swear your comments and
your sweet words literally light up my
life and when I'm having a horrible day
that's another thing that I like to do
is just kind of go online and talk to
some of you guys and you don't even know
how much of a huge impact that you guys
have so thank you all of you because
without you I don't even know where I
would be so again I love you have a
great day if you're having a bad day try
some of these steps let me know how it
works for you and keep that chin up
because it will get better and just
remember we are literally floating in
the middle of a solar system just in the
middle of space like that doesn't even
make sense like how are we even here you
know so don't let your little problems
bother you because there are so many
bigger and better things to be happy
about and the number one thing for all
of you guys should be to be working on
yourselves working on making your life
everything you've ever wanted it to be
so I love you guys again that's a third
time I studied I don't care I'll say a
million times but until next time I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
