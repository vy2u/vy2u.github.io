those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I'm going to be
teaching you how I got this full face
cut crease affordable makeup look every
product that I use could either be found
at the drugstore or online so if you
guys want to see how I got this look
right here then please keep watching the
start up stays look I'm using the NYX
pore filler I'm applying that on my face
and a downwards motion for foundation
I'm using the la girl pro coverage HD
foundation I'm going to apply it with my
hands and I'm going to blend it in with
my Beauty Blender to contour my nose I'm
using the LA girl Pro conceal in
beautiful bronze for concealer I'm using
this one by color pop in the color
medium you can't get it at the drugstore
but it's cheaper than I think most
drugstore concealers it's only six
dollars and I've used this before and I
know I really like it so I'm going to
apply this under my eyes on my smile
lines my chin and also between my brows
and we're just gonna blend that all in
I'm going to apply a little bit more
right next to the contour and I'm just
gonna blend that in
to set my under eyes I'm using the air
spun powder
I'm also gonna sit under here like chin
before head for brows I'm using the NYX
brow pencil in espresso I'm gonna shape
them a little bit as you guys can
probably already tell I don't have
eyelash extensions anymore they
officially are gone I'm giving myself a
break because this girl can not control
her picking habit so I look like a thumb
it'll grow back I'm grabbing my NYX
contour kit and I'm picking up this gray
tone right here and I'm going to use
that to contour my nose
and then I'm going to work away the
powder
I'm grabbing a little bit of this first
shade from my kit and I'm gonna contour
my cheeks just a little bit
so first I'm going to pick up this light
brown shade with my Sigma e-40 and I'm
gonna start blending that into my crease
I'm gonna be dragging the shadow out a
little bit further as well like towards
my brow I'm then picking up this orange
shade a little bit and I'm gonna blend
that right on top of it and up towards
my brow again with my morphe m33 i'm
grabbing this darker orange and i'm
gonna apply that underneath those two
shades more like in in my crease
I'm then grabbing the darkest brown
shade just a little bit and that's gonna
go right under that orange
and with my morphe m1 70 - four I'm
gonna just blend that in
and I'm just also gonna be dragging it
out over here
grabbing my pencil brush and that
darkest Brown I'm gonna go right up
against that line this is gonna help
accentuate it even more and grabbing a
little bit of this lightest shade I want
to Pat that on my lid and then I'm gonna
go back in with that same brush and
sharpen it up
using the same light mat she I'm just
gonna highlight my brow first that so
for eyeliner I don't have any drugstore
and liquid eyeliner a lot of mine dried
out and I had we bought a couple so I'm
just gonna use my Tarte eyeliner today
and I'm going to line my upper lash line
so you want your eyeliner to go in the
same direction as the shadow to
highlight underneath my brow I'm using
the Physicians Formula the butter
highlighter in the color champagne
four lashes I'm using the Christina
WSP lashes these are my hands-down
favorite for the inner corner highlight
I'm picking up this yellow shimmer and
then under my eyes I'm applying this
shimmery cranberry and that's gonna go
all throughout the bottom lashline and
I'm picking a little bit of that matte
strawberry color I'm applying that in
the inner half and then with the darkest
matte Brown I'm applying that on the
outer edge and I'm just lightly dragging
that out in that same direction as the
eyeliner and the shadow from mascara I'm
using the NYX pinup tease so my camera
wasn't recording for my bottom mascara I
just applied a little bit of the airspun
powder and then I applied the bottom of
Skara and once it dries I'm going to
wipe away the powder so I'm going to
wipe away the powder from under my eyes
to bronze up my face I'm using this
baked bronzer by Milani
I like my nose I'm gonna use that same
highlighter so it's really nice
for blush I'm using this one by Wet n
Wild it's called mellow wine and with my
Beauty Blender I'm gonna apply a little
bit of this highlighter on to my cheeks
just a little bit I think I want to do a
red lip today I think that's what I'm
gonna go with to line my lips I'm using
cherry pie by Milani and I'm using
creeper by color pop this is one of my
favorite Reds
I'm gonna go in with this pickup liner
from the bomb just because it's a little
sharper so I definitely recommend this
lip liner over the Milani one I probably
would not rebuy them a long one if you
guys are looking for a good red lip
liner this one is actually really really
good I don't know what color it is
though boyfriend material so I'm just
gonna throw my hair together put on an
outfit and I'll be right back
so now that I'm dressed I'm gonna apply
a little highlighter on my shoulders
because why not they're showing and I'm
gonna finish off this look with the wet
and wild natural finish setting spray
this is the final result I hope you guys
