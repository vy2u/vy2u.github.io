and appreciate you me found something
pretty hi everyone thank you for
watching so this morning I was trying to
figure out what I wanted to film and I
realized when I looked at my calendar
that January is basically over which is
crazy because it flew by so I wanted to
get up a Valentine's Day look for you
guys if you want another look I can
definitely do it that's why I wanted to
get this look up now so I have some time
if any of you guys want either a more
dramatic look or maybe using some
different colors so really quickly
before I start the video I just wanted
to tell you guys about two different
Valentine's Day specials that whitening
lightening is having for my followers
the first one is called I want a
sweetheart special and it's going to
come with two lip glosses which if I
were you guys I would pick the feejee
and the Icicle because these ones are
amazing I actually used this one in the
video it also comes with a brow bar
which I use in basically all my videos
and you also get either a regular
whitening pen the super booster pen or
you can get the zero white pen so that's
going to be one whole bundle and I do
have a code that will get you all of
those things and the second special is
called I got a sweetheart special and
you will get to dial a smile kits along
with a brow bar to go as well so if any
of you guys wanted to try any of these
out these specials are available for a
limited time and I want to just let you
guys know really quick but if you want
to learn how to get this makeup look
please keep watching I don't want to
hold you if you wanna go now I'm not
gonna make you feel loved if you don't I
would rather learn what it feels like to
burn they feel nothing at all
well I used to treat you sweetie I would
pull you to my chest as you cried about
feel they've been quickly through your
hands he was searching for one grain of
sand along an endless beach because I
was building you a castle that you just
refused to see what do I say
what do I do to show you all the ways my
heart is slowly shattering
what do I see what do I do I don't wanna
hold you if you wanna go
I'm not gonna make you feel loved it
I would rather learn
you have faded my reality like a Eve
that turn the dust fell asleep inside a
fantasy then we'll go feeling lost now
I'm terrified and restless but I just
cannot escape I wish you had a word
that is killing me what do I say what do
I do to show you all the ways my honest
slowly shattering feet
I see
what do I do
oh man you feel
make you feel
Oh
I don't
you feel nothing
hold you if you wanna go and I'm not
gonna make you feel loved if you're dumb
I would rather learn what it feels like
to burn and feel nothing at all so this
is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video definitely don't
forget to comment below and let me know
if you guys want another Valentine's Day
inspired look or maybe we could do a
Valentine's Day hair or outfit or
something like that so definitely leave
