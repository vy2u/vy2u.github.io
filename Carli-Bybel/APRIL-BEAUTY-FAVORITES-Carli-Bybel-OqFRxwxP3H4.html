feel like I always start my intros the
same I feel like I'm always apologizing
for not getting videos up sooner but I
was away last weekend so that is really
Mike's use this time around but today I
wasn't really sure what I was going to
film but it's been about two months
since I've done a favorites video so I
figured I would talk about some of my
recent favorites Beauty and then a few
non beauty related please comment below
let me know what you want to see because
I will be reading through all the
comments and I'm going to pick one of
your ideas to film for tomorrow so I
hope you guys enjoy this video and if
you want to see some of my current
favorites please keep watching so the
first product that I have is my makeup
forever this is the pro sculpting duo in
the color 1 I'm not sure if it was a
favorites video that I mentioned the
number-two one but I actually just
recently picked this one up and it is so
beautiful it's more of like a cooler
pink highlight color so for those of you
guys who maybe are a little bit lighter
skin tone and you don't want something
so gold like the number 2 this one is
gorgeous
I love how pigmented they are the number
two reminds me a lot of whisper of guilt
and Estee Lauder heatwave it's the same
kind of texture and consistency so when
I tried this one out I was like oh it's
so beautiful I originally wasn't gonna
get it because I was like you know what
I don't really ever grab for the cooler
tone highlights but I'm really happy I
did because I've been wearing it a lot
lately and I'm actually wearing it right
now on my cheeks and I really love the
subtle pink glow that it gives me again
my skin tone is a lot paler right now so
this looks great with the paler skin
tones the next pack that I have I've had
forever now but I've just recently
became more obsessed with it this is the
Mac global glow and it is a bronzer it
has like such a shiny texture to it so
it's more like a highlight and bronzer
in one it's the mineralized skinfinish
but it gives you such a beautiful bronze
color so I think for this year it's been
the first
time ever that I just kind of let my
skin be and I didn't do any tanning beds
I didn't I haven't laid out and forever
I didn't go on any vacations that I got
a tan so I've just been kind of rocking
my lighter skin tone for a while and a
lot of bronzers are either too dark too
matte to oranjee they kind of flake off
but this one it's gonna give you like a
beautiful glow and a highlighted finish
at once so I really have been loving
this if you guys haven't tried it it's
definitely a must-have as far as
bronzers next up I had this new
concealer by la girl these ones are so
affordable and I absolutely love these
they finally came out with an orange
color and it's a creamy consistency
which is amazing I know in my how to
cover dark circle do I mentioned an
orange concealer I believe I showed you
guys the nyx concealer and then I also
have a makeup forever but they're more
like a cakey concealer which I've always
worked great for me but I've found this
more liquidy texture looks amazing and
it covers really nicely so if you guys
don't know about the orange concealer
I'll quickly fill you in what it does is
it cancels out the bluish purple
undertones underneath your eyes so if
you guys have really bad dark circles or
just dark spots under your eyes if you
apply this before your concealer it's
gonna help cancel out the darkness and
what it's also gonna do is put a layer
under your concealer so you know
sometimes throughout the day your
concealer can fade a bit and then your
dark circles just come right back out
when you layer it the orange is gonna
help keep it covered so if throughout
the day your normal concealer fades a
little bit the orange is still gonna be
underneath there to help cancel it out
so I've always found that using this it
really does make a difference especially
for a long wear so I'm obsessed with
this and it's so affordable which is
great so next time I have a blush that
I've just been using so much lately I
don't think I've ever really mentioned a
blush in a favorites video I mean maybe
once or twice but I'm always just trying
new blushes mixing different colors and
I've never really had a favorite but
every time that I've travelled lately I
brought just this one color with me and
I've been so happy with it so I figured
I would include it in this month's
because I feel like I've been
this one more than any other shape the
reason is it's the mineralized blush
also from Mac it's called petal power
and the reason that I'm loving this one
is it's gonna give you as well as the
bronzer like a nice Sheen to your face
so with summer right around the corner
we love that glowy dewy look and if you
use products that have a little bit of
shimmer in them along with a highlight
you are gonna be glowing and it's gonna
look amazing so this color is a
beautiful pinky peach more on the peach
side but I'm wearing it today as well
and it just goes with any makeup look
that you do so I'm obsessed with this
one I had to include it today and the
next product is something that I picked
up probably like four months ago I'm
gonna say it's my urban decay it's the
naked illuminated highlighter you guys
know how much I love my highlighters
it's a beautiful champagne color and
it's so big so I have been applying this
all over my chest if I'm going out as
well as just right on my cheeks it's
just like gorgeous champagne color and
it also has a little bit of a sparkle to
it so it's not just gonna give you that
pretty highlighted look it's gonna also
add a little sparkle so when you hit the
light it's gonna look nice and shimmery
and sparkly but I absolutely love this
one I think it comes in another color
which I have but this has been one of my
favorites at the moment so I have two
lip glosses that I've been in love with
ever since I got them the first one is
by Anastasia Beverly Hills in the color
vintage and it's this beautiful pinky
mauve color and it has a tiny bit of
like a gold sparkle in it I'll swatch
this so you guys could see it up close
but it's just such a gorgeous color
their new glosses are so pigmented and
so beautiful you don't even need a
lipstick underneath so if you guys are
looking for some of their lipstick the
whole new range are just gorgeous
they're to die for I actually did a
friend recently for her wedding and I
used it was either this one I think I
may have mixed this one along with a
little bit of a lighter nude and it was
just so gorgeous and the next one is
from BH Cosmetics
it's the Forever aqua gloss nude
they came out the whole line of all
different color nudes which are gorgeous
but this one is my favorite it's called
the color scone and I'll also swatch it
for you guys but they're really
pigmented and these ones are super
hydrating which I like they're not that
sticky consistency that some glosses
have so these two glosses I've been
loving I also wanted to quickly mention
I'm wearing it on my lips right now
along with whirl liner I also mixed in
Gerrard Buttercup so it lightened it a
little bit but this is the new liquid
lipstick called Kraft and this is also
by anastacio they just came out with
this one and the color unicorn which
I'll show you it really quick cuz anyone
is interested so these are the two new
shades and how gorgeous are they I'm
obsessed
I love these purpley colors I think the
color Bambi I haven't tried it yet but
it was on my list of next ones to try
because it's such a like a bright
fluorescent color and I haven't really
ever tried something this color but
they're gorgeous I'm obsessed with this
color isn't it so pretty I think it's
great for summer and I think it's also
gonna be really pretty for a fall as
well
the next product I recently just got
when I was in LA Parrish was telling me
about it and she's a makeup artist for
all kinds of celebrities and she does
all kinds of amazing makeup so whenever
she was like oh this products amazing
you must have it I was like buying it
buying it this is by Guerlain I think
I'm saying that right
it's the Terra Cotta spray it's a
bronzing powder mist with a sunscreen in
it so she was telling me how when she
was away on vacation she would just
spray this on her face and she didn't
even need foundation it's basically
halfway empty since I got it over the
weekend and the reason for that is I
didn't get a spray tan before I which I
was really hoping to get because
everyone out there is so gorgeous and
tan but um so I brought a couple fake
tanners with me like instant tanners
that I can use to just kind of throw on
if I was going out or anything like that
this is amazing it's not just for your
face I was spraying it all over my body
on my arms it's such a fine mist that
you don't need to blend it in like I'm
gonna spray a little on my face and see
if it makes a difference but I love it
this is in the color to medium I also
bought it in the color light because I
have light skin and the light one would
make
you look a little bit better but I
wanted to Tammuz out there so number two
was the one that I use the most I don't
know if we'll be able to see with all
the bright lights the difference but it
just goes on so fun and it just gives
you like a nice glow
so I'm seriously obsessed with this
stuff this one that we picked up I think
at Saks and then a couple days later we
ended up in Sephora
and I'm gonna just tell you we are so
bit together to makeup artist and
Sephora it's never a good idea but so I
found it in the light color and support
I picked that up as well so I love with
them they're a little bit pricey but
what's cool about these is it has SPF in
it so if you guys are going out in the
Sun and you want a nice sunkissed glow
without taking on any product this is
super lightweight and it gives you a
flawless finish the next product I have
been in love with ever since I got my
hands on it I bought both of the colors
online this is the Platinum one which
I'm loving it's a more like a rose gold
finish I'm going to show you the to
swatch side by side depending on your
skin tone feel free to choose whichever
one you want if you are looking for
something like this the darker one is
great for if you have a tan it's gonna
give you a gorgeous glow this one looks
a little bit better on lighter skin tone
because it's not it's not gonna give you
like a tan look it's just gonna
accentuate your own skin it's gonna make
it look flawless it's gonna make it look
like you have diamonds on your skin so
this body bling by Scott Barnes is
amazing I am obsessed with it and yeah
so I'm going to show you guys swatches
right now so you could see the
difference in colors but it's gorgeous
and I know I'm gonna be trenching myself
in this the whole summertime the whole
summertime the whole summer so next I
have two nail polishes that are gorgeous
for spring and summer the color that I
had on in my last couple videos was
Essie sitting pretty and I think could
be wrong because SE always releases new
stuff I think this is from their new
collection but I again I could be wrong
I'm not sure but it's such a vibrant
bright purple gorgeous I know a lot of
people were asking what color it was and
since I was away I didn't have any
product so I wasn't sure exactly the
color and another one that I'm just I've
been in love with for at least two years
now is the China Glaze flip flop fantasy
and it's just such a bright neon corally
orange color and it looks gorgeous with
a tan I love it on my nails and my feet
so wherever you want to put it but it's
but it is such a gorgeous color and I'm
obsessed screams summer time so I
quickly wanted to mention a couple non
beauty related items because they've
been my favorite I've mentioned in a few
videos how my skin is just it just hates
me I have such a sensitive skin that I
can't use any flavor lotions I can't use
good detergent I have to use everything
like made for sensitive skin free of
dyes free of this because I just have
eczema and my skin just horrible
I wanted to just mention my razor only
because I didn't realize how good it was
until Brett wanted this razor because he
loved it and I wanted my own so I went
out and bought a different one that was
also good for sensitive skin and it just
like pulled and it just hurt and made me
rub rub burn
razor burn so I didn't realize how
amazing this was until I tried a
different one it's the Schick Hydro silk
I'm pretty sure it's called this one is
for sensitive skin the heads that I use
are made for sensitive skin and it has
like a nice little cushion on it so it
does not give me wrap um Jesus remember
does not give me razor burn and it just
makes my skin feel super soft and yeah
so if you guys have really sensitive
skin and you're looking for a good razor
that's not gonna affect you this one has
been great for me and I used to use just
like the disposable Daisy razors forever
and I like those but I always would get
razor burn if I didn't use a lot of soap
or a lot of anything with it so this one
is worth the money in my opinion there's
a helicopter outside my window would you
try to acquire the next product is
deodorant it's by Tom's and I think it
was one of my nighttime routine videos
where I mentioned that I applied the
odorant before I go to bed and I saw a
lot of people comments
and letting me know that it's like
really really bad to hide uterine before
you go to bed because what a lot of you
were saying is that there's an
ingredient in it that can cause cancer
and blah blah so I was just like okay
well I won't be using that's the owner
anymore this is the one that I picked up
after that because it says that it's no
artificial fragrance or preservatives
its long-lasting its natural it's
aluminum free and it has like a pretty
nice scent to it also on the back it has
like a million different reasons why
that this one's like better so I've
heard good things about Tom's I also use
their toothpaste because we're trying to
get the healthiest thing that you can
get let me know if you guys have heard
anything about the Sprint I've been
using it and I felt safer about it I
haven't felt any difference or I've been
seen any difference but I just heard
that it was healthier for you guys so I
wanted to mention it because I think
that's one thing a lot of us don't
realize myself included is that there's
so many products out there that are so
bad for us and we don't know and we use
them on a daily basis and they're saying
that it can cause breast cancer think of
how close your armpit is to your boobs
so it's like it only makes sense so I
think this option is a lot better than
maybe some of the other options that
they have out there just thought I would
throw that in to share with you guys um
the next thing that I wanted to mention
is honesty I've always been in love with
tea usually I only drink hot tea I have
all kinds of different teas at home that
I'm obsessed with
but I also love the Starbucks tea but it
has a lot of sugar in it so I know it's
not really good for you this was
actually something I found my mistake I
was just craving some sort of iced tea
and I think Brett ran it's a la bar or
something and just put like pulled
whatever he saw this one is the
raspberry and then there's also like a
green tea with like honey or something
and you could just tell that they're
healthy they're not super sweet and
they're not like oh my god delicious but
they're so refreshing and you just feel
good drinking them there's 100 calories
per serving 26 grams of sugar which
actually I think that's kind of high but
it is organic and I have been liking it
a lot and apparently
a lot better for you than a Snapple or
some of the other teams out there so
another favorite that I wanted to
mention and then last but not least my
candles that I have been burning all
over my house this is coconut vanilla
bean
it's Yankee scandal it's so delicious
normally my obsession I know one of them
would oh mama Lee my obsession is
vanilla candles
I've loved any type of like vanilla
vanilla cupcake like all of those yummy
vanilla flavors that I'm sure you guys
have all heard heard have all smells
just basically anything vanilla was the
ones that I was grabbed first but when I
smelled this one I think I gotta have
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond I was like oh my god
yes I bought like ten of them and they
smell so delicious yeah I figured for
this month I would include a couple
non-bt favorites I hope you guys enjoyed

really happy when I recommend something
