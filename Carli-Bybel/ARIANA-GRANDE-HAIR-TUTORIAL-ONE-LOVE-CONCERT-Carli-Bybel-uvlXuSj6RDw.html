today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this ariana grande inspired hair
tutorial so over the weekend I assumed
into her one love concert and I thought
it was such a beautiful idea and I
really only originally planned on maybe
watching it for a little bit just to
kind of see how it was going but I found
the house and I watched the entire
concert on Sunday with all the tragedies
that have been going on in Manchester
and then London it's just so
heartbreaking I was personally in
Manchester and London last year and
they're such beautiful cities to see all
those crowds of people show up and be
brave I think was just so empowering and
so beautiful and I was really excited to
create this list for you guys today
but I also wanted to do to help out and
have you guys also help out is for any
dollar that I make on my Adsense for
this video I will be donating a hundred
percent of it to the Manchester Relief
Fund to help support the families and
the victims so make sure to share this
video with your friends or anyone that
you know that loves ariana grande
because the more views the more money
that we will be able to donate so if you
guys want to see how I got this
hairstyle right here inspired by the
beautiful ariana then please keep
watching and we can do a video together
did anyone do mom's hair for me I'm
going to do it hi I'm Chyna so this is
the first time I've had nails on in a
very long time so it might give me a
little bit longer but we shall see using
a little comb her braids are pretty
small so Karthik since we're doing a
high ponytail you only have to braid
till about here let me help probably
going to be like around right there the
same thing on the other side
under suppose Thomas compasses all into
a low ponytail just to keep it out of
the way the first braid of my talk you
guys through in case you have never done
a French braid before I do have a Dutch
braid tutorial where I go a little bit
more in depth which I will link for you
guys right here so you can go check that
out if you need a little bit more
explanation but like I said I'm going
talking to the first one so I'm using a
little bit of this shine spray just to
kind of like smooth my hair without
making it hard you guys can use hair
spray to or like wood or anything so
we're going to start in the front part
of the hair so with the piece like this
and we're going to section that into
three little sections like so we're
going to take section one we're going to
put it underneath section two and then
section three put under Section two does
that make sense I'm smoothing left and
right in the middle so again we're going
to do left my left probably your right
underneath the middle tight in and then
right underneath the middle tighten so
we do that two times so that's going to
start out the braid with each piece grab
a tiny little piece so from the left
side we're going to cross under the
middle and tie in and then from the left
side under tight end the chaos of check
in each time and just keep grabbing a
little pieces of hair all sounds right
so we're grabbing pieces and we're just
putting it underneath the middle piece
every time so again we're grabbing this
piece put it on there tie em continue
again nails they're not making my life
any easier so yeah we are continuing all
the way back and you want to make sure
you're only grabbing hair from that
section that way it stays nice and
straight and then once you get to the
last piece of hair braid it out a little
bit so it stays nice and tight so it's
always left under the middle right under
the middle left under the middle right
under the middle and I'm going to secure
it with one of these little rubber
elastic
I could probably made this braid a
little bit tighter but since we're
applying the little rings all throughout
the braid anyway it doesn't matter
there's your first one right down the
center next on my section off like this
section all of those if you're doing
like a half-up half-down you could use a
comb please kind of double as comb and
I'm just going to put that into a
ponytail so it doesn't get stuck let me
just flip it so I'll take my comb and
then I want to drag it right next to my
ear and up to the side and get that next
section of hair so this is the piece and
I'm going to take the rest of my hair
and put that all in one ponytail again
and then I like to clip actually just do
it stays separate I'm just going to take
this clip right here so it pulls this
hair upside from it could spray it a
little bit if you want with the shine
spray or whatever else
under under under and then we're going
to start grabbing I'm never going to
braid like this small on the side of my
head so hopefully it's work we're going
to take peace Thunder hey n take the
piece under tighten so the keys of this
look is just to like you master how to
do a Dutch braid
you could try bigger grades first it's a
little bit easier to learn it's the same
exact step so it's just about once you
get two steps down it's just about like
keeping it super tight and then just
braiding up the side of your hair
sorry guys I know this isn't the best
angle right now but
I'm finishing up this grade and we're
just going to tighten it so again don't
worry if the brains aren't perfect these
clips we're going to put a nut in that
it's going to cover so we're going to
secure it again with an elastic so I'm
just taking my finger right above my ear
and I'm dragging it all in back as if I
was doing like a half up half down and
then we want to make it to sing drag it
up as well just clip it into this clip
and then I want to just I'm a mess right
now we're going to just put all this and
a hair tie so we don't get any confusion
oh I'm sweating so you want to make sure
when we are smoothing the ponytail back
we're not brushing the braids it's so
hard to do it a high ponytail and you
have like really really long hair so
they are listening while I smooth it out
so now at this point I'm going to use a
little bit of hairspray this is the
Texas T hair spray and that's just to
make sure it's all smooth and separated
so you can see the braids so then we are
going to secure the pony try to keep it
as tight as humanly possible and we're
going to do one more because my hair is
really thick and it never saved spray it
once you get it secure and I'm going to
use this comb just to make sure it's all
smooth back so just kind of scoop it
back and again any of these little like
bumps back here which I don't have many
usually I have more will be covered and
I'll show you how we cover them in a
minute so I like to use like a little
eyebrow brush and you can just smooth up
your flyaways so I don't actually use
this brush on my eyebrows I'll just use
it for like little parts on my hair so
slice right hairs Brown it okay so I'm
going to pin the braid down just a
little bit so it's placed flat over here
so this is all my natural hair but hers
is even longer for the show and I'm
going to show you like I said easy way
to add some extensions there may be
better ways if you have shorter hair to
apply extensions with a ponytail this is
just how I am going to be doing it today
so if this technique doesn't work
reowww I'm sure there's like a billion
different tutorials online that you guys
can look at I'm going to put another
elastic right below my other elastic
approaches because my hairs are DC and
I'm going to be using the Bellamy clip
in extension these are the longest ones
they have and I'm going to clip the end
of the clip right above that other hair
tie and I'm going to wrap it around and
clip each clip around the ponytail and
slowly like bring it up as you wrap it
that's the first one I may only use two
actually
cuz I want it to be like insanely heavy
but we'll see so we're going to repeat
the same thing we're just going to clip
right above wherever the last clip was
and wrap it around and clip it as you
wrap it
so added a little bit more volume as you
can see now we can't just leave it like
this we're going to have to finish off
this look which is perfect because this
is how she wears her hair so we're going
to just paint a piece of hair from
underneath and we're going to wrap this
around the ponytail and then we're going
to secure it with a bobby pin now that's
that's done what you guys can do if you
want her smile like tilts up now I'm
sure her stylist probably has a better
technique than this but I've done this
before and it talks it all day and no
one ever can see it if you get a little
clip like this you're going to pick up
the ponytail and you're just going to
clip this right underneath like that and
like dig it in and it's just going to
give automatic lips to your ponytail and
you can't see the clip you could spray
it one more time make sure the hair that
the wrap is nice and smooth okay so now
that we are looking good at our the
ponytail you're going to start applying
these little silver ring so I've never
done this before and I have one nails so
this may take a little while these I
bought right off of Amazon I also found
the exact rings on Etsy so I'll link
both of em for you guys if you want to
go check them out so I'm going to use
two pleasers to open up these rings
better open up good we're going to scoop
these puppies in don't know how oh there
we go that was easier alright so now I'm
just going to also with the centered one
so she had one like really close to the
front so now I'm just going to make sure
that I tighten them as well so they
don't fall out like that
so found easier when open that I'm just
sticking my finger in one side and then
the tweezer to help open it and it opens
it up a little bit faster and easier so
this little trick I think that looks
good so I use nine on the middle ones
and I'm probably going to do the same
down the sides so my braids on the sides
of a hundred percent been better but
again with these rings it's okay it
covers the braid anyway so I was doing
that um from the elves would be so much
easier for sure
I would say this hairstyle can be done
on your own clearly too I'm doing it but
if you want it to be like perfect at
least for the ring part I would
definitely have someone help you this is
the final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I'm sending so much love
to every single person watching this
right now and especially to all of those
families and friends who are affected in
this horrible tragedy but again I love
you guys so much thank you for watching
and until next time I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
