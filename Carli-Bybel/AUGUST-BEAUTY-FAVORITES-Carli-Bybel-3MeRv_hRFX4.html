was planning on uploading my full review
of my new Carli bybel palette if you
guys don't follow me on social media and
you have no idea what I'm talking about
I'm coming out with my own eye shadow
and highlighter palette with BH
Cosmetics there's a total of 14 colors
and I will be posting the video tomorrow
probably early afternoon of full
swatches the full review so you can
really see it up close and personal so I
did film majority of that video today I
was just waiting to receive a brand new
palette I had been playing around with
mine for so long that it's kind of a
mess so I wanted to be able to show you
guys like a full fresh new palette but
they were supposed to be delivered today
and now they're not coming till tomorrow
morning so it's now 4 p.m. and I was
just notified that it won't be coming
till tomorrow so I figured it's been a
while since I've done a favorites video
so I just wanted to sit down and talk
about some of my favorite beauty
products at the moment and I promise
tomorrow morning you guys will get the
full hundred-percent review with
swatches and colors and close-up images
and all that good stuff so if you guys
can hold it off a few more hours I
greatly appreciate it and if you guys
want to hear some of my beauty favorites
from the past month please keep watching
so the first product that I wanted to
mention is the new Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation I picked these up
when I was in LA I got them from nannies
which was one of the most deadliest
stores that I've ever been in me and
Nicole went there twice within like two
days and spent way too much money but I
picked up the two Ultra HD foundations
in 127 and 153 which are now why 335 and
why 405 and these foundations are so
incredible one of the main reasons that
I love this foundation is I just love
how it looks on my skin after I apply it
normally I apply a bunch of layers I'll
do foundation and concealer and the
bronzer and this and this and that but
once I apply one coat of this foundation
my skin literally looked flawless
it didn't seep into any of my pores that
created this just gorgeous finish on my
skin and just creates a great base for
all of the steps you're going to
on top of it if you guys are looking for
a really great foundation I definitely
recommend this they say it's a lot
better on camera as well and I noticed
once I started using it on camera my
skin looked a little bit more flawless
so these are the ones that I've been
using the past month every video that
you have seen I have used these as my
foundation so if anyone has been asking
this is the one that I've been using I
just really really love the consistency
and I love the finish that it leaves on
your face so I'm obsessed with those I
also wanted to let you guys know on the
Make Up For Ever store not the section
in Sephora the actual makeup forever
store you can also get a pro card where
I have 40% off in that store as well so
if you guys are makeup artist and you do
have the credentials I would definitely
look into getting the discount program
because getting everything 40% is just
like a huge huge huge deal so yeah I
would definitely recommend looking a
little bit deeper into all of that if
you guys want to get a sick discount
because 40% is just like life-changing
next I wanted to talk about this new
primer that I've been using this primer
is just so amazing for mattifying your
face so if you have deep pores if you
have fine lines this will instantly make
your skin look completely flawless I
have a couple others that do the same
idea but this what I noticed just makes
your skin look the most perfect it's by
dr. Brandt and it's called pores no more
and I bought this one from Sephora
I believe and it's just so amazing it's
a nice creamy texture you put it on and
it literally mattifies your face so I
feel like with back-to-school if you
guys don't really want to wear a lot of
makeup if you get a primer like this
it's going to help really give your skin
that flawless face at a foundation or
concealer and all that would do so no
makeup makeup look apply this and then
you're good to go so this has been my
favorite the past month or so
um I've gone back to a couple old ones
and I don't know I just found that this
one has been my absolute favorite I feel
like besides this one the other one
that's like my 110 go-to which you guys
probably already know is the Smashbox
pore minimizing primer but this
definitely gives it a run for its money
I'm not sure how much this one goes for
compared the Smashbox but I will list
everything below in the description box
as usual for you guys the next product
that I wanted to mention is by best damn
beauty which is Nicole Guerrero's brand
it's the best damn lip mask and it comes
in like this little jar it's pink and
it's so thick and I've been applying
this every single time I apply my liquid
lipsticks which if you guys know me you
know I tend to stick away from the
glosses so one thing that I hated was
when I'd get like that line across my
lips from wearing the liquid lipsticks
my lips are just always so so so dry and
she actually told me this trick when I
was out there and then when I finally
got this mask I tried it out and I was
literally blown away so I just love the
consistency of it it's super creamy
super thick and it just makes your lips
feel so moisturize and it also helps
keep the liquid lipstick on all day so
this is a must-have I'm obsessed with it
Nicole good job with this because this
is literally life and I'm using it every
single day so I mentioned body bling and
a couple of my videos which is a little
bit more of a pricey version of what I
have right here this is the hard candy
glow all the way
glamazon bronzed face and body
illuminizer it says it's infused with 24
karat gold but I just absolutely love
this one I think it's an exact duplicate
of the body bling it just doesn't stain
your hands as much so if you guys are
looking for something really affordable
that's going to give you the beautiful
shimmery airbrushed look on your body
this one you can get right at Walmart
and again I don't know how much it is
but I know it's a lot more affordable
than the body bling which I had
mentioned previously so I mean they're
all they all do the same thing I do love
those just as much as this but I found a
cheaper alternative and I wanted to
mention it to you guys because the stuff
is amazing I know summer is really
ending but if you guys are going out
somewhere you have a special occasion
and the steer legs or your arms or your
chest and you will literally be a bronze
glowing goddess this new liner I've been
using a lot lately I'm actually wearing
it right now it's the max spice liner
it's like a brownish pink it's just a
really really great color I love the Mac
lip liner so obsessed with Oak stripped
down whirl and boldly bare and soar
those are like my number number number
ones if you're going to make more than
one a number one but this one's spiced
is just such a gorgeous shade it's good
if you want to do like a brown lip if
you want to do a nude lip it's just
really really
pretty so I want to mention that as well
while we're on the subject of lips I
wanted to talk about bow and arrow by
Kat Von D I actually had the original
bow and arrow which was released like
three four years ago and then they
discontinued it which was so bizarre to
me because it was literally one of my
favorites I never used it back in the
day because it was sold out and there
was no point of using it when none of
you guys can get it but with her new
launch of the new colors this one came
out again last time I checked it was out
of stock on Sephora but I know randomly
they're restocking everything so I'm
gonna check for you guys if it's not in
stock I will keep checking back and
letting you guys know if they do restock
it but it's just such a gorgeous brown
taupe color and I mean I use this
throughout the summer but with fall
coming like these are my go-to shades
these Browns these nudes these mob
colors so I'm literally obsessed with
this one another favorite liquid
lipstick is sepia by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and this is just a beautiful like
brownish gray taupe colored liquid
lipstick and again with this one I did
wear it throughout the summer but I know
it's Paul coming these shades as well as
like the dark cranberries and the dark
plums are going to be my go-to so this
is just absolutely gorgeous I love every
single liquid lipstick that they came
out with they are just my obsession
right now so sorry if you guys don't
really like the liquid lipsticks I just
tend to stick with them over the gloss
as of right now next I wanted to talk
about this brush cleaner it's by semi
secrets and it's the quick drying rinse
free formula if you guys have not heard
of this this has literally changed my
entire life um I only bought in about a
month ago and the reason that it's
basically halfway empty is three three I
can't do three like isn't it weird okay
so I could do three perfectly on this
finger but when I try and do three like
look what look what happens that's what
my three looks like why it's like a claw
anyway so on three separate occasions I
was using this to clean my brushes
I had the cap off and I accidentally
like elbowed it off of my vanity and it
just fell right over bring out
and honestly tragic the first time it
happened I was like crying like oh my
god I'm wasting all this stuff and it's
staying my carpet and then happened two
times after that all in like the matter
of two days so it's basically gone at
this point I did use a lot on my actual
brushes what I've been doing the past
month or so is when I deep clean my
brushes with the vegetable oil and the
dish soap they're brand new and perfect
and then once you use them they're like
completely ruined again so in between
the deep cleaning if you use this
literally within seconds your brush will
be brand spankin new and it dries
instantly so it's just absolutely crazy
I don't know what is actually in it I
don't know what is in it to make it that
incredible but the stuff is a must-have
if you guys have makeup brushes and
another thing I wanted to mention is
make sure you're cleaning your brushes
there are bacteria and all kinds of
gross things hanging out on your brushes
my mom I went over to her house and my
mom had a brush that was not clean she
said in like a couple years I was like
mom you need to clean your brushes so if
you are lazy like me get this product
and it will literally save you hours and
hours and hours so yeah I'm obsessed so
if you guys saw my updated skincare
routine you probably saw me talk about
my eczema about all the problems I was
having and I think that was about a
month maybe a little longer ago so I
wanted to give you guys just an update
on the CeraVe cream I am in love I think
I was only like a week in when I had
first mentioned it and I left and I told
you guys that I would keep you updated
on what I felt and my eczema has been
gone like gone it's not here I'm not
itching my life has literally been
changed ever since I've been using this
product so again if you guys didn't see
that video I will link it for you guys
so you can check it out and I can tell
you guys - step-by-step as a how I apply
it and what I've been doing and why it's
been working but a month later and I
have had no flare-ups you guys are
really looking for something good and
affordable the surabhai cream has been
like and again go check out my videos so
you could see the different steps that
I've been using in order to keep my
eczema away so next I wanted to talk
about this concealer that I'm obsessed
with and that I've been using all the
time I don't know if I've ever mentioned
this in a favorites video
I tend to grab this one when I want to
do a March
maduk look and just I mean like a lot of
coverage if I have very dark circles
that day this is the anastacio concealer
I have it in a couple different colors
this is in the color 2.0 which I got a
spray tan a couple days ago so that's
why I've been using this one when my
skin is paler I use it in point
seven-five and it's just so creamy and
so thick and just goes on so nicely and
when you set your under eyes with the
powder it's gonna give you like a
perfect flawless look you don't need to
do anything after that
so this concealer if you're looking for
a really full coverage concealer this is
worth every single penny if you guys
don't like full-on glam then maybe skip
out on that concealer just because again
it is really full coverage and I'm
obsessed with it but for an everyday
look it's probably not something that
you guys need next I just wanted to
quickly mention I picked up about two
months ago from I think Ulta the Tarte
um what are they called Amazonian clay
full coverage airbrush foundation and
I'm gonna do a video for you guys
because I've never done a powder
foundation routine and I'm not going to
go full of detail into this I'll do the
video like I said because I think for
back-to-school powder foundations are
just so easy and also during the whole
summer when I was just running out to do
errands or something like that and I
didn't want to put any makeup on I just
use a little bit of this airbrush
foundation and it just gives you the
perfect flawless look these are amazing
I have them in the color fair light
neutral and light medium beige these
matched my skin when I was paler they
definitely would not match my skin right
now but they're amazing and if you guys
want to see the foundation routine using
only powders let me know because I would
love to film that for you guys so next I
wanted to talk about my surf spray by
bumble and bumble I've probably
mentioned this in a favorites video but
the past month I've been curling my hair
a lot and I've been doing like big
beachy waves I know a lot of people have
been asking what how I've been doing my
hair and I'll definitely do a tutorial
for you guys I know it's been like two
three years since I've done all of my
hair curling videos so if you guys want
to see that also let me know but this is
empty this is my second bottle that I
went through this past year it's
completely empty I need to go pick up
another one but what I do is I curl my
hair and then once I'm done I just
spritz it in and just
kind of go like this and it gives you
that beautiful beachy look next I just
wanted to quickly mention these little
bh cosmetics lipsticks i have a bunch of
them and I didn't try them out until
recently and I was so blown away at how
pigmented they were they look like
they're mini sized so they're good to
travel with but they're actually a
full-size lipstick if you open it up and
I just wanted to show you guys swatches
of these because when i swatched them i
was literally like what the and they're
just such gorgeous shades I actually
have one more that I brought out at the
conceit purple so I'm going to show you
guys close-up of the 3 swatches and
you're going to see with just one swipe
how pigmented they are they're so cute
and affordable so I wanted to include
this in today's video and last but not
least so this is my new eyeshadow
palette most of you guys probably
already saw the picture that I posted
all over my social media but this is it
and isn't it pretty um I'm not going to
go full detail into this because that
video is coming tomorrow where I'm going
to show you the inside the inside is top
secret until then I actually posted on
my snapchat the first row of the five
shades which are my favorite I love
those shades so if you guys want to go
check it out there's a little sneak peek
on there but I wanted to include it
because I have been using this for the
past couple of months and there's been
so many times where people are like oh
my god I love your makeup do a video and
I was like well I can't really do a
video yet I had a hold off and it's
gonna be so affordable for you guys
besides the fact that it's super super
super pigmented it's anybody can go out
and buy it which is my goal which was
the reason that I wanted to create the
palette with them because I wanted
everyone to be able to buy it I didn't
want it to be like a high-end item that
only certain people can afford I wanted
anyone to go out and try it and you guys
are going to be blown away by the
quality I'm so so so proud of it and I
can't wait for the video to go up
tomorrow so you guys can see all about
it so right now I think that is it as
far as my August favorites I hope you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
come back and check my channel out
tomorrow because I'm getting up the full
review of my Carli bybel palette and so
excited to be sharing it with you guys I
love you so much thank you for watching
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
