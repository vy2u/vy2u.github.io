I got this Adriana Lima inspired makeup
look I think the two reasons why
everybody loves Adriana Lima is her eyes
and her lips I mean of course there was
a million other things that I could name
when I did this Adriana Lima look I
definitely changed my eyebrows a little
bit
she's very thick more straight eyebrows
where mine have more of an arch so first
I apply a dark brown eyeshadow to my
eyebrows and I filled them out after
this tutorial I noticed they weren't
thick enough so I did go back and redo
them again you just want to make sure
they do look natural first I'm going to
be taking this color from Mac it's a
pearly white color and this is going to
go all over your entire eyelid next I'm
going to taking my wet n wild Halloween
palette and I'm using the white
eyeshadow in the tear duct of my eye
next from my other wet and wild
Halloween palette I'm taking this white
sparkly color the reason I'm using this
first is it's going to give it a very
very light undertone and also when I put
glitter on later it will help the
glitter stick to it then I'm going to be
applying a white loose glitter - by mac
cosmetics you're going to just put a
little bit on a brush and make sure you
blow the brush before you actually put
on your eye because you don't want to
get any sparkles in your eyes then
you're going to line your upper lash
line I'm using a liquid eye pencil by
Jordana cosmetics it's always a lot
easier to do this in sections like I've
said previously definitely keep your
eyes open as you're doing it and do it
slow because you probably won't be able
to get a straight line the first try you
also want to make sure you drag it out
forming a tail
then I'm going to be using a medium
brown color from my Maybelline palette
and this is going to go in the crease
right above my eye the most important
thing here is to blend make sure you
blend everything in it's often helpful
if you wipe off whatever eyeshadows on
your blending brush and just blend
whatever's in the crease upwards so it's
not a sharp line and it's very very
natural-looking
then you're going to line your lower
lashes with a dark brown eye shadow
you're only going to use this in the
outer half of your eye apply your
mascara as you normally would she has
very thick lashes so if you want to add
a couple individual lashes you can do it
that way we can put a little loose
powder on your eyelashes and it'll
actually make them thicker by dragging
out the line in your tear duct does make
your eyes appear longer and more sultry
like Adriana Lima
then I'll be lining my lips with a skin
colored lip pencil
the base color for my lips I'm going to
be using a concealer stick you're just
going to use a little bit on your
fingers and Pat it onto your lips
following that you're going to be using
a light pink lip gloss and that's going
to go all over your lips
then you're going to use a white
shimmery color and apply that right onto
the tops of your lips and also the
bottom center of your lips this is going
to make your lips appear bigger the
second to less step I'm going to be
using a peach colored lipstick all over
my entire lips after all these steps
you're going to have a lot of products
on your lip so you are going to want to
blot it with a napkin and then you're
going to apply a clear gloss over the
entire thing I'm using lip venom which
is a lip plumper as well and that is how
I got my Adriana Lima inspired look I
hope you enjoyed and thank you so much
