this is love it it lays heaven knows
it's had time I've been waiting oh man
to low hi ladies thank you for watching
so in this makeup look I'm going to be
using my new Naked 2 palette from
Sephora I absolutely love this I just
got it and the colors are really
pigmented so it's awesome it's $50 so
it's a little pricey but I mean it comes
with a lot of really pretty colors
they're all kind of neutrals and there's
some matte and there's some shimmer most
of them are shimmer which are fun and
it's perfect for the summer because with
a nice tan you can use any of these
colors and get a great look all of the
colors that I'm going to be using on my
eyes are from this palette there's also
I'm using a bronze color from Mac so
I'll post the name of that one also so
if you want to learn how I got this
Adriana Lima inspired makeup look please
keep watching oh and for those who are
asking I did get my hair done I went and
got it done at a salon I got the ombre
look which fades from like the dark to
the light
this color is caramel and basically she
did just like the bottoms of my hair and
she added a couple highlights like
throughout so for those of you who are
asking that's the color that I have in
my hair so please keep watching and
season to apply this blush I'm going to
be using the eye shadow brush that comes
with this palette first taking my Sonia
Kasia concealer quad I'm just going to
be applying this right on my eyelid as
an eyeshadow base the first color I'm
going to be taking is the color VirB
from The Naked palette and this is going
to be going right in the tear duct of my
eye and I'm going to be dragging it
inwards on the inner third of my eye
the next color that I'm taking is called
snakebite this color is going to be
going on the outer part of my lid and
I'm going to be dragging it inwards
picking up the color half-baked I'm then
going to be applying this on the middle
part of my eyelid right over the brown
color
now using the other end of this
eyeshadow brush I'm then going to be
taking that same brown color and
applying it right in the crease of my
eye blending it upwards
to give it more of a bronzey look I'm
taking the color amber lights by Mac and
just applying this again over the three
shadows I have used previously right in
the middle of my eyelid
with the blending side of my brush I'm
taking the color chopper and I'm just
going to be applying this right in the
crease of my eye focusing on the inner
part taking a small angled brush and
that same brown color from my Naked
palette I'm just going to be drawing a
line right underneath my eye
go over that same line with this
brighter color taking my NYX gold
glitter I'm then going to be adding a
little bit of the glitter underneath my
eye and then going to be lining my upper
lash line with my Bobbi Brown gel liner
to give your eyes more depth I'm taking
a black color from my Naked palette and
I'm just applying this right in the
outer V of my eye here then I'm going to
want to apply your mascara at this time
my favorite is by L'Oreal and it's a
telescopic mascara and carbon black
the lipstick that I'm using is by Rimmel
it's called dreamy and I booked a set of
Walgreens so you can really get it at
any drugstore
so that is how I got my Adriana Lima
inspired makeup look using my naked 2
Urban Decay palette I hope you ladies
enjoyed and thank you so much for
watching I love you all bye gonna close
