one more day sing to you one last time
and make
all right it's hard for me to explain I
love you more every day hi everyone
thank you for watching so it's been a
really long time since I've done a more
dramatic fun makeup look and I figured
since now that spring is finally here I
would show you guys it's really pretty
light orange and a little pop of
turquoise makeup look what's really cool
as I'm using two pallets in this they're
both limited edition by BH Cosmetics and
they're both only 11 dollars each so
this look is very affordable I love it
for springtime I think it's super bright
and it really pops and I really think
this look would look good on all eye
colors so if you don't have blue eyes
don't worry this isn't just for
blue-eyed people so if you want to learn
how to get it please keep watching for
this look I want my eyelid as white as
possible to start because I am doing a
very light peach and white eyelid and
with this look it's a lot easier I
noticed because I have done it a few
times to use something like a white
eyeshadow base I believe it or not used
face paint
it's like face makeup from like
Halloween time and I just use it because
it's thick and it goes on nice on your
eyes and it also works as a good base
and it works to keep it on all day so
I'm just taking a little bit on my brush
and applying it on my eyelid
to achieve this look I'm using these two
new pallets and they're both by BH
Cosmetics and if you open them up they
have all different colors on each side
these pallets are only 11 dollars each
which is just crazy so the first color
I'm taking is a white color and I'm just
gonna be applying it in the inner part
of my eye and also around my tear duct
then mixing these two colors I'm going
to be applying this right on my entire
eyelid
these colors together gives you an
awesome right peachy color I think out
of all my eyeshadows this one is going
to be one of my favorites for summer
because I love peach right now like
anything like peach right now is just my
favorite now that you have the both
colors on the lid you're just going to
take a little bit more of the white and
you're gonna blend it out into the
orange then using this light beige
sparkly color I'm just gonna be applying
this right into my crease with this big
blending brush cuz this is just going to
add a nice little shadow and it's also
going to blend very lightly into the
colors that are on your lid one thing i
recently started doing was putting on my
eyelashes before i did my eyeliner and
the outer darker part of my eye shadow
because one thing I noticed is if I
would do my whole eye then apply the
eyeliner and then the lashes I would
always end up going over the outer part
darker and extending it a little bit
because once you have the lashes on it
kind of extends your eye on its own so
to make things a little bit easier and
not do as many steps I'm going to be
applying my lashes right now so now that
the eyelashes are on we are going to be
doing the eyeliner
then I'm taking this black color and I'm
applying it right in the outer V of my
eye
then we're taking this brown sparkly
color and we're going to blend it out
into the crease
then just taking a little bit of the
school color I'm going to be applying it
right above the darkest color right up
here I'm taking this lighter beige color
I'm going to be applying it right
underneath my brow bone
then I'm applying some mascara and this
is just gonna make your real lashes
blend in with the fake ones next for the
lower lash line I'm taking this bright
blue color mixing it with the turquoise
color and this is just going to go right
on my lower lash line
after you finish that you're gonna want
to put at least one more coat on your
lower lashes because the eyeshadow I was
gonna lighten them a bit so this is my
final look I hope you all enjoyed don't
forget if you want to know what I used
on my lips and my face and everything
else I have a blog now where I'm going
to be listing all details and any links
that I could find I will be linking the
products as well to make it a lot easier
for you guys so again I'm gonna link
that all below and I hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you schedule I would
find the words I'd sing them out oughta
be heard for you I would find my faves
I'd tear them down wet boy your tears</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
