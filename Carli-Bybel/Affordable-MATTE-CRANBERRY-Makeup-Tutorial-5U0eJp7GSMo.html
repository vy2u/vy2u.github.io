today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this full matte cranberry look I
wanted to recreate something that was
affordable for those of you guys that
are on a budget and you want to recreate
this look also really quickly today
we're going to get little Cindy girlis
sister from the same litter so I can't
wait to little babies and if you want to
learn how I got this look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
using benefit stay don't stray from my
eyeshadow I always notice that when I
apply this first my eyeshadow stays on a
lot longer I'm just using my brush to
blend that all in and you want to make
sure you're applying it a little higher
up especially for a more dramatic look
like this using the morphe 35n palette
I'm picking up this nude color and I'm
applying it in the inner part of my eye
I do have a 10% off code from morphe so
you guys can get a 10% off next I'm
picking up this dark cranberry color and
I'm just applying a little bit to kind
of measure out where I want to go then
I'm grabbing the lighter cranberry color
and putting it right next to the darker
cranberry and I'm going to slowly do
like an ombre look so I'm going back in
with the dark cranberry and I'm now
applying this darker on the outer third
of my eye I am dipping my brush into
fix+ to get it really really pigmented
next picking up this light beige color
I'm blending that next to the light
cranberry and next to the whiter shade
just to give it again more of an ombre
look picking up my smaller brush with
that dark cranberry color I'm going to
start applying that in the crease of my
eye I want this to be really neat
looking and not so blended so that's why
I'm using that smaller brush and then
I'm going in with my pencil brush and
that same color just to blend it out a
little bit so it's not such a harsh line
I really love how this look came out I
think it looks super neat and it's
easier to see the different colors on
your lid so try out this technique and
let me know what you guys think so I am
grabbing my blending brush a little bit
of that dark cranberry and I'm just
going to start blending it into my
crease
feel free to blend it as high as you
want of course with my large blending
brush I'm picking up this yellow shade
and I'm applying that above the
cranberry so it looks a little silly at
this point but once you blend it all
together it's going to give it a really
really nice overall look
then with my pencil brush I'm using the
black shade and I'm applying just a
little little bit right on the outer
just to give it a little bit more of a
deep contrast so just keep blending
until it looks up to your standards so
next I'm just lining my eyes with a
black liquid liner I'm going back in
with that yellow shade and my pencil
brush blending it underneath my eyes
then I'm grabbing the dark cranberry and
applying that closer to my actual lash
line so again it's going to give that
bottom lash line a nice ombre look as
well next comes mascara this is my
L'Oreal telescopic as usual and then if
you want you can apply a black liner in
the inner tear-duct so I'm grabbing my
Carli bybel palette which is finally
back in stock hallelujah and I'm taking
the light pink eyeshadow and I'm gonna
use that to highlight my nose I love
using this shade for a highlight it's
just so beautiful so I'm applying a
little bit down the bridge of my nose
and then the little ball at the tip
Nicole taught me this trick and I'm
obsessed I'm applying some on my Cupid's
bow on whatever that thing is called
above your lip and then I'm going in
with my Sonia Kashuk bronzer I love this
one you can get it at Target and it has
a really pretty sheen to it so I am just
applying that with a smaller contour
brush
for blush I'm using this elf palette
it's so great the colors are really
pigmented I'm mixing the two bottom
shades together and I'm just very
lightly blending that in going back in
with my palette I'm using the second
highlighter shade and I'm just applying
a little little bit if it were
summertime I'd be going a little bit
harder on the hand but during the winter
I don't know I like to usually have a
matte face but with this look I just
wanted to add a little bit of shimmer so
for lipstick I'm using this one by
Gerard cosmetics I do have a 40% off
code for anyone interested and to line
my lips I'm using this one by la girl
I'm not sure of the name but I will list
it below for you guys
and to finish off this look I'm using
this NYX mattifying setting spray this
is my first time using it so I will keep
you guys posted on how I like it so this
is the final result this look took a
little bit longer than expected so make
sure if you want to recreate it you give
yourself a little extra time I wanted to
do an all matte cranberry look because I
feel like majority of the time I'm
always using shimmery shadows I just
love a nice shimmer but I hope you guys
enjoyed this look I love you guys so
much and until next time I will see you
all later
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
