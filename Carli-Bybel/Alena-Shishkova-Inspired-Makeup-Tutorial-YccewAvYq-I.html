hi ladies thank you for watching if you
watched my village esterday and you
wanted to know how I did my makeup this
is the tutorial for it
it is inspired by a Russian model her
name is Elaine Ashish gova and she's
honestly one of the most beautiful women
I've ever seen in my entire life
I loved her makeup in this picture
because it was very natural but it had a
little bit of a bronzey look to it so if
you like how my makeup looks just keep
watching and I'll show you how I got
this first you're going to want to apply
a concealer all over your eyelids either
that or an eyeshadow base using my ELF
palette I'm going to be using this
pearly white color and I'm going to
apply this all over my entire eyelid i'm
using my Ecotools shader brush for this
you're also going to want to highlight
underneath your brow bone with the same
color then taking my Mac blending brush
and this brown shimmer color I'm going
to be applying this right in the crease
of my eye
since this color is really light you
don't have to be too mindful as to where
you're putting it in your crease I'm
just going to be doing circular motions
in my crease blending it upwards and
also downwards
taking that Sam color from my ELF
palette I'm going to be applying this on
the inner thirds of my eye and also on
the outer thirds of my eye
using my Bobbi Brown gel liner I'm then
going to be lining my upper lash line as
I have said in previous videos if you do
it in sections it's a lot easier you
know there's no rush take your time
doing this
you
next I'm taking the small angled brush
and this brown shimmer color from my ELF
palette I'm lining my lower lash line
you then want to apply your mascara at
this time I'm using L'Oreal telescopic
mascara and as I've sent in every other
video this is my absolute favorite
mascara then want to line your lips with
a lip liner mine is by Jordana cosmetics
and it's a little bit darker than my
skin tone
after you've lined the outer part of
your lips you just want to shade it in a
little bit that way the line looks more
natural
I'm next using one of my favorite lip
glosses it's from whitening lightening
it's called color or smile it is a lip
plumper and it has an LED light on it
which is really cool if you're out and
it's dark you can you need to go to
bathroom because there is a mirror also
on the side of the lipgloss tube I also
have a coupon code to get 70% off so I'm
going to post that below
thank you ladies so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed my Elena shish covet
inspired makeup look definitely try it
out and stay tuned for more videos
subscribe and comment if you liked my
video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
