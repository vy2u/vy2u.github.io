hi everyone thank you for watching so
this video has been highly requested for
a while now I know what ton of you have
been asking since day one
all about my hair and the extensions
that I use and I've never done that a
extension review video on my channel and
I think one of the reasons that it has
taken me this long is because when I was
first getting more popular on YouTube I
had a lot of different companies
contacting me asking if I wanted to try
out their extensions in exchange for a
review and at first I thought it was the
coolest thing ever and I accepted the
extensions from a few different
companies and I always ended up sending
them back because I was just not happy
with either the quality of the hair or
just how they looked in my hair
personally because I have really thick
coarse hair so any extensions that are
really thin on the bottom or that get
thinner as they go to the bottom will
just not look real on my hair when it
comes to trying out popular hair
extensions I promise you I have tried
basically every single brand and they
all have been out of my own pocket I've
just decided to go out and try them
myself
without having to feel obligated to do a
review for anybody and just see which
ones I personally like so I can give all
of you options because there are some
that charge a lot of money and then
there's something to charge a little
amount of money so you want to make sure
if you're spending the money on
extensions you are and getting what you
pay for and be getting the quality that
you deserve and some extensions are
amazing at first and then after a few
months they just completely shred and
like the hair falls out and they're just
not good so that is why I have taken
this long to make a video for you guys
so if you are new to my channel and you
haven't been following me for a while I
only do reviews on products that I
personally love myself and that I would
recommend for every salon to my friends
and all of you guys of course so I
didn't want to wait until I got to try
out a few brands and try them out for a
long period of time and then give my own
opinion so after trying them out these
are just some of the ones that I try to
associate one two three four five six so
I have six different brands in front of
me plus the ones that I'm wearing so
seven different brands and I'm going to
be telling you about my favorite brands
you guys want to learn how I actually do
put the clips in my hair I do have a
video that I also will link right above
so you guys can go check that out I show
how to put them on myself and also how
to put them on another person
I never really liked those videos where
there's people trashing a brand or
trashing a company I think it's just
very unprofessional so one thing I will
do is I will show you a couple different
brands like the quality of that one
thing I want to talk about first was
extension thickness so my biggest thing
is I have very thick hair so if I get
extensions that get thin on the bottom
they're gonna look completely fake
because not only do I pick coarse hair I
have layers so a lot of the extensions
that I tried I put them in and it
literally looked like little strings
hanging so the point of extensions are
not for them to look ridiculously fake
you want them to blend in nicely with
your hair and one of the problems with a
almost basically every single brand that
I tried was that the bottoms were just
way too since so I'll show you these are
the ones I actually heard great things
about this one company and they were
sold out in every color so I bought a
lighter color and dyed them my natural
color because all extensions I usually
end up dying anyway just so they do
match perfectly and you can see right
before I even open it this is one with
four clips and usually they have four
clips they should be like thick at the
bottom and I held them up and you can
just tell that yeah they're pretty thick
they're pretty okay decent up here but
as soon as it gets to the bottom it's
like stirring me as anything so I tried
them in and I tried them a couple
different ways to try and make them
thicker and they just did not work for
me at all
this company did say that it was 200
grams but a lot of times people don't
realize that they do come with a lot of
single clips and a lot of clips with two
clips on them and I don't personally use
those ones but I know a lot of people do
use those so those do count in the grams
of hair so be careful when you're
picking out the hair extensions these
are most of them all together and as you
can see just really thin and stringy at
the bottom what I'm really talking about
I can show you because I have my
Bellamy's in right now I only have three
tracks in right now on the bottom three
that's it and you see how thick and no
matter where you go in my hair whether
it's up here or down here it's still
super thick and it doesn't look like
little strings hanging from my hair so
that was the first brand that was the
first thing that you have to look out
for before I even open them I kind of
have a feeling just looking at them that
they were gonna be like that this next
brand I thought was gonna be one of my
favorites their extensions were a lot
more pricey but they had like 300 gram
hair extensions and a lot of bigger ones
so I was it got perfect the more hair
the better but little did I know that
yeah they come ahead look at these ones
these are nice right like thick nice
like one little clip there's three clips
on it and has all this nice hair and at
first I loved it but after washing it
one or two times it got so naughty that
whenever I would put it in my hair it
would form like this big rat's nest and
that made me so sad because I was like
oh my god I could wear one or two tracks
and it looks like I have four tracks in
from another extensions but I guess the
way that they sewed them together it's
just way too much hair on one track that
it comes in a huge knot and it just ends
up all over the place and I do not
recommend getting something that's maybe
over 200 grams because that is gonna
give you a problem so yes they do look
beautiful and right now I wish I can
just put too little Jackson and be good
but again too much hair on one clip is
not going to be good for your natural
hair and in
brushing hair all day I know I don't the
next company I didn't even bother open
them I don't mean to be mean but they
had sent me these though
they sent me a chocolate brown color and
they sent me things fun like Clem ones
for fun but I don't even open it because
you could just see like thick hair and
then just look at the little strings at
the bottom so I was like okay sorry I'm
virtually for me they're not gonna work
this time and the next one I actually
liked I used here and there I'd switch
them off with the Bellamy but the hair
fell out so quickly
let me see and like every time I would
wash it it would get so matted and the
hair would fall out I would see so much
hair all over the place so this is after
maybe like four washings like this is
what the hair looks like and I don't
know it's just not nice quality so moral
of the story I've tried out nine
different brands probably even more and
after all said and done I wish I can
give you guys maybe more options but
Bellamy is hands-down my absolute
favorite their hair is so silky it's
just as thick at the top as at the
bottom their customer service is amazing
so if you need help picking the color
for your hair they will be there to
answer your questions and I just wanted
to personally say thank you to everyone
over I Bellamy because you guys have
been so amazing you've offered so many
different giveaways from me and my
followers and I am so happy with your
extensions and I will forever wear them
because I've honestly tried every other
brand and I'm just not happy so if any
of you guys were kind of on the fence
with start companies I hope this helped
and again this is just my opinion so a
million other girls out there I'm sure
make videos showing their opinions on
different extensions if you are in the
market but again this one is the one
that I love and I will forever use until
maybe my hair actually grows long enough
but until then Bellamy all the way and I
hope you
enjoy this video also if you haven't
seen I posted a draw my life video on my
second channel so I will link that above
as well bye guys I hope you enjoyed
making time for the ones that count
