Morning Sun your mind
all mine play the music low and sway to
the rhythm
hi everyone thank you for watching so
it's been quite a bit since I have done
and updated hair care routine so I'm
basically going to go through all the
products that I use in my hair from
everything I use in the shower so when I
get out of the shower and to style my
hair and definitely stay tuned till the
end of the video because I will be
announcing a huge giveaway with Bellamy
hair so if you guys want to hear about
some of my favorite hair products please
keep watching
so before I start naming all the
different products that I use in my hair
as of lately I just wanted to let you
guys know that I had curled my hair with
the Bellamy 6 in-1 curling wand I had
mentioned that and I believe is the last
video that I posted where I did the big
loose waves so with this style I just
did the curls and then I pin them up so
that gave me this hairstyle for those of
you who are wondering and I'm also
wearing the Lily hair the 260 gram by
Bellamy and I only have four tracks in
right now so the first two products that
I'm going to be talking about today are
the biological aging shampoo and the
biological trajeron bomb and I've used
these products I'm going to say four on
and off eight years now I'm going to
give that a rough estimate and I've
always loved this product the one
problem with this product is of course
it is a little bit more pricey I believe
they go for about $26 a bottle at the
drugstore but they really are amazing
products and the smell of them are just
like that's freaking gross I just got on
my lips obviously but the smell of them
are great so that's a one of the reasons
alright those fail so these products
smell amazing but if you guys are
looking for something more affordable I
don't remember how long ago I had posted
my previous haircare tutorial but I was
always using I think it was L'Oreal Viva
Pro which was amazing the Garnier I've
used two so I will list drugstore
options that I've used in the past that
I did love but this product I always
tend to go back to no matter how many
different products that I tried
while we're on shampoo and conditioner
I was using the when for three months
the past three months and I will tell
you the pros and cons of this product I
believe I was sick one night and I was
up watching infomercials and I don't
know if you guys have ever watched
infomercials but they really sell you
like you want to buy the product as soon
as that hour-long infomercial is over so
when was one of the products that
happened to be on the infomercial so I
of course went right on and I think it
was like 39.95 to get the starter kit so
first let me talk about the pros it
smells amazing you only have to use the
cleansing conditioner it's a shampoo and
conditioner and one so that's cool that
you just have to buy one product as
opposed to a shampoo and a conditioner
and a deep conditioner the one thing
that I do also like about this is when I
use it in my hair air dries I really
don't see any frizz maybe a little bit
of frizz but the curls are really nice
and it really tames my hair which I have
not found from any other products but
what I like to do is I like to let my
hair air dry and then I blow it out so
what I noticed when I use this product
is when I shower at night and then I let
it air dry and then blow it on the
morning my roots tend to look a little
bit greasy and I don't know if that's
because I used too much of this or what
it is but my hair never gets greasy like
I'm the type where if I wash it I can
probably go 3 4 days and it still looks
like dry it doesn't look greasy at all
so that is one of the reasons why I went
back and bought the biologics is you pay
39.95 for the first kit and then every
month you can set up to be like every
month every two months it sends you
another kit and it already charges your
card so it's like a monthly program they
send you a different bottle every month
and then that's kind of how it works so
it's kind of annoying because some
people may think that you just pay one
time you just try it out and then that's
that and then they ends up getting it in
the mail and then realizing that it was
charged on their card so I would
recommend if you guys want to try the
one but you're not sure I would
recommend to go and get it on Amazon
because I checked and they had it all
over Amazon you can just try the
cleansing conditioner the
that I love is the sweet almond mint and
it's all really really good and I think
if you have really frizzy curly hair and
you'd like to leave your hair natural I
think this product would be amazing for
you I am definitely not throwing it away
I have like two bottles in stock still
so I'm gonna be keeping this but I'm
going to be switching back to the
biologic or now just to see the
difference because like I said it's my
notice the top of my hair looks a little
bit more greasy quicker which I don't
like because I'm lazy and it takes a
while to blow-dry my hair so I fell for
the infomercial do I love it I don't
love love it because I went out and
bought one of my old favorites but I
really do like how my hair has felt for
men it's just the one thing the negative
about it was it made my hair look a
little greasy so another thing you guys
have to keep in mind is I have naturally
curly hair for those of you who don't
know and it's very frizzy it's very dry
I'm always using heat products heat
styling tools so I like anything that's
very conditioning and something that's
going to be really thick and then I just
slob it on my hair and I use a lot of it
so again that's why I'm getting the
ultra hydrating balm but for those of
you out there who may have thinner
straighter hair that you want more body
definitely go for something that's a
volumizing shampoo and conditioner also
I don't have the product anymore but
what I used to use and what my mom used
to use my sister used to use it was I
believe by matrix and it was a root
lifting spray and I definitely mention
it in one of my videos I will link that
and what it does is when your hair is
wet you spray it and like right in the
roots of your hair and you just kind of
go like this and then you blow-dry it
and it really does give you a lot of
body like my hair stick to begin with
and when I used it I noticed it was
literally like massive so again I will
link that below but majority of the
products I'm going to be talking about
are for dry frizzy unmanageable hair so
remember that keep in mind so the
products that may work for me may be
completely different for you the next
product I'm going to be talking about
I've used for I'm going to say about two
years now and this is the new me
hydrating mask and this is a deep
conditioner for your hair and I love
I've gone through I don't know 10 to 15
bottles of this and what I like to do is
use the shampoo conditioner and then
once I rinse out the conditioner I take
a big a big scoop a big scoop of this
and then I apply it like from here down
I don't ever put it near my roots but I
leave it on for about 5 to 10 minutes or
until I'm done in my shower rinse it out
and then that's it so I began use this
for two years I used to always buy the
different masks at the drugstore a
couple of them are good but once I tried
this there was really no comparison so
I've just been using this so like I said
I blow-dry my hair all the time to blow
it out straight so I always use a heat
protectant right now the one that I'm
using is by Tresemme and it's thermal
conditions heat tamer leave-in spray so
I've gone between this and then the Chi
version of it and I've used again both
of them just back and forth and I really
liked it I mean I don't notice a
difference from using it but it's
protecting your hair so it's very
important to use this when your hair is
still damp or before you're about to
blow-dry it one of my all-time favorite
products and a necessity in my life is a
dry shampoo the one that I always buy
you can get at a drugstore or a beauty
supply store I believe it's called like
batiste I will link again everything on
my blog for you guys but what it is it's
like a translucent shampoo so if you
notice your hair is a little greasy and
you don't feel like shampooing it you
just shake the bottle spray it in your
hair and then give yourself like a scalp
massage and then I always like to go
over with a blow-dryer and it's awesome
what it does it literally takes the
grease out of your hair so this one that
I have right now is bamboo style and
it's by alterna if you guys watched
Project Runway I was on one of the
episodes and as a little gift they had
sent us a whole basket of alternative
products because that's the products
that they use on the show so this along
with the hairspray they're both
alternate and my first time using them
but I love them so far this works just
as good as the batiste I'm not sure the
price difference because like I said I
did get in a nice gift basket but as far
as the hairspray I really really like
this hairspray it's almost empty
the other hairspray that I've loved
and the only ones that I'll buy is the
Loreal Elnett satin that's actually one
of my favorites because it's not a
sticky hairspray this one was awesome
again the alterna and which other ones I
always use I don't know I forgot the
name of the other one that I always tend
to use but you can get them at the
drugstores so that is that I've two more
products that I'm going to be talking
about really quick for you guys and then
we'll be doing the giveaway um the first
one is going to be the argan oil that I
use every single time when I get out of
the shower this one is also by new me
and I don't know I believe I have a
coupon code for this and the hydro mask
I don't know if it's for both of them
together what it is but I'll check it
out and list it below for you guys but
this is what I've been using for I'm
going to say year and a half to two
years
I love argan oil I always like to put
about a quarter size you can do a little
bit less if you have thinner or shorter
hair and I mix it in between my hands
and then I put it all on the ends of my
hair and this is right when it's damp
right when I get out of the shower right
before I brush it and this new product
that I actually just picked up from
Sephora when I went to the mall I don't
remember what it was um it was you know
when you go in Sephora and you wait
online and they have all those little
products like while you wait online you
have to stare at them all and like check
everything out well it was like $20 for
this one and it came with like a face
version and of course I ended up buying
it but I actually really liked it it's
so different
um what brand is this josie maran i
think that's a name it's called argan
oil hair serum with radiance what I like
about this is it's not a regular argan
oil it has like this brown illuminating
look to it it's kind of like the stuff
that you put on your cheeks the Revlon
stuff I will show you guys a close-up of
this right now
but as you can see it's like a really
nice consistency so when you put it in
your hair it gives your hair like this
shiny silky look to it so I really
really love it and this also came with a
face version that you can put on your
face to give it a nice glow so these
products are definitely brand new
they're still pretty full but I really
like them so far so
I think that's it as far as haircare if
I did forget anything I will mention it
on my blog but I'm pretty much a
creature of habit I always tend to stick
to the same products although lately I
have branched out and I'm trying new
things so I will always continuously
keep you updated if anything changes or
anything like that but alright let's
move on to the giveaway because I'm sure
you guys are super excited and I'm
actually super excited to announce it
for you guys this is in celebration of
Valentine's Day so all of the rules will
be listed below in the description box
make sure to check it out because you
have to follow all the steps in order to
enter this is like a two-part giveaway
so we're going to be doing a YouTube
prize and also an Instagram prize so if
you don't have Instagram you can do the
YouTube prize and then if you have both
you can enter on both accounts okay so
let's go through the prizes for the
YouTube giveaway four people will be
winning the three-in-one
Bellomy curler which is their new
curling set so it comes with three
different size wands so four people will
be winning that and then two lucky
winners will be winning a lifetime
supply of Bellomy hair extensions and
what that means is you will get two sets
of extensions every single year for the
rest of your life how cool is that I
don't think they've ever done a giveaway
like that so that's so exciting
you get to every single year no matter
what grams that you want
I recommend the 220 grams but um yeah
you get them twice a year so if you want
to be nice and share it with a friend
you can do that or you can keep them all
to yourself so I think that's a really
awesome fun prize for those of you

the Instagram prize there's going to be
five people who will also win the
three-in-one curler and again it has the
three different wand sizes and there's
going to be one lucky winner who is also
