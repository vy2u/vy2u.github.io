today I wanted to sit down and basically
talk all things hair my hair has
definitely grown a lot the past year or
two and I just wanted to I guess go
through everything that I've done some
little techniques that I've done that
have helped me because it took me
literally ten years to grow back my hair
so I'm gonna just basically talk about
my hair and then a little bit about my
nails as well because I've seen so many
people asking about my nails and just
wanted to clear some things up so if you
guys want to hear a little bit more
about my hair and my nails please keep
watching
okay so first we're gonna start with
hair I'm gonna give you a little bit of
background on my hair because I have
been through a lot with this hair it all
started my freshman year going into high
school my entire life I had hair so long
past my boobs all one length just really
really thick curly frizzy hair so the
reason that it was always so long was a
because it was just curly I never know
how to style it and I never wanted
layers and these since I was always
using like gels or mousse is I was never
using heat on my hair so I think that
was the main reason that my hair was
always just long and luscious no
problems whatsoever so again it all
started going into my freshman year of
high school I went for a trim before the
first day of school I just needed a
little bit of a trim and I also wanted
to get side bangs alright so yeah you
would think a little trim some nice eye
bangs we're perfect for highschool well
when I went in I told her just the trim
like the tiniest bit no offense if
you're a hairdresser most of them if you
go to them and you ask for less than an
inch off you ends up walking out with no
hair and that's exactly what happened to
me so my side bangs I want a nice long
swoopy side things those side bangs
turned into something that looked a
little bit like this and yeah I was not
happy about it it not only did they not
go scooping to the side they literally
stood straight up they were so short I
couldn't do anything with them and then
on top of that she chopped my hair up
just below my shoulders so I walked out
of there
hysterically crying I was just so
mortified and so upset that I was in the
start high school with this horrible new
do I should have just left it how it was
but of course that was my beginning of
my hair troubles so I had to wear those
little clips but you remember the little
snappy clips I just have to wear them to
hold down the bangs so I could just clip
them back and wear it in like a ponytail
that year I did learn how to blow out my
hair because when you blow it out it
looked a little bit longer so that was
my first big tragedy at a hair salon so
I think at that point what since I
started learning how to blow John my
hair and straighten my hair and use like
curling irons and stuff like that that
he played a toll on my hair and I
noticed that it wasn't really growing
back as quickly then in my sophomore
year of high school I heard about
something called Japanese straightening
and if you guys haven't heard of it it's
basically just like a permanent
straightening process you could do for
your hair and it would make a pin pin
pin straight take out all the frizz
basically just complete opposite of what
I grew up with so when I heard that this
was an option available I begged my mom
to get it for me I needed this done to
my hair so I got it done and don't get
me wrong I was absolutely obsessed for
the first couple months because it was
like I didn't have to do anything with
my hair and it just showered and a dry
pinch straight and it was just
absolutely amazing
but it wasn't until maybe like six
months afterwards I noticed that my hair
was really really dry and like brittle
at the bottom and every time it would
get to a certain length it would never
grow past that certain length so I
didn't really care I was like screw it I
don't care I love my hair at this
straight I want to keep it like this so
I think I got the Japanese done maybe
two or three times after that where they
just did the roots because the rest your
hair just stays so that I might junior
year of high school I think it grew
maybe 1/2 of an inch if that I decided I
wanted some layers in my hair I wanted
like that really choppy love with like
short layers and I just thought it would
look so beautiful I had full friends
that did and I wanted to try it so of
course I go I could go back to a salon I
have them cut my hair
and they cut the layer so deep into my
hair that my longest layer was literally
starting like so low that I was so thin
so like the longest part of my hair was
so thin and the rest was all just like
chopped into all these layers and I
don't know it just was not it was not
good at all I then learned how to cut my
own hair because they just unfortunately
never did what I liked so between the
Japanese straightening and the bad hair
cuts my hair was just done it was not
growing it would not do anything so
that's a little bit of the background
behind my hair that's why I took me
almost ten years to grow up back because
I had to grow up the Japanese
straightening I had to stop highlighting
my hair and I stopped doing the Japanese
straightening did I just say the
Japanese chanting I don't know if I just
said that so at that point my life I
realized what I needed to do if I wanted
to keep the layers was keep my hair
maybe from like here upwards where the
layers are and everything down needed to
be the long thick layer so if that makes
any sense it's kind of hard to explain
so basically from like here up I started
cutting my layers and then all of this
down here keep one length that way it
would grow longer faster because it had
more thickness at the bottom I swear my
theory is that if the longest layer is
thin it's just gonna keep breaking as it
goes so I like to keep a really really
thick bottom layer that's all one length
so it can grow healthily together I
think my junior year after I got that
really bad haircut I was like screw it
I'm done with layers I'm just gonna try
and have my hair all one length and then
eventually when it's all one length
it'll grow nice and long and thick
together and then I can cut my layers so
from my junior year up until a year two
years ago that was what I was doing I
was not getting any haircuts I was just
trimming it myself I have a video if you
guys want to see how I trim it myself
some people think it's crazy but this is
just the way that I've always done it I
got a keratin treatment for the first
time a few years ago I never really
liked it but I heard that the Karin was
a lot better for your hair than the
Japanese or anything like that I
recently found this new girl who I'm
actually really good friends with who
does the keratin it's the GK keratin
I've been getting that done for
little over a year now and I think that
was really my turning point and noticing
that my hair was growing a lot longer
the reason for this is the keratin
treatment gets your hair really silky
really soft frizz free not perfectly
straight but it has like a little bit of
a wave to it so when I started doing
that I literally like stopped
blow-drying my hair I like stopped using
any hot irons I don't know if you guys
notice but like my hair was always just
kind of like beachy waves and yeah maybe
I will try it once a week at that so I
think that was a really really big part
and how my hair started growing I
stopped using heat as much I wash my
hair every 3 to 4 days
and yeah I think those were like the two
biggest things was the heat I think
using the heat so much since my hair was
so frizzy and curly
I had a literally blow-dry it three four
times a week just to get it straight and
keep it silky so I think that was one of
the biggest things so my biggest tip for
you guys that you're trying to grow your
hair don't cut short layers in your hair
don't do anything to your hair that's
gonna really damage it like a lot of
bleaching a lot of highlights the
Japanese straightening or anything like
that I do recommend the keratin
treatment it's a little bit lighter on
your hair but it's still gonna give you
a frizz free look so I think that also
helped a lot another thing that I've
always done for like five six years on
and off not every single day somedays I
forgot believe me but what I do is I
take five ten I'm not gonna lie I maybe
take this three times a week if I
remember I'm so bad with remembering the
TKE pills brett has a bunch of different
pills that I've been taking like
probiotics and women's health pills and
just stuff like that like your daily
vitamins that I try and remember to take
as well so whenever I do take those I
take the biotin as well and I think you
will see some difference by taking the
biotin I haven't tried any of those hair
pills that are out on the market so I
don't really know if they work I'm sure
they're basically the same thing as the
biotin so that is another suggestion
that I have for you guys another
suggestion that I have I swear I might
be crazy but almost
single night I make Brett I don't make
him he enjoys doing it because he knows
I like it but he scratches my head like
for like at least 10 minutes like he'll
just go all around and just be like like
that and I swear that like promotes your
scalp to keep growing your hair I don't
know is that a proven fact
maybe not but he does it all the time
and not only does it feel great but I've
heard that it helps promote hair growth
I don't know if you guys ever saw one
let me grab it I know if you guys never
seen these bad boys I am almost a
hundred percent positive Nicole Guerrero
sent me this did you send me this bill
I don't remember I'm pretty sure that
could be wrong but anyway it's this
little scalp massager and you just
massage ahead so if you guys don't have
a scrumptious little boyfriend you
that's gonna scratch your head every
night you can do this as well I don't
even know where you can get these I'm
sure Amazon because Amazon has
everything that's where I get my bikes
and pills off Amazon I'll link
everything for you guys if you want to
check it out for yourself so yeah I mean
is this 100% proven not that I know of
but I really believe that it helps
promote your hair to grow so let's just
do a quick rundown because I feel like
I've been blabbing about my hair but
everyone's hair is different that's oh
you have to remember for some people
something my working for other people
something else may work but my hair has
always been really coarse really thick
curly and just had baron haircuts I
think that was my biggest problem was
the bad haircuts so if you guys do love
the layers and the fullness let your
hair grow all in length first and then
when it's at the desired length then
start cutting your layers I actually
recently like last week cut some more
layers in my hair because with the
keratin treatment and the long layers my
hair was just looking flat and like I
feel like all I was doing was just
straight hairstyles because I didn't
have it in me to try and like tease it
and get it nice and big but now I have
my layers back and it's already helped
so much with the body in my hair I only
cut layer starting like here and I go
around and I keep the bottom super super
thick and that's how it's gonna grow and
stay nice and
thing I recommend is finding a shampoo
or conditioner that works best with your
hair I'm not gonna say go out and buy
this brand this type of shampoo and
conditioner because we all have
different needs we all need different
things some people have dry hair some
people have oily hair some people have
curly hair and some people have a pin
straight hair so depending on what your
need is go out and look for a specific
shampoo and conditioner that's doing
what you need one thing I recommend one
thing I always do is use a deep
conditioner only on the ends of my hair
I like keeping the ends of my hair super
super soft I always use argan oil at the
ends of my hair as soon as I got out of
the shower and that is just to keep the
split ends from splitting up and then
giving you that brittle look at the
bottom so another tip is to trim your
hair every few months you can do this
yourself it's not that hard if you just
take off the littlest bit right off the
bottom of your hair that's good enough
you don't need to go and end up getting
a trim that gets cut up to your shoulder
so that is really it as far as what I've
personally done for my hair struggle
that I've had the past ten years of my
life I wish I could tell you like oh I
took this supplement and then overnight
my hair grew back but unfortunately it
was a really long process for me the
biggest thing is try and cut down on the
heat whether it be a blow dryer or a
curling iron or straightener because
that's really gonna help dry out your
hair and prevent it from growing super
long that is really it as far as my hair
um I wanted to quickly also talk about
my nails because I've had this like pale
pink color on my nails for like four
months now and I'm gonna talk a little
bit about it what I used to do for my
nails is I would get acrylic over my
natural nails I don't know if you guys
remember but I talked so much about how
my cuticles were always so dry and red
and just looking like crap like I don't
know what it was I now realize that I
must have been allergic to their acrylic
because ever since I stopped using the
acrylic my cuticles are literally
perfect I don't have to use cuticle oil
I don't have to use a million products
on my hand just trying to get that to go
away I don't know if you guys remember
but I told you I get my nails done at my
local Walmart actually it's funny but
they have a nail salon inside and I
swear they're the only ones that
actually do what I asked and do a really
nice job when I went there
I needed a new set of acrylics because
they were just looking nasty and the guy
that does my nails recommended that I
try something that was new and it's
called a blush gel so it's literally
this little blue container I don't know
the brand of it but it's called blush
gel and it's literally this light pink
gel he put it just over my natural nails
shape them so they're a little bit
square and then you put it in the LED
lights and then they Harden
so I guess it's basically the same thing
I was like a clear gel that you
sometimes put over your nails to keep it
nice and hard and nice and shiny but
it's just a light pink color so every
time I go in there's no color that I got
in my nails this is literally just the
color of the gel and every time it's
like do you want a color tonight you
want to color this time I'm like no you
know what this pale pink it just goes
with everything it's nice and clean
looking it's nothing crazy so that is
what I've been doing for my nails I just
wanted to let you guys know so it isn't
a specific nail polish color it's just
called blush gel next time I go I'll try
and write down the name of it so you
guys can go check with your local salons
but I know it's a newer thing so some
salons probably don't even have it yet
so yeah that is basically it for my hair
and nails I just quickly also wanted to
add that I drink so much water not like
too much Sun I'm gonna die but I'm
always constantly filling up my water we
have this big water cooler so I know
drinking water is gonna help not only
keep your whole body healthy but it's
gonna help promote growth for your hair
and your nails when your nails grow fast
and your hair grows fast that's a sign
that you are healthy so I recommend
working out I recommend eating healthy I
recommend drinking a lot of water of
course that's all something you need to
be doing just to live long or not just
so your hair and your nails grow longer
so that is also a little something I
wanted to add on but that is basically
it for now I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm sorry if it's a little long
but I just wanted to kind of clear up
everything about my hair and my nails
cuz I think that's been like the number
one the most requested thing for quite
some time now so I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and
see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
