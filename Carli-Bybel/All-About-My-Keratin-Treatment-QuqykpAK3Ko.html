drawing me in and you kicking me out got
my head spinning no kidding I can't pin
you down hi everybody thank you for
watching so in today's video I'm going
to be talking about the keratin
treatment that I got done to my hair I
believe two or three weeks ago I had
that done right before my vacation about
a week before so however many days ago
that was but I wanted to talk about it
because ever since I posted that picture
I've seen so many people asking
questions about it and yeah I've gotten
a keratin treatment about five times in
my life I've also done the Japanese
straightening I've basically done
everything to my hair highlights I
bleached it I dyed it I've cut it I've
done it all so I just basically wanted
to go through a couple different things
that I've experienced through the
keratin treatment and everything like
that and if my voice sounds different
it's because I've been feeling a little
crappy the past two days I woke up and
like my throat's been bothering me a
little bit so I've been taking mucinex
and hopefully it gets better but I
honestly don't really notice a big
difference in my voice but I guess you
guys watching my videos all the time do
so I do apologize if I sound a little
bit deeper than usual it's so funny
people are like freaking out about it
but yep just a little bit sick so
nothing serious also really quickly as I
mentioned in my previous video the
ludora boutique earrings are now 40% off
for a limited time use code
Carli bybel all lowercase to get it 40%
off the entire website these beautiful
earrings are also handmade by her as
well and I will be listing all that info
in the description box so if you guys
want to learn a little bit more about my
keratin treatment please keep watching
so if you guys follow me on instagram
you probably saw me post the before and
after picture of my hair one of my
really good friends Kayla her cousin
Lindsey which is also another one of my
really good friends she was the one who
did it for me and she has a full salon
in her basement so I was over there for
a little party and she was like well
come check out my salon in the basement
and I went to
down there and it was amazing there was
the sink and the chair and it basically
looked like you're in a salon and she
was telling me how she specializes in
coloring and the keratin treatments and
everything like that so of course I knew
I was going on my vacation so I set up
an appointment with her and I have
gotten the keratin done a few times in
the past and I like the keratin but I
really never noticed a huge difference
in my hair if you guys saw my
blow-drying tutorial you saw what it
actually looks like naturally and this
is how air dried so take that in for a
second it's like straight at the top and
then it's a little bit wavy I put some
surf spray in my hair to make it look
like beachy in a way but yeah my hair
used to dry like round and frizzy and
curly and this was the first time that
the keratin actually made my hair almost
straight took all the frizz out and all
that good stuff so she used the GK
keratin system and I think that's one of
the healthiest ones that they have out
right now and this one was amazing I had
gotten it done when was the first time I
did the keratin I would say two years
ago and I think after the first washing
it was obviously a lot easier to tame
but then I noticed once I would wash it
more it started just going back to my
natural hair so I mean it did save some
blow-drying time but up until this last
time I really wasn't so over the top
with it when I was in high school I had
gotten the Japanese straightening done
to my hair which is when it dries like
pin pin pin straight and no frizz
nothing and at the time it was God said
I was the happiest person alive because
I'm get out of the shower and my hair
would dry pin straight and for the first
time in my life I was like wow that is
absolutely crazy because I've just been
so used to the frizziness and then
having to blow-dry it for hours and all
that nonsense
so back then it was an amazing
experience for me but what I did notice
is that when I was getting the Japanese
training not only was I sitting in the
chair for like eight hours to get it
done but my hair was damaged after so
when I was in high school I had cut my
hair about up to here and then once I
got the Japanese straightening I noticed
that it would never
grow past that length I would have to
keep getting it cut because the ends
were always like fried and like all like
sizzled up so that's why I did stop
doing that treatment because it was
obviously not good for my hair and as
much as I loved how it looked I realized
that I'd rather have healthy shiny hair
than have to deal with the fried
frizziness of the Japanese straining so
I came across the keratin treatment and
I think I actually posted a video
talking about it and like I said I did
like the treatment when I first got it
done it just didn't last that long for
me so this again is only about three
weeks old but when I wash it and I dry
it and I let it air dry like you cannot
beat that and now with spring and summer
coming I'm really really happy that I
did it and I will 100% get it done again
if you guys are in the North Jersey area
I will list her email and all her info
so you guys can contact her because I
highly recommend her and she actually
just got this new vent so all the fumes
go right into the vent so you are
completely safe from all those fumes one
thing that I did notice when I got the
keratin treatment was my scalp was
burning a bit while she was doing the
process which I guess is pretty normal
because you are putting chemicals but
even later that night I was getting a
little bit worried because what they do
is they put the keratin treatment in
your hair and then they blow it out and
then they straighten it so it locks it
in and later on that night I got home
and my scalp was still itchy so I
started googling keratin treatments and
the pros and the cons and why my scalp
was itchy and there was all kinds of
like tragic stories on there where
people would have burning scalps and
their hair would fall out so here I am
the first night like oh my god should I
have done this like what if all my hair
falls out but obviously that wasn't the
case you have to keep it in for about 48
hours and then you can wash it out and
then your hair is good for I don't know
exactly how long I would say about six
months I think they say I think hands
down it is worth it but I just wanted to
put a warning out there that I have
heard a lot of bad stories and a lot of
people that don't maybe know what
they're doing with the keratin so before
you make the decision to get it done I
highly suggest going into the salon
meeting with the person who is going to
be doing it seeing a book of clients
seeing how long
I have done it just making sure whoever
you're going to has been doing it for a
while because the last thing you want is
to go out and try it and then you're
doing it with someone who's trying it
for the first time and it's not really
certified and then it ends up being a
disaster so I of course highly suggest
the girl that I went to her name is
Lindsay in Jersey so for those of you in
Jersey you will get an amazing card in
treatment I can guarantee that as for
everyone else I'm sure there are
millions salons that do it and that are
great at it so definitely look into it
depending on your hair type
I would google it and maybe read some
other people's stories because of course
not everyone has the same great
experience that I had I think after the
first couple times I got it done I
didn't really want to do a video on it
because I liked the results but it was
nothing that drastic but after this time
I really really really loved the result
and when I was away on vacation it was
amazing having this nice frizz free
Beach hair so that was a really great
plus for that there are a few tips that
you can do to maintain your card and
treatment one is buying the shampoo and
conditioner it's the same brand as the
keratin treatment they say once you get
the keratin treatment done and you plan
on going swimming whether it's in the
beach or the pool that you should put
that conditioner on your hair before you
get into the water that way it helps
seal in the keratin and it doesn't strip
it because they say the chlorine and the
salt can strip the card in so for those
of you who want to get it done and are
planning on being in the pool in the
ocean all summer
definitely check out the conditioner and
the shampoo just to help it last longer
and everything like that like I said it
has only been a few weeks but it is the
most amazing thing I have done and I
will give you guys an update in a few
months just to let you know how long
it's lasting how it's doing and
everything like that but I saw a ton of
you guys requesting a video basically
just talking about the process and
everything like that my hair took around
5 hours from start to finish but I have
really thick massive hair so that is why
I took so long so if you guys don't have
as long or as thick hair it probably
will not take as long but make sure when
you book your appointment you clear out
your day because you will be sitting in
that chair for a long time one thing
about this is that you will have pin pin
pin straight hair for three days until
you can wash it so for me I like volley
and the thickness and all that good
stuff so for the first couple days I was
just looking at myself I'm like oh I
look so weird it's so weird having like
pin straight hair but once you can wash
it you get some body back and it's just
incredible I could not suggest it
anymore but again the friend that had
done mine has been doing it for at least
five six years and she's one of the best
that I've seen so make sure you look
into who you're booking wit with and
everything like that but I think that's
really it for the keratin treatment I
think I basically talked about
everything I wanted to talk about I will
give you guys an update in a couple
months just to let you know how I'm
loving it but as of right now do you see
this I'm in heaven
just Joy's like this it's just so easy I
think I posted a picture a couple weeks
ago on Twitter with just like a big afro
I'm like someone please come do my hair
and now I don't even mind doing my hair
and then if I don't even feel like doing
my hair I could just shower at night
sleep on it wake up and then I got this
going on so all my curly hair girls out
there I'm sure you can relate to the
struggle that we deal with on a daily
basis just to get rid of that frizz to
tame that frizz and all that good stuff
so if any of you guys are looking to do
it I do recommend it it's a great
experience
try it out if you don't really like the
outcome it doesn't do much of a
difference to your hair then now you
know for the future you don't have to do
it again but definitely shop around find
the best place that's going to do it and
don't go somewhere that's the cheapest
just because you want to get the
cheapest price because sometimes with
stuff like this you want to pay a little
bit extra just knowing you're going to
get the best that it could be it is your
hair you don't want it falling out you
don't want it to be dead and another
thing I noticed was before I did it I
really needed a haircut and then once
she did it my hair was just so smooth
and silky and it's just unreal I don't
understand how it works but it's a great
process and I do recommend it so I hope
this video helped a little bit for any
of you guys in the market for a keratin
treatment again check the description
box below for some info on my friend
Lindsay who does the hair and also I'll
be listing a couple tips on my blog some
ways to maintain it and everything like
that so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and
next time I'll see you guys later on
that beautiful mind I'm on your magical
mystery ride and I'm so dizzy don't know
what hit me but I'll be alright my
head's a new
I'm breathing fine you're crazy and I
out of my mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
