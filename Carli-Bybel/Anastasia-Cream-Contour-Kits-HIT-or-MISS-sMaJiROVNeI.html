in today's video I'm going to start a
new series hopefully this one is a
little bit more interesting for you guys
I was browsing on YouTube for the past
couple weeks and I was just trying to
make sure that I wasn't copying anybody
the idea is definitely very similar to a
few other girls that I've seen do it
I wanted to basically bring in new
really popular products
talk about them do my first impression
do a quick review show you guys swatches
basically just talk all about it so if
any of you guys are in the market for
buying something you guys can get a real
honest review before you go out and
spend the money so this is something
that I want to call hit or miss I just
really feel like I've tried so many
products and I have a lot of insight on
what's really good and what's not and
what you guys need in your kit versus
some things that I just will recommend
that you guys should skip out on the
main reason I wanted to do this is
because there's nothing worse than
spending money on a product getting home
playing around with it and then hating
it and just letting it sit in your draw
for months and months and months so
today I figured what better product to
start with then the new Anastasia cream
contour and highlight kits
these are got in the mail like two weeks
ago I posted a picture when I first got
them and that day I played around a
little bit with it um I wasn't I'm gonna
be honest I wasn't too fond of them at
first it just seemed very lightweight
and I wasn't too sure about the colors
I'm gonna show you guys a demo right
after I'm done talking about the product
that way you can see how I created this
look right here
I started this look out with just
primary foundation concealer and then I
already had my hives done of course
because I just wanted to show you guys
kind of the kit in action also talked
about how I feel about it as I go so if
you guys wanted to see that stay tuned
to the end of the video
from that so first let's talk about pros
the one thing that I immediately noticed
about this product was super super
creamy and it blends really easy so one
thing that I found with cream contour
products I've literally tried a
bajillion of them is some of them can be
harder to blend if some of you guys are
just starting out with contour highlight
it's great to find a product that's
really blendable that's easy so you
don't have any sharp lines it doesn't
look all messy it's going to be a lot
easier for you guys to kind of work with
so that is one thing that I do love
about these kits I only tried out
personally the light and medium kit
which are these two right here
I had a spray tan about two weeks ago
when I first got the kit so I had tried
out the medium kit I used the shade this
shade this shade and then I actually
used this shade instead of using it as a
corrector which I believe that is what
it's for I use it as a cream blush which
was really cool it gave you a really
creamy nice finish but the only thing
that I have to say is that with cream
contour and highlight you always have to
set it with a powder that way it's not
slipping and sliding all over your face
so I mean if you're gonna be investing
in a kit like this you're gonna also
kind of need to invest in some sort of
setting powder whether it be the Laura
Mercier setting powder that I talked
about in my last video or if you want to
get the highlighting contour kit that
has some cooler tones and different
shade contour and highlight colors so
that's really up to you guys one thing
that I love about the light kit is that
it has the banana color the vanilla
color and then the cool pink so it's
going to have your warms your neutrals
and your cooler tones so depending on
your skin tone this is really versatile
besides the highlight colors I have to
say I'm not a huge fan of the colors of
the contour creams that they chose let
me tell you why recently one thing that
I've been doing and one thing I've been
obsessing over is using really cool
grayish tones to contour not only does
it look more natural in my opinion but
it really accentuates your natural
contours of your face one of the biggest
places that I like need-need
need a grayish cool tone is for my nose
I always found that the cooler tones
look a lot more natural as opposed to
the warmer more orangey shades it kind
of just maybe looks a little bit less
natural in my opinion so that was one
thing that I noticed while doing the
demo you guys will kind of see my first
hand reactions as I apply everything I
wasn't so sold on the contour shades but
with a little setting powder and using a
cooler tone over it it really kind of
bounced it out so that was I guess a
really good thing so you just need to
make sure if you are using these warmer
orangie shades you need to set it with
something with a cooler tone that way
you're not looking Orange you're not
looking to warm it kind of will just
balance it out make it look like it's
the real contours of your face and yeah
so I mean I finish it off with some
blush some setting powder and I kind of
fix it up a little bit it's not one of
those products in my opinion that you
could just put a little highlight put a
little contour and then you're good to
go you need to do other steps with it so
that is something to keep in mind when
you guys are purchasing it I'm such a
makeup junkie and I look I can't get
enough of anything that comes in a kit
like this um but I have to say if you
guys are going to splurge maybe go for
the powder contour over the cream
contour first test it out because you
can always just use your foundation
concealer use a little bit of a powder
contour highlighter and you're good to
go with the cream it's kind of a lot
more steps a lot more layers for those
of you guys for everyday natural look
it's probably going to be too many
layers for those glam girls out there
that really love thick cake makeup and
you don't mind a couple layers and I
think these kids will be great for you
again they're super blendable I would
have to say out of one through ten I
would rate these kits seven and I feel
bad because I swear every single product
that I've ever tried from Anastasia I
literally died over like her brow
products are incredible the highlighting
contour buff when I got sent that I
literally shut it here it was like this
big every shade freaking amazing and I
am so in love with the contour kit the
powder version it's been sold out
everywhere and I don't blame it it's
amazing but I have to
I'm hoping with the cream series she
comes out with more shades kind of like
the powder series so that way we can
just go in right with that cool tone
contour shade and then just set it with
some setting powder and be good to go
and that's all you have to do so we'll
see I guess time will tell I know right
now they're not in stock on her website
um I just wanted to get this up and talk
to you guys about it because I feel like
when something sold out it's like crack
you like need it you're like oh my god
and so now like what's worse than that I
need the product even more believe me I
have been one of those people if it's
sold out I literally wanted 900 times
more even if it's not that good of a
product so I'm going to say just relax
don't freak out if it's sold out you
guys want to try it a million percent
try it they're great products but I
don't think it's going to replace my
normal contour highlight routine
products I prefer using just concealer
and then a darker foundation contour and
then just kind of setting it with a
contour highlight powder so that is just
my preference everybody likes something
different try these out if any of you
guys have tried them out let me know
your opinion of course my opinion is not
the only one that matters but I just
didn't want everyone to think it's like
the newest greatest best thing to ever
come out and everyone needs their hands
on it because I didn't personally feel
that way although I was so excited to
get them I'm not gonna lie they're so
pretty to look at but I have to say just
a little bit disappointed in the contour
shades but hopefully again they will
come out with some other shades that way
we can mix and match a little bit but
that is really it for all I have to say
about the palettes I hope I was helpful
in some way I don't want to say don't go
out and buy it if you guys were really
really set on it I do think they're
great it's just not for everybody so
that is my review on the new Anastacio
kits I will have swatches of all of them
shown in a minute I'll show you the
swatches and then stay tuned if you want
to see the demo of the product
you
so the kid I'm going to use today is the
light kit when I first played around
with these I try out the medium kit
because I had a spray tan so I was a
little bit darker so let's try out this
bad boy the first thing that I'm
noticing that maybe is a little bit
annoying in my mind is that there's no
cool shade contours colors I prefer like
a grayish Brown to contour with because
it kind of is more natural it looks more
like the actual contours of your face so
I mean most people aren't going to go
out and buy all three shades you're
going to really buy the kit that works
best for you so I guess I'm just going
to use the darkest color with this small
morphe MD 19 brush and I'm going to
start contouring my nose the one place
that I feel is like necessary to use a
cool tone contour shade is the nose I've
used orangey shades before and just
never really looked that good on me so I
mean let's just test it out before I
make any judgements
then taking my math 130 brush I'm
picking up that same brown color and I'm
going to start contouring my cheeks I
have a nice little pimple right there I
think I realized what that pimple is
from the last night I was on the phone
for like a half hour and I was like at
my pimples bothering me and I realized I
hold my phone literally right here all
the time and I wonder if that pimples
from my phone and then right after that
I went and got Windex and cleaned my
phone because if you think about it like
how dirty are our cell phones like they
touch every single surface and we're
constantly putting it in your face we're
constantly touching it and it's kind of
really gross so you guys are watching
this go clean your cell phone with
something with antibacterial in it
because clearly it can cause pimples so
as I'm applying this I have to be honest
I don't like how Orange it is um let me
try the medium kit maybe the medium kit
will have a better shade medium kit has
a few different shades but it looks like
the darkest shade in the light is the
middle shade on the bottom here so let
me pick a little bit of the color
chocolate up from the medium palette
looks a little bit less orange
now this color is definitely better very
dark though
and I have my skin's very light right
now cuz I don't have a tan so one
mistake I always made let me just share
with you while I am doing this is I used
to cut off my chin a little bit and draw
the line but now I have a very weak chin
I feel like so now I've been just
contouring
completely under my jawbone to really
balance out my face a bit so if you guys
have a longer wider chin
feel free to contour higher up to kind
of cut off your chin a bit if you guys
have a smaller chin you can go right
under the bone and it's gonna make it
look a little bit bigger
we're just longer and just to kind of
match the rest of your face so now I'm
really regretting the nose um
I guess let me take a little bit of the
color chocolate backup to go over it
maybe it'll
do you guys know I am obsessed with
highlighting and contouring I personally
tried every item out there on the market
um one because I'm obsessed with
highlighting contouring and I want to
find the best products but also because
I find if I'm going to be sitting up
here giving guys advice on what to buy
and what not to buy I need to test out
everything to really see what works best
and what doesn't so now let's move on to
the highlight the light kit has banana
vanilla and cool pink and then the
medium can has banana cream and warm
coral the warm coral when I first tried
out this kit I used it as a cream blush
the coral and it actually showed up
really really pretty but I now know that
it is actually a corrector so if you
guys watched my previous how to erase
your dark circles I mentioned an orange
concealer this coral color will work
just as well if you guys want to really
brighten up your under eyes I'll link
that video if you guys want to learn a
little bit more about that but I'm using
the same 130 brush I have two of them so
I'm using the one that I didn't just use
I can always tell because one looks a
lot darker and I'm gonna pick up from
the light kit I'm gonna go back so oh if
you guys could only see what I create as
like a table while I'm filming it's
honestly the dumbest thing I have my old
makeup case chanel sunglass case and
then my mirror balancing on it I'll take
a picture and link it see Chris can see
but it's ridiculous anyway okay so I'm
going to pick up the color banana and
vanilla and mix it and apply it right
under my eyes so I already applied
Foundation and concealer before I
started this I didn't apply any powder
so that's all that I did beforehand
um don't mind this bandaid on my hand
you guys probably ready no because I
bring it up almost in every video I
burned myself about two months ago got
infected and went to the dermatologist
he gave me an antibiotic and a cream for
the past two weeks still did nothing for
me I'm going to the dermatologist
actually in two hours so hopefully he
tells me that it looks okay it's just
healing but it doesn't it does not look
okay I just had to cover it for the
video because I want you guys to really
learn and not just stare at this gross
burn in my hand so um if you guys don't
know where the highlights go goes
underneath where you would put your
concealer and like a downward triangle
we're gonna put it in between our brows
a little bit on my forehead I have a big
forehead so I like to just keep it very
minimal on the forehead down the bridge
of my nose around my lips on my chin and
just blend it
then I'm just going to take my damn
Beauty Blender and just start blending
in all the sharp lines
so now that I'm blending it out it does
look a lot better um it's very easy to
blend it's really creamy which is nice
whenever I do a cream contour I never
leave it cream I always set it with a
powder you can use the contour kit if
you want to contour a little bit further
but if you want to just leave it as a
very natural contour you can just use
some setting powder to kind of set
everything so I'm taking my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm using
my damp Beauty Blender and I'm just
gonna apply it under my eyes
basically wherever you highlighted you
want to apply this to set the contour
I'm using this color right here this one
is a very cool tone contour color so I
guess if you're using a more orange II
warmer shade for the cream I recommend
sending it with a nastier cooler tone
powder
you
I'm picking up a little bit of that same
powder with the brush that I used to
contour and I'm just going to go right
over it
so that is it for now definitely keep me
posted on any hit or miss series that
you guys want to see next let me know
what products you guys are dying to try
out but you're a little bit on the fence
I would love to review them for you guys
again I only use these products this is
my second time using them for this video
so it may grow on me if anything changes
in the future and I just all of a sudden
find a new technique and it's the best
product ever I will let you guys know
but after two tries but seven I'd give
it so I hope you guys enjoy it I love
you so much
and until next time I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
