it's gonna snow
everybody thank you for watching so here
we are in May I can't believe how quick
the year is already going it's finally
getting warm here in New Jersey I feel
like I keep saying it's finally getting
warm but one day it's warm then the next
day it's raining and freezing so I can't
really keep up but I'm ready for you may
so bring on the warm weather so today
I'm gonna go through a couple of my
April favorites a lot of products that
I'm going to be mentioning in this video
I have not mentioned before there are
fairly new products or products that I
just refurbished that I haven't really
talked about so before I get into
today's video I just wanted to let you
guys know that this is all my natural
hair I saw so many people requesting a
video where I don't wear extensions and
yeah so this is my natural hair my
keratin treatment is still doing amazing
for those of you who are wondering I
took a shower last night I put it in a
braid and then this is what I woke up
with and for those of you that are gonna
say oh you do have extensions and I just
wanted to show you all nothing in there
my hair is actually getting like pretty
long which is exciting so yeah for those
of you who wanted to know what my actual
hair looks like without extensions there
are a few other videos where I am NOT
wearing extensions but yeah this is it
also really quickly I wanted to announce
I have a new bundle with whitening
lightening and there's actually two and
what happened was they came out with
this new gloss and it's called coral
craze and you guys probably realized
that the nude gloss has been my favorite
forever now but when they came out with
the coral craze I tried it and it's like
amazing it's actually the one that I'm
wearing right now and it's this perfect
peachy color for spring so I teamed up
with whitening lightening and I created
this bundle for you guys with my
favorite products my spring essentials
in the first bundle you're going to get
a new gloss a coral crazed gloss a brow
bar to go and also the bb+ illumination
and if you guys just saw my recent
highlighting video or highlighter video
I showed you guys swatches of each and
the bb+ cream is literally amazing a lot
of people are comparing it to whisper of
guilt and the heatwave by Estee Lauder
all of this would normally cost you
around $85 but with the code essentials
you can get $30 off so it brings it down
to $55 and you're getting all four of
those product
and the second bundle is my spring
must-haves and that's going to come with
the dial a smile kit which is what I
actually use this morning to get my
teeth white because they were looking a
little bit yellow also you're going to
get the bb+ illumination and you're
going to get the coral craze and the
nude lip gloss so all of that would cost
you roughly around 139 dollars but with
the coupon code must-haves you will get
that all for 99 dollars so it gives you
$40 off so those are my two bundles that
I have for spring they are limited
edition so if you guys were looking at
try some of these products it's better
to buy it in bulk because you're gonna
save a lot more money that way so now
let's move on to my favorites the first
product that I wanted to talk about is
my new foundation this one is by Chanel
and it is the perfection lumineer and
this one I got in the color 40 and I
picked this up I'm gonna say about two
three weeks ago and I've been using it
all the time this is what I actually
have on my face right now and I actually
noticed some of you guys saying did you
get a new foundation because your skin
looks really nice but this one is pricey
so I mean it is around like $60 so it is
a bit expensive I just wanted to mention
this because if any of you guys are in
the market for a great foundation and
you maybe want to spend a little bit
more the Chanel is amazing I'm sorry
again that this product is very pricey
but I do have a bunch of drugstore halls
and drugstore videos where I show
different drugstore foundations that I
really really love as well when I picked
up that foundation I also picked up
label unk by Chanel as well and these I
got from Macy's I actually they
convinced me to sign up for a Macy's
card because you got 20% off so I got a
little bit of a discount but this is
actually a makeup base and it's very
very bright so if you apply it
underneath your concealer it's gonna
give your face a really really bright
look and this one again is a little bit
pricey I would compare this to the two
products that I mentioned in my previous
video which were the Maybelline conceal
any concealers in the radiant and the
ivory so I would compare it to those two
of you guys maybe want to try out a
similar idea but this one is amazing and
I
we use this today as well the next
product I am ridiculously excited about
and I've been in search of a product
like this for so long but never found
anything this is my million dollar town
and it's called all that shimmers dry
oil shimmer this is not a self tanner so
it's not gonna stain your skin what I
recommend this for is if you're going
out you have your legs showing your arms
showing just apply a little bit on and
it gives you this beautiful all over a
bronze glow and what you should do is
you should apply it wait about five ten
minutes before you apply your clothes
because you don't want it to get on your
clothes but this is going to be my Holy
Grail product for spring and summer and
I have been looking for something like
this
forever I can't even tell you so I just
got this product a few weeks ago but
I've already used it two or three times
and I know with the warmer weather I'm
gonna be grabbing this all the time to
give your skin just a really pretty glow
so I know I just posted that video about
highlighters and Luminizer 'z but I
actually recorded that on Thursday
Friday I actually went to the MAC store
with my sister and we popped her on for
a bit and I actually picked up Mac soft
and gentle I know I saw a lot of you
guys requesting to try this but I've
actually used this product for four or
five years now and I ran out of it so I
didn't have it when I had filmed the
other video this product is amazing I
actually use this for my eye shadow and
also to highlight my face today this
product is great because if you want a
very light glow you can just use the
powder as is or you can dip your brush
in fix+ and it gives it such a pigmented
look and again the reason I love this is
because it's multi-use so you can use it
really for all over and that's the same
thing really for any powder highlighters
that you have if you dip it in something
it's gonna really really bring out the
pigment another highlighter that I have
is the Becca opal and I also saw you
guys requesting for me to try this as
well which is funny because I got it in
the mail on Friday because I had ordered
it on Sephora I had heard great things
about it so those are the two
highlighters that I didn't really get to
mention in my previous video because I
had recently just picked them up but
they are such beautiful options and I
saw you guys commenting all over my
video that I have to try these out so I
just wanted to let you guys know that I
am upset
these products and they are great as
well the next product that I want to
talk about is the elf lotion wipes and
this I picked up when I was at Harmons
and the reason that I am ridiculously
obsessed with these is because the
flavor of them are vanilla coconut like
what this oh it's gonna jump on in there
they are so amazing these are great for
all over they're not just makeup remover
wipes and since I have lotion in them
they leave your skin feeling so soft
afterwards and did I mention that they
smell so hey I don't know how I love
this out these me and my cousin Martin
Hartman's and there was only one left
I mean her we're like well I saw at
first but then we turned the little
thing and we found another one thank
goodness because I don't know how I
would have lived without these the
infamous Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit I've had this for a few months
actually and I've tried it a little bit
here and there but this month I actually
really started using it a lot more and I
love love love it they have it back in
stock at Sephora which is great the ones
that I tend to use the most are the
middle brown one this one has a
beautiful highlighter in it and then the
middle is a yellowish color it's very
similar to the Ben Nye banana powder
which I've mentioned in other favorite
videos as well so I would have to say I
wish that there was a darker brown color
to contour with just because I like
starting off with a really really dark
contour and then I blend it out but
overall I definitely approve of this
palette I think it's amazing and I think
a lot of you guys that are looking for a
nice palette would find a ton of use out
of this so for those of you guys looking
for a nice highlighting contour palette
this one is definitely great I've seen
everybody using it and this past month
I've noticed myself using a lot more I
will use it in a video if you guys want
to see how it actually works so in my
past two videos I had mentioned the Kiko
cosmetics the new brand that I had tried
but when I was at Garden State Mall they
have a store called engli as well I'm
sure some of you guys have heard of it
but they don't have any other stores in
New Jersey they're mostly just in New
York but I picked up this sparkling dust
face eyes and body and it's just like a
loose shimmery
powder it's funny because I originally
picked this up to use more for my body
to give it like a body shimmer and then
when I got the million dollar tan
shimmer I was like well this one works a
little bit better because it's not a
loose powder but if you need something
that's multi-use if you want to use it
to highlight you can use it for your
body really wherever this loose powder
is absolutely beautiful I'm going to
show you swatches of course of
everything as well but this was amazing
this one is in number three I think
that's how they go by their products and
then I also picked up this amazing
pigment this one is number 86 and I'm
just so in love with the Inglot pigments
they're so pretty they're so pigmented i
recommend dipping your brush into either
fix+ or eyedrops just to get it wet to
really give you the highest level of
pigmentation that you want the next
product that I picked up was by Makeup
Forever and this is called 12 flash
color case and these are really really
cool I originally saw someone using this
as a lip gloss or a lip stick so I
wanted to go out and try it
these are multi-use you could use it for
eyeshadow you could use it for face
paint you can use it for lipstick could
use it to draw something on your body
there's just so many different uses that
you can use out of these and that is why
I went and picked it up the gold one I
used as an actual eyes shadow and it was
so beautiful this product is a bit
pricey but it is so fun and I keep
grabbing this beautiful peachy color I
guess I'm gonna call it a lipstick and
I've been using it for lipstick and it's
just really really funky and cool and
I've had so much fun playing around with
this I will use it in a video as well so
you guys can really see it in action
next up I have these two new bronzers
they're by BH Cosmetics and they are
amazing I use the matte Brown bronzer
today to contour and this one is a
shimmering bronzer so it has a more
shimmery effect so this one's matte some
shimmer depending on what kind of finish
you guys want I would recommend these
the matte one is amazing it's super
pigmented and I'm loving these right now
so I actually just picked these up from
the drugstore yesterday but it's only
because I
live for these clips like I don't know
where the hell they go because I've had
I've probably bought about mmm I'm gonna
say about 30 of them and just throughout
time they all just start disappearing I
don't know where they go but I literally
use them every single day so I ran out I
was literally down to one and I honestly
don't even know where that one one they
always get misplaced I don't know how
that's even possible but I just pick
these ones up and these are the best
clips ever if you want to just clip up
your hair and just get the hair away
from your face last but not least I have
the L'Oreal boosted high lift creation
spray and this is amazing this you can
use when your hair is dry which is cool
you just spray it right onto the roof of
your the roof of your hair the roots of
your hair and you massage it in and it's
gonna help lift up the roots of your
hair so if your hair is a little bit
dull I recommend sectioning it off
pulling it forward spraying it on the
root and then you can back home in a
little bit but it's gonna really help
keep it in place and you can also use
this to finish off your hair this I've
used a bunch actually but to be honest
I've been letting my hair air dry a lot
just how it is right here because ever
since I got that keratin it's like I've
been super lazy I don't feel like well
drying my hair anymore so this is what
I've been working with but when I blow
out my hair I like to spray a little bit
in around the roots to give it some
extra body so that is it for now I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and if you
guys decide to try out any of the
products that I mentioned definitely let
me know how you liked it because I love
