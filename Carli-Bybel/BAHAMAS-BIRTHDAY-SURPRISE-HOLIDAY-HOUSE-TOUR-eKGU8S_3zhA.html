gotta get off the bus down to ours
good morning oh I haven't blogged since
I have been home I had planned on it but
I wasn't feeling well on the two days
after I got home I feel like any time I
fly I just get sick my eczema flared up
I was just like lethargic so I caught up
on some rest and I have been getting my
house ready we're having a holiday party
here with all of Brett's family on
Sunday so I wanted to finish up all my
decorating
I've been running around getting lots of
food and everything all prepared but um
we've had a lot of people out in the
house the past couple of days we finally
got our fireplace fixed so I don't know
if I ever even showed you guys the
before because I didn't love the tile
that was there but I will show you guys
that in a minute and I also want to show
you some of the holiday decorations that
I set up so I really miss you guys I
feel so weird being like mi4 like this
many days especially on snapchat but
once this blog goes up you guys will
catch up on my week and what I've been
doing the past weeks oh we got little
baby in the back baby in the back baby
in the back stupid what we doing over
here
sonar sent me the okay Google um little
thing for the holidays and we've been
using it's been playing Christmas music
the past couple days I'm obsessed I also
want to show you guys this don't mind
this insane mess over here that I got to
work on but when Kylie had that 20% off
sale I went a little nuts but lots of
goodies to do for a big holiday giveaway
which I am planning it's gonna be
awesome and there's gonna be tons of
winners look at this from up here so the
cats because the cats already broke one
of these we already had overturn it oh
we can put this little guy and I'll show
you guys this at night too but we
wrapped these little lights around house
and we put the little sticky things on
our doors there I'll just show you
because it takes apparently like an hour
for them to set so good hanging the
little briefs so we got so this is our
new fireplace
and then up there lights up with the
trees but I'll show you guys that at
night so you get the full effect and
then normally these will these benches
will be pushed out a bit but because
this is where we put our tree we moved
it in a little and um if you could tell
all the ornaments are towards the top
because the cats have already broke and
knocked over a ton of them we found Bo
in the tree which I'll show you guys a
quick clip of that it was the cutest
thing ever
are you kidding me this is a little
sitting area so you could see how nice
the fireplace goes with everything
um we painted all these walls and it's
the wrong color it came out like way too
peachy I wanted it more like vanilla II
so we're gonna redo that but um the old
fireplace had like oranjee beige and
brown little tiny rectangle tiles so it
was like the only thing this room that
really didn't match I'm so happy with
how it came out and these two little
lanterns are just like holiday
decorations they have little light-up
little things inside of them which again
I'll show you guys a little later and
then we have our stockings for Cindy
bear Bomi and bread get some snow
outside today right berry paint honey
bear Cindy EMBO all got a bath and a
little haircut on Wednesday so my
grandma got me this how great is this so
this is like using to cover that
this little tree was from Tarte in their
little holiday package so I figured it
looks really cute there and these are
the wreaths that we're gonna be hanging
there like white and silver as you guys
can tell everything is white and silver
my mom taught me not a cute thing
whether okay google lower the music
please
okay Google lower the music please so
how each time it goes okay Google what
is the weather like today 36 and a low
of 35 currently is 33 and cloudy thanks
little guy on I always have him on and
then again I just use this to kind of
like cover the plugs a little tray over
here some alcohol a little cute guy I
got to take his tag off and then right
here we have this cute little placemat I
got from Pier one and these flowers are
still from my birthday and they are
still alive and looking perfect so I
don't know how that's even possible but
they're real and they're still alive so
those look pretty nice right there above
our fridge we have that that little
round thing is from Pier one Nicole got
that for me for my birthday which fits
perfectly up there until we finish it
off we're gonna add cabinets and like
probably molding to finish off this
little area over here but we got this
cool new fridge so the screen saver just
tells you with the weather and
everything look you could view inside of
our fridge so that way if you're like at
the grocery store you forget what you
have you can open it up on an app which
is just ridiculous but it's pretty cool
plays music it turns into your TV so
like if fred has football on he can have
it on here too you can add like little
notepads and notes from your phones and
they'll go directly up here and also has
like your schedule and everything like
that which is really cool so this is our
little fridge and then we kept the other
one it's in our pantry we're gonna use
it for like all like drinks and all
kinds of stuff like that so when they
dragged our old fridge out they moved it
into our pantry which is over there and
I didn't realize it at the time we you
still eat in but they dragged it all the
way across
and now there are skid marks all across
my brand new floors don't you baby boy
how you doing buddy how's my cute boy
and how's this boy you have this little
Nutcracker and some pretty key Andals
and then we have I have to fill these up
I just recently bought one of those
little um what are they called Polaroid
cameras so I figured these little frames
were perfect I can put cute little
Polaroids in them which I already did
four over here on our kitchen island
there's like this little area over here
and I got these little silver books from
Z Gallerie and then I just kind of put
this in this our little candle holders
those as well and then here funny story
about this little tray so I bought it
thinking it was like a serving tray like
a large tray and it showed up really
tiny so I figured it was like a cute
little cute little tray when I got my
three then we got some books just some
little triangle thing and then some more
of those silver books so we're still
waiting for this area over here that we
ordered a custom like bench that's going
to wrap all the way around and then I
think we're only going to keep three
chairs here we have to see but we're
going to have like one two three chairs
and then the bench around the back and
we're gonna put all curtains so those
doors are going to become windows since
we never ever use those doors some
little angels these guys light up let's
turn them on they turn on too and then I
love this little thing this is from Pier
one literally thing I bought out the
entire pier one store a little TT girl
so this is the dining room yesterday we
had actually all these chairs the
couches and the kitchen chairs and the
barstools I had them all sprayed with
like a Scott not Scotchgard but
something similar so that way of
anything spills or anything we don't
have any issues here we have this little
placemat is from Pier one I bought this
little tree and then I decided to put
like little balls in them
these little decorative balls there
Sookie and then since I didn't really
fit perfectly and kind of made this
ourselves there's like these little
filler things underneath to kind of fill
in the holes so I thought that looks
cute and then over here is the little
banquet piece we added a little tree and
then we have a little village of a
penguin and owl and a polar bear all on
this little tree so as you guys can see
like the colors on the walls are
different this is the new color it's
like a purpley mauve shade and then this
wall we're going to be doing mirrors and
then like a fabric wall piece in the
middle so that's why the whole wall will
be covered that's why we didn't paint
that wall so I love these little lights
I feel like they are really delicate and
nice so we got rug samples in as well
we're gonna do like a big rug under here
the base of its just going to be like a
cream color the same color as the chairs
and then there's gonna be like a stripe
around it to match the walls you can see
it's like a purpley very like pink
purple mob color but I absolutely love
it especially because the whole rest of
the house is gray because I'm obsessed
with white and grey so it'll be nice to
add a little bit of color whipped up the
snow boots today there's snow storm of
the year these pants are support they're
an extra small and this is how they're
supposed to like are you kidding so
they're just too comfy to return I like
big sweats but this is how I'm going out
today the winter wonderland Oh thought
that bad but it's pretty pretty bad
currently wrapping some gifts Cindy so
what we're doing for all his uncles and
his brother
we got them this big boot and we're
gonna give him a six-pack of beer each
we thought that was a cute little gift
idea by the time this video goes up the
gifts would have been given already I
wrapped these two for Brett's little
cousins I got them the UM what are they
called
the Polaroid cameras here I'll show you
I got one for myself
and I use it all the time so this is
it's a little Polaroid camera and then I
actually forgot to have to give them
instead of film each Parker we got a
little toy and we got a little Puma
sneakers Brett's mom we got a really
nice light up mirror like a double-sided
mirror it has like a Bluetooth speaker
and all that and then what I figured I
would do for his aunts and his
sister-in-law I got you I think I went
to the Harmon and I saw a bunch of cute
little thing so I figured I'd get a
little aloe mask
like a I mask I got a little baby loofah
um like a shower these little things you
put in the shower they're like different
flavors there's like lavender and
eucalyptus their shower tablets so you
put them at the bottom of your shower
and it's supposed to make it smell good
I got them a few face masks some aloe
socks a sea salt scrub and then a bomb
like a cream bomb so I'm just wrapping
now and also meeting this little vegan
enchilada from Amy's ok google' volume
up
Cindy I'm trying to get this excuse me
Cindy sees you unbothered
excuse you it's not yours to lay on this
paper pretty I got all the paper at five
below and I got these little guys at
five below hmm
pity you better watch it useful
I'm the worst rapper and it doesn't help
with three kitties I'm show you guys a
really cool thing so these are like kind
of out so although they turned on it's
kind of hard to tell but so I got these
little angels pr1 and I put a little
like fake candle in it because I thought
it looked cute I put a little some gems
at the bottom as well but this is like
the banquet piece and then I have this
cute little sparkly candle holder in the
middle but we got our little acrylic
nutcracker guys and then another angel
and then that I also put these pretty
little flowers oh um so I got these
boxes up here one and the flowers from
Michaels I just kind of mix an
assortment of different different
flowers so these little guys I actually
have on a timer so that's pretty cool
they go on about the same time every day
but luck so all the lights go on and I'm
ready
now those babies go on their tree at
night I love the only thing I regret not
right grab because it looks good at
night but the top doesn't light up so it
looks so pretty during the day but it
doesn't have little lights on it so
maybe next year we'll get a nice light
up one but so this is it the fireplace
with Cindy so these are like those
little lights that I have up there and
also that I have wrapped around my
staircase but they come in different
sizes as far as like feet so I think
these ones are like five feet or maybe
ten feet and I just put them in these
little lanterns I have these little
candles turned on um I have this little
penguin guy I have another mini lantern
with some lights and then I think my
favorite of all is this one this is a
candle holder from Pier one as well no
I'm not sponsored from Pier one it's
just right next to my house and they
just have great stuff there um so that
is from there as well as the lights and
then this sparkly silver candle if you
can see it and this little head is from
home goods and this pillow I got as a
birthday gift from my friend Kayla and
it looks so good with the chairs in here
so I got this little guy as well from
Pier one um just to add a little holiday
sparkle you know my favorite part of
this room I think is the ceiling like I
love the molding on the ceiling what's
really funny about this room is when we
first moved in as you guys can see
there's like a big opening right here so
you can see the staircase this was all a
wall with like a tiny little door so
this was all a wall the paint was like a
dark dark red and then the ceiling was
like a dark beige so obviously I had
that all switched out I painted the
walls gray and then I oh sure that was
weird so yeah so we had this wall opened
up and then we had this molding added on
to match the dining room so at night
time this is what you get
it literally took maybe 10-15 minutes
maybe a little bit longer but I'm really
happy with how it came out I can't wait
to get a big entry table here I want
like a big black table round I was like
a big Boz and then I kind of want to do
like a bench on either side and art or
something like that on the entry but we
also put up our little wreath so imma
show ya on our front door so we did - we
did one over there and go out here look
there's and then one on that side so
this was my first year actually
decorating um
don't even think about a kid I first
you're decorating for the holidays and
I'm really happy with how it came out
what's up guys what's up ha oh we just
follow mom wherever she goes
hi

oh that's a big hair tie lucky girl
was a fluffy
the pure bliss
you see your child he's hilarious
what was that
Bowie Oh would you do are you not
getting enough attention let oh good oh
good babe go get him butwe oh my god
give me a frickin heart attack he
already jumped off of this thing once
when we first got him scariest moment of
my life this is the progress that I'm
making it is currently 1118 almost done
I honestly still can't get over this
good morning
so it's Sunday morning it's around 10:30
so the first time I've worn makeup since
I've been home from Bahamas my skin is
very dry so it did not go on as nice as
I had hoped usually I like giving my
skin a little bit of a break and then
when I apply my makeup looks so much
better but I'm a little dry from the Sun
but we're just getting everything ready
everyone's coming around 1:00 I'm
starting to put all the presents under
the tree I'm so excited I'm not wearing
my hair like this it's just I curled it
and it's like extra frizzy today but
this what I'm wearing I'm staying super
comfy this is from forever 21 the
leggings are pretty little thing and
then I just have these little socks from
forever 21 just because I need to be
comfy today you know and it's funny
because we left on lettuce and tomatoes

our fruits and veggies are bad or we
want to throw them out obviously we
don't throw them out we put them out for
the deer and they didn't eat them what's
going on up there
