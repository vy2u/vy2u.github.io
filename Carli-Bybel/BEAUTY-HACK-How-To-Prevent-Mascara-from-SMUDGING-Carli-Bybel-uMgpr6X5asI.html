today's video I'm going to share with
you a top secret Beauty hack that has
literally changed my life the past month
I don't know if you guys have the same
problem as me but when I used to apply
my bottom mascara and I tried like a
bunch of different mascara so I know for
sure it wasn't the mascara but I would
always get like black dots underneath my
eyes that I would have to literally
smudge out like a Beauty Blender or a
brush and all of the time and hard work
that I have put in onto like sending my
under eyes making sure there's no
creases all that dust would get like
completely ruined so maybe some of you
guys already know this trick but it's
something that I just randomly came up
with about a month ago so I wanted to
share it with you guys
so if you ever had that problem where
you get darkness under your eyes you get
black box on your eyes from your mascara
please keep watching and you guys will
see the perfect tricks to prevent that
so this set comes once you basically
finish all of your makeup so as you guys
can see I have done my makeup prior I
didn't do anything crazy on my eyes I
just used my palette I use like a mob
shade from my palette in the crease and
then on my lower lash line I use the
Kylie holiday collection like that glue
shade and also that turquoise shade on
my lower lash line so that's what I did
for my eyes if you guys want to see my
full face routine
I just recently filmed my exact routine
so I like that for you guys one thing
that I always get no matter what and I
couldn't figure out why was when I do my
bottom mascara these my lashes are a
little bit longer on the bottom than
maybe some other people I don't know I
always get like the dark little like
dots underneath my eyes and no matter
what mascara I switch to or what power
you that you just never figure out like
how to prevent that from happening
so if you take so much time to try and
get your under eyes cannot be created to
look nice and flawless and not too dry
there's like a million things we rosh
hashanah fix on our makeup and then like
one mole thing at the end you just ruin
all of your hard work so I randomly
started doing this it works for me
amazingly I'm not saying that I'm
I just randomly tried it on my own I
didn't see anybody else do it it was
just something that I'm like let me see
if this will work and actually did so
what you're going to do is you were
going to do all of your makeup your
upper mascara your lashes all that is
completely fine if you want to apply any
shout-out or liner on the lower lash
line through that first as well so what
you're going to need for this hack is
some loose translucent powder whatever
you use to set your eyes is completely
fine you're also going to need a little
brush or you can use your Beauty Blender
whichever you guys prefer the brush that
I use is the more PT 20 and all you're
going to do is you're going to put your
powder are usually just put it right in
the cap so it's easier then you're going
to dip your brush in the powder you want
to get like a decent amount and then
what you're going to do is going to look
up and you're going to apply the powder
right underneath wherever you get the
smudges or wherever you know your lashes
are going to hit underneath your eyes
about that much you don't need anything
crazy just enough that it's going to
prevent the blacks from actually
touching your skin so obviously this is
a step that if you do this like there's
the tons where I apply mascara and I
like let it sit for a little bit all off
and they'll do something and then I'm
getting ready to leave it I'll look in
the mirror I'm like please why do I look
so weird I forgot to wipe this powder
off so don't feel like if you're
applying this powder it's going to make
your under eyes dry or it's going to
ruin any of the work you've already done
because that is not the case which is
awesome so the next step is to apply
your bottom mascara lately I've been
using this one by Fox's own I actually
stole it from my sister they say water
based mascara so when I had the eyelash
extensions this was the one that I was
using she had me really steal from her
she kind of let me have it but it works
really really well especially for bottom
lashes I feel like it just keeps
something nice and separate so I'm just
going to apply my bottom start as I
normally would and I really like it
pretty heavy as far as like we start on
the bottom but what before I learn this
trick I was like trying to keep it to a
minimum and I tried a million different
mascaras and it was just any single time
that I did
it always happen so you can apply this
myth if you want without ruining your
makeup which is awesome so again we're
just going to apply the lower
Scarah I always like to like wait a
little bit it helps make them look
longer
so now that I applied my Azana mascara
you want it to dry before you wipe off
the powder so normally what I'll do is
I'll like move on with my make on
whether I'm doing my lips or anything
like that
first Negus but I'm just using the BSS
to liner by colour-pop and I just have
it all over my lid with a little
chapstick I really love how pigmented
these liners are you don't even really
need a lipstick with it it's all about
preference of course a lot of those
times I get that annoying line so I'll
just use this and then chapstick I'll
just kind of like lend it over my lips
so honestly I'll leave this on maybe
about 10-15 minutes especially by no I
want my makeup to last like all night
long and you want to do what this powder
trick and everything before you apply a
setting spray of course the Waldie
lashes are drying I'll just sit here and
chat with you guys
fumus powder all over my shirt let me
tell you how annoying and hard this
outfit was kidding - but sometimes
beauty is pain still waiting but that's
the key is like the wait as long as
humanly possible so you want to leave it
on for like 20 minutes that's completely
fine as well but you want to leave it
long enough that that mascara is going
to dry without creasing into your under
eyes I hope all the guys are having a
great week so far I have been blogging
through the last week so I'll probably
get that up I'm not trying to set up
this weekend it's not the beginning of
next week for sure
cut a little bit look as I'm sitting
here talking to you guys I'm like
playing with my brush and it broke but
this happens a lot with brushes because
when you wash them sometimes the
moisture can get underneath it so all
you need is a little bit of now going
with some hot glue whatever and mostly
right back on okay so I think it's been
long enough so I'm going to just dust
away all of these powder
very lightly
and then with whatever's left on my
bronzer brush I'm just gonna make sure
there's no like highlighted parts or
sometimes with a brighter powder it can
like brighten up wherever you apply it
so obviously I don't want to look like
like random brightness that is it so
that is the simple easy beauty hat that
has honestly changed my life I think one
of the most annoying things ever for me
was just like having to wake up absolute
last minute to apply my mascara but
wasn't dealing with all that darkness
like for instance I'm never going out in
New York City and I know I have like an
hour drive I used to always just wait
til a right before I got there to apply
my mascara because I always knew it took
about like 20 to 30 minutes for that
blackness to happen so now that I
figured out this new trick
as we got to lifesaver and I really
wanted to sit down today and show you
that hat because it has changed my life
and it's just such a simple little easy
fix that all you guys have powder right
if you're setting your under eyes and
have the powder you have a brush you can
use your Beauty Blender so it really is
a super easy hack that you guys can do
at home try it out let me know if it
works for you guys thank you so much for
watching and until next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
