super excited to be filming today's
video I am finally able to announce that
I have been working on for the past year
and I haven't even hinted at it at all
you guys are going to be completely
surprised so if you want to hear what it
is then please keep watching so today's
the day I'm finally launching my new
company which is called pronounced
beauty and I'm going to get into all
kinds of details and tell you about how
it shows name and all that good stuff
but what is launching today is the first
puff under my own brand so it was a long
time I really wanted to create my own
company and ever since we went vegan
which was almost a year ago I know I
really want to create different products
that I can guarantee we're 100% cruelty
free 100% vegan and also that could help
benefit other people so 1 cruelty free
was not too hard for me I must say but
some of the brands that I do use are
owned by parent companies that I do
still test on animals so I was thinking
of different products to release for my
new brand I had a million come to mind
and I didn't plan on doing a lot of
things in the future as well but the
first thing I really wanted to do was I
wanted to create something that can give
back to the community so I was searching
for a charity to work with for my first
ever project and there were a lot of
research I found an amazing charity
which is called the web foundation with
them I'm creating a scholarship program
to send girls in Cambodia Oh a to
college to get their degree to become
teachers the last foundation was
recognized by four heroes of
philanthropy this foundation is
dedicated to improving the lives and the
living conditions of communities in
Cambodia through healthcare through
water as well as education is built so
many schools in Cambodia which is so
incredible and I thought it would be
such an amazing opportunity to create
the scholarship under my name and
creative products that we could sell to
raise money to send all these girls away
to college during the 1970s between 1.4
and 2.2 million people were murdered in
a match
genocide which is almost 21 percent of
the population so it's so crazy to think
about that something as horrible of
active happenings is a little under 40
years ago so when I heard about this and
I heard about the living conditions and
just everything that's going on in that
country I really felt a close connection
to these girls and I wanted to help
provide them with an education and
provide them with a life they maybe
never dream that they could have so what
our goal is for this launch is we are
trying to raise $100,000 and next
month's the beginning of April me and
Brett are going to be traveling to
Cambodia and we'll be able to present
the money that we raise to all the girls
over there and this will send 120 girls
away to college for four years this will
also provide them with dorm room with
food and with spokes and everything that
they could possibly need to graduate so
I was thinking of different ideas of
what I could create to sell for charity
I don't wanted to pay something that I
personally love and that you guys would
personally love and want to wear as well
so what I did was I created four
different charity bracelets they all
have different sayings on them and they
also have real crystals on them as well
and I'm going to go through and read
each one the post that I chose for each
one and show you guys the bracelet and
then I'm going to get into why I chose
the name for my company and all of that
good stuff so every little piece of this
bracelet I designed from scratch and I
put so much hard work and energy into
this and it's so much fun to create so I
hope you guys love them as much as I do
all of these verses are limited edition
and they will begin shipping on March 27
so that you do place your order today it
will not about immediately be cited
we'll get emailed and you will be kept
updated on everything as well so the
first bracelet and B hope bracelet and
on the box that you will get it in there
is a quote which says a single thread of
Hope is still a very powerful thing and
also on this bracelet is an imaginary
crystal this is known as the lucky hope
stone it will be lucky for all your
hopes and your dreams it brings calming
and soothing energies especially in
times of stress this stone is said to be
of truth on our communication integrity
hope and Trust it is said to enhance
intuition and psychic powers creativity
intellect and psychic ability
I am so into crystal that I believe in
them 100% and I thought it would be
really cool to have a crystal on each of
these bracelets that way if you are
buying it for yourself or if you're
buying it for a friend it has meaning
behind it so not only is the money going
towards an amazing cause you guys are
gonna get a beautiful bracelet that also
has amazing symbolic meaning to it as
well seeing that bracelet is the energy
bracelet and the quote for this one is
the energy of the mind is the essence of
life on this bracelet there's a
labradorite stone which helps to purify
your energy and connecting with the
energy of light clears and opens all
your chakras while bringing you closer
to discovering your dreams and
uncovering your destiny the next
bracelet is the balance bracelet and
this one has an amethyst on it and this
is one of the most spiritual stones that
enhances intuition spirituality and
meditation it helps develop a deeper
understanding of life it's extremely
protective and it neutralizes negative
energy comes to mind and spirit
facilitates decision making and it
balances emotional highs and lows and
the fourth bracelet is the serenity
bracelet the quote is serenity comes
when you trade expectations for
acceptance and on this bracelet we have
the Jade stone and Jade is a symbol of
purity and serenity it signifies wisdom
that is gathered in tranquility Jade is
associated with the heart chakra and
increases love and nurturing it is a
protective song which will keep the
wearer from harm and bring harmony into
your life
Jade brings good luck and friendship the
stone stabilizes the personality and
integrates the mind with the body J
promotes self-sufficiency releases
negative thoughts and soothes the mind
it stimulates ideas and makes tasks seem
less complex so they can be acted upon
so those are the four graces that are
now on sale I hope you guys are so
excited and remember this is all for a
great cause so by purchasing with
bracelet you're going to get a beautiful
bracelet you're also going to be helping
a bunch of girls go away to school and
fulfill their dreams to not do any of
this without you and I'm so excited to
raise the money and get the child over
there and you can meet all them and just
make some big changes so I also wanted
to talk about my new company
why I chose it and some of the other
products that I am planning on launching
this year so a few months back I had
gotten this tattoo on my finger which is
an old symbol and I know I've seen a lot
of people asking about it wondering what
it was if they've never seen it before
or some other people asking why I had a
religious symbol on my finger and I just
didn't wanted to talk about why I chose
his name and meaning behind it for me
and the meaning behind why I thought it
was a great name for my new company
so yes the old symbol is a sacred symbol
of Buddhism and Hinduism but it is also
something that is chanted before and
after yoga sessions so it definitely has
a very spiritual meaning and I don't
know if you guys know what I am more of
a spiritual person than a religious
person there's a few things that I did
want to read to you because I didn't
want to word anything incorrectly but I
just wanted to explain why exactly I
chose this without getting anybody upset
and just understanding like the whole
meaning behind it so this mantra is
insider' to have highest spiritual and
creative power but despite this it is a
mantra that can be recited by anyone so
the sound almonds and compasses
awkward's all sounds in human language
so I was trying to create the name my
original plan was like own beauty or
makeup something along those lines but I
couldn't find a name that wasn't taken
already so I decided to go with Pandava
Beauty because the word for Nava
actually means own so it goes hand in
hand when you chant the word own it
actually helps your mind calm down
you're soft to feed and there is an
instant feeling of peace and calm and to
me that was the main reason that I
thought it would be important to include
it because people all over the world
would be now saying this name and
without even realizing it maybe it can
help calm you guys down so that was like
my main reason behind it I also thought
it would be really cool for people who
maybe have never heard it before to look
into it a little bit more maybe learn
more about meditation more about yoga
and incorporating it into your own life
I wanted to create a place where I can
create
products and teach new things and has it
all benefit you guys and just benefit
everyone
overall so that was like the main reason
behind choosing that name in my head I
have all the meetings and everything I
want to say that I want to read it off
of here that way I'm not saying anything
wrong and I don't get anything all mixed
up so the sound of ohm encompasses all
words and all sounds in a human language
ohm is a matrix of all sounds when it's
the versified form gives rise to all
words used in language so for those
wondering why we can do it everything in
the universe is pulsating and vibrating
nothing is really standing still the
sound om one chanted vibrate at the
frequency of 432 Hz which is the same
vibrational frequency found throughout
everything in nature as such own is the
basic sound of the universe so by
chanting it we are symbolically and
physically tuning it into that sound and
acknowledging our connection to all
other living beings nature and the
universe
I thought it would be so awesome to help
again spread this knowledge of this word
and just a way to connect all of us all
around the world together through
something that we love which is makeup
and beauty and all that stuff so that
was the main reason behind choosing that
name I hope you guys can look into it a
little bit more and maybe added into
your lightest and the meditation into
your life and I just really wanted any
time you saw the symbolizing like that
for a peace of mind to come see by or
maybe just a little bit more relaxation
that wasn't there before so that was the
meaning behind the name of my company
and I'm super super excited to produce
new products I thought it was only right
to start off this company with an
amazing product that is going to be
giving back and it's going to help
change so many people live so with your
health I'm hoping we can raise $100,000
by next month and then I will be going
out to Cambodia and providing them all
of the tech so it's super exciting the
bracelets are so gorgeous and they're
going to love the packaging as well so
the braces are now on sale by one by
four buying for friends whatever you
decide to do some super excited about
the future and one other
that I am working on that I can tell you
about we'll be launching the beginning
of summer is a perfume so the name of my
perfume is going to be called opal and
my birthstone and as you guys know I
love stolen tulip crystal and I love the
meaning behind all of them and it's my
go-to stone so I thought it would be the
perfect name so that's all I can really
tell you about that I have been picked
on which is working on the bottle at
this point but I'm super super excited I
can't wait to share more with you guys
and I'm hoping this is just the
beginning of something really big and
really exciting so I love you guys so
much thank you for watching and go head

LAT foundation I will link their website
