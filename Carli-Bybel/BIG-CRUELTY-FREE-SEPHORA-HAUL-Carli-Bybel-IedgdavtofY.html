today's video I'm going to show you some
of the products I recently picked up
from Sephora I was away all weekend so
don't mind my voice I kind of lost my
voice in Nashville we were there for one
of my good friends bachelorette parties
and it was such a good time hence me
losing my voice I don't get out much but
when I do I am like a wild animal out of
its cage and now I get to suffer the
consequences but I wouldn't trade it for
anything because it was such a good
weekend I also came home with like this
really really bad toothache I only got
one pulled and my bottom left one has
been throbbing and Advil luckily has
been helping but I think I might need it
pulled so anyways let's get right into
today's video you guys want to see what
I recently picked up from Sephora then
please keep watching so the first
product we have is the natasha de Nonna
tropic palette and I actually use this
palette for my eyeshadow today so I did
my eyeshadow first and then after I use
the sangria all over my lid I was like
mmm I have this one shirt that I've been
dying to wear natasha's de Nonna is
definitely super pricey so I wouldn't
say her eyeshadows are like a million
times better that is worth the price
they are obviously amazing quality but
of course I had to try because I love
all of her products and I really love
like the whole theme of this palette I
had to pick this guy up because it's so
beautiful so this next product I didn't
even open yet but it was new in and I
read like the description on it and I
was like mmm I don't want to try it
it's called diamond bus by these
stunning and on the back it says you are
on your way to more vibrant radiant
healthy skin with regular use of the
diamond buff you will achieve stunning
natural results and shine bright like a
diamond well that is interesting so it
comes in a box
and it has like an exfoliating side and
I wonder are these real diamonds so it's
a microdermabrasion tool so the tool can
be used on either dry or damp skin but
it says for best results we recommend
damp skin the point of it obviously is
to exfoliate your skin but I believe
there's real diamonds in there which is
really cool so I will try this thing out
and I will let you know I want to do
like a nighttime routine and show you
guys like what I do every single night
so I'm gonna try this for the next
couple of days and weeks and I'll let
you know what I think but it was really
intriguing and I had to pick it up so
the next thing that I picked up is this
pocha it's a $70 value for $56 so this
has the luminous dewy skin mist the
one-step cleansing oil I think it is
it's the pinnacle pure and then the
violet C radiant mask so I tried the
dewy skin mist probably like 2 or 3
years ago and I hated it but I always
see people loving it and talked about
how amazing it is so I thought you know
I haven't tried it in a while like no
it's definitely bad by now so I wanted
to try it out again and I saw they have
this little set first day off so I
figured I would try it out so next up I
have the Tasha silk canvas filter finish
protective primer and this I heard so
many good things about it was sold out
and I kept checking back for it because
I really really wanted to try it so it
comes in this silver bag
I wonder why and it comes with this this
is what it looks like really nice so
let's see what's so nice it says that
with every purchase you make you help
right in the feature of a girl in a
developing country one full-size
skincare purchase equals one day of
school touches proud to partner with
room to read to make this change
possible which is so nice I love that
so you glide the round scoop
to service until the primer reaches the
line marked worn between fingers and
pressing the skin and upward strokes I'm
really excited to try this I'm gonna
should've tried it today but I honestly
had it over there and I forgot about it
if you guys have tried it comment below
let me know what you think of it I love
what Touch is doing that's an amazing
things so just for that reason alone I'm
glad I purchased this to support it so
next up I have the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in the color dream circle I
have every single Becca highlighter so
any time I mean one drops I always have
to get it plus the packaging it's white
and silver which is so cute it's like an
orange II highlighter with little swirls
on it it doesn't smell they shouldn't
mean it smell like a creamsicle that
would be cool but let's swatch this
pretty thing red I'm gonna finger for my
lipstick so it's such a beautiful orange
shade I love it yeah
so yeah I had to pick this one up
because I have like the whole collection
and it's like a makeup collector's item
but also the shade is absolute gorgeous
I actually don't have any highlighter on
my cheeks right now so you put a little
bit on
so pretty I really actually love this
the next product I picked up is by Olli
Henrickson I think that's how you
pronounce it and this is the clean truth
foaming cleanser has African red tea
extract in it and I was looking on so
forth website because I was in need for
a new liquidy face wash so I went under
like their bestsellers and I think this
is one of them for cruelty free skincare
they don't have many cruelty free brands
on Sephora but I really wanted to try
this and I love it because it smells
like oranges and it helps remove makeup
really nicely so I've been using this
the past couple of days and I again
really like it I mean I don't see any
difference in my face or my but it does
help remove a lot of the makeup and I
love the smell of it as well and
speaking of skincare because I did pick
up this one as well this I'll actually
use before this one this is by the brand
pharmacy it's called green clean and
it's a makeup melt away cleansing balm
the reason that I was drawn to this was
it's saying it's an extract of the
Moringa tree which I heard is amazing
for you it's a native to India and
Africa it helps to purify and refreshes
skin by removing impurities caused by
pollution so this I've been using first
to remove like all of my makeup mascara
everything then I've been going in with
this and then I'll go in with my regular
exfoliating cleanser I always like to
make sure all my makeups gone before I
go in with an exfoliator because I wear
a lot of makeup and sometimes you think
all of your makeups off but it's
actually not so again I'm gonna show you
guys like my full nighttime routine
really soon I do have a vlog coming
Sunday like I mentioned but if you guys
want to see this next let me know and I
will add to the top of my list so the
next product I have is this Sunday Riley
acne face mask and it's Medicaid at 10%
so for mask dries and clears of acne
while preventing new blemishes from
forming and it's like a little like pale
color so I've been using this a lot
lately because I've been breaking out
hi everyone hi everybody thank you for
watching my name is Sami you subscribe
to my mom's channel she loves ya so
anyways I have been using this product a
lot the first time I went downstairs to
eat dinner with my dad was like lose
something face smells like it's a face
mask don't worry I'm not dying
the next product this is like my 10th
bottle of this it is absolutely my
favorite instant tanning product again
it washes off this isn't something
that's gonna like make you tan and keep
you tan but it's called the Vita
Liberata body blur and I get it in the
color medium which is latte
and this is just my favorite I have it
on my arms and my chest right now this
is my Holy Grail product so I've seen a
couple people asking about what product
that I use this is my favorite as far as
if I'm doing my full face makeup and I
want to go out and have like a glow on
my body this is what I use so I feel
like I got a lot of skincare in my last
two shops but I really ran out of a
bunch and I wanted to try new things
this next thing I got it's called light
stem for wrinkles and it reduces and
eliminates fine lines and wrinkles so I
have not tried this one yet either I do
want to try it so it looks like it has
um it's just like a light pen so they're
showing pretty awesome before-and-afters
but they're saying after eight weeks so
I definitely want to try this before I'm
like oh god and buy it but I love when I
go and get facials and they do put the
light therapy on so it's saying that it
is FDA cleared and it's used and
recommended by obstetricians then we're
talking to some classic surgeons for
over a decade now available for home use
so that's really cool if it is as
powerful as the ones that they have the
places that you go to get facials so
again I will keep you guys posted on
this and a few of the other items but I
just wanted to show you guys a quick
haul of what I purchased I hope you guys
