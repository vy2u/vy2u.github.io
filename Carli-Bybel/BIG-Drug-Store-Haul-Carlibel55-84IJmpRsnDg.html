watching so do you notice anything
different I'll give you a second I got a
back job so I know a lot of you guys
have been complaining since I moved and
you weren't feeling my back drop I'm
sorry I know the wall was like uglies
and I was too hard to see so I promise I
do listen and I picked this thing up at
Walmart and it's kind of like a room
divider so let me know if you guys like
this better because if not I don't know
what else to do
so what I'm gonna be doing today is a
drugstore haul I haven't done anything
like this I did do a fashion haul and
you guys seem to like those and I also
posted yesterday and asked if you guys
wanted to see this and majority of you
were excited about it so what happened
is the credit card that I use once you
spend a certain amount and get points
and you can pick which kind of gift card
you want sent to you and they had CBS as
one of the options and that was the best
option for me because I know how much I
usually spend in drugstores so when I
got it in the mail of course I had to go
and buy a bunch of stuff so if you guys
want to see what I bought most of it's
just replenishing what I normally use
please keep watching and I will show you
guys what I got the first thing I want
to talk about my m and love with these
are lip stains I have tried a bunch of
different brands and they all seem to
work about the same way these ones were
a lot less expensive so I wanted to try
them out and I did like them these ones
are by NYC they're called New York color
then I got it in a peach and like a pink
color and the reasons I love these is
because if you just see they're like
kind of like a magic marker
so one of the reasons I love lip stains
is because if you are going out and you
want it to last all day it comes like a
magic marker for your lips as I just
said and you can put a lip balm over it
and you're good to go and it lasts so
much longer and you don't have to keep
reapplying it it doesn't get sticky
looking so I'm a big fan
these these ones again were cheaper so I
did want to try these ones out they do
make other brands that have lip balms
actually attached to the opposite end so
if you see one like that and you just
want to get the two in one I recommend
those another reason I luck one in
drugstores is because they always have
some sort of deals especially on the
mascara that I use and yesterday when I
went they had eyeliners where is the
other one
normally the gel liners that I use are
either from Mac or Maybelline but I
noticed that L'Oreal had a sale which
was violent get one free I think or buy
one get one half off and these ones are
L'Oreal lacquer liner 24 hours and
there's a gel liners and they come with
the brushes which are so much easier to
use I got it Ange the classic black and
then I also got it in a navy blue
because figured I would try that out I
don't have any navy blue liquid liners
so I'm sure these work just as good as
in their Mac or the Maybelline ones I
will keep you guys posted on that but I
love the gel liners that come with the
brushes because there's so much easier
to apply the next thing that I am
excited to talk about is yesterday I
went for a facial and it was the first
facial i've gotten in a while and she
was telling me that I had little veins
on my nose and she said that if you want
to prevent them from showing more or if
you have like red spots and you don't
want them to show as much you can use
all right honestly I don't even care
however you say it it's like something
acid and it's an acne medication and if
you mix just a little bit of this gel in
with your normal moisturizer just
wherever you have those lines or veins
in my case it's gonna help get rid of
them and make them less noticeable and
also prevent them from getting worse if
you just damp a little bit on wherever
mine are right here wherever it is and
then you can put your normal noise riser
over it or you can even mix it in with
your moisturizer and you don't even have
to buy acne lotion you can just mix it
in and then you're all set so I'll keep
the guys updated on how this works but
the way she was explaining it she said
that she seen such great results in
other people so obviously how to go out
and get it since I did get my facial
yesterday I was asking her about her
opinions for a couple of the different
machines I know a lot of people have the
Clarisonic and she was telling me how
she has that one she loves it but she
also has one by Olay it's called the Pro
X which is this one she said that if I
wanted to try it out this one is cheaper
so I could try it out so since I had
that coupon I was like I might as well
try it out so it is the Olay pro-x and
it does come with an exfoliating renewal
cleanser and this is just gonna really
deep clean your face you should use this
I would say every three days you don't
want to use it too often but it does
clean your face really really well and
it does help prevent blackheads and
pimples and everything so I do highly
recommend this I have been using a
different brand but I ran out of the
cream for it so I wanted to try the bold
leg one and I will keep you guys updated
if you want I can do a video on this
because I know a lot of people did the
videos on the Clarisonic I haven't tried
that one but if you want to see that
comment below and let me know about that
the next thing that I purchased is
something that I always get and I go
through them so quickly they are makeup
remover wipes and these ones are by
Neutrogena and they come in this little
piece that's why I like these ones
in the case and then you have the wipes
inside you can just buy the wipes I
think it's like a dollar cheaper but I
like having it in here just so they
don't dry out and they work so amazing
no matter how much makeup you have on
these we'll take them off one thing I
like to do sometimes days before I wash
my face if I do have extra eye makeup on
I will use these get all the excess
makeup off and then use my regular
cleanser to get anything else off but
yeah these ones are my favorites and
Neutrogena ones they're under $10 so if
you are looking for good remover wipes
I recommend this may come as a huge
shocker to you guys because I've never
ever mentioned this before but yesterday
and CVS the mascara that I always used
was filing down half off which is
awesome so my L'Oreal telescopic a lot
of you are asking which ones I guess so
these are the only ones I use they do
have ones that come in a gold bottle I
don't know it's pretty similar but I
just like these ones so they're in the
black casing they're the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black and Walgreens
and CVS always have a buy one get one
half off offer if you do have the card
so that is also really awesome so go
check that out if you guys do love the
mascara and you don't have a CVS or
Walgreens card if you sign up for it
they always have the buy one get one
half off so it does pay off because it
is about $10 for one mascara next we're
gonna talk about now stop if you guys
have heard of the Sally Hansen nail
strips these are amazing I have actually
on my nails right now I have these two
are stickers so I love doing my own
nails and sometimes I can get creative
with them and sometimes I'll just use
the stickers they're so easy to use all
you do is you peel them off and you
stick them on and you can just file them
to fit your nails and they last about a
week and I've used all basically every
single one of them and them every time I
post a picture everyone's like oh my god
I love your nails but yeah these are the
trick to having awesome nails these
Sally Hansen stick-ons
if you aren't as istic guns I have a new
obsession with nail polish
have like them all spread out in color
order but these new ones that I just got
are still pretty sinful colors I got in
this peach and this pink clearly I'm
feeling peach and pink but the reason I
love these these are $1.99 so I mean you
can go to the Walgreens or CVS and you
can get a nine $10 nail polish which is
fine it's still like s cheaper than OPI
but $1.99 is just ridiculous you can buy
like 10 colors for the price of one and
then you have more colors to choose from
so simple colors thank you so much for
making that so affordable because I
probably wouldn't own any nail polish
otherwise but yeah I love that brand I
also got this color it's called minted
by Revlon and I just love it
these two were called so I didn't tell
you guys this pink one is called pink
forever and this peach one doesn't have
the sticker on the bottom anymore so
yeah I'm sorry the sticker fell off so I
don't know the exact color of it but
again because they're what they look
like the last thing that I did buy was
my Neutrogena it's a breakout free
sunscreen with SPF 30
the reason I love this is because it
doesn't cause breakout so if you do have
acne prone skin you don't want to put
the lotion on your face to protect it
this is made for you guys and it's so
important to put SPF on your face and
all over your body but especially your
face because you don't wanna get
wrinkles you want to avoid getting
anything any skin cancer any bad things
happening to your skin so SPF 30 I think
is a good amount to have on your face
again this one is awesome and I did buy
this because next week me and my
boyfriend are going away for Valentine's
Day and we're gonna be in Punta Cana so
it's gonna be super more I'm so excited
and I'd buy this so that is all that I
purchased for my haul with my hundred
coupon and I think it was about sixty
extra dollars so I think I got a pretty
good amount of stuff for that if you
guys liked this video comment below and
let me know if you want to see more and
if not let me know what you want to see
next I hope you guys all have an amazing
amazing weekend and I promise next week
I'll definitely post one more video
before I go away so have a great day
guys
I'll be the one to keep you
meet you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
