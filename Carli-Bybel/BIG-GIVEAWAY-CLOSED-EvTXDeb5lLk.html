for watching so today I'm here with
Brett and we are going to be announcing
a huge giveaway huge giveaway I'm
excited for the giveaway we've been
sitting that were you gonna say
something else yeah I was just gonna say
some of us all there's no ramble for a
second floors mine I was just gonna say
I'm excited for this because it's my
first one I've always asked you like how
the hell do you even do these giveaways
I'm no member we did this - I know I
mean those more me though we've been
literally sitting down writing different
ideas down what we wanted to include for
the giveaway and we figured it was time
that we spoiled you guys a bit so we are
gonna be doing three big prizes and
there's gonna be just very simple rules
to enter which will all be listed below
in the description box but there's going
to be a beauty slash fashion prize a
tech prize a ton of those um and a
fitness slash health prize so we're
gonna just go through what you guys
could win and also I guess really
quickly how you have to enter so I'm
gonna read the beauty one and then you
can read the other one okay okay
you're reading beauty in fashion right
now but well three tack and then you'll
read the health tech I'm sure they're
like what the hell do they mean by tech
okay so so I asked you on Twitter what
you would want to win I saw a lot of
people asking to win a bag and I thought
that would be really cool to get you
guys like a really nice designer bag
because it's something that I personally
picked out that I would personally want
for myself but instead of splurging on
myself I'm gonna splurge on you guys so
I don't think I have any okay I do have
one designer the little YSL bag but I
don't have any like big okay there's
like big like nice designer bags
I think it's value but that big I know
it's remember the one I bought and then
as soon as it got here I felt guilty and
I returned it remember I had the one
your I didn't even open it up that's
like saying remember that glass of water
you drink I'm saying that big yeah here
every single job aren't you bad I'm
saying number and I didn't even open up
I sent it back okay well now is the time
that I splurge and it's on you guys so I
went on Barney's Neiman net-a-porter I
was just on all the websites looking for
the nicest bags out there and I really
didn't find much there was one that
stood out and it's the Phillip Lim bag
and I'll show you guys a picture right
now and how beautiful is that bag so
it's black it's classic you can use it
with everything and I think if you're
gonna spend the money on an expensive
bag you should definitely get a black
one so you could use it all the time so
that is why I picked this one out for
you guys I've been wanting to buy this
forever and I just think it's so perfect
so the grand prize winner is going to
win that Phillip Lim bag and inside the
bag I'm gonna stuff it with some of my
favorite beauty products I'm just gonna
fill it up I don't even know what I'm
gonna go include because the biggest
thing was just the purse but I'll post a
picture when we finally get all the
goodies together today I ordered the
purse and we're just really ordering
everything to gather it all together but
basically all my favorite beauty
products you're going to
during the bag and that's gonna be like
a total of $1,500 worth of prizes I will
tweet and Instagram a picture of the
prizes when we finally get everything in
the mail but I couldn't hold it in I
wanted to announce it so that's why we

part of it thank you for letting me be a

deserve it because we haven't really
done anything in a while and you know we
loved if like it was possible for us to
hang out with you guys like every single
day just like this one big room we would
really try to I mean it's just not
possible it's just a huge party this one
big room is called the Internet in
YouTube so that's basically where we
hang out so it's it's cool but how good
this you look know like what do you you
don't want your makeup like this for me

like to just do a giveaway and nice big
giveaway this might not be the last

enter it's gonna be really really easy
I'm gonna put all the links and
everything below the final steps of the
giveaway is going to be to comment on my
blog which is gonna be linked below as

because I want to have all the entries
on my blog that way I can copy and paste
them and do use your freaking man yeah
so I can pick it randomly and for me a
lot easier than scrolling through nine
older pages or on YouTube yeah so again
all the links and all the directions
will be listed below just about each and
every step and you will be entered to
win some of these amazing prizes
also make sure please try and limit it
to five entries per person I don't want
to see like those fake accounts with
like a million entries cuz it's not fair
if you guys just have a Twitter or just
have an Instagram account make sure
when you comment on my blog you just
write in no Twitter no Instagram or no
YouTube whatever which I'm sure you have
YouTube if you're watching our videos so
the number one thing you have to have to

the entry that way we can just keep
track and make sure everything's all
organized also in the comment on the
