right now why not I don't have a mirror
so I'm just gonna wing it
ah so it looks like it worked pretty
good arctic fox they sent me the color
poison it's hair dye and I know
everything's vegan so I actually
randomly found out about this brand I
think when I was googling vegan hair
color then I wanted to dye my hair navy
blue which I never did and I still want
to do and I didn't realize that Kristen
LeeAnn was the owner of the company so
she sent me so many goodies to try
including this and I really want to do
something different with my hair like I
don't know what I had a dream that I
dyed my hair blonde and when I was in
the chair they were like Oh something
went wrong and like all of my hair fell
out but I just feel like I'm so boring
and I will always have dark hair but we
shall see but thank you so much for the
cute little package we have a box from
Charlotte Tilbury like this video is
like coming up to an hour filming so
Hollywood flawless filter this is a
magical new flawless filter for the best
skin of your life enriched with lamellar
filler which acts like a digitally
enhanced filter for your skin it's soft
focuses perfects and illuminates for a
dewy flawless super star youth glow
though first apply all over the face as
a flawless filter and then you can also
apply it on top of foundation if you
want extra coverage so is this a
foundation I guess it's not a foundation
let's test this guy out because I don't
know so it comes with like a little wand
this is in the color medium for okay
it's right here ooh
okay so it's definitely not a foundation
it gives like a really pretty dewy
finish
I don't know I'm definitely have to try
this guy out on my face to see if it
really works but this is cool and I love
Charlotte Tilbury products so I'm
excited to try this I've never heard of
anything even like this before so this
is cool so next up I actually have
something that I ordered so excited I
ordered this like a month or two ago and
it was lost in all the chaos these three
books from R M Drake broken flowers
gravity and a brilliant madness so if
you guys haven't heard of Robert Drake
you guys have to check him out on
Instagram but he always puts the most
inspirational quotes and I
for them he actually just started
falling back and I got like way too
excited about it but this was like his
little three books special that he had
this one is like different poems so I
just opened up to a random page I will
read you what it says so this is called
all broken flowers grow I want to see
you grow I want to see you for who you
are I want 10 years to pass so you could
come back and tell me how much you loved
how much you've learned I want to see
you inspired and touched by the flames
inside of you I want to see you do all
the things we both know you're capable
of but I can't help you if you can't
help yourself because I believe in all
the things that move inside of you so
give yourself a chance and I will be
here just in case you ever fall crying
I'll read one more because honestly that
just touched my heart this event is
called face the world you should go out
and face the world as you once did when
you are young see the sky and different
shades and the trees for more than what
they are you should stand beneath the
rain and feel more than little droplets
of water rushing through your skin you
should wrap everything with your
imagination by that I mean people in
places and find the inspiration to make
things better this is how we will
survive this is how we will wander away
but ultimately find each other again I
love him so much all right one more
this one's called real is real what is
wrong with the world we used to hate
racism violence poverty famine and more
now everyone hates on anything anytime
they get the chance to the music you
listen to the films you watch the books
you read the clothes you wear and the
way you speak
they even hate you in your own skin if
you tripped over they would even hate
the way you fell the reel of the reel is
how people do not know what to hate on
anymore they have all run out of things
to destroy I will be bringing this and
putting it on my nightstand I just live
for his quotes and his writing he's such
a beautiful author and I highly highly
recommend checking him out if you guys
haven't already so I think on that note
I'm gonna end today's PR unboxing I feel
like I got it so some of it done I think
I got a nice amount done I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching I know a lot of you guys said
in
at last vlog where I did like a little
PR unboxing that you guys really enjoy
these videos so definitely comment below
and let me know if that is true and I
will continue to do these maybe once a
month if you guys want to see them plus
it'll be a way for me to like open
everything and get everything done I am
moving in a couple of months so I really
have to go through everything and then
box everything back up but yeah so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I love
