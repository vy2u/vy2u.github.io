today I'm in one of my spare bedrooms
upstairs that I temporarily converted it
into a closet there is carpet in this
room and there are a ton of clothes so I
can already tell by talking that there's
not going to be any echo so hallelujah
everything around me is like pure chaos
and messy and there's still boxes
everywhere I had someone here about a
month ago and I helped design my new
closet since my last unit just wouldn't
fit in my new closet it's not that it
wouldn't fit because I did have it moved
into the closet now but I just wanted to
do something different and something new
so it's so cool because I got to design
the entire thing so I'm so excited to
see how it finally comes out it's going
to be installed in June I'm going to put
all of my stuff away and organize it and
get rid of so much stuff and I have a
really fun idea on what I'm going to do
to get rid of a lot of my clothes since
I do recycle and I do donate a lot of my
clothes there are a lot of things
leftover that have tags on them that are
still in amazing condition so I will let
you guys know about what I'm going to be
doing with all that shortly but I just
wanted to show you guys some of the
stuff that I picked up recently from the
stores so if you guys want to see what I
got it please keep watching so behind me
I have most of my newer stuff I have
older stuff mixed in as well so I'm just
going to show you some of the items that
I'm hoping are still in stock the first
thing that I picked up is a little set
it doesn't come as an actual set but I
saw it on the model as I said um I just
did set like 12 times this shirt I wore
in my recent like boho makeup and hair
tutorial I actually love it it's flowy
it's airy it's super lightweight and
they had it paired with these cute
little shorts so I just love anything
with matching separate matching
separates are definitely my go-to so I
loved how this look together
I feel like this is definitely more for
summertime but I feel like depending on
where you are you can wear some summer
stuff in the spring it was like 80
degrees yesterday and then today it's
like 40 degrees and raining so it's kind
of all over the place
I haven't actually switched over to
shorts yet but I did start purchasing
them because summer is coming
and the warmer weather was supposed to
be here when it turned to spring but
that's just not how it works in Jersey
so I'm super excited for the warmer
weather this year you can really pair
with jeans you can pair it with you
shorts you compare with a bunch of
different things I think it's really
cute and one thing that's annoying about
doing fashion hauls is every time I hold
something up the lighting changes so
it's really dark this is a romper that I
got from szabo skirt
I love szabo skirt so easy to throw on
that's why I love the warmer weather you
can just throw in a romper or pair of
sandals and run out the door and you're
good to go so I absolutely love this one
and I think it looks so cute on and I
think it'd also be really cute as like a
cover-up for a bathing suit you could
throw it over a bathing suit and it's
like pretty beachy looking as well next
I have this white lace jumpsuit from
misguided it's so gorgeous it has like a
bodysuit built in and then the legs are
sheer and they're like wide leg I am
obsessed I think it's so cute I cannot
wait to wear this it's definitely fancy
and it's a bit revealing so it's not for
everybody but I think this would look so
beautiful with a pair of white heels big
loose waves a light makeup look and like
a really nice tan next I have another
romper also from szabo skirt it's super
flowy and super lightweight it does have
a double lining so it's not see-through
to wear it off the shoulder or you can
wear it on top of your shoulders as well
next I have this little crochet I guess
it could be a bathing suit or up top I'm
pretty sure it's advertised as a bathing
suit but I would even wear this with
like a pair of high waist Jean ripped
shorts or something like that this I got
from Free People I can't wait to get a
tan because I feel like this shirt jean
shorts sandals and a nice tan what's
better than that but I love anything
crochet especially for the spring in the
summertime this is from the website
called Zachary the label which is
another one of my favorites from
Australia I forgot to mention for Tsavo
skirt and furs a Krieger label I do have
coupon codes for anyone interested this
shirt is so cute on its an
off-the-shoulder crop top and then to
pair it I have these little beige pants
I'm obsessed with these
I love Zachary the label because they
fit so nicely I've never had to get any
of my pants from them hemmed or tailored
or anything like that where usually if I
buy it from a different website I'll
have to go and get it usually like fixed
by the waist or sometimes
or in so I actually love this website
they have such cute stuff I would
definitely wear this like out to dinner
or if we were going out somewhere which
if they leave and go out we're so lazy
but I'm gonna make sure Brett takes me
out so I could wear this outfit I love
body suits I'm such a sucker for body
suits I picked up this one that's the
back song from ASOS and it's like that
shiny material I feel like this would
look so cute under so many different
things if you want to wear a skirt if
you want to wear pants if you want to
wear jeans jean shorts the best part
about it is it does have the thong
bodysuit to it so you won't see that
line some body suits are so cute but
they have like that full butt and if you
wear anything too tight you just see
those lines and there's really nothing
you can do so when I saw that they were
the thong backs I picked it up in this
color and then also a khaki color which
I'll show you guys in a little bit I
love basics because you could just layer
them so I could wear this with say a
pair of jean shorts and then like a
little kimono or something over it I
think they look really cute next I have
this silk jumpsuit from misguided one of
my favorite websites as you guys know um
I'm loving silk right now I love the
style of this it has a low front which
knowing me I'll either safety pin it so
it covers a little bit more or you can
go more like a cute crop top underneath
it completely up to you but it has the
long sleeves and then it's the shorts on
the bottom next up I have this brown
bodysuit from Zachary the label as well
I have these in like every color I'm
obsessed with them um they have these
long ties so you could kind of tie them
a bunch of different ways I'll show you
guys a few pictures so you can see each
way that you can wear them I would wear
this with a pair of pants or even like a
high waist skirt or you could even do
shorts I love wearing jean shorts with
basically everything so I can't wait to
pull out all my jean shorts they're
still in boxes somewhere I have this red
2-piece set this is from revolve
clothing there are these cute little
shorts with like red seashells on them
and then the top to go with it I like
how its matching separates but they're
not exactly the same they just have the
same colors and it just goes really cute
together
I don't have to say
enough but I love matching separates as
much as I love putting together outfits
when I'm in a rush which is like 80 90 %
of the time I love just throwing
together a full outfit so when I have
the matching separates or I have the
rompers they're just so much easier to
just throw on and get ready a lot
quicker so next I have this beautiful
red silk gown I have no idea where I'm
going to wear this but I will find
somewhere to wear this it has a long
skirt with the slit on the side and it
just looks so beautiful on I love maxi
dresses for the spring in the summer
they're so airy and fun and this one
obviously is a little bit more dramatic
but I have a few that are more casual
and I just feel like every girl needs a
good maxi dress in their closet I picked
up this army print dress from misguided
I loved it because I love re print
anything army print but I love how it's
like these colors like the purple the
lavender the khaki and in the tan I just
think it's so so so cute
so it's a midi dress it goes down right
below the knees I cannot wait to wear
this I'll probably throw on like a beige
bomber or something over it and then a
pair of like beige sandals to go with it
but I absolutely love the colors of this
print I think I got it at a shirt as
well but I just lived so I know I
mentioned before that I love silk right
now this silk play suit from misguided
is literally everything I actually love
the shape of it and looks so cute on
I've never seen like a silky material
like this in this color so you know I
had to get it hey this is literally
everything look at the sports bra shimmy
shimmy shimmy so I want to wear this
like right now I want to put it on it's
so cute I would definitely wear like a
bomber over this and either high waist
leggings or something with a high waist
I just think it's so cute and it's so
different and I can't wait to wear it
I'm gonna be wearing it like as soon as
possible but I just absolutely love this
next up I have this cute little romper
this is from the website know style
their site has so many cute stuff for a
lot cheaper than some of the other
websites sell it for so how I would wear
this is I would probably just wear this
with some sneakers and then like a black
sweatshirt wrapped around my waist um
yes that's what I was thinking maybe
even a bomber depending on the weather
outside
but I do have a 15% off code if anyone
wants to go check out their website they
have really really cute matching
separates and cute just like stretching
material outfits like this so I also
picked up this sweater dress it is so
cute on so cute I absolutely love this I
love how a lot of their outfits are like
weirdly cut I had in my last vlog I had
on a Szabo skirt shirt and everyone's
like I don't understand the shirt so
I'll show it to you guys in a minute so
this it has a turtleneck on the top the
crop top and then the skirt and it goes
down to like right below your knees as
well so just to show you guys this is
the outfit it has the shorts and then
the top goes take it off the hanger to
show you it goes like around the neck
and then it has this cute little so it's
like that one shoulder which you saw
like all twisted so it has like the one
little sleeve and it has like this
connected bra top in it so a lot of you
guys were like is your boob hanging out
understand but this was on so this
covers so it's just so different and so
cool and it's that silky material which
I'm loving I also love the color of them
and these shorts though so a few minutes
ago I showed you the beige bodysuit I
have the same one in the khaki like I
mentioned from ASOS with the thumb tush
and it has the buttons on the bottom so
you don't take the whole thing off to go
to the bathroom because I have a few
that don't have the buttons and there's
literally nothing more annoying than
having to go to the bathroom and take
off your entire outfit what do you guys
think of this jean trend
I had bought like a jean long skirt last
year and I never ended up wearing it but
I saw this cute little dress on
misguided and I don't know I kind of I'm
feeling it I feel like it's really cute
I would probably wear it was either like
flat sandals in this color like a camel
color or even like a pair of heels um if
it's really really nice it's super snug
and I don't know I wanted to take a
little risk and try something new and
it's a stretchy material which is nice
as well this crop top is literally my
life I am obsessed it has pearls on it
it has like silver studs it has like a
lace detail
it's from Nasty Gal it's so gorgeous it
came with a matching skirt which I
wasn't really feeling but I love this I
would wear this with like a black high
waist long miniskirt
a tight-fitting one or even like
high-waist black pants I have a problem
where if I really really love an outfit
I always want to save it in case
something really awesome comes up and I
need a cute outfit but then a year
passes and I realized that I don't
really ever go anywhere I'm so boring
and I like to stay home but I guys start
getting out there and wearing my cute
outfit so I can't wait or this I am
going to London on Wednesday with my
sister so maybe I'll bring a couple
etude outfits it's for a secret reason I
can't tell you guys yet but I will be
announcing it very soon I'm so excited
about it by the way but so next I have
this adorable one-piece onesie thing
with two stripes down the side this is
also from know style it fits like a
glove I absolutely love it it's so
sporty and so cute I wore a really
similar outfit in my last vlog I'm so
glad that that style is like in because
there's nothing that I love more than
wearing stretchy clothing and sneakers
and I know it's a little boring and I
know a lot of you guys are used to like
my extravagant outfits with heels and
stuff like that
but I've just been showing more
realistic outfits and stuff that I wear
on a normal day but don't worry I will
be starting up my blog again it's just
been so hectic with the move I mean we
moved back in December but I still not
done unpacking but yeah as soon as
that's all setup and everything's good
I'm going to start up my blog again let
me know do you guys prefer the blog
posts that I did or do you guys prefer
like my mirror pictures that I've been
doing on the fashion page let me know
either way I'm probably going to still
do both but I would love to hear your
feedback so let me know comment below
let me know so this next jumpsuit is
also by misguided it is definitely
inspired by the one Kim K wore ever
since I saw her wear that outfit I was
like I need that in my life I love
anything crochet and misguided just
recently came out with this so as soon
as I thought it was a guest Nina in my
life I bought it that day so I wanted to
show you this little bodysuit that I got
me and my best friend Nicole are going
to a country music concert in August we
are seeing Miranda Lambert Sam hunt and
Kenny Chesney which is so exciting I'm
literally so excited to go to that I
already planned my outfit even though
we're months in advance I don't know I
always have to wear something French
when I go to a country music concert
because it's just that's what you do
that's what you're supposed to wear
something with a French so I figured
this
of hair like black shorts and then I
have these fringe boots where are they
laughs fringe boots and I figured
that'll be my outfit I can just see
myself now dancing and just hitting
people in the face of my friend yes and
then the last thing I'm going to show
you guys today is this little skirt that
is also from no style it has a slit in
the front and it has like a little
underwear piece attached so I think this
would be so cute to wear over a bathing
suit as like a cover-up you can also
just wear it if you want to wear it out
with like a cute little crop top but I
actually love this I got it in white as
well because I think it's so cute and I
love that it comes with the underwear
included because sometimes they'll sell
like sheer items without a piece
attached and then you have to go out of
your way to go find something that'll
look good on dress so I guess that is it
for now thank you all so much for
watching hopefully the echo was better
in this video because there is no tile
and there are tons of clothes or help me
so I love you guys so much - thank you
for watching and until next time I'll
see you guys later
figured I would show myself doing this
hairstyle and if I liked it I would post
it if I didn't then I went in but I
actually really liked how it turned out
I think it's so cute it literally makes
me feel like a spice girl
