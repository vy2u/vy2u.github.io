today I am back with a spring fashion
haul for you guys I think the lesson
that I did was full / winter it's been a
little bit and the past couple days I've
been really organizing my closet trying
to get rid of a lot of stuff and just
trying to organize everything making it
look all nice so I figured say I was
filming my closet
this week I'm supposed to get like 89
degrees in New Jersey which is crazy
because I feel like it's just been
really really cold like I still been
wearing sweatshirts and jacket and all
that so I don't know how much of a
spring we're gonna get so I want to show
you some of the pieces that I recently
picked up so if you guys want to see
what they are then please keep watching
so this first little crop T is a
Baywatch tee it's really funny because I
got this probably about two weeks ago on
Urban Outfitters and on the other side
we went to go see a movie with my mom
and grandma my sister and then our
boyfriends and I saw that Baywatch is
coming out like there's a new movie
coming out within the rock and Zac Efron
so I already have this and then I saw it
I'm like Oh perfect timing so when I saw
this shirt I wanted to get it because a
in the summertime especially from where
the beach or like a pool or something
like that I always only we're just like
high-waisted jeans and then like a cute
cropped tank over my bathing suit so I
bought a pair of orange high-waisted
shorts to go with it I saw it on the
model together and I thought it was
really cute she next item is this white
flowy dress I really really love this
here I bought a few shirts at couple of
months with these long please and it's
funny because I think that it wasn't
like 5th grade
yeah it had of them 5th or 6th grade
into the random story that I just
thought about it so I figured I would
tell you so I had a shirt very similar
to this was like the very tight sleeve
and then the flowy arm and I wore to
school and I stole one of my sister's
bras like I literally had no boobs I was
completely flat and I wore one of her
padded bras of the shirt and I put a
sweatshirt over it and I snuck out
because I knew my mom would be like what
are you doing and
when the school day I think everyone
made fun of me in every was like one of
those boobs come from yes oh that
happened fine how I'm seeing so many
times coming back that were popular in
the 90s and nineties are coming back and
I'm very happy about it I love this you
can dress it up you can dress it down to
wear like a pair of booties with it wear
a pair of sandals super flowy and it's
very lightweight so although it is long
please it's very lightweight so if you
do wear in the warmer weather you guys
will be completely fine next up I have
this three-piece set is a beautiful
white lace like trench coat and you can
see it also has those sleeves white lace
shorts or high waist and the crop top
has a choker attached to it which I mean
I don't think Childers are going
anywhere
I am personally obsessed with them so I
just love the combo of all of this I
have to find somewhere good to wear this
because the problem is I would buy like
some of the stuff that I buys like super
cute they obviously can't wear on like a
day-to-day basis I was continent
everything fun I was kind of like saving
like all my really cute outfits for like
a special event and then I realized two
three years later when I bled my special
office untouched that I really don't go
anywhere and I just need to make
breathtaking out dinner or just
something along those lines just so I
can learn from with my cute outfit so
this next dress I just got in the mail
yesterday I know what parva 21 stuff
goes quick online so I'm hoping that's
still there because I thought this was
so beautiful so it's a maxi dress that
crisscross is in the front the back has
a crisscross all the way up and it's
long flowy and has a slit in it it's
just literally so beautiful I think this
would be so cute paired with like a pair
of flat sandals you can even wear like
nude high Standells to wear it as a day
dress and keep it a little more casual
or you can wear it out to dinner
anything like that so maybe for some
it's a little too much for a day time
look but I was totally wear this during
the day next I have this blue and white
stripes off the shoulder kind of like a
boyfriend shirt and can wear this with a
pair of jean shorts a pair of jeans I
don't think it's long enough
moving on making some super short but
something like this but we're a little
long
and steal your boyfriend's button-down
shirt you can wear with one of those
corset belts which I absolutely love I
know some people still don't like that
but just wait I'm sure another whole
month they will grow on you but I was
probably wear this tucked in with a pair
of jean shorts and a pair of white
sandals so it lays off the shoulder and
then it does have the long sleeve but
again it's super lightweight very beachy
- you can even throw this over a bathing
suit but I saw it on forever 21 and I
just needed it in my life so next I have
literally the cutest - piece in the
world
I posted a blog post a couple months ago
probably left know was it last summer
with that jean corset that denim corset
so I have on the white dress denim
corset denim heels and everyone loved
the belt that I had and I actually got
it custom made from a website called tlz
listen I believe this house pronounced
she designed to news to pieces and she
send them to me a couple months ago now
and I didn't even have a chance to wear
them yet but of course about a week or
two after I got them kind of dinner did
a photo shoot and more both of the two
pieces that I got so I'm waiting to wear
them I had them before she posted them
but you know it's my own fault because
when I get things I never wear it right
away so I'll probably wait a little bit
before I wear it because everyone always
thinks I'm copying them but I think we
just have very similar kinks but anyway
so I really really love this it has a
deep long flowy a big sleeve and then it
has a little mini skirt that matches so
I also got this exact two-piece in a
nude like crochet look as well so she
sent me these two pieces and she also
sent me a couple more of the corset
belts which I absolutely love so if you
guys haven't heard of archery hand makes
everything just amazing go check out her
website next up I have this cute little
craft t-shirt and has a I in sequins on
the front which I love is again another
simple crop top but I figure with a pair
of highways jean shorts
I like black short IV black jeans um
being forever kind of any bottom with it
I just thought it was super cute casual
to throw it over a bathing suit and I
just
that I was blue so that's why me that's
the real reason I died of the cool
eyelashes Anna Bligh I need it so this
is next crop top I was debating whether
to wear this I would say or this because
I got a choker that matches this and
then this crop top and then I also have
the little jacket which I'll show you so
I'll probably end up wearing this
tomorrow or the next day
Tommy Hilfiger well I don't think it
really is I got it off of Etsy um so
yeah it's definitely probably not a real
Tommy Hilfiger shirt but I loved it I
thought it was so cute I would probably
wear this with either like onyx pants
like this maybe like baggy like the
button on the side pants or you could do
black highways chains I feel like I
always wear black high-waisted jeans you
guys need a good pair because I'd like
to go with anything and everything and
the ones that I wear literally all
decided right Levi's all these nineties
brands that were huge in the 90 mm
they're coming back and as I was saying
I had a jacket that match I got this
vintage Tommy healthier windbreaker
jacket I got this on ASOS marketplace so
a silk has a section where they have
like vintage clothes I don't know if
it's like lightly worn use whatever it
is like it kind of smells a little bit
honestly but it's vintage so that's what
you got to do so when I wear the bandeau
top I'll probably have this like open
next up I have is Harley Davidson in the
crop top another crop top I feel like
whenever I do these videos I always show
crop tops bike I just love crop tops
especially with spring and summer
they're just so easy I got this actually
at a thrift store it's just a game ended
t-shirt and on the back it says
harley-davidson Memphis Tennessee so
cute simple vintage love it
so this next body suit I wanted to show
you guys because I got this from Bali
when you're in Bali we did a little bit
of shopping and Brett wanted to buy for
me so sweet and you bought this handmade
bodies for me it is so gorgeous I don't
know if you guys can see the detail from
here but it's all hand beaded with
sequins
the back is a little bit low I
definitely need to wear this probably
like one of my next videos before it
gets too too hot it was pricey for sure
especially because some of the other
shops we were going in were like very
affordable but if you guys are ever in
Bali the name of the shop I'm sure she
has other shops it's called Thai and I
just like a little logo right there oh
the next time I have this cute little
donut tank they have a matching skirt to
go with it and I had it in my cart but
you know what I I took it out because
I'm like realistically I probably won't
wear the skirt or the little miniskirt
with this little top I probably wear
this top was like a pair of like banging
your pants I really don't know yet but
velvet is still in in for spring and for
summer and I think this color is just
really really pretty I don't have
anything build it like in the same color
so have a try next up I have this
t-shirt dress so you can wear as a
t-shirt with it like kind of tied up in
the front or you can wear as a dress
sometimes I'll buy like band t-shirts
and they definitely will not fit as a
dress so I believe this is even labeled
as a dress yeah it's called a t-shirt
dress so they made it a little bit
longer but fancies I love them they're
easy to just throw line you can put a
pair sandals pair of booties really
whatever you want I mean all the stars
wearing like thigh highs with them but
probably the thigh highs first fall in
the winter next up I have another
t-shirt this one is from Urban there are
little roses on it on the back as well
there's some roses and then almost
sleeve I just love anything more like an
army print and just these colors
together I love so I thought it'd be
really cool to wear this and wear like a
bright orange lipstick with it and they
have that pop of orange um I bought it
in an extra-large because I was trying
to make it a t-shirt dress I don't know
how it's gonna look I have to try it on
first but if not then I'll probably just
knot it up in the front that's kind of
what I always do either where is dress
I'll tuck it in you know Brett hates
when cuffing then I'll just a little
knot in the front and then it was really
cute his next top is literally the
cutest I got it in black as well it's
just a little crop top with long sleeves
so it's off the shoulders it's like a
Bardot's type of top with a knit
Patrick I probably just wear this with a
pair of high-waisted ripped jeans and
sneakers or if you're going out you can
even wear heels is the next of I have
this adorable 2-piece the please feel
like super long ties which I would tie
into a bow so it's a crop top with
matching Shore it came out a few color
so I got to see which ones are still in
stock but you can see they're just
shorts with the tie down the side and
then the matching tops to go with it how
cute is this guys you can wear this out
with a pair of heels or you could just
wear it with a pair of sneakers and like
a little baseball cap and keep it more
casual for the daytime guys guess what
another crop top shocking it's this cute
little yellow crop top I believe this is
from ASOS and I think you could tie it
into a bow I just tied it to get it onto
the hanger again high-waisted anything
whenever I'm wearing crop tops I feel
like I always wear a high waist also
because I'm so sure when I wear high
waisted things it makes my legs look
longer so I feel like I got a long torso
and shorter life so when I wear high
weights and stuff it kind of like
balances it out so if you're short try
something else how wasted if you haven't
because it'll change your life
so next I have another outfit that I
can't wait to wear I'm going to be
wearing it very soon this is like a four
piece outfit which you don't need to get
every part of it but it's a yellow
jacket with matching yellow shorts so it
seemed like that windbreaker material
and then I have a little cute sports bra
underneath so the shorts are a little
high waist you wear it with that and
then I also bought the matching
underwear because they're high-waisted
underwear and I'm obsessed with the
yellow I just thought it was like super
different and bright and yeah I can't
wait to try out and see how it looks on
me but this look from Urban Outfitters
as well awesome to pieces I feel like
I've been obsessed with two pieces for
years and years and years it makes life
so much easier
people always say oh I'm nothing away
and I'm sure some of you were wondering
do I still have those days where I'm
like I have nothing to wear
yes don't call me crazy but it's just
like it's hard to pick out office and
it's hard to figure out like what do I
want to do tonight so I want to do pants
what I want to do short so I want to ask
Ertz I want to address the wrong part so
it's definitely very hard to figure out
what to wear but with the matching
separates it makes your life a little
bit easier so that is why I always stock
up on them so I love look how cute this
is this is from urban you can wear it as
like a cover-up for a bathing suit you
could just wear it on a regular summer
day I just actually love the green in
the pink it's so bright that's just the
people in line right now when I ordered
it I thought it was only the top and I
looked on the whole website I couldn't
find the short but sometimes companies
will like launch something and then a
couple days later they'll release the
other half to the matching set which is
so annoying but it's definitely like a
sales tactic to get you back on the site
so I ordered it anyway thinking it was
just going to be the shirt and then I
would get the shorts later on but it
came and it was the set so I was really
excited about that
and I love love love the color of it
next up I have this pretty pink romper
it's a crisscross back so it's laying
weird on the hanger but it was really
pretty pleated material stretching
material as well has the wide legs on
the bottom it fits really nicely the
back is open it's like a crisscross back
compare this with a cute cells of course
I felt a regular develop or you can just
wear it plain so when I was shopping for
like Bali and Malaysia and all that I
wanted to get some cute to pieces
I don't know what the plan really would
be as far as dinner and all that stuff
but I wanted to have option so I bought
this is a skirt with two slits in the
front when I tried this on you can't
wear a bra with it but what I did is I
just put bathing suit padding in it that
way I could have a little bit of umph
it's funny because a lot of people have
been asking me if I've gotten a boob job
lately and no I haven't so I figured
I'll film a new like boob hack video for
you guys because honestly like my boobs
are they're not small they're like
medium but I can make them look really
so again it's all about working with
what outfit you're wearing and just
working with what you got so if you guys
want to that video comment below and let
me know because I was thinking of
filming at this week as well so next I
have this pink long t-shirt dress it's
like a very slinky type of material I
saw this on my site with the girl had a
corset on and then she had a pair of
kind of like biker shorts with the lace
on the bottom so it's so cute together
so that's why I picked it up so we have
it looks a little boring but it's also
how you style it can we take a minute
for this shirt right here oh it's so
beautiful so I have like that opal looks
with so this is all sequins it's a crop
top surprising like whenever I do these
fashion hauls I realized how much I buy
like the same thing like so many crop
tops but like never bottom so I need to
start buying some bottom actually no I
don't need to buy anything I have
bottoms but yeah I probably wear this
with maybe like a pair of high-waisted
white jeans or maybe like white trousers
just another color I wear with this
maybe like lavender but I have a pair of
lavender trousers but as soon as I saw
this and it was so super sent off I was
like done mean it is perfect it has a
little bit of a flare sleeve not as much
as the others but it's absolutely
gorgeous and I'm upset so this probably
isn't a spring /summer outfit but the
color is and I live in sweat pants and
sweatshirts so I got this champion
two-piece sweater just underneath or
just purple whenever I travel I just
don't like when my skin touches anything
in the airport or on the airplane
because I have like a weird phobia of
germs and I don't know so I just always
have a sweatshirt or something long
sleeve with me so I thought this would
be like the cutest traveling outfit
specially the color like my dining room
wall downstairs the top is a medium and
then the bottoms are a small I believe
so next I have another outfit that I
brought with me to Bali but I never
ended up
because we only did dinner I think like
two nights where we got dressed up so I
will definitely be wearing this soon so
it's a beautiful black maxi skirt it has
two slits in the front and polka dots
all over it also has like two little
pockets so it's a bathing suit top that
they showed with a bottom but it's the
same brand and they showed this skirt
with this top and I thought it looks so
cute together but I absolutely love it
like how cute or the Polka Dot and it's
a little bit short as well as far as
like a length wide so I can't even wear
heels with it which is I mean fine it's
more like beachy understandable but if
you guys are tall the skirt will
definitely be way too short for you guys
so I put it on with heels and it was
like this much off the ground which when
I wear maxi skirts I like when they
touch the ground so just a little heads
up if anyone's looking to buy them and
then last but not least I have this crop
sweatshirt from forever 21 and hadley
beep snap up the sleeve which they
showed it kind of unsnapped so you can
have like your shoulder hanging out and
the heather rest button and it comes
with a matching skirt like a little mini
skirt it's like in the same sweatshirt
material can't find it right now I do
have it though somewhere in the mess but
it's so it's like this cute cropped
sweatshirt was like a little sweatshirt
mini skirt and yeah so it's very sporty
and cute and I just thought it would be
really cute for the spring time I'll
probably wear it honestly with some like
lace-up sandals or even sneakers you can
go either way with it again it's really
about how do you want to style it so I
feel like I always have ideas on how I
want to wear something and style it and
then I'll put it on and then I'll change
my mind completely but it really just
depends on I guess move in where I'm
going and all that good stuff so these
are some of my recent purchases I know
you guys were asking for a haul so I
hope you enjoyed I definitely want to
start doing some of those books I just
got some new camera equipment that will
help keep everything really stable and
everything like that so hopefully that
