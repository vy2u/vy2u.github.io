moments of weakness for once at peace
with mercy hi everyone thank you for
watching so one question that I'm always
constantly asked is what are your
favorite online shopping places where do
you get your clothes anything like that
so I just did some shopping recently so
I wanted to show you some of the stuff
that I've been getting and I also wanted
to tell you guys about some of my
favorite online shops right now so if
you guys want to learn what they are
then just keep watching the first online
shop that I'm gonna be mentioning is
definitely my number one favorite so
that's why I'm going to be telling you
guys about it first and the website is
called a so if you have been following
me for a while I'm sure you have seen me
mention them I actually got these
amazing earrings from there as well
I love their online shop because it's
really really awesome for anybody they
have women they have men's they have
plus size they have maternity clothes
they have shoes accessories bags jewelry
everything you can imagine so it's
definitely my number one go-to store I
recently got a few things from there
that I wanted to share with you guys I
got this green maxi dress and I love
this because it's it's pretty plain so
it's definitely casual or you can even
dress it up it does have the two slits
in the front so it looks like kind of
like that so it's like those long maxi
skirts I have this list in the front and
I love it because it's a fabulous green
color and again you can throw it over a
bathing suit or you can even dress it up
and wear it like for a night out and yet
super comfy stretchy material and I love
love love this this color for summertime
is definitely my favorite right now
another thing I recently purchased from
ASOS is this beautiful blazer I love how
it's all embroidered it looks like it
took forever to make and it looks
designer in my opinion and it really was
not ecstatic spensive at all the back is
my favorite part I can't wait to wear
this I don't really know if I'm gonna
save it for when it gets a little cooler
out or I can always throw it over like
an all-black outfit for a night time but
I absolutely love this jacket and for
those of you who are asking I usually
get either
extra small or this is the jacket is a
size two so the next thing I'm going to
show you is my absolute favorite I can't
wait to wear it I do have to get it
hems because they were low on stock so I
had to get a little bit of a bigger size
but it's this adorable Rhodes blazer and
it comes with matching shirts which is
just too cute so I would probably wear
this with like a white t-shirt
underneath or anything like that I'm all
about matching separates whether it's
the Blazer and the shorts or crop tops
and the shorts I love love love the
style for something with ASOS is it is a
very popular website so a lot of their
stuff does go out of stock quickly so I
always check back a couple times a week
just to see some of the new stuff that
they got in and I promise you if you
check out their website you will not be
disappointed the next online store I'm
going to tell you guys about is also
another one of my top favorites it's
called Nasty Gal comm and I recently got
these two things from there one is this
pretty peach halter top and I love it
because it's highs are on your neck and
it's a little bit loose so it's gonna
look really cute with a pair of
high-waisted shorts or even jeans tucked
in and I love it because it has kind of
like a low back but not too low so I'm
pretty sure you could still wear a bra
with it I haven't worn it yet so I will
keep you updated on that but I just love
this color and it looks really good with
a tan and the other thing that I
recently bought was another maxi dress
it's so funny because I used to be so
against maxi dresses or maxi skirts
because I just thought since I'm so
short it would just look silly on me but
they're on a pair of heels and you're
good to go
so this is the dress that I got and love
it this is the front and then the back
is the crisscross and it also I think
has the two slits in the front right
yeah and it also has again the two slits
in the front so this is so pretty
I definitely wear this for a night out
to dinner definitely reminds me of a
vacation dress but I love it and sel
always has amazing stuff they don't ever
really have any discounts which is kind
of stinky but sometimes they'll throw in
like a 20% off sale excite wide sale
which is really cool and they just had
one actually
don't care how old I am or where I ends
up in life I will always always shop at
forever 21 they have the best stuff it's
so inexpensive and I don't know if you
want to find something that you can
usually find for like a couple hundred
dollars I'm sure you can find something
very very similar at forever 21 I used
to just go to them all the time but
honestly online shopping is definitely
my new thing it's a lot easier a few
things that I recently purchased from
them was this black lace it's like a top
but I bought it to be a cover-up I
thought it'd be really cute to just kind
of throw over a bathing suit whether
you're on the beach or a pool party and
yeah it's long enough to definitely
cover your tush so you don't have to
worry about that and let's see how much
this bad boy was $24 not too shabby
the next thing that I got is also from
forever 21 I thought this was too cute I
know like the lions and tigers are
really in right now like the gold
necklaces so I saw this and I thought
this would be really really cute with
like black highway shorts and maybe a
blazer or even pair of jeans but I love
the detail of this and when I saw it I
knew I had to get it one thing I could
never get enough of are forever21 shorts
they are so inexpensive and they fit
really really nicely so I recently
picked up these two pairs these are one
of them they're like the houndstooth
print and I love this yellow color I
actually have a pair of shoes from
forever 21 I think I showed them in my
spring fashion trends video it's at this
yellow color so I'm definitely gonna
probably wear these with like a white
top and in those yellow shoes I love
getting patterned schwarz because it's
so easy to kind of throw an outfit
together if you just put on the
patterned shorts plain top and then you
have a pair of shoes and your jewelry to
match it looks really really cute and
well put together and the last thing I
got recently from forever 21 were these
blue shorts same idea with the yellow I
would probably wear just like a plain
top and some blue jewelry a blue purse
and yeah I love these types of shorts
they fit really nicely and they're not
too short which is good the next website
I'm gonna be talking about which is also
one my favorites is ami Club where I've
been shopping there for a couple years
now and I first only was buying their
shoes because they have very affordable
shoes
then this year they came out with a
whole new line of swimwear which really
got me because I'm slightly obsessed
with bikinis and yeah I'm kind of
slightly obsessed with a lot of things
but bikinis is definitely one of them
and so many of the websites now are
selling bikinis for like one to three
hundred dollars which is just absolutely
crazy in my opinion I found these
amazing affordable ones on ami and I had
to show you guys because I wore them
over the fourth of July weekend this is
one of them and it's like a light pink
outside with baby blue floral print and
this is the bottom so it fits so nice on
and I absolutely love the print of it
it's so pretty and I think it was under
$30 like it's definitely under $30 I
should say so I definitely recommend to
go check out their bathing suits because
if you can buy like seven for the price
of one on another website why not the
other one I got was this one this is the
print of it and it's just the regular
triangle top same bottom but I just love
the print of it and it fits again really
really nice what's good is the back has
the scrunch butt which is the only ones
I wear because it really fits your body
nice and also the other ones always give
me like that saggy butt look so I didn't
really like them but the reason I love
this is because it is a full bottom it
covers basically your whole but a lot of
the other websites are basically selling
songs now so it's not really appropriate
so these ones I really really love and I
highly recommends another thing I bought
from that website recently was this cute
flower crop top I thought it would be
really cute to just throw on with a pair
of high waist jeans and maybe like a
loose jacket or something casual I
thought it was really cute so I
purchased that along with it I think it
was like under 20 bucks as well and the
fourth thing that I got from them was
just this army print tank has like a
little pocket in the front again it is
very affordable and I'm loving army
print right now so I saw I had to get it
and now the final website I'm going to
be talking about is definitely a newer
website that I came across the name of
it is boohoo comm and they have really
really cute stuff I believe they are
based out of the UK so it's cool because
a lot of the u.s. websites I feel like
have the same stuff on every single
website and it's over
pettite of so it gets like annoying
seeing the same stuff all the time like
I need options I want to see different
stuff so when I found boohoo calm I was
loving what they had and I thought this
was so cute I got it's like a little
romper it's long sleeves it shorts and
it has like a drawstring so when I saw
this I was like this would be the cutest
thing to travel in so same one in the
airport or something like that I just
thought it would be super easy and super
cute to just throw on really quick and
it's comfy but yeah that's cute at the
same time so it has the zipper it has a
little hood and yeah I thought that was
too cute so can't wait to wear that and
another thing I recently picked up from
them was this adorable maxi skirt I love
like the sunflower print on it and its
sheer at the bottom but it does have a
cabbage skirt underneath it so it will
cover your butt it's not completely
see-through but it gets right below your
knees become seat there so I love it it
has a zipper on the back so it fits nice
and snug and it also has little belt
loops if you do want to wear a belt with
it so as of right now those are probably
my top 5 favorite online shops I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I will try
to find everything I bought on the
websites if it is still available and I
will link it either below or on my blog
so definitely check out the description
box for all of that info and don't
forget to leave me suggestions on what
you guys want to see next I hope you
guys enjoyed and I love you all so much
have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
