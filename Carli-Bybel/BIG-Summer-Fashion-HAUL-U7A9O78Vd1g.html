been quite some time since I have done a
fashion haul or any type of haul for
that matter and I've seen a lot of
people requesting it
I do actually look through all the
comments and I love hearing your
suggestions so don't think that when I
ask you guys for your suggestions I'm
not actually going through them looking
through to get ideas so thank you to all
of you guys who suggested me doing
something with fashion or a fashion haul
I'm sure you guys already know how much
I love fashion and I do go shopping all
the time but recently I picked up a
bunch of new things for summer and I
wanted to share them with you because
sometimes it'll take me a little bit of
time to wear something that I just
bought and by the time I get it up on my
blog it's sold out which is annoying so
I wanted to show you guys some of the
things that I picked out recently and I
hope most of them are still available on
the website I will be listing where I
got every single thing on my blog along
with direct links and all that good
stuff so you don't have to waste your
time looking for it so if you want to
see some of the items that I picked out
please keep watching so first I wanted
to share with you two purses that I
picked up they are both from ASOS and
they are beautiful this is the first one
and the beading of this is just so
amazing I love the pastel colors this is
pretty similar or the same idea as the
floral clutch that I had done in a blog
post
they keep restocking that it keeps going
in and out of stock so for those of you
who were still interested in it
I will check if it's back in stock but I
do notice that it keeps popping back up
this one is gorgeous though I just got
it in the mail and I really really love
this I cannot wait to pair it with an
outfit and the other one is also from
ASOS and it is a cute gold little purse
with a little fringe at the bottom I
love the details of this I actually have
a similar gold purse which I showed in
my July 4th video but this one is still
available I hope and I just love the
details it is pretty fancy but I just
love the tassel and I love how it's
sparkly and pretty so those are the two
purses that I recently picked up so I
have so many bathing suits I actually
had to take them all out of my draw and
I started stuffing them in purses
because I didn't really
for them anymore but I love swimwear
this one I actually just got it's a
white crochet bathing suit it's a
one-piece you can kind of that's the top
it's kind of hard to tell but I actually
have this in red and hot pink I know why
do I need it in white too but I don't
know I just love how it fits I like that
it's a one-piece it's very sexy I wore
the red one or the pink one
when me and Brett went away for
Valentine's Day so I will link that
picture or I'll post the picture so you
guys can see what it looks like on but
for the doll swimwear website I do have
a 10% off code which is awesome
I loved all swimmer because everything
on the site is very affordable as
opposed to some of the other sites that
have very very high priced bikinis I did
pick up one that was a little bit more
pricey from the orchard boutique this is
the bottom has a tribal print the back
is like a gold shiny back and these
scrunch buds I'm sure you guys have seen
everywhere these are perfect for people
with smaller butts or for people who
always get that saggy butt look I don't
know I just have a guess a weird shape
but that whenever I would buy normal
bikinis the butts would sag and I'd go
in the water and I just look at a diaper
on so I came across the scrunch butts
forever dull swimmer was actually I
think the first to do it now you could
find them everywhere but the top is
really what sold me on this one it's
fringes let me try and fix this for you
so this is the top just makes you want
to like shimmy I don't know I love this
I thought it was so pretty and I love
how it's like a shiny metallic gold so I
think together it's just such a cute
bikini I had to pick it up this one is a
little bit more pricey because it's a
designer but I really love it it fits
really nice and it has the padding in it
to make your boobies look really really
nice oh also speaking of making the
boobies look nice um yesterday when I
posted my beach slash um pool video I
just want to let you guys know I picked
up these new a bathing suit headings and
they have like an extra like padding at
the bottom so it helps lift up your
boobies
no I did not get a boob job for those of
you guys wondering I actually gained
like six almost seven pounds which I
know a lot of people are good you need
it too but I don't know I guess the only
positive thing about gaining some weight
is that your boobs grow but these really
do help they help lift them up and give
them some nice shape so I got these I
got these off of Amazon I will link
these for anyone interested as well also
um I saw a lot of people requesting some
sort of bra video or something like that
and I don't know if that would be
appropriate to post so I guess comment
below let me know if you want me to just
do a video talking about I guess some of
the bras that I use how I get my boobs
to stay nice and perky because I have I
guess a couple techniques that I do that
I guess really work because people think
I got a boob job
so okay moving on I wanted to mention a
couple of these little headbands because
if you guys notice I've been wearing
them in a lot of the beginnings of my
videos I hate clipping back my hair to
do my makeup because pieces always fall
down and I don't know it's just annoying
it could ruin the way I wanted to do my
hair so I love these little headbands
that you can wear just to hold back your
hair plus they're super cute and I don't
know I feel like a little girl when I
wear them but I love them I got a black
one which I've worn a bunch with a
little bow I have this white one I think
I may have worn this in a video as well
I love this because it's like a crochet
material I think these are perfect for
the summer if you want your hair out of
your face they're really cute it's a
really cute way to accessorize and also
get your hair off of your face I picked
up another one these ones came in like a
two pack I don't know if this was the
two pack I believe there was a white one
I don't know where it is I wore it
yesterday I think but they're all just
the same cute little headbands but I'm
loving these and they're all from ASOS
so I will link them as well but I think
it's a really cute new way to just kind
of get your hair up your face and yeah
that's I guess oh I got these new shorts
they're one teaspoon and these are sold
out everywhere like when I tell you
every website has them sold out I was so
upset because I've seen them sorry I've
seen
them everywhere and I've wanted them for
a while but they didn't have my size so
I went on Amazon and I just typed it in
and lo and behold got them in my hands
they had every size so hopefully they
still have some more on Amazon for you
guys they are a little bit more pricey
but they fit really nicely and they look
good with my short legs so there's this
new website that I've actually known
about for a while but I don't know I
wasn't really placing any orders on it
but recently they have had some really
cute stuff I've never mentioned it in a
video I did mention their site on my
last two blog post but the websites
called dish the first thing that I
ordered were these green shorts they're
high waste they're tailored I don't know
something about them screams The Little
Mermaid I want to wear these with like a
light purple top and just totally bring
out my inner mermaid I don't know I just
saw these and I was like yes I need
these in my life so I have yet to wear
them I can't wait to pair an outfit with
them but I love these another thing that
I picked out was this shirt that I've
literally been looking for everywhere I
saw a fashion blogger wearing it like
two years ago and I just figured you
know what they're never going to make
something like this again so I don't
know if this is the same designer or
maybe a knockoff of a designer but this
shirt is just everything it's white
long-sleeve lace the back has a zipper
down the whole back and the back is
longer than the front can you just see
this like this is just oh my god I can't
I'm absolutely obsessed with this I feel
like you could do summertime or winter
time with this I mean winter time most
people probably wouldn't wear white lace
in the winter time but hey you never
know
I just really love the details of this
it looks like it should be like 200
dollars but it was I think under 100 it
was like 60 bucks but I love that and
the third thing that I picked up was
this black netted top
it's baggy it has pretty like low sides
I thought this would be so cute with you
can either throw it over a bathing suit
I would probably wear like highway
shorts tuck it in and
then either like one of those black cami
bras or you can wear it on top of a
bathing suit like I said but I just love
like the whole mesh net is in everywhere
this year so I'm really a big fan of
this one and the last thing that I got
in that order was this black leather
skirt um yeah you would probably think
black leather skirt fall winter time
which I will definitely be using it in
that time too but you can wear a leather
skirt in the summertime I actually wore
one I remember last summer when I went
out one night I wore a black leather
skirt and I paired it with a white
t-shirt that was kind of off the
shoulder is a very just basic t-shirt I
wore my black buckle Gucci shoes and
then I wore a lot of gold jewelry along
necklace lots of cuffs on my arms and it
really was a really cute look and it's
fine for summertime I think if you're
gonna wear leather you just have to
dress it down a bit make it not too
winter slash fall looking and I think
you can get away with it but this skirt
is adorable and I actually really love
how it fits another one of my favorite
stores right now is misguided which it's
been misguided for ever now but I bought
a few things recently that I wanted to
just share with you guys I actually got
this yesterday in the mail I picked up
this um tan
it's called taupe I think colored scuba
skirt and this is similar to the pinkish
nude one that I wore in my blog post I
think was called like tassels in lace or
something along those lines but I really
love how it fits it's very form-fitting
I would wear this with a crop top and it
looks just really really cute and classy
and well put together nice length so it
goes down to your knees it's nothing too
short but yeah I just love this color I
thought it would be really cute with you
can really do any color crop top that's
the beauty of it I'd probably wear it
with a white crop top maybe even if I
had one the same color would be cool can
even do like a pink color and then the
next pair of heels I think that's a
perfect outfit for nighttime for the
summer of course I picked up this romper
I honestly off the top of my head I
don't remember if this is from dish or
misguided I will find it for you guys
because I just got it as well but
everything was like in a pile that I
didn't put away yet so this might
actually be from dish
again I'll check for you guys but it's
this adorable adorable lace play suit it
has the lace hi front ties around the
back and it has a low open back and then
it's just a short so I'm obsessed with
rompers for the summertime not only
because they're just so easy to throw on
but sometimes it's hard trying to put
together an outfit like the top and the
bottom so and I'm just like okay I'm not
in the mood to search through everything
and pick out an outfit I'll just go and
grab a romper throwing a pair of heels
grab a matching clutch and then good to
go
so this I just love the print and I
loved how it was a high-neck I have a
shirt pretty similar to it so I knew
that when I got it I would love it as
much as it looked on the website and the
last thing that I got from misguided was
this skirt and it's like long and it's
all these pretty plants on it I actually
got the matching crop top but it didn't
come in this order so I'm assuming that
it's going to just come separately but
it has a cute little matching crop set a
crop set crop top I love matching
separates they are everything whenever I
see something that's a matching separate
sometimes I'll just buy it and then I'll
get it and I'm like why did I buy that
why because it's a matching separate I
don't even like the prints of it but in
this case I really love the print I
think this with a pair of white sandals
a nice tan going out to dinner going out
to a club whatever you're doing I think
it would be such a cute outfit I really
envisioned myself on vacation wearing
this outfit but since it's summertime
it's basically vacation and the last
thing from misguided that I got was this
adorable two-piece suit it is velour so
I mean I guess you can really do this in
the summer or fall time with maybe a
jacket but it has like like the velvet
not the war velvet I guess the Lauren
Bell that are basic no felt it felt it
well but yeah they're the shorts and
then it comes with a cute matching crop
top I believe they have the same outfit
in mint as well so I will link both of
them for you guys and next two items I
got from beginning boutique I am
obsessed with Australian fashion like I
don't know why I don't live there I am
dying to come over there because I know
if I came I would go shopping and buy
every single thing
the stores because they don't make it
like this in America everything is so
nice and fitting if I buy something I
know it's gonna fit me right it's not
just gonna be baggy on me so that is one
of the main reasons why I love shopping
in shelleyan boutiques
this is a cute little jean skirt it's
high-waist it's a very old school I feel
like people probably wore something like
this in the 90s but I absolutely love it
I think this with a cute crop top would
be great I ordered this black crop top
to go with it it's a net it's like a
knitted crop top I just love these
knitted crop tops as well I thought it'd
be a really cute outfit I'm Polly ends
up wearing it in a blog post eventually
but I don't know jeans skirts are kind
of cool I don't know it's like stretchy
I just thought it would be really really
cute and it shows your curves so I have
two more things to show you guys I
recently got these new sandals from ASOS
they tie up the ankle this is like a
metallic rose gold I wore these recently
when I had my or Brett's cousin's
graduation party I wore a gray dress
which I posted a picture but you
couldn't see the full outfit a gray
dress and then I wore these and they
laced up and I just loved how it looked
so wearing these not only were they so
comfy and so cute after that night I was
like you know what I'm gonna go see if
they have them in another color they had
them in the tan color I love love love
these they come with them like tied up
so it's easier to store but they tie
right up your ankles so they're very
like gladiator Greek goddess type
looking sandals again I will be linking
everything um oh one more thing I got to
show you and then I'm done because I'm
they're staring at me okay so really now
the last thing I'm going to show you are
these awesome green heels I think they
were like 30 bucks which is just such a
steal these are from go Jane and I just
love the color of them I love the
details as well they're super cute and
my mom was actually just over and she
grabbed them she's like I wanna borrow
these like mom they were 30 bucks and
they're not your size so go buy them I
love affordable shoes I have a few
designer pairs that I plan on selling
because half of them I haven't even worn
like the Louboutins I wish that were
comfy but they're not so
yeah I mean I guess that's really it as
far as my new purchases I hope you guys
enjoyed this haul I wanted to put some
more variety on my channel I will be
doing more color series don't worry I
just didn't want to make it only color
series because we don't want to get
bored here so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video again remember to check out
my blog because I will be linking every
single thing that I got and if for
whatever reason it's not in stock from
one week ago I will list similar
alternatives as usual so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and until next time
I'll see you guys later yeah I love it
as much as it looked on the website so
funny I just ramble sometimes and hmm I
just love matching separates so weird
