today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here this
is the makeup look that i wore for my
birthday we went out and celebrated on
October 20th and I saw a lot of people
requesting a makeup look so I wanted to
share that with you guys today when I
went out to dinner for my birthday with
my family I also did a really really
similar look I just did like less
dramatic eyelashes but I feel like the
lashes like really made it kind of pop
and I added of course a little bit of
sparkle so if you guys want to see how I
have this makeup look right here please
keep watching to start off this look I
am using the first shade in my Carli
bybel palette and I'm just applying that
on the inner half of my eye I like
applying the shade first because it
really brightens up my eyelid and it
helps really accentuate my nose contour
so after that I'm picking up the second
shade in the first row which is one of
my favorites the light pink one and I'm
applying that all over my eyelid
I'm picking up a little bit of the
second highlight shade also from my
palette and I'm applying that right over
it just to give it a little extra
shimmer with a large blending brush I'm
picking up the third shade from my
palette and I'm applying that right into
my crease with a smaller blending brush
and the darkest plum shade I'm then
applying that on the outer V of my eye
and then I am picking up the fourth
shadow in the first row and I'm applying
that in between the darker plum and the
lighter Bob color for liner I'm using
the tortise liner I made it a little
thicker than I had wanted to I feel like
I couldn't get my liner to look good
today so don't mind the liner it's not
perfect but you know what it works
especially with the crazy lashes I'm
about to put on you don't even see the
liner that much you guys are just seeing
it's super F close so with a smaller
pencil brush I'm picking up the dark
plum color and I am just darkening up
the outer V I always like to do like a
lighter rough-draft first and then once
I get my liner on I'll go in and I'll
darken up all of the colors I'm picking
up the middle orange shade with a large
blending brush and I'm just applying
that right over the purples I really
like how the orange and the purples look
together it's just something I've been
doing a lot lately and then I'm also
picking up the black shade from the
bronze palette as well and I'm applying
that right over the darker plum just to
accentuate the crease a bit and then
from my lower lash line I'm using the
top three right shadows from my palette
just in like an ombre effect from the
lightest to the darkest for mascara I'm
using this one by Tarte and since it was
my birthday obviously I had a little bit
of sparkle like you can't not have
sparkles on your birthday in my opinion
so I'm just applying a little bit of
this OCC glitter onto my eyelids just a
little bit I'm just dipping my brush
into my setting spray and then I'm
applying it that way it sticks to my
eyelids and doesn't end up all over my
face I mean sometimes there's some
stragglers but that's the risk we're
gonna have to take if you're using
glitter so to bronze up my face I'm
using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette and it looks a little bit
blotchy right now but I'll show you guys
how I smooth it all out in the end so I
did my face makeup before this video but
I just want to let you guys know my face
routine is exactly the same from my last
get ready with me video so I will link
that right here for you guys if you guys
want to go see my full face routine I
will also be posting another fall makeup
look really soon and I'll do another
full face updates I know a lot of you
guys like that so to highlight my nose
I'm using the second
Oh shade from my palette as well and I'm
also highlighting on my Cupid's bow and
then underneath my nose I know you guys
don't like it but I like it so for blush
I'm using the BH nude blush palette this
pink shade is my favorite I'm almost out
of it it's like the only color that I've
been using but it's just like the
perfect light pink shade so I'm just
applying that on my cheeks to give my
face some color to line my lips I'm
using candy kay liner and I'm also
filling in my lips with this color and
for lipstick I'm using the shade posh by
Mello cosmetics I do have a coupon code
I haven't worn lipsticks in a while I
was always wearing matte lipsticks and I
just kind of missed the creaminess of a
lipstick so this is what I ended up
wearing for my birthday on my lips but
as you can see from the powder and blush
and everything like that my face looks a
little bit blotchy so I'm just going in
with my Kat Von D foundation powder and
I'm just doing circular motions and I'm
just kind of like buffing everything
together and it's just make it look a
lot more neat which is always good and
then to finish off this look I'm using
the lavender setting spray by gerard
cosmetics I also have a coat for you
guys which I will list below
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and until next time
I'll see you guys later
