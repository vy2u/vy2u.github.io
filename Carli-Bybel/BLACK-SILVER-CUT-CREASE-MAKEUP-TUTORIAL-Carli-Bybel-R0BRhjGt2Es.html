I've had people at my house super noisy
I apologize so I figured I would just
film a makeup look today and then do a
voiceover I got some highlights in my
hair do you guys like it what do you
think let me know down below should I
keep it so to start off this look I am
using this color pop white eyeliner I
just wanted to use this as a base for
the white eyeshadow that way it just
comes out more pigmented I'm then
blending that in with an eyeshadow brush
so as I was saying there's been people
here literally every single day since
we've been back from LA working on my
closet so it's been crazy I'm using the
Urban Lux palette it's only $10 from BH
and I am using the white shade and I'm
applying that basically on the inner
half of my eyelid then I'm picking up
this darker silver shade and I'm
applying that on the outer half and I'm
going to slowly blend it in to like the
middle I'm then picking up a medium
colored silver I say and I'm applying
that in between the white and the darker
silver and it's gonna give it a really
pretty faded look I like to dip my
brushes in some sort of liquid to make
the pigment stand out and I do this with
every single eyeshadow palette that I
own I'm just using my settings by for
this one but then I'm picking up the
black shade in this palette and I'm
applying that on the outer V of my eye
I'm very lightly dragging that into the
crease and by very lightly I mean just a
little bit then I'm picking up this
peachy color and then I'm just blending
that on the inner part of my crease
so then I'm going in with eyeliner this
one's bites heart my other one was
drying up so I figured I'd go in with
this one today
I am then going back in with the black
eyeshadow and I am just drawing out the
outer V and connecting it to the point
of my wings liner and then I'm just
dragging that in very lightly going in
with a clean blending brush and just
blending that up into my crease a little
bit for this look we want to keep it
pretty pointy on the end so we don't
want it too smoky in the crease so just
do this again very lightly with a clean
brush and you will get the look that
you're going for
next I'm going in with this silver gel
liner it's only six dollars by the way
which is amazing and I'm just lining
right in my crease so you want to keep
this line thin and just basically right
above where your crease is that way it
doesn't smudge so I kind of screwed this
eye up it wasn't even so I just wiped it
off a little bit and I drew it where I
wanted it and then I went back in with
my liner and my dark shadow because it's
always hard getting them even doing the
first eye is always great but then when
you want it exactly even it's a little
bit harder especially on camera so
that's why I did that but now I'm just
going back in with a smaller brush and
all of those shades that I just
previously used and I'm just darkening
up the shadows the reason I'm using a
very precise brush is to make the look
look a lot sharper from further away for
lashes I'm using these ones in the style
Wood winked I don't remember the brand
but I will list it below for you guys
then I'm taking that same dark silver
shade and I'm applying that on my lower
lash line to bronze up my face I'm using
my favorite Kat Von D shade and light
palette and I'm just applying this all
over my face before this tutorial
started I did apply some self-tanner I
do have a little bit of a tan still from
Florida and just from being outside but
it is the self-tanner that I mentioned
previously I will list it below for you
guys for lip liner I'm using the color
brink from colour-pop and I'm just
lining my lips and for lipstick today
I'm using the color baked by amra it's
her new shade from her liquid lipstick
collection I absolutely love the shade
I've worn it probably like five times
the past two weeks and I love how they
go on they're very creamy unlike some of
them that are more runny and liquidy and
then they dry matte so I love the
consistency of this one and then to
highlight I'm just using the light pink
eyeshadow shade from my palette it's
just one of my favorites to highlight
with so I noticed it was a quick
tutorial but if anyone wants a full face
routine I just posted one with my
current full-face foundation routine it
doesn't change that often but I promise
my next makeup look I will do a full
face and then to set everything I'm
using this clean of Hungary mist so it's
really weird not doing an intro and
outro today for you guys but as I said
in the beginning we've had people here
working and it's just been super noisy
but I wanted to get something up for you
guys I hope you enjoyed this dramatic
makeup look I love you so much
and it's on
time I will see you guys later so if you
want body and you want them to look
fluffy and big pin your curls all right
so it is 350 we have to leave in 10
minutes I'm going to try to get a quick
picture before we go on my outfit so you
can see the full outfit and I'm going to
take you guys along with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
