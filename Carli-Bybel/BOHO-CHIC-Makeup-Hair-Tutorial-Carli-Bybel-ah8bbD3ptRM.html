today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this boho inspired hair and makeup
look so the hair is a little bit hard to
see because my hair so dark but I have a
little fishtail braid on this side and
then a cool little braid under here if
you guys have highlights or like blonde
hair I feel like this hairstyle will
look sick on you guys but I still love
how came out and I would definitely be
wearing my hair like this for the spring
and the summer I love big beachy waves
that I love like a texture messy look so
since goshala was last weekend and this
weekend I felt a little bit of the boho
inspiration although I'm all the way on
the East Coast but if you guys want to
learn how I got this hair and makeup
look please keep watching to start off
this look I'm using the Too Faced bon
bon palette I'm using the color divinity
and I'm applying that on the inner half
of my eyelid
next up I'm grabbing the color malted
and I'm applying that on the outer third
of my eye I'm keeping the darkest part
really in the outer V and then I'm gonna
slowly just blend that in towards the
cream color we want to keep all the
darkest shades just on the outer V for
this look that way we can create a lot
of dimension don't go crazy with this
brush and the blending I'm going to go
in with a blending brush in a little bit
and just kind of smooth out the edges
that way there's no sharp lines or
anything like that this brush is just
going to help apply the shadow in the
right areas so once you've done that on
both eyes you're going to go in with
your blending brush you can pick a
little bit more of that same shadow up
and then just start blending around all
of the sharp lines we're going to
continue to add a couple more colors to
the crease so again you don't need to go
crazy crazy with the blending right here
and a little bit we're gonna pick up a
larger blending brush and it's gonna
help Len everything together nicely next
I'm picking up the color Bordeaux and
I'm putting that right over the brown
color I wanted the crease to have like a
plum shade in it as well
so I started with this one and then I
realized that I wanted something a
little bit more purple so after I
applied this I'm actually going in with
the darkest plum shade from my Carli
bybel palette just to kind of add a
little bit more pigment and more of that
purple color that I was going for so I'm
applying that over the Bordeaux shade
and then I'm just going to keep blending
until it looks nice
grabbing a little bit more of that dark
plum shade with my pencil brush I'm
applying this on my lower lash line but
it's look I'm going to do a pretty wide
lower lash line I'm going to apply a
couple different shades I actually
really love how it came out I think it
looks really smoky and really nice so
first I'm just going in with that purple
and I'm gonna have a thicker towards the
end and then a little bit thinner as you
get towards the other end of your eye
so then I'm just grabbing a blending
brush and I'm just gonna blend that
workout that I did that way it's gonna
make it look a little bit thicker but
it's not going to make it look too too
dark
you're going to want to blend the lower
lash line in with the crease just to
give it a nice finished look
and then going in with my larger
blending brush this has nothing on it
and I'm just going to blend it up
towards my eyebrow
to line my upper lash line I'm using
this dark plum eyeliner by colour-pop
it's called best eyeliner and normally I
like to use a liquid liner but I wanted
to use a pencil today so I can kind of
smudge it and make it look a little bit
more smudge because I feel like no boa
look is complete without like a smudge
messy liner look
I'm using my pencil brush just to smudge
out the end as I had just talked about
you can really use like a q-tip or
anything if you don't have this type of
brush but I'm also applying this shade
right in my lower lash line if you guys
want to use black in place of it you
could do that as well I just kind of
wanted to try something different for
today's look and then for lashes I'm
using these wispy ones by our Dale and I
applied I don't know the exact number on
the edges of them but I will list it
below for you guys for mascara I'm using
this one by Tarte I have like the little
mini sample version of it I like this
one because it doesn't leave your lashes
too too clumpy so I mean it gives you
that option if you don't want them to
clumpy but again still I'm in the
process of finding a new favorite
mascara so you guys know if I ever find
one that is my new absolute favorite so
I don't want you thinking every makeup
look that I do you have to buy every
single product I'm using I'm still in
the process of finding new favorites
with this whole cruelty free thing so
again I will keep you guys posted when I
find like an amazing amazing product I
like my tear ducts and underneath my
brows I'm using this light pink shade
from my Carli bybel palette
and then next I'm going in with the
Anastasio single shadow in the color
caramel I'm applying this underneath the
purple just to give it a little bit more
depth and dimension under my eyes
so bronze up my face I'm using the Kat
Von D shade and light palette as you can
see mines basically empty I need to buy
a new one
this has been my favorite for a while
I'm grabbing that same shade that I
highlighted with and I'm highlighting my
nose I'm also highlighting under my nose
and on my Cupid's bow
for blush I'm going in with this nude
blush palette by BH it's only $10 I am
using this like mob shade and you only
need a little bit it's very pigmented so
I'm just applying a little bit and then
doing circular motions to really blend
it in nicely then over that I'm using
the Kat Von D foundation just to blend
in the contour and the blush that way
nothing looks too harsh and it looks
more natural
for lipliner I am using the color dopey
by colour-pop it's only five dollars
which is amazing and I knew I wanted to
use one of the new honest Asya liquid
lipsticks so I decided to choose the
color catnip and this lip liner just
much perfectly whenever I like to apply
liquid lipsticks I always like to do a
liner first that way when you're using a
darker color you have lines to color in
because I've noticed sometimes if you
don't use a liner you can get the liquid
lipstick a little too far out of your
lips and I feel like with the Reds and
the darker Pink's like this it's just it
always stains your skin and it never
looks as good so just a little tip
and then to finish off the look i am
using the gerard cosmetics lavender
finishing spray
moving on to hair the first thing that
you want to do is put some big loose
leaves so what I've been doing lately is
I just put my hair down the middle and I
push it all to the front and then I just
start grabbing random pieces and today
I'm using the Nicole guerreiro gold wand
I believe this is the one-inch wand and
I'm just doing random pieces all
throughout my hair if you guys want more
thickness or more length to your hair
you can always add a pair of clip-in
extensions I'm not wearing any but the
ones that I do recommend are also by
Bellamy I have a coupon code for anyone
interested so again I'm just grabbing
random sections small and some large and
I'm just curling my hair
you guys have seen me curl my hair a
million times so I'm gonna speed this
all up but my only tip is just touch the
hair while it's on the wand and when you
feel the heat coming through that's when
you know it's done
Oh
so once I finished this side I'm using
the mai tai spritzer sea salt spray and
I'm just applying this all throughout my
hair then I'm using the triple sec three
and one this just gives your hair some
nice texture without it feeling too
sticky or too hard so I'm just doing
that and then I'm going to repeat the
same thing on the other side so once
you're all finished you can just spray a
little bit more of the sea salt spray a
little bit more of the texture spray and
until you like how it looks I'm not
using any hairspray for this look
because I like it more soft and beachy
looking
so I'm gonna add a fishtail braid to the
left side of my hair so I'm just taking
like a medium-sized section and I'm
going to start fishtail braiding for
anyone who doesn't know how to fishtail
I'm going to leave this in regular time
that way I can maybe teach you if you
haven't learned before so all you're
going to want to do is section your hair
into two pieces
the section closest to my head going to
call section one and then the back piece
I'm going to call section two so I'm
taking a little piece from section two
and crossing it over to section one and
then I'm grabbing a piece from section
one crossing it over and putting it in
with section two
and you're just going to continue this
over and over again it's just back and
forth crisscross so it's actually really
easy it's just a little bit more
time-consuming so again you're just
going to take one piece from section one
cross it over and put it into section
two take a piece from section two cross
it and put it into section one so again
just take your time with this and at
first you're going to be like I feel
like this is doing nothing but after you
do it a couple times you'll see the
fishtail braid really start to come
together
so when I'm doing the fishtail braid I
always like to do it a little tighter
and then I will eventually pull it all
apart I'm using like a little black
elastic that I got from the drug store
to secure it in place
and I'm just going to start pulling
apart the braid I want this to look
super messy so I'm just going to keep
playing with it until it's as wide as I
want and until it's messy as I want so
I'm just gonna leave it like that for
now but I'm gonna keep pulling it apart
throughout this video you'll see so on
the other side of my hair I'm gonna
section off the top part put it to the
other side and then I'm gonna do a
little braid underneath that section
that way it kind of peeks through when I
have my hair down like I said in the
intro if you guys have highlights or if
you have lighter hair this hairstyle
will look really cool since my hair is
kind of all one color and it's a little
bit dark you can't really see the braids
as well especially on camera with these
lights but I'm just doing a regular
braid on this side I'm doing this one a
little bit looser and then I'm going to
do the same thing once I get to the
bottom I'm going to secure it with an
elastic I'm going to slowly pull out
little pieces of it to make it wider and
to make it more prominent so it sticks
out when my hair goes back on top of it
so it's really all about preference if
you guys want this to be a tight braid
you can do that and maybe add a couple
more or you can just keep pulling it out
and make it look a lot wider than it
really is
so I love pulling out my braids I think
it makes it look so much cooler
you
you
so I have these little flyaways that I
strained and they're super annoying and
of course standing straight out so I'm
just actually using my Anastasia brow
gel and this is like the brown one
usually I'll use a clear brow gel but I
couldn't find it but I'm just applying a
little bit and it just makes your
flyaway stay down which is nice so just
a little trick if any of you guys have a
clear brow gel or even like a brown one
if it matches your hair try it out and
it's like gel on the go
so now that I've pulled out the braid a
little bit more I love how this hair
looks so I'm just going to apply a
little bit more of that sea salt spray
and that is it
so this is the final result I hope you
