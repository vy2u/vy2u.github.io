today's video I'm going to show you how
I got these little braided buns right
here so I wanted to try a new hairstyle
outside I'm also filming my spring
fashion haul and I figured I would film
myself doing this hairstyle and if I
liked it I would post it if I didn't
then I wouldn't but I actually really
like how it turned out I think it's so
cute it literally makes me feel like a
Spice Girl
I wore this hairstyle when I was like in
first grade when I was scary spikes for
Halloween
pull pictures right here so you can see
that so if you guys wanna learn how I
got this hairstyle right here please
keep watching so this is the first time
that I'm trying out this hairstyle I
don't know if I'm even going to like it
but I figured I would try something new
so I'm just going to be parting my hair
with a comb I never like to do like dead
center parts I always do it like a
little bit off just because I tell you
because I have a bigger forehead somehow
it looks better could all be in my head
but you want to get a straight line and
then we're going to pull it down to the
front
I like holding up where the hair is
going to be that way you can see like
where the back hair is in LA so I'm
going to twist this to the front and
then do the same thing on the other side
so I'm just going to clip the rest of
the hair back that way I don't get
anything in the front and I'm going to
smooth this into a ponytail so I have
this little brush here I was into spray
before I put anything into a ponytail
that way I can make sure it's perfect
because I didn't have any use like extra
body and if they're not needed
and then I repeat the same thing to the
other side
you just want to make sure that your
pigtails are even
I'm using this texture spray to add some
texture into this part of my hair
because it's a pretty small piece and
then I'm going to braid
and then I'm just pulling apart the
braid not putting an elastic on it took
a it's messy
and then just wrap it around another
hair tie
so now I have a bobby pin I'm just going
to secure the bun so it's not flopping
all over the place one in the back and
then one on the front I feel like the
key is to make these look messy could be
wrong but work at it I did this
hairstyle when I was um
Scary Spice for Halloween I'm going to
see if I can find the picture and I'll
link it for you guys but I definitely do
this hairstyle before I forgot cute and
now we're on our feet on the other side
wrap it around and then secure with an
elastic
I couldn't probably use the smaller
elastics I have like really small black
ones but I was sure they were going to
be big enough so
putting a little hairspray on this
little brush I'm just going to come down
my baby hairs a little bit
so when I curl my hair like I just
parked down the middle and bring it all
to the front I want to do something
different with my hair like color wise I
don't know what I want to do I think I
want to get some like highlights or
something that brings I've had the same
hair forever
so for this look I'm using the cold
narrow one from her kit by Bellamy I'm
using the half inch head I'm just gonna
do curls all around my hair you guys
have seen me cry my hair million times
but I figured for those of you who
haven't and you want to see it I'll
leave this part in but I wanted to just
kind of fill you in on what's been going
on with my kitties I know that I'm
hosting that I've had some issues and I
was up with that and all the stuff so
what happened was last week bear had
thrown up it was like Monday night I
noticed it was a little larger but
nothing out of the ordinary because
these cats sleep so much regardless so
the next morning we woke up and bear was
limping he wouldn't put any weight on
his front left paw so I was like all
right that's it obviously now I pulled
the bet so we took him to the vet and
they did an x-ray and they did to check
up and everything and they couldn't
figure out what was wrong with him so
they gave him an antibiotic and
anti-inflammatory and so that should be
better put in like 24 to 48 hours so the
next day we woke up and his paw was
doubled in size literally it was huge so
I called the vet again and they really
go of course so we brought him back in
they took some blood work and they gave
him a steroid and another antibiotic so
again that said this should help it
should be getting better if you don't
see any improvements then take him to
the emergency room so we waited a whole
other day and then by Friday he was not
getting any better with whoever so we
took him over to the emergency room we
were there like five hours and they did
all kinds of tests and they just didn't
know what was wrong with him
he was very dehydrated and everything
cuz he wasn't eating so they decided to
keep him overnight in the emergency room
which was so sad I hated leaving him but
we just wanted to figure out what was
actually going on the weirdest part
about the whole thing which I forgot to
mention is that he had fever he had 105
fever the entire time so normally if you
hurt your leg that was saying like if
the cat dart it's like it shouldn't have
a fever as well so there was like some
sort of virus or some sort of something
going on that they just didn't know
about so I'm just going to put a little
more of this texture spray just to get
some texture
I actually really feeling this hairstyle
so anyway the next morning we call and
they said that the fever broke so if you
come pick them up so we got only
wouldn't screw my poor little baby there
she was whole egg to see if there was
any like bites or anything like that
and so now here's one shaped leg and
then
the other leg shades we have the idea in
people's butchered and of course on
Tuesday we have the appointment to get
them neutered and spayed the reason
obviously that we're doing this because
they're a real brother and sister and I
do not need incest babies plus they say
that your cats last a lot longer when
you do get them neutered and spayed so
we had their appointment and they're
almost eight months so it was like long
overdue we had to get it done ASAP and
of course I cancel bears appointment
because I don't want him to go through
hell all over again because he had just
been through so much so we had rings
Sydney on Tuesday so we had they're
still recovering and when we got Cindy
home she was a mess and she kept trying
to lick her wound which they said if she
tries to do they gotta put a cone on her
and so we got our home and of course the
first thing she started doing was
licking it so Brett ran out to go get
our cone and I made her like a little
paper plate cone temporarily definitely
like that better than the actual cone
she would not keep it on luckily they're
both feeling better day by day so that's
good but it was definitely an experience
that's for sure we have a little onesie
on Cindy I'll go grab them for this
video to show you how cute they look but
yeah so the onesie is a great idea any
of you guys are going to hear your cat
your cat spayed you can get them a baby
onesie arms like three dollars from
Walmart and they're
a tutorial that I lastly you could just
cut a little hole in it and it's perfect
and can't even go to the bathroom and
you do everything with it and she can't
reach her loom so she hasn't looked it
at all so I was literally like following
her around like a crazy person making
sure she wouldn't lick it and now I can
finally relax and she's been good the
past two days so yeah so yeah that has
been my little shenanigans with the
kiddies this whole week so I apologize
that I haven't got a video up sooner
yesterday I actually filmed the full
face makeup look and I could notice that
you guys were saying like can you do a
more cooler tone look like you're always
been warm tones and bronzy tones and I
know I always do tones like that because
I just feel like with my skin tone
everything looks better so I decided to
film like a cooler tone I use the grays
and blues and not blue it's just mostly
like Gray's in black and it was really
dramatic and I just did not like how it
looked but it's been an over an hour
filling and
and result I was just like I don't like
it like I look I don't know they're
gonna like it so I have on the footage I
don't want me to post it seriously when
I was little all I wanted to be was a
spice girl I had a spice girl party not
even kidding where I had everyone come
dressed up as a Spice Girl I'm just
gonna like tease right here a little bit
to give it some more texture more body
so this is the final result I am very
pleased with how it came out I think
it's super cute it's definitely not
something that I would do on a daily
basis but I think it's a really cute
alternative when you want to switch up
your pair and try something new I
personally didn't think I would like it
whatsoever so if you feel the same way
try not be people like it you never know
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and until
next time I'll see you guys later
with tits
I call you welcome your truth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
