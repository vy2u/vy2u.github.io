today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this dramatic makeup look right
here originally I wanted to do something
like bright and dramatic for spring but
I've been dying to use this lip color in
a tutorial ever since i swatched it in
my previous video so I decided to do a
dark brown shimmer / copper smokey eye
and then I paired it with this dark
brown lip and the best part about this
whole look is I did a full face routine
with all cruelty free products so I was
really pleasantly surprised that a lot
of my favorite brands were on the
cruelty free list so if you guys want to
learn how i got this makeup look please
keep watching to start off this look i
am priming my face with my NYX pore
filler i'm applying it in a downwards
motion all over my face I originally
wanted to film this video and do a talk
through and chat with you guys but since
that echo is unbearable for some of you
I figured doing a voice over was better
I did get a new mic and I've been
putting blankets down until I get my
couch and everything for that room so
they're with me for a foundation I'm
using the cover FX total cover creme
foundation I'm mixing n40 and g30 kind
of like in between those shades so when
I mix them that came out to be like a
perfect color this is my first time
using this foundation and I actually
really loved it it covers really nice to
blend in my foundation I'm using my
Sigma f80 brush I do have a 10% off code
which I will list below for you guys
Sigma uses synthetic hair for their
brushes and they're amazing so I just
wanted to point that out to blend it in
a little bit further I'm just using a
damp Beauty Blender I've been watching
my mom's cats for the whole weekend so
there's lots of fuzz in this one you
ever get like there was like clear
fuzzies and you feel it on your face and
you just don't know where it is and it's
the worst thing ever I feel like that
happens to me every single day now that
I have cats
next to contour my nose I am using the
la girl Pro conceal in the color toast
I'm applying this on the tip of my nose
to make it look shorter and then I'm
applying it down the sides of my nose I
always draw the lines closer together
than where my actual nose is and that
just makes it appear more narrow then
I'm just blending everything in with my
finger smudging it to make it look more
natural obviously right now it looks
silly but a little bit you'll see it'll
all come together nicely next I'm
applying concealer I'm using by Kat Von
D the Lockette concealer in light and I
am just applying this with my Beauty
Blender underneath my eyes and I'm
dragging it down in an upside-down
triangle
whatever concealer is left on my beauty
blender I am applying that on my eyelids
as well just because I have some
discoloration we want it all one color
I'm taking a little bit more of that
concealer with my finger and I'm
applying it right on the bridge of my
nose just to highlight it a little bit
and then I'm just blending it in with my
Beauty Blender
to set my under eyes I'm using the
Sunday Riley translucent powder in the
color light and I'm first blending out
my creases underneath my eyes with my
Beauty Blender and then I'm going in
with the powder with the Sigma brush and
I'm just applying a decent amount and I
like to do this because it really helps
prevent those wrinkles from forming
under my eyes so I'm just rubbing my
eyes to get whatever creases were on my
eyes as well and then whatever is left
on the brush I'm just going over that to
kind of set it so I don't get those eye
creases whenever I'm doing a full glam
look this is something that I always
like to do I am using the Kat Von D
foundation powder and I'm using this
small Sigma brush and I'm just patting
it under my eyes it just gets rid of any
darkness and it just really brightens up
your face which I absolutely love doing
yes it's a little bit extra and you
don't need to do this if you want
something a little lighter you can just
use your translucent powder and apply it
wherever you applied your concealer to
set my nose contour I'm using the Kat
Von D shade and light palette I'm using
the grey R tone and this smaller tapered
brush and I am just going right over
those lines and it's going to give it a
little bit more of like a cooler
undertone which is gonna make it look
more like a shadow which in turn will
make it look more real then going in
with brows I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow is to shape them and
then to fill them in I'm using the brow
bar to go by Gerard cosmetics I do have
a 35% off code for all of the products
on that site so again I will list all of
that below
four eyes I'm using the Anastasia single
shadow in the color fawn with this large
blending brush from Sigma and I'm just
blending that right into the crease of
my eye you only need a little bit these
shadows are super pigmented so just
start with a little bit and then you can
always work it in
next up I'm picking up the color Sienna
also by anastasiya and I'm using the
same brush and I'm just applying that
also in my crease just not as high as I
did the previous color this is gonna
give it a really pretty copper look so
like I said earlier I did plan on doing
something bright for spring but I don't
know I just wanted to do something like
with Browns and copper tones today so
that is how that ended up happening
next I'm grabbing the color millionaire
by colour-pop which is such a beautiful
color like do you see how sparkly this
is I just wet my brush a little bit with
the setting spray bar Gerard
just to give it a little bit more
pigment so it I'll have to use so much
and it's not going to fall out on my
eyes but I just absolutely love this
color it's so beautiful and it's only
five dollars which is just ridiculous if
you click on my link below I get you
guys a $5 off code so definitely go
check out their site because they have
some amazing products
the next chain I'm using is called
thirsty girl and it's also bicolor pop I
didn't realize until I was editing that
this color was a limited edition so they
no longer have it but you could just use
that one color and I think this look
would be perfect but this is just going
to add a little bit like a golden brown
on top of it just more shimmer more
sparkles but you can just double up on
that previous shout out and it'll look
just as good the next color I'm picking
up is fudge and I am using a smaller
blending brush and I'm applying this
right on the outer V of my eye we don't
want to bring this color up too high we
want to keep it just in the outer V
because it's gonna give a lot of
dimension to your eyes and just help
make your eyes look bigger as well and
again remember a little bit goes a long
way so just start with a little bit and
keep blending it and then adding color
as you go so just realize when I do my
voiceover I have to talk with my hands
otherwise I feel like too robotic so I'm
sitting here like flailing my hands
around
I'm just picking up that larger blending
brush I wiped it off beforehand to make
sure there was no product on it and then
I'm just blending everything out to make
sure it looks perfect for liner I'm
using by Kat Von D the ink liner in the
color Hemingway it's like a dark dark
brown and I figured since I was sticking
with the Browns today I always always
use black so I figured I would try a
nice brown liner and I actually really
really liked it it didn't look much
different but I do love how it came out
so for lashes I'm using by red cherry
the wispy lashes the WSP and then I have
to try a new mascara so I am switching
over to all cruelty free products
I've yet to try enough mascara to really
find a new favorite so I'm trying the
better than sex one by toothpaste I like
it I don't love it but again I'm gonna
have to try a bunch of these without any
lashes on to get my true opinion and
I'll let you guys know which is like my
favorite favorite cruelty free mascara
I'm going back in with Sienna and a
pencil brush and I'm applying this on my
lower lash line
and then I'm going in with the shade
henna and I'm applying that right in the
center to give it a little bit of
sparkle
then I'm grabbing my Carli bybel palette
because it's vegan and cruelty-free
which is amazing and I am picking up the
second highlight shade to highlight
underneath my brows and also in my tear
ducts just wanted to let you guys know
that there's only how many more days
left in April but this palette is going
to go up to 1450 on May 1st so I just
wanted to remind you guys again if you
didn't get it for the 1250 yet you have
a few more days or I think at least
another week until it goes up so make
sure you head over to BH right now I'll
link it below and make sure you got it
for 1250 because it's such a steal then
I'm going back in with my shade and
light palette and I'm bronzing up my
face
you
for blush I'm using one of my favorites
by NYX it's the baked blush in the color
wanderlust and it's a really pretty
peach color so I'm applying that with my
morphe blush brush this is literally my
favorite brush ever and it's so
affordable it's perfect for blush and
it's also perfect to just blend
everything in so I'm just picking out
Asian powder and I'm having circular
motions all over my face just to kind of
blend out any of the harsh lines and
just make it all flow really nicely then
I'm going back in with the highlighter
and I'm going down the bridge of my nose
and I'm also applying the little dot on
the tip of my nose I'm taking a little
bit of that highlight shade and I'm
applying it on my cheekbones I don't
know why but I haven't been loving extra
highlight on the cheeks I feel like it
makes my pores look bigger I don't know
maybe when I get a little bit of a tan
with the warmer weather I'll pull out
the highlighter but for now I'm just
gonna do a little bit right at the top
for lips I'm using true Brown K by Kylie
cosmetics ever since I did that swatch
video I absolutely loved how the Brown
looked which I was so surprised because
when I had seen it originally I was like
I don't think I would look good with
that nor do I think I would ever wear it
but I absolutely love it and I think
it's so beautiful and I know it screams
fall and winter but I mean you can
really wear it any time of the year
there's no restrictions with makeup
then I'm lining my inner lashline with
this dark brown color pop liner which is
also only five dollars and I'm applying
that in the lower lash line and then a
little bit right in the inner corners
just to make the lashes look more
natural and then to finish off this
whole makeup look I am using the Gerrard
setting spray and the lavender flavor it
smells delicious I'm absolutely obsessed
with it
so this is the final result it's super
dramatic but I absolutely loved how it
came out I am going out tonight so I'm
just going to leave my makeup like this
I may switch up the lip color because
it's a little bit more of a casual night
but we'll see make sure to comment below
and let me know what videos you guys
want to see next week whether you want
more makeup tutorials or spring fashion
haul which I think I'm going to do that
for sure next week and maybe I'll do a
try on haul included with it since I
