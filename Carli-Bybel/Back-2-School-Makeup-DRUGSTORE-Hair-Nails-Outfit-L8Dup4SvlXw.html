you do what you do everything that don't

this morning
put aside the math hi everyone thank you
for watching today I am back with a
back-to-school video for you guys I
wanted to do hair makeup outfit and
nails that way and if you guys are
stumped on what to do or what to wear
maybe this video can help you out maybe
get you inspired to find something in
your own wardrobe to wear for the first
day of school or even just for back to
school so if you guys want to see how I
got this look please keep watching to
start off this look I'm going to be
using the Loreal BB Creams I'm using the
anti-fatigue and also the light one I'm
going to be mixing them together who
said the method so I did use all
drugstore products except for my brows I
use my brow bar to go because it has a
really nice matte dark brown shadow if
any of you guys know a great drugstore
recommendation as far as eyebrows
definitely let me know but of course
looking through all of my products I
didn't have any actual drugstore brow
products following that by Milani I'm
using the clear brow gel to hold my
brows into place
for concealer I'm using by Maybelline
the dark circle eraser you get that on
it
next comes a little bit of bronzer I'm
using this one by Sonia Kashuk and I'm
just applying this right on my cheeks
around my forehead also under my chin
and on my neck you want to make sure
that your neck matches your face so it
doesn't look like we have a mask on here
next I'm using the pink side which is
the blush and I'm applying this right on
my cheeks using my foundation brush I'm
just going to be blending everything in
moving on to eyes I'm using the shadow
eyes by Milani and I'm applying this
right on my eyes and it's a really
really pretty pink champagne color and
it's just gonna really brighten up your
eyes
then using a shadow brush I'm just going
to be smoothing all that in so it looks
nice and blended then with a big fluffy
blending brush I'm going to be using the
Loreal eyeshadow in bronze taupe and I'm
just going to be applying this right
into my crease just to really open up
your eyes
and of course for mascara I'm using
L'Oreal telescopic use as much as you
feel comfortable with you guys probably
already know that I love Spyder thick
lashes
I'm highlighting my Cupid's bow was a
little bit of that same shadow and I'm
lining my lips with my Jordana lip liner
in the color 20 and for lip gloss I'm
using this nude one by Revlon
so this part is optional but I am adding
a little bit of a highlight right on to
my cheeks
so this is the finished makeup look now
let's move on to hair my hair is just
not looking good today so a ponytail is
I used to wear this ponytail all the
time when I was in high school
especially in September when it's still
warm out my school was not
air-conditioned so I loved having my
hair up so what I'm doing is first of
course making the part you can do the
side part or a middle part depending on
how you prefer it and I'm sectioning off
the back part of my hair and I'm
clipping it up now taking the rest of
the hair I'm going to smooth it into a
low ponytail this part could take a
little bit of time you want to make sure
you can get as smooth as possible so
take your time with it once you have it
nice and smooth you just want to spray
it and continuously smooth it all down
until it's perfect and just fasten it
with a hair tie
now taking down the back piece I'm going
to section this off and tease it a
little bit and it's just going to give
it a little bit of height in the back
you just need to tease it just a tiny
bit and another reason why I do it into
sections like this is because it's so
much easier to get it nice and smooth
the other way it's always leaving bumps
so I just always found this way to be
easier so you just flip all your hair
back and you're going to smooth it down
and once you get it nice and smooth and
the height that you want it you're just
going to use another hair tie and you're
good
you
so now let's move on to nails my nails
were inspired by my new purse that I got
that I would totally wear her back to
school I am painting my middle finger
nude because this is gonna be the
leopard finger and the rest of my
fingers I am painting the color Bahama
Mama by Essie originally I was going to
leave my thumb this nude color but I
didn't like how it looked in the end so
I ended up just painting it the same
color that I used for the rest of my
nails
so this was my first time ever trying
Leopard and it actually came out pretty
good I would say I'm just using this
little wooden stick um I'm sorry you
can't really see my hand is blocking it
a little bit but I'm just using the
pointed side and I'm just drawing like
little leopard spots the black part of
it and then I'm gonna go fill it in with
a brown color in a little bit it always
helps looking at an actual picture of
Leopard in this case I'm actually
wearing leopard flats so I was just kind
of going off of my flats
and then to top it all off I'm using a
fast dry top coat I would definitely
recommend doing your nails the night
before school not the morning of
otherwise you're gonna have to wake up
super early but again I just wanted to
give you guys a cool idea for
back-to-school so for my outfit I just
wanted to go with something really
comfortable and cute
the Alpha definitely inspired my makeup
hair and nails so I always like to go
and pick out my outfit first I recommend
doing this the night before but yeah
everything that I picked out I will be
listing all on my blog as well as other
options if it is no longer in stock but
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
for everyone going back to school I
wanted to wish you guys best of luck I
hope this video helped and until next
time I'll see you guys later like
everything that's green girl me this
morning
a
we decide the math in logic you gotta
know your I wanna rap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
