today's video I'm going to share some of
my back-to-school beauty tricks for you
guys it actually wasn't until the other
day that I thought of this idea because
I had done one of the tricks that I
hadn't done in about 4 to 5 years it was
something I completely forgot about so I
was like you know what let me sit down
and name some of the things that I used
to do when I went back to school it
really helped me get through the day
also I'm going to be announcing a big
giveaway so if you guys want to hear a
little bit more about that stay tuned to
the end of the video so I mentioned to
you guys in my back to school video that
when I went to high school majority of
my classrooms were not air-conditioned
so for the first two months of school
and then the last three or four months
of school it was so super hot and I have
a sweating problem on top of all of that
to begin with so one I would always wear
my hair up or majority of time would
wear my hair up just to keep it off my
neck to try and keep me cool but another
thing that bothered me was how if I
would apply a little bit of makeup it
would look really greasy or I would just
look really sweaty throughout the day
especially after gym class so one thing
that I always kept in my purse with me
are in these little oil blotting sheets
I know they have many different brands
the one that I always tend to grab are
the deep clean Neutrogena ones their
blotting sheet so they get rid of oil on
your face without actually removing your
makeup so these were literally my Holy
Grail product I probably went through
about a pack a month but all they are
are these little sheets if you haven't
seen them there's like a little sticky
thing at the top so each time you open
it it gives you a fresh new sheet take
it off and then you just kind of DAB on
your face wherever your oily and I'm
oily because I've been sitting here in
these lights yeah this used to be a lot
worse but as you can see it just kind of
picks up your oil and you'll see a tiny
bit of makeup rub off but most of it is
just going to be the oil off your face
so these are everything especially
if you guys are anything like me and you
get a little hot a little oily
throughout the day another thing I
recommend along with this this is
completely optional is to bring a
translucent powder either like a compact
actually yeah I'd recommend the compact
not really a loose powder to brand just
because it could get a little messy but
bring a little translucent compact with
you
take a little bit and then just kind of
blot your face throughout the day if
this is not enough for you guys so that
is my trick number one so for me I
always brought like a pretty decent
sized bag with me to school bag slash
purse so I like to find a bunch of mini
things that I can shove in there that I
will need throughout the day or if
something happens one thing that I
always would carry with me is a tide to
go stick these are cool if you guys get
any stains on you throughout the day I'm
sure most of you guys have heard of
these are ready but they're like a
little marker you just push down let
some of the liquid come out and then you
rub and it gets all the stains out I
swear every single time I would wear
either a white shirt white sweats or
anything white I would spill either
coffee in the morning or something at
lunch time so this time to go stick was
definitely used a whole lot so if any of
you guys are a little bit messy and you
just seem to get stains on you all the
time I recommend putting this right in
your purse it's super small and it's an
instant stain remover while on the
subject of little mini things to put in
your purse I mentioned these in my last
favorites video these little mini sized
fragrances you can get these at the
drugstore that this is an impression of
Dolce and Gabbana light blue so it's a
nice little sprite to bring with you
guys this is especially great to bring
for after gym class get a little smelly
either you can leave this in your locker
or in your purse and it's great to just
freshen up throughout the day the next
beauty trick is going to be how to get
your lashes super long I did a video
probably a year and a half maybe two
years ago talking about this trick but
what I always like to do is apply my
mascara
in front of a fan junior and senior-year
I would drive to school I got my license
really early so I would always do this
in the car once I was parked because I
always like to sleep in the extra five
ten minutes and not use that time to put
on makeup so for me if I didn't have
time to put on makeup I would rush to
school and just apply my mascara in my
car right before I went in so the trick
is that if you apply this in front of a
fan or just the vents blowing and air
conditioning in your car your lectures
are going to get like three four times
longer than they actually are and the
reason for that is because as you apply
each coat it's going to help dry the
coats in between therefore you're just
going to be building each layer and it's
going to make them super long this
L'Oreal telescopic has been my holy
ground mascara for ever now I have a
whole drama mascara that I've tried but
none of them even compared to this one
so I'm sure for those of you who have
tried it you understand why I love it
but try this mascara out try it in front
of the fan and let me know how much
longer your lashes are because I
guarantee you they're going to be super
long so if you guys do decide to wear
any makeup for school and you notice
your skin gets really oily or it just
doesn't last all day I definitely
recommend using a makeup setting spray I
have three different ones that I
recommend the first one is by NYX this
one is called dewy finish the other one
is from motives and it's called no more
shine and the third one is model in a
bottle and this one's for sensitive skin
they all basically do the same thing
they're just going to help set your
makeup in so if you do take that extra
time to do your makeup and you want it
to last all day I definitely recommend a
setting spray I've always found that
when I applied the setting spray my
makeup would stick a lot longer it
wouldn't get as oily looking and I
wouldn't have to use the oil pads or
anything as I would need to if I didn't
use a spray so definitely a mess in a
good setting spray this next one you can
get right at the drugstore it's super
affordable I have tried a few others but
not worth mentioning so these are
definitely the three top brands that I'm
loving at the moment and my last beauty
tip is the best one that I saved for
last this was the one that I was talking
random linkage so most of you guys may
have brow gel a clear brow gel if not
you can go pick one up at any drugstore
they also are called clear mascara so
just make sure it's like a clear gel and
what I do is I like to keep this in my
purse with me if you're wearing your
hair up or slicked back and you get
those little flyaways and you don't want
to bring hairspray a brush or gel with
you clear brow gel does the exact same
thing and it works better than gel and
it has that little brush so it's going
to smooth it down I'm not wearing my
hair up today but if you guys try this
out you guys are gonna be thanking me
because this is literally the best trick
ever I've been wearing my hair like
parted with the front slicked back and I
always get these little like frizzies
right here so you just take it smooth
back and then it's perfectly straight or
straight back at least so this is
definitely my number one trick this is
the trick that I used all the time
because I always would wear my hair back
and I have curly frizzy hair naturally
it was something that I just constantly
was doing so this is definitely my most
used beauty trick and if any of you guys
haven't tried a clear brow gel or a
clear mascara you can use it for your
brows and also for your hair so show
this in your purse you will thank me
because if you get a little flyaways you
can run right to the bathroom just fix
them real quick and it works just like
gel and it has a it's gel and a built-in
brush just mini sized so those were my
top back-to-school beauty tricks I hope
maybe you learn something new if you
haven't heard some of them definitely go
try it out let me know how you guys like
these tricks I think the clear brow gel
one will really surprise you if you guys
haven't tried it because it is amazing
