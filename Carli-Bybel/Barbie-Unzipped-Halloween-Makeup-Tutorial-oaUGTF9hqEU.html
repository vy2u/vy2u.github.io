and I am a blowing I wanted to dye my
hair and yeah no I'm totally kidding and
it's so funny because I just posted a
picture on Instagram saying I needed a
change and then right below it I wrote
just kidding April Fool's I'm recording
Halloween tutorials today and everyone
seems to not understand that it's a joke
and everyone's freaking out so don't
worry it's just a wig but today I'm
gonna be showing you how to get this
Barbie inspired makeup look I saw a lot
of people requesting this and honestly I
was at the Halloween store today with
Brett and I was trying to find different
ideas of what I wanted to do this year
and there was like nothing left first of
all and second of all I really wanted a
wig because I've never worn a wig in my
entire life and it was so fun to try
these on at first I put it on I was like
oh hello Amanda Bynes about it after a
little bit a little moving around kind
of looks almost a little bit real so if
you guys want to learn how to get this
Barbie inspired makeup tutorial for
Halloween please keep watching to start
off this look I'm grabbing this white
color from this Halloween palette and
I'm going to be applying this all over
my eyelid
from me take me to Brazil I shadow
palette by BH I'm then picking up this
very pigmented white eyeshadow and I'm
applying that right over the white cream
base and I'm also applying this under my
eyebrows and also in my tear duct
the same palette I'm picking up this
goldish brown color and I'm going to be
applying this on my eyelid on the outer
part and I'm going to be blending it in
with the white color
picking up this hot pink with my Mac
blending brush I'm then gonna be
applying this right in the crease of my
eye blending it upwards and also
blending it into my crease
next I'm taking this dark brown shadow
from my whitening lightening brow bar
and my Mac pencil brush and I'm just
gonna be applying a line right in the
crease of my eye you want to keep this
line pretty thin
grabbing this dark purple color and my
other back blending brush I'm then gonna
be applying that right over the brown
line that I had just done blending that
up into the pink shadow same gold I used
on my lid I'm also gonna be lining my
lower lash line and on the outer part
I'm going to be grabbing that dark brown
color from the brow kit so line my upper
lash line I'm using a dark gel liner and
for my lower lashes that I won't be
drawing on in a little bit I'm using
this dark brown gel liner
it's now time for your lashes and your
mascara once you've applied them you're
then gonna just draw with the brown gel
liner to sharpen lines like this on the
side of your eye and this is gonna make
it appear as if your eyes are larger
from far away following that you're
going to use your white eye pencil which
is also gonna make your eyes appear a
lot larger like a Barbie doll for blush
I'm just using that same hot pink eye
shadow and I'm going to be applying it
right on the apples of my cheeks and to
follow that I'm going to be using two
different lipsticks one is a brighter
hot pink and the other one is a peony so
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed and whatever you are being for
Halloween this year
good luck with the costumes and if you
need help for makeup ideas definitely
comment below because I'm gonna be doing
a ton of Halloween videos so I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys later
imagine my hair was really this blonde
so today I bought this skull zipper FX
makeup kit and I've never used anything
before like this so I wanted to give it
a try so I'm just going to show you a
quick version of me trying to apply this
for the first time it's quite amusing
and to take a long time and I cannot get
the glue off my neck but other than that
I thought this was a really cool look
for those of you who like to be scary
for Halloween I usually never do
anything like this but I wanted to step
outside of my boundaries a little bit
just to show you guys a scary unzip
version of a Barbie
and I thought this was a perfect look
because complete opposite of the typical
Barbie look I hope you guys enjoyed and
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
