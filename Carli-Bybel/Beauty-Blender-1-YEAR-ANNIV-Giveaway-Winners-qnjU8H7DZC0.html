Mozart affects my home
and he keeps whispering and
here you given
I feel like he's got your back
at least your
and no it's boys and Nas hi everyone
thank you for watching so I know a lot
of you have been waiting for this
giveaway and it's finally here so before
I announce it I'm just gonna really
quickly talk about the new Beauty
Blender that I had gotten and I had
posted on my Facebook page and I had
minds of you asking what is it for why
do I recommend it why is it $40.00 bah
blah blah so just really quickly I
wanted to talk to you about my Beauty
Blender which I actually ripped tonight
by accident but mine I actually ended up
getting from Walgreens I was in there
picking up my daily needs and I saw this
and I heard a lot of people talking
about it so I wanted to try it and I
figured before I go out and spend I
think it's like $40.00 or however much
it is for the real one I wanted to I
guess to try this brand I think there's
only like $7 and I personally love this
I don't know why it's so good or why I'm
obsessed with it but I think cuz it's
the pointed tip it's so easy to blend it
in and feel like around your nose and it
just makes like it blend in really
perfectly and I feel like if you use a
brush it doesn't keep it on it kind of
just spreads it in and then it doesn't
cover up your bags and then I can use
your fingers it kind of doesn't blend in
nicely so this thing I really really do
recommend if you're in skeptical about
it I mean go do what I do go to
Walgreens and try the one for $7 I again
never tried the other one to compare it
but $7 can't really beat it and it's
amazing for putting on concealer I don't
use it for foundation I haven't tried it
for that yet but if I do and I like it I
will keep you guys updated so good luck
to everybody and I also I was supposed
to pick two winners for the Mac brushes
and three winners for the two lip
glosses in the pen but I'm going to be
picking four winners for the Lightning
pen and the two lip glosses I'm going to
be picking three winners for the Mac
