it's been a really long time since I've
done a favorites video so instead of
doing oddest favorites I decided to do
just my I don't know what I would
actually title it yet but I'm gonna just
do like a big combination of all my
favorites from makeup fashion and I have
a couple accessories a couple different
things I'm going to throw in so if you
guys want to hear what they are please
keep watching so first I wanted to talk
about a few Sigma products that I just
got from their new collection basically
it's all different shimmery products
amazing things that would be perfect for
summer but for those of you guys who are
not ready to let go of summer yet you
can still bring the shimmer into fall so
there's three lip glosses one of them is
called dazzling the other one get ready
and the third one is steady glow and
this one the dazzling one is the one
that I wore in this picture and I'll
show you guys a little picture of it I
saw a ton of you guys asking what lip
combo that I use and I just put this lip
gloss on and it came out like a little
bit of a brown shimmery finish and it's
definitely something very different than
anything that I have so when I tried it
out I was actually very pleasantly
surprised the other ones there's like a
more of like a nude one and then an
orange one these are absolutely
beautiful but I swear ever since all
these highlighters have been coming out
I've been on the search for the best
highlighters and they came out with
these awesome little powders one of them
is more like a creamy mature myrrh so
what I actually did for my highlight
today was I applied with my finger a
little bit of the cream highlight and
then right over that I used the loose
shimmer and this is called gilded and
what's cool about dilution Wars is you
can use it for an eyeshadow you can use
it to highlight highlight your Cupid's
bow you can really do a million
different things with it so I thought it
was really genius of them to come out
with the loose powders and the cream
powder is because it's cool to double up
that way the powder doesn't end up all
over your face it has something to
actually stick to so these combos have
been my absolute favorite there are a
few other colors but the ones that I've
been grabbing are brilliant and gilded
so next up I have two Mac lip pencils
that I've been using non-stop
the first one is oak you can tell
actually you can't really tell that much
but it's a little bit shorter than this
one these two colors are pretty similar
I will swatch them to show you guys the
difference but one is oak and one is
stripped down and this oak one is
definitely my favorite I'm wearing this
one right now and I know what the
transition of fall I will be bringing
these two with me everywhere another
favorite of mine
for the past few months that comes with
me literally everywhere I go is this
little NYX butter lip balm and the
reason I'm loving this is because it has
a little bit of a tint to it and it's a
perfect nude color so I have a million
different chopsticks but I keep bringing
this one with me this one is called
biscotti and it's like a really pretty
nude color next up I have this new eye
cream that I've been loving it's by
Bobbi Brown and it's called extra eye
Repair Cream and it's really really
thick consistency I've been using this
every single night and I've also been
using this before I apply my makeup one
thing I've always noticed with me is
that if I wear a lot of makeup as in the
concealer and all that I start getting
like those little dots under my eyes and
it gets really really dry so no matter
what I did I couldn't fix it I tried
using less setting powder but then it
would always like smudge or crease so I
started using an eye cream before I
applied all my makeup in my primer and I
noticed that I helped a lot for all
those problems that I had so this is the
one that I've been using this one is a
bit pricey but I would definitely
recommend you guys applying an eye cream
if you tend to have maybe some of the
same problems that I had just mentioned
so BH recently came out with these three
little mini palettes and they are
incredible I'm sure you guys have heard
me talking about the galaxy chic palette
which has been one of my favorites for
ever now and those are the baked
minerals shadows the reason I love the
big mineral shadows is because not only
can they be used for shadows but they
can also be used to highlight basically
like multi-use like some of the other
products that I just mentioned but they
came out these cute little ones and
these cute little cases I
the wild child to do my eye makeup today
and I'm just loving their new shades in
these mineral shadows these are the best
you can use them dry for less
pigmentation or if you wet your brush
with either eye drops fix+ any night
good stuff it will help bring out the
pigment so for any of you guys who've
loved the galaxy chic palettes I
definitely recommend these three they
are super affordable and I'm absolutely
obsessed so while on the subject of
small cute little palettes I also have
this one by Too Faced the cat eye
palette this one I've been using all the
time because it has the most beautiful
brown shades the tiger's eye and the
leopard have been definitely my most
used the right side of this palette
these shadows can be used wet or dry as
like an eyeliner and they say I haven't
tried it for that yet but um this tiger
color tiger's eye is the most perfect
crease color to give it a really nice
bronzy look plus the palette is just too
cute next I have to mention this Beauty
Blender this has been my absolute
favorite thing to blend in my face
makeup it looks super big because it's
wet from just doing my makeup but when
they aren't they're super small and they
say you can use them dry but I prefer to
use it wet I wring it out and then I'll
just blend everything in and this is
just so amazing they are a little bit
pricey and before I actually use them I
was like I'm not spending that much
money on those stupid little sponge but
and when I found out how to use it right
I was like wow this actually is amazing
it helps keep everything nice and smooth
and yeah so I also bought the little
mini ones that they just came out with
and they're so cute but I don't really
like it as far as blending like
concealer I don't know I find it just to
be a little bit too small so I love this
for foundation for concealer and just to
really blend everything together next I
wanted to talk about some of my favorite
jewelry companies or jewelry products
right now these new bracelets and rings
that I found on this website are so
amazing they are designer inspired I'm
wearing three of the bracelets right now
they're like these cute little gold ones
black green and white they're amazing
then I also got just a plain gold one
this cute little one and yeah there are
all different bangles they're so cute I
love them and they really look like the
designer ones and they're like a
fraction of the price
so we don't need to tell we could just
wear them and pretend that they're
designer also I got a bunch of rings
they're gold they have the mini rings
and I do have a coupon code for you guys
which I will list below and they don't
sting your fingers leaving them green
and all that good stuff well on the
subject of jewelry I just got these new
ludora boutique airings as well these
are so fun I love them you guys already
know how much I'm obsessed with ludora
boutique but they came out with a bunch
of new styles so I just quickly wanted
to share that as well next I have these
two little mini perfumes you can get
these at the drugstore the brand is in
style and it says it's an impression of
a actual perfume so I personally like
these because they smell really good
they're really small so you could just
shove them in your purse and yeah
they're designer inspired again so
they're not the real thing but you're
gonna save a lot of money on them and
they smell just as good in my opinion
so I know some are slowly coming to an
end but that doesn't mean you still
can't wear jean shorts I love wearing
shorts even in the fall on the winter
time usually I'll pair them with
stockings or sweater or somehow make it
work so if any of you guys are looking
for like custom vintage style Jean
Schwartz wait so you see these aren't
these so fab they have like the lace and
the little studs on front you guys
probably heard me you mentioned : teri
maybe last year I've loved their stuff
forever but I actually just got two new
pairs these have like the cute little
gold studs and they're all Levi's shorts
so these are amazing if you guys are
looking for custom denim they fit the
best out of any pair of shorts that I
have they really they fit nice on the
weights and then they give you a nice
room for your little tush so the last
two things I'm going to show you as my
favorites are my newer newer bags that I
am
obsessed with that I've been using every
single day and yeah I think it's just
the shape and the style of them they're
just really beautiful I have this one
it's black and beige
this one is River Island and then this
one I'm not sure the brand that I got on
ASOS I love how it has that cranberry
color this is the one that I used in my
back to school video and the last week
I've literally picked out like five or
six different outfits that I've worn and
matched this perfectly so I love this
because it has like a pop of color if
you want to wear all black or just like
black and gray and you can just add that
little cranberry pop match your lips
match your nails to it but you know
these are two purses are definitely
gonna be my favorites for fall they are
already my favorites I can look at
September already that like it's not
crazy how fast the time is going if you
like that's like the most common thing
for beauty gurus to say I can't believe
the time to sign but no it's honestly is
crazy I think once you're out of school
time just starts going like that because
you know sitting in class will die
nobody loves that nobody looks forward
to that so it just kind of drags on the
day but once you're out it's like the
weeks really need to slow down so for
those of you guys back to school I know
it's not fun right now but just take it
all in and really try to do the best
that you can do so yeah that is it for
now
I decided instead of doing my monthly
favorites something I'm not think about
it I just figured instead of doing it
every single month every two three
months I'll do just like a combination
of all my favorites that way I can
really give you guys a better opinion on
the products I've been using not just a
month and so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video make sure to comment below
let me know what you guys want to see
next and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
