hi everyone thank you for watching I'm
sorry it's been forever since I posted a
video on this channel I did plan on
posting the Kylie Jenner look for you
guys but it was just one thing after
another with that video and I just feel
like everything happens for a reason so
I am NOT going to be posting that video
and I will explain why because I'm sure
some of you guys were really excited to
see it um I had mentioned on Instagram a
little bit of what had actually happened
the night that I was supposed to upload
it um I hadn't updated my software in a
really long time on my computer so I
don't know while I was exporting the
video
Final Cut decided to just close out so
when I reopened it all the clips were
back unedited so it was like two hours
worth of clips just sitting there and at
first I was just like this can't be
right like something must have happened
so I started looking through the whole
Final Cut Pro all my projects everything
trying to figure out where my final
project was and it was completely
deleted so I literally stared at the
computer screen hyperventilating
hysterical crying for at least 20
minutes Brett came near me and I was
like out to stop just get away from me I
can't move applause so I went online I
paid $70 to talk to some tech support
guy and he talked me through five or six
different ways to try and get my file
back and it was just completely gone
this has never happened to me in my life
and of course the night before I had
target and then I max this all happened
so it was a pretty devastating moment
for me and then what happened was Friday
I ended up having zero time Saturday
morning I left for IMATS
and then yesterday no Monday when I got
home I was like all right let me sit
down I'll read this video and we'll just
get that on up and when I went to open
Final Cut all the clips were gone and
not only that but when I had done the
Kylie video the first time around my
intro and the hair tutorial was really
really dark and the background was like
shaky so I had to redo that video and
all those clips are gone because my
memory card was full at IMATS and I just
told Brett's and just delete all the
videos on my card and the to last final
clips were on that memory card and now
they're gone so I'm a firm believer in
that everything happens for a reason and
there is a reason God does not
want me to put up this Kylie Jenner
video so I figured since a lot of people
thought the picture was a Beyonce
inspired look let me just kind of tweak
things a little bit and then I did this
video for you guys today so I don't know
if you could even keep up with that
crazy long story I just told you but
yeah I just feel like everything happens
for a reason all that drama that
happened from that video and clips being
deleted and my final cut breaking down I
just like that's all a sign so today I
will teach you how to get this Beyonce
look and enough of me rambling if you
want to learn how to get it please keep
watching so start off this look I'm
going to be contouring my nose before
this tutorial started I did apply my
makeup forever foundation all over my
face and I also filled in my brows with
the Anastasia Beverly Hills pomade and
then the whitening lightening brow
powder on top grabbing my larger contour
brush from Sigma I'm then going to be
using that same dark brown color to
contour my cheeks also on the sides of
my forehead and underneath my chin
poor concealer I'm using Laura Mercier
and sc3 and I'm applying this underneath
my eyes also on the sides of my nose and
in between my brows on the bridge of my
nose and on my chin to set my foundation
and concealer I'm using by mac and
medium dark this mineralize skinfinish
and i'm applying this all over my face
moving on to eyes I'm using by Sigma
this eyeshadow base in the color sculpt
look hey baby hey I'm filming are you in
my attic
hey baby hey can you come focus me and
stop
hey couple for eyeshadow I'm using my
Naked 3 palette and the first color I'm
picking up is called dark side and this
color is going all over my lids using my
bigger blending brush I'm picking up the
color Factory and I'm applying this
right into the crease of my eye
for this look I noticed that Beyonce
really had any color in her crease it
looks like just her lids were a dark
grayish black but for my eye type I know
it looks better with something in the
crease so I'm just extending it a little
further in the crease and she has it
picking up that same color which was
darkside and this smaller brush I'm then
gonna be lining the lower parts of my
lower lashline
after this I'm picking up a pencil brush
to smudge it out
next up four liner I'm using by BH in
the black onyx color and I'm barely
making a tail for this look I'm just
gonna be lining the outer part of my eye
and then very lightly lining the inner
part of my eye it didn't look like
Beyonce had much eyeliner on for this
look so that's why I'm doing it this way
then for lashes I'm using the demi
whispies I'm cutting these in half and
I'm just going to use the outer parts
again with this look it didn't look like
she even had false lashes on but I
thought with a darker smoky eye lashes
really complete the look so I'm just
again applying them on the outer part of
my eye
poor blush I'm using my NARS palette and
I'm taking this pinkish color and I'm
applying this right on the apples of my
cheeks following that I'm grabbing a
foundation brush just to blend all this
in
I'm lining my lips with the Jordana
cosmetics lip liner in the color
Cabernet and be careful when you're
doing this because since it is a really
dark shade if you get it on your skin
it's really hard to get off
for lipstick I'm using two colors the
first one is by Milani and this one is
called Cabernet blend and then over that
I'm using by covergirl the bright red
color in hot passion
so now moving on to hair since I do have
long hair I want to create a faux bob
look the first step is to spray my
Bumble and Bumble hair surf spray and I
had slept with my hair in a braid last
night
so last night I showered and it was damp
and then I put in a braid and that's why
I have these waves in it if you guys
have frizz your hair if you hadn't just
gotten the keratin treatment like I had
you can definitely do curls or waves
with a curling iron and at the end of
this look I'm actually going to curl a
few pieces in the front anyway but to
start up this look you're going to take
a back section of hair twist it around
your hand and then twist it up and
you're going to pin it against your
scalp for this look you're going to use
a ton of bobby pins so make sure you
have a bunch handy and as you have it
rolled up you're just gonna pin the hair
that's closest to your scalp against
your scalp I use about 3 to 4 per piece
of hair
if you don't have any layers in your
hair and your hair is pretty long and
all one length I'm not really sure if
this look will work for you but I have a
lot of shorter layers on top so as I
curl these pieces up I leave a couple
little pieces out and I'll show you what
I do when it gets towards the front of
the hair
so this is where it gets a little bit
tricky it's all trial and error I've
done this a few times and I did it again
last week a few times to film the Kiley
look but you just really have to place
hair in different places and then pin it
up and try and make it look as natural
as possible and I'm going to just do the
other half of my hair and then I'll work
on the front parts
using my Bellamy Tuan I'm just gonna be
curling the front pieces of my hair and
this is going to help blend the look
together
you
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
this look was inspired by one of her
most recent red carpet looks where she
had that beautiful white lace gown and
the Bob and then this similar makeup
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
no place my body so to rest on the new
life walking in my life that we live
I'm rubbing on the Rope rubbing if you
skate for everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
