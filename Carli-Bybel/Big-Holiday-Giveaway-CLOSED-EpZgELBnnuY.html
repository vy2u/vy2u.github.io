freckles and my smile back of my mind
making me feel I just wanna know you
know hi everyone thank you for watching
so I cannot believe the holidays are
finally here I did some holiday shopping
today and the mall has been so crazy I
don't even want to go but gotta do what
you gotta do so I wish all of you the
best of luck while holiday shopping and
to those who celebrate Hanukkah happy
second night of Hanukkah so I wanted to
do a giveaway video I just wanted to
give away a few things just to show my
gratitude for all of you guys seriously
I wish I can give every single one of
you something you all made my ear so
amazing and this has been such a fun
experience so I figured what better time
to do a giveaway than the holiday season
so if you want to learn how you can
enter to win please keep watching the
first giveaway is going to be a lip
gloss and this is by whitening
lightening I love these with lip glosses
if you found my videos for a while now
you've definitely heard the name and you
probably see me use these I love them
because they have the mirror on it and
then if you're out it has the light so
you can just kind of apply it I love
this lip gloss it also are lip plumpers
so they come in four different colors
and I'm gonna be giving away three of
those so whatever color you decide to
choose if you are a winner the next
thing that I'm going to be giving away
is also from them it's the zero
whitening pen and it has zero peroxide
in it so I'm gonna be giving those two
to people and I love the zero pen it is
the newer version of the super booster
pen they're both equally amazing they
have no sensitivity but the zero 1 has
no peroxide so it's safer if you're
nursing or if you just don't want any
peroxide so again I'm going to be giving
away three lip glosses and 2-0 pens I'm
going to post the website below and
there's a lot of coupon codes as well so
check them out because they're having a
lot of great holiday specials right now

description box so next there's gonna be
nine winners for the new me giveaway and
I'm gonna be giving away 3 straighteners
which
I just got this new one so the vintage
straightener they come in pink they come
in turquoise they have all different
pretty colors which you can see on the
website and I'm actually gonna be
posting a curl your hair with a
straightener tutorial this week so
definitely stay tuned for that so three
people will be winning the straighteners
three people will be winning a curling
wand of your choice and then three
people will be winning they it's called
a threesome and it comes with the three
different sized ones if you've watched
my other videos you saw me use the one I
still have to unpack from LA I feel like
my life has been so crazy I've been
going everywhere and I don't even get to

go-to drink</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
