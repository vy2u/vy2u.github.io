today's video I'm going to do a big
spring fashion well for you guys so I've
been shopping preparing for spring the
past couple of weeks and just wanted to
go over some of the things that I picked
up to maybe give you guys some ideas to
go out and fill your wardrobe with some
great spring essentials so I'm also
going to show you guys some shoes so if
you guys want to see what I picked up
please keep watching
so the first shirt is so cute as soon as
I saw it I definitely needed it in my
life
the past couple of weeks for Coachella a
lot of the online websites that I shop
on had a ton of different outfits that
they would recommend for festival season
so of course I splurged even though I
knew I wasn't going to Coachella but
when I saw this shirt I was like oh it's
so cute I love flowy arms like this so I
can't wait to wear this it is a crop
shirt so I would probably be wearing
this with a pair of high waist jeans
I mean highways shorts because it's
gonna be warmer out yeh um in Jersey is
actually pretty nice today but the past
couple of days it's been so cold that I
literally been wearing my winter jackets
I started putting some of them away for
the spring and then I had to pull them
back out because it just doesn't want to
be come spring here in Jersey so that is
the first shirt that I picked up I
believe I got this from Nasty Gal
um I will be linking where I got every
single thing so I'm going to post it
below as well as on my blog for those of
you guys interested
the next shirt is from misguided this
also screams Coachella to me it's the a
knit top with a bunch of fringes at the
bottom personally I bought this because
I thought it would be so cute to throw
on over a bathing suit so I know I am
labeling this a spring wall but I guess
it's kind of spring and summer I love
this house I think it's so cute since it
is see-through again if you want to
throw it over a bathing suit or what you
could buy um I actually just picked them
up from ASOS I'll link them for you guys
there's a little band do tops so they're
gonna cover your boobs so you're not
exposed but that way you can get away
with wearing all of the shirts that are
kind of a little bit more exposed but I
would definitely wear like a little
white band ooh bandeau top is that what
they're called bandu top underneath this
the next stop is pretty similar
actually I'm seeing these kinds of tops
everywhere this year the knitted look
with the fringes which is very boho
styled and I absolutely love it this one
is I believe from ASOS and it's a cute
little cardigan top this one isn't
see-through so if you guys don't want to
buy something that would go under it
this top is a good alternative for me
when I just showed you this one's more
of a cream-colored um I would probably
wear this again with jean shorts that's
probably all you could really wear with
it jean shorts maybe like a skirt like a
jean skirt or something like that but um
high waist jean shorts are what I live
in for the warmer weather so I love
getting different tops that I can
mix-and-match with them because I do not
need any more shorts so I haven't
purchased any shorts I always like to
get tops over bottoms because I'm again
living in the shorts the next romper is
amazing I actually almost wore this to
I'm at the what was it two weeks ago now
it's suede and it's this beautiful camel
color and it's strapless and the bottom
is nice and flowy one thing that I was a
little worried about when I first bought
it was sometimes when you buy rompers
like this they could be a little too
short and then your tush can hang out
the bottom and I don't like that I like
having everything covered so this I was
so pleasantly surprised with because
it's super long in the back so no tush
is hanging out and it just fits really
really nice I would probably wear this
and throw maybe like a jean jacket or
something like that and a pair of
lace-up heels
what's great about this is you can dress
it up or dress it down if you want to
throw on a pair of flats and like a jean
jacket you could do that or if you want
to wear it out you can also throw in a
jean jacket and just add some lace-up
heels or something like that and I think
it would be super cute so I love this I
love the color camel next I have just
like a little dress it's just tight it's
pretty basic um it's from basic basic
bitch it's just like a t-shirt dress um
it's tight-fitting and it has a little
bit of like scrunches on the side
I just love just as like this just to
throw on when it gets warmer out this
and a pair of sandals and you're good to
go
sometimes I don't want to sit
and try and pick an outfit out because
although I enjoy putting together
outfits sometimes it can be really
stressful so I love just getting just
like comfy dresses like this you can
just kind of throw on put on a pair of
shoes and then you're good to go
so I love this plus anything from
misguided is very affordable um some of
the items that I picked up maybe are a
little bit pricey but if you guys see
something that you really really like
and you want a cheaper alternative it
I'll try and list those on my blog as
well the next item that I have is a
bodysuit majority of the time I like to
tuck in my shirt so when you're wearing
a tight shirt like this if it's a
bodysuit it's going to stay nice and
tight all night so I'm going to start
riding up so that's one of the main
reasons why I love these bodysuits like
this next I have this super cute dress
from Free People it's like a grayish
taupe color and it has like these little
braided I don't know it's kind of like a
belt on it but it's cute because the
side has like this see-through netting
um I just love this I love dresses for
spring I just told you why it's always a
lot easier to pick out an outfit when
you have a dress I picked this up
probably about a month ago but I love
free people they always have the cutest
stuff their style is so boho so if you
guys haven't heard of Free People which
I'm sure most of you had check out their
stuff it is pricey but the quality of
their clothing is amazing so it's worth
the money in my opinion next I had this
grey skirt I'm actually wearing the same
skirt in camel right now this one's from
misguided and it's just the stretchy
skirt these are super comfy and they're
great to just throw on with any kind of
top I'm wearing what crop top with mine
who are body so you can really wear any
types of tops with them this is the
first year that I've been trying more
longline
clothing I used to stay away from this
because I am really short so sometimes
if you wear something that can cut you
off on your legs it can make you look a
little shorter but I really love how
these fit they're super comfy I have it
in black gray and
this camel and yeah so I really love
these this is again it's not misguided
another skirt that I've also picked up
from the same store is this grey one and
it's a shorter one it's more of like a
casual just everyday type of skirt I
would wear this with just a t-shirt um
it's just really really comfy and cute
and you can just kind of mix and match
and basically wear whatever you want
with this type of skirt I'd like these
skirts I'm going to definitely be
getting a lot of use out of I love
buying solid items that I can mix and
match with a bunch of different tops so
that's why I have a lot of solids this
year I saw a couple people asking to do
on like a try on haul I'm not going to
do it this time around because I filmed
another video earlier and I just want to
get this up for you guys but if you guys
go on the websites everything's still in
stock and you can see what it looks like
on the model so this next outfit is from
ASOS this is like a kimono jacket
it comes with a crop top underneath well
underneath because it's on the hanger
but it comes with a crop top and then
matching trousers again I'll link so you
can see what it all looks like on the
model but I just love matching separates
and I think this print is really really
pretty and could ditch the jacket if you
want and just do the top of the shorts
but I like that it gave you the option
that you could wear a jacket with it
because sometimes well most of the time
when I buy matching separates sometimes
like the crop tops will be a little bit
skimpy and I don't always feel
comfortable walking around in certain
types of tops so this I absolutely love
I can't wait to wear it I may bring it
with me to LA this weekend but we shall
see next I have another matching
separate set this is the top and the
shorts this is from the website called
the fashion bunker and it's the brand
keepsake I love this top and the shorts
I I absolutely love the website fashion
mugger I've been shopping there forever
basically any event that I've had I've
worn something from that site their
clothing is a lot more pricey but the
quality is insane and they're all
trillium brands so I backed them up a
hundred percent um again I guess the
main reason why I usually only wear them
for events is because I like to keep
stuff on my blog affordable and the
stuff that you guys can go out and
purchase yourself so I know a lot of
people won't have the money to go out
and just spend on a two piece separate
like this but if you guys have some sort
of event you're going to or something a
little bit special and you want to
splurge on an outfit I definitely
recommend checking out their site they
have the cutest stuff so next up I have
a romper and this is like a nude pink
beige color it's just like a silky
material and it just has like the long
legs and the racerback and then the
criss cross front this one is from Nasty
Gal and I absolutely love rompers
rompers are definitely my favorite to
wear they're also the easiest to wear
because again you don't really have to
pick out your outfit it's just a full
outfit already ready for you so this I
got about two weeks ago from Nasty Gal
I believe it's still in stock I
absolutely love rompers and this one
just stuck out to me because it's plain
so you could throw on a belt um you can
add like a pop of color with the belt
and really make the outfit look a little
bit more fancy or you can just kind of
leave it plain as is and put on a pair
of flat sandals maybe like it's just a
light jacket and then go out during the
day as well so look at my phone's
ringing sorry guys so next I have this
really cute blazer I actually posted an
outfit wearing this a couple days ago on
my fashion account this blazer is also
from ASOS can you guys tell that I
basically only shop at ASOS Nasty Gal
um fashion bunker show PO those are
basically like my top top stores this is
the brand River island and I just loved
the colors of this it just screams
spring and summertime and what I wore
this with was just a light pink cami
pair of ripped jeans and then
a pair of nude mules which I will show
you guys in a second so I absolutely
love this blazer it's super comfy it's
lightweight so it's great for the warmer
weather and the colors are just really
beautiful next up I have this beautiful
floral kimono I just got this in the
mail like a couple days ago so it's
definitely still in stock for anyone who
wants it um it's just like here I'll try
this one on because this will be easy to
try not to show you guys um it just
comes around like this like that and
it's just like a pretty little kimono so
you could throw it over an outfit you
could wear it over a bathing suit
there's really a million different
things you can do with these kimonos so
I absolutely love these if I'm not
mistaken this one was super affordable
so again everything will be linked but I
just love floral I think it looks so
pretty on and summertime you need
florell in your life and you can really
mix-and-match and wear like so many
different colors with this or again you
could throw it over a bathing suit and
it's a perfect cover-up next I have this
green maxi dress it's an full open back
and it just goes down to the floor and
it's so cute as a halter top I don't
know if I already said that this is also
from ASOS I just got this in my most
recent order as well I love maxi dresses
they're so fun and easy to throw on when
it gets nicer out I know I'm going to be
living in maxi dresses the summer as
well as rompers they're just so airy and
light and it's something different than
the normal gene shorts that I tend to
stick to one thing I wanted to mention
about the ASOS website is sometimes the
ASOS brand runs a little bit bigger and
sizing so if you guys are getting
anything of the ASOS brand I recommend
going a size down I always have to get a
size down and that as opposed to the
normal sizing of the rest of the item so
that's just a little tip that I want to
let you guys know and the last dress
that I have for you guys is from Shoko
and this is a black maxi dress it has a
nice little slit in the front it also
has the Razorback and again it's just so
easy to throw on super comfy I
absolutely love this Shoko has the
cutest clothing I will link you guys
this dress as well as the website so you
can go check it out there
so based in Australia but their clothing
is a lot more affordable than the
fashion bunker website so you guys
should go check it out so next up I have
some shoes that I wanted to share with
you guys these are the ones that I wore
to my mats they are Shutts and they are
the ones that lace up your ankle I also
wore these to the wedding that I had
this past weekend I saw a lot of people
asking where I got the shoes as well as
the dress and it's funny because I
literally bought like five new dresses
for the wedding I didn't like any of
them and I ended up wearing a dress
that's like three four years old that I
never thought I was going to even wear
and that I was planning on selling so
the dress is a few years old it's from
Shoko though but these shoes are still
available I got them I believe on
revolve clothing but they're so cute and
they go with so many different colors
these are so comfy and you guys are like
me and struggle in heels these you will
not shovel and I wore these the entire
night I'm not only wore these all
throughout I'm has had no problem but
the entire wedding everybody was dancing
in their socks and barefoot and I still
had my heels on I was completely fine
which was a huge shocker for me so I
don't know what it is that's different
about these but they're so comfy and I
absolutely love them the next pair of
shoes I've been wearing like almost
every day these are little mules are
from go Jane and they're like 30 bucks I
have them in nude and black I'm actually
wearing the nude ones right now and they
are so comfy they have a little wedge so
it gives you a nice little bit of height
for those of you girls up there that
want some height but you want to be
comfy at the same time like I'll wear
these and go walk around the mall that's
how comfy they are so I'm loving the
whole mules this year they're everywhere
and in my opinion I think they really
make you look taller the way that
they're cut off they just make your legs
look a lot longer so I love them plus
they're really comfy so once I find a
pair of shoes that are comfy and that
are cute at the same time I will never
stop wearing them I mean 30 bucks you
can't really beat that they might even
be cheaper than 30 bucks I'm pretty sure
they actually are cheaper than 30 bucks
so again I have them in the black and
the nude color I wish they had more
colors that they came in but they don't
so again go Jane super affordable
website and
have really cute shoes and the next pair
of shoes that I just got are also by
Shutts and I love fringes so as soon as
I saw these I literally died a little
inside they have the lace up front and
then the sides are fringe and they have
these little um ties at the top that
lace up your legs and then they have
little fringes at the bottom so these
are so cute they come in a couple other
colors but I love gray I've been loving
grey this year so I wanted to get the
grey ones but again these ones are a
little bit more pricey this should shoot
the shit's shoes are more expensive but
they have the cutest shoes plus they're
always so comfortable which is a plus
these ones are sweet and yeah I'm just
so in love with these alright guys so
that is it for now I hope you guys
