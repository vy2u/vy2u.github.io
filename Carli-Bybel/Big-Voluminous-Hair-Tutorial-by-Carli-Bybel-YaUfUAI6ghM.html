the Utah where my cheese
hi Ellen thank you for watching so I
have some exciting news to announce if
you haven't already saw cuz I've been
posting it everywhere I hope I'm not
annoying you guys I just created a
second channel and I've been wanting to
do something like this for a while now I
just finally got around to making it
it's called the inner beauty Bible
because this one is the beauty Bible so
I figured we're gonna leave this channel
specifically for makeup hair and fashion
which some of you that's all you want to
see for me which is completely fine I
know a lot of you have been asking for
different types of videos like my diet
and exercise routine or fitness videos
or how I stay so positive or different
things that have helped me get through
day to day life and I feel like I
personally have gone through a lot and
yeah I'm only 22 but I really feel like
there's a lot of things that I've
personally learned that have really
helped shape me into Who I am today and
I just figured it'd be really awesome to
do a separate channel to get more
interactive with you guys and obviously
I want to hear all kinds of feedback on
what you want to see so I do have a ton
of really exciting fun ideas so I hope
you all will just take the one second to
go subscribe to that channel I will also
post that link below two months ago I
had posted a little black bag unboxing
and if you didn't see that you should go
check out that video but I just got my
second box and I didn't get to do it

I did do it again this month and what's
really cool is they're partnering up
with new me which you guys know how much

below as well so yeah we're all teaming
up and there's gonna be 4 winners and

or a wand and quick sidenote I just
wanted to apologize I have a base sheet
on the back of my back drop because the
white was really bright to some people
and I have a white shirt on so bear with
me for now guys I do plan on painting it
in future so enjoy so before I started
filming this tutorial I just blow-dried
my hair and normally would when getting
your hair really full and really fluffy
it does take a couple steps
and of course depending on your hair it
may not come out exactly how you want it
but there are a few techniques that I
personally do that I have noticed really
makes a huge difference in my hair I
have very thick coarse curly hair
naturally so my hair does have body just
naturally like as you can see just
blowing it out straight it does already
have some body in it because I guess
since my hair is coarse and not so silky
it just stays a lot better but there are
a few tricks that really do help make it
really big and voluminous as opposed to
just kind of flat dull and lifeless
so once you've fully blow-dried your
hair you can at this point
apply your extensions if you want I
already have my Bellamy 22 inch
extensions in and I recently also just
gave myself a haircut and recently dyed
my hair I did find new hair dye so I
will be telling you guys about that one
next it is also from the drugstore so
it's nice and inexpensive one main thing
you can do it's you get fuller hair is
to cut shorter layers on the top part of
your hair if you guys follow my videos
for a while you do know that I do cut my
own hair but if you guys can see I do
have shorter layers at the top of my
hair so all this is right here you can
see it starts really really short and it
kind of blends into the rest of the hair
one reason I love shorter layers on the
top of my hair is because it really
gives your hair a little big lift and it
also helps it stay a lot longer so the
first thing I'm gonna do to get my hair
super full is after I'm already done
blow-drying I'm gonna take these little
velcro rollers which have my hair stuck
to it but you can get these at any
drugstore any ones with velcro on it
will help
I like the velcro ones because you just
need about one bobby pin to hold them in
place and they pretty much stay right
where they should be when you want your
hair super super full you want to focus
on the top part of your hair if you
don't have shorter layers and your hair
is all one length this probably won't
work for you so if you are looking for a
fuller effect I would definitely
recommend getting some shorter layers so
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna comb my hair back
and I'm gonna take this first chunk of
hair and I'm gonna use the blow dryer
just to heat up the hair again and I'm
gonna blow it forward and again I'm just
gonna get the hair hot and then I'm
gonna apply the roller I'm using a
ceramic round brush this one is pretty
small I have these in about three sizes
when I blow-dry my hair I always use a
nozzle on my blow dryer but I can't find
it right now so yeah I'm just gonna take
my hair slide the velcro all the way
down to the bottom and then I want to
roll it up but I'm gonna be pushing the
roller forward so as it goes on top of
my head it's gonna give it lift
once you've gotten all your rollers and
you're just gonna apply a little bit of
hairspray is one it's by salon graphics
shaping hairspray and this you can just
get as well at any drugstore again I'm
just going to be putting a little bit of
this on so normally if you were gonna do
this I would suggest doing your hair
first and while your hair is still in
the rollers you can do your makeup and
take little time say 1020 minutes to get
ready and then you go back to your
rollers so I'm just gonna leave mine in
for a couple of minutes and once I'm
sure that they're done then I will come
back and take them out and show you what
I'll do next so once you take them out
of the rollers your hair's gonna be big
giant mushroom head so you obviously
don't want to do like that but you guys
as you can see just by adding those
rollers I mean how much bigger and
fluffier and how much more lifted it is
so that's gonna be your first step so
yeah as you can see it's nice and lifted
there are some days where I will just
blow dry my hair and basically do that
and then kind of just mess with it and
leave it all flippy and big as you can
see and I know for a lot of you you were
asking about a picture I posted and my
hair was just basically like this and
you were like how did you get so full
until thick and yeah it's really just
simple eyes the rollers they really do
help and of course the shorter layers
and yeah so okay I don't I only flip my
hair I can go like this and it like
looks all curled under so I mean rulers
really help blow-drying your hair away
from your head is also a good idea
because if you're blowing it back just
getting your hair used to laying back if
you're blowing it forward then it's
gonna be drying facing forward so when
it is finally drying has to go back it's
gonna get and lift it and give it more
so besides that I just wanted to really
quickly also show you guys a second look
that a lot of you have been requesting
and I do the same step right before I do
all that and the picture that I had
posted
couple from IMATS la and even a couple
just going out where the two pieces are
pinned back like that and it's really
really full one of the main things that
you need to do for this hairstyle is you
want to make sure the hair all around
your face is nice and silky straight so
there's no frizz my hair tends to curl
right at the root because my hair is
naturally curly so when I am pinning
hair back I want to make sure that these
pieces are super straight so for that
I'm just using my UV straightener - the
pink one and this is the vintage flat
iron I have all kinds of codes below for
new me you guys know how much I love
their products so yeah first thing I'm
gonna do is just kind of flip my hair
over and take the strainer right around
my roots
it's the next step you're gonna have to
taste the front of your hair and I just
wanted to really quickly share with you
guys I went to Walgreens the other day
to get a comb because my combs always
break or I lose them and I got this pack
of combs I don't know how many are in
here 20 20 pieces of combs 20 pieces of
combs that doesn't make sense but it
says 20 pieces but yeah there's 20
different columns you can get and this
was like $2.99 so I don't know if they
sell them at every drugstore but when I
went into Walgreens they had like all of
these different columns for $2.99 where
you normally one is just one or two
ninety-nine so great deal and there's
all kinds of combs for every kind of
hairstyle so if you are looking for
combs definitely check out a drugstore
and get a combo pack because that way
you are all set and you don't have to
worry about losing them like me I'm
gonna use this blue one and it's just a
normal comb and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna tease the front parts of my hair
where I wanna pick back so with this
look I always do more of a side part so
first I'm gonna part it where I want it
and this part you're gonna always want
to keep back
again they're just gonna spray a little
bit on the t's to make it stay and then
you're just gonna want to comb it and
smooth it using just any color bobby
pins one thing I love is once your hair
is teased it kind of just stays wherever
you put it so I'm gonna make sure it's
all smooth and I'm just gonna pin it
right into the back of my hair
and we're gonna repeat the same thing on
the other side
so once you can play around that and
just make sure that they are the way you
want them to be and once you have the
two pieces from back you're just gonna
take the hair that you originally had
put back sometimes it gets stuck under
the bobby pins which is completely fine
and you're just gonna tease this part
now one thing to remember when to using
is if you want it to really stay you
take your hair and you pull it forward
and then tease it same technique with
blow-drying your hair again because if
you do it this way then when it falls
back its higher see so you're just going
to do all around the back just to blend
it in with the front pieces
so this is the final look and you can
really do this with curly hair straight
hair wavy hair any kind of hair however
your hair is and you don't want to sleep
it down just pin the front pieces back
I've been doing this a lot lately and
it's nice because it keeps your hair out
of your face and it's a nice different
look and don't forget to check the link
