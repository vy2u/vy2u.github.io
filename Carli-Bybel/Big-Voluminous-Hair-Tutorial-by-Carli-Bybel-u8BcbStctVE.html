Happy New Year
I hope everybody had an amazing New
Year's Eve in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how to get a lot of volume
in your hair just like how my hair is
right now so if you like how my hair
looks I suggest you continue watching
before I started recording I just
blow-dry the bottom part of my hair as I
normally would part you want to focus on
the most at the top because that's where
you're going to need the most body
first going to be taking this much hair
and applying my matrix root lifting
spray right in the roots of my hair what
this does is it lifts up your roots so
when it dries it gives you a lot more
body I'll be using my luxor pro ceramic
brush as well as my baby bliss Pro titi
hair dryer with the nozzle attached we
want to be taking small sections like
this at a time and I put this part in
slow motion just you can get how I do it
because it's kind of hard to explain
you're going to start at the root and
you're going to people drawing the top
of the hair and be blowing it upwards
you're going to take this same piece of
hair and you're going to be drying it
from every single angle each time making
each time holding the brush and sliding
it upward so your hair dries up
you're then going to be taking a roller
like this a medium sized velcro roller
and sliding it down your hair to the
bottom part and rolling it upwards this
is going to help your hair cool while
being lifted upwards at the same time
secure these rollers you can be using a
bobby pin you can get these rollers at
any Walgreens or any drugstore they sell
them in big kits
I love the medium sized ones because it
give it a little bit of a curl as well
as some body you're then taking the
front part of your hair and then
repeating the same steps
you
you
you
you're then taking the top parts of your
hair and I split it up into three
sections
the first being where my bangs are but
my bangs aren't really that long but the
front pieces of my hair I'm going to be
pinning this up with just a makeup brush
just to hold it away from my face and
then with whatever is left you're going
to split that into two whole wanted
piece forward and then I always like
starting in the back just because it's a
lot easier take the same route lifting
spray and spray it right on the roots of
your hair when blow-drying this top
piece I always blow it forward what this
does is it dries the roof standing looks
like pretty much straight up and if you
blow it the opposite way that it's
supposed to be going when it falls it'll
have a lot more body that way also you
want to make sure your hair is entirely
dry if you have hair like me where it's
frizzy and curly if you don't have it
dried all the way it will freeze up
you
you
you
then you want to use this middle section
in the front section if you want to do
it in two parts you can do it that way
I'm just taking it all as one big
section and blow-drying it forwards as
well
you
after you're all finished you want to
take a crew sunlight finishing spray and
sprite all over the rollers
thank you so much for watching I hope
this helped for all the girls who had
asked me how I do my hair have a great
day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
