today's video I'm going to take you guys
step-by-step through how I have been
currently curling my hair I've learned
some new techniques and basically just
found some new awesome products that
really help keep it in all night long I
think one of the number one problems
that most people have when curling their
hair is after an hour or sometimes even
like a half hour the girls just fall
starts looking frizzy and just doesn't
look as good as you did when you first
leave the house so I'm gonna take you
guys through the steps that I've
personally been using that I love and
that really help keep the curls intact
and looking great all night long so if
you guys want to see how I get full long
lasting curls please keep watching so
the number one step and the most
important in my opinion is to use a heat
protectant spray you want to protect
your hair from the really hot iron that
we're about to use the one that I'm
using is by Schwarzkopf and it's the
crystal shine and hold heat protection
shine spray so I'm just going to be
applying it right onto my dry hair I'm
just going to be applying it evenly all
over and that is gonna be step number
one and again when you're applying this
you want to make sure it's reaching all
throughout your hair so you can just
kind of fluff it around
so for this look you're gonna need a few
simple tools I have these little clips
that you can just pick up from your
drugstore after I do each curl I'm going
to pin them up feel free to use bobby
pins in place of this but the number one
thing that I recommend when curling your
hair keeping it all night long is to pin
them up let them cool and then we'll
take them down afterwards
so first you just want to section off
your hair before you do each section
make sure to brush it through so it's
nice and smooth and it's gonna help keep
the curls looking really nice as well
then what I do is I just take my finger
I run it through the back and create a
little part and then I bring the two
sections to the front so I'm now going
to take this one section and split it
into two
and they're going to give you about a
piece about this big and this is how big
you want to do each curl if you're doing
the sections too big the curls are not
going to hold as well so I like to do
smaller sections and then at the end I
blend it all together so they look like
bigger curls so don't think you're going
to get some little tiny spiral curls by
doing it this way so I have my one-inch
curling iron what you're going to want
to do for each side is you're going to
curl it away from your face so with this
side I'm going to take the curling iron
right back here and start curling it
away from my face just like that and a
reason I'm loving the one with the clamp
is because just to get it extra hot I
pull this down I just kind of tap it
like this and it helps keep in the heat
and get them nice and curly so now
depending on the thickness of your hair
that all depends on how long you want to
keep it what I like to do is just very
lightly touch the hair and when you feel
the heat starting to come through then
you know that it's done so once I feel
the heat I do a little a little bit of
that and then you just let it down so
then immediately what I like to do is
just curl the curl back into place like
this curl it back up so it's against
your head and then use one of these
little clips and just clip it right in
also just let you guys know I have the
iron up to 430 degrees which is the
hottest that it gets I've tried it on a
lower heat and from my hair since it's
very coarse and very thick it just
doesn't hold the curl as long so I guess
I recommend using the high heat don't
forget your heat protectant spray
because when you're using such a high
heat you don't burn your hair so again
we're just curling it up and clipping it
into place okay so now moving on to the
other side we're going to do the same
steps just we're going to be curling it
again away from the face so it's going
to be opposite as the other side
now sometimes if you use the clamp
you'll see that it would get ridges but
all you have to do is just instead of
keeping it straight you curl it the way
that it's curled so it's on like an
angle I don't know if that makes much
sense but if you guys have ever gotten
those little creases this will prevent
it these clips are just like bobby pins
there's a thief in the night that just
comes and steals them and they all go
missing
okay so now I let down another layer
this one is right above my ear and what
I like to do when I'm curling my hair my
hair yes it's getting very long I'm very
excited about it but what I like to do
especially when I'm curling it since it
does make it a little bit shorter is I
like to add some extensions I'm down to
only two sets of the four clips so I'm
slowly weaning myself off I like this
Hey what I'm gonna do now is I'm going
to tease around the root just put the
comb in once push it up regrip the hair
take that same piece and just kind of
slowly push it up to the root and you'll
get a nice little tease and then I'll do
a little piece in the back again I'm
using the ones with the four clips I'm
taking the one that's a little bit
shorter first and you're just going to
clip it right on to your head we're
going to curl it again away from our
face because then I want this video to
be an hour long the next step is going
to be the exact same process as what I
had just done so you just take a little
more hair and then do the same thing
with the other set of extensions so now
we're finally at the top layer part your
hair however you want to part it I
always like to do it up to the side a
bit then what I do is I section off from
here down so this is going to be the
back section and then I keep this as the
front section I'm going to split this
into two sections and do the same thing
and the reason I'm not doing one big
piece is because like I said before if
you're doing too big of a piece it's not
going to hold the curl as well and the
point of this video is to get the long
lasting beautiful curls that are going
to stay all night
and not fall out on you so the smaller
the piece is the better in this case
just hook them up
and then the same thing on this side
we're just going to split off into two
sections put that putting this section
towards the back for the back pieces
you're gonna want to make sure you're
clipping them up like this
we're also curling these back pieces
away like back as if we were blowing out
our hair okay guys so I just finished
curling my entire head as you saw
throughout this video I didn't use any
hairspray I like to use hairspray at the
end of the look not only because too
much hairspray can weigh it down but I
don't like crunchy curls I like them to
be really soft natural but we do want
something that's going to really keep it
in place the hairspray that I'm loving
right now is by Schwarzkopf as well and
it's the biotin volume and texture the
number one reason this hairspray is
great is because it is h2o free so what
are free hair spray is you only tend to
find in your beauty supply stores or the
more expensive hair sprays this one's
only six ninety seven and it doesn't
have the water it's gonna really help
keep the volume in your hair it's not
gonna weigh it down for some of you guys
you know if you walk outside when it's
raining or if it's wet out the first
thing your hair is going to do is either
go completely flat or it's gonna just
frizz up and just cause a lot of other
problems you know what our formula is
something you see in higher end brands
so that's what really got me hooked on
this hairspray spray it all around my
head you don't need too much of it so
I'm going to wait about 15-20 minutes
and then I'm going to come back take out
the curls and then show you guys some
other steps on how to keep it nice and
full and voluminous
you
and you're all done no just kidding can
you imagine matching we just left like
this now so when your curls look like
this that is how you know that they were
up in their pins long enough they're
nice and set there of course way to
spirally and way too tight but this is
the first step that you know you did it
right so the next thing we're going to
do before we start breaking up the curls
is we're going to add some volume powder
some of you guys may have never heard of
this before but it is the most genius
invention and I swear the first time I
tried this I was literally like gimme 10
bottles of this it's just absolutely
incredible
this is called the biotin volume and
texture magic valium powder this is also
by Schwarzkopf and wanted to quickly
mention that the three products that I
did use we you can find at your local
Walmart each product is only 697 so
they're all incredibly affordable which
is another reason why I absolutely love
them all you have to do for this is
section off your hair and tap it in
wherever you need the volume so I like
to do it all around the top sections of
my hair I'll start on this side I'm
going to just pull up the first curl
move it to the side
I always tell to my head a little bit
because we don't on this all over the
place and you're just gonna mess up and
get it on the face you're just going to
very lightly tap and you'll see the
powder come out and you just need a tiny
little bit you'll feel it's a little bit
cold but that's how you know that it's
coming out so I'm going to lift this
piece up as well
but down I'm gonna do it on this side
now remember a little bit goes a long
way you don't need a lot I'm going to
show you what you do next to really
activate it but again you don't want to
put too too much so now what you're
going to want to do is you give yourself
a nice little massage okay so this is
literally not even fully done but you
see already how much volume it's giving
me it's like magic I really don't
understand how it works but it's
incredible now that we have the volume
powder in I'm going to take my paddle
brush and I'm just gonna very very
lightly and when I mean very lightly
just brush through just gonna loosen up
the curls a bit it's gonna help lend
each section together and then the final
step to give it a little more volume is
of course you want I also want to let
you guys know I haven't washed my hair
in like two days so normally it's like
so flat ever since I got my card in
treatment so if you guys have had a
keratin treatment or if you guys have
just flatter hair again I can't speak
enough about this value powder the
second that I tried it it just literally
opened up my eyes to a whole new world
and I don't know where it's been all my
life but it's incredible so if you use
the volume powder and then you tease a
little bit your hair is not going to go
anywhere and the beauty of that powder
is even after a couple hours if your
hair is starting to look a little bit
flatter all you're going to do is
reactivate it by scratching your head
basically and it's going to give you
volume instantly so it's not like this
is going to disappear after a few hours
for those of you who don't really know
how to tease I like taking the hair
putting it forward and then back combing
very lightly you don't wanna do too much
because we don't want our hair to be
knotted but I like just doing it right
around and if you wanted to use the
front pieces you can do that as well
just
a little bit once you have it styled how
you like it
just apply a little more hairspray so
this is the final result these are my
latest tips and tricks on how to keep
your hair looking really full voluminous
and keeping the curls in all day or all
night so this routine I definitely
recommend for those of you guys that
maybe have some trouble in the past and
you can't get those curls to stay try it
out let me know if this technique works
better for you because I found that this
is really the only way that my hair will
stay curly all night so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I love you so much
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
