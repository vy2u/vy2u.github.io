about a week ago it was my birthday and
I went out with a bunch of my friends
and we celebrated we went to dinner and
I posted a few pictures and I saw some
people requesting a birthday makeup
tutorial so I wanted to recreate how I
did my makeup I wanted to thank you guys
again for all of your sweet birthday
wishes I felt so much love and I'm so so
gracious for every single person that
decided to wish me a happy birthday and
if you want to see how I did my makeup
look for my Night Out please keep
watching so to start off today's look
I'm going to be starting with my eyes
I'm filling in my eyebrows with my brow
bar to go in the darker shade since I'm
applying some glitter with this look I'm
going to be applying my eye makeup
before my face makeup so I will be
getting to that in a little bit to prime
my eyes I'm using the pursuade eyeshadow
base by sigma and this goes all over
your eyelid
picking up this matte black shade with
this smaller blending brush I'm going to
start blending out in my crease this
part is going to be a bit of a process
so bear with me I'm going to be using a
lot of colors and I'm going to slowly
add on as I continue the look but I'm
just starting out with the black color
and you want to apply this right into
your crease then grabbing this brown
color from that same palette I'm
applying that in my crease above the
black just to give it some more depth
and a little more shading
I'm then grabbing a larger blending
brush with that same brown shade and I'm
going to just blend out my work to give
it a nice blended look
picking up my vanilla pigment by Mac I'm
applying this color right on the inner
part of my eyelid I'm also applying it
on my tear duct
grabbing the color son for my Galaxy
chic palette I'm then applying this
right on the center part of my lid the
key to this look is to make it really
smoky I like using the brown shade and
then once I'm a little bit more finished
I go back to the black shade to really
make it pop but moving on to liner I'm
using the color wicked by Sigma and this
is just going all over my eyelids feel
for you to do whatever type of liner you
like best for your eye I always tend to
stick with the same type of liner
because it really accentuates my eyes
makes them appear longer then picking up
my white gold pigment I'm applying that
right over the vanilla pigment to really
make it pop it has a really shimmery
finish so it's gonna make your eyes look
really sparkly I'm going back to my
blending brush and I'm just going to
blend it out because the pigment can
leave a little bit of a fallout into the
crease so normally I don't stack lashes
but since we want super glam I'm going
to be stacking my two favorites which
are the Ardell whispies and the Mac 35s
and then over that I'm applying my
mascara L'Oreal telescopic of course
next I'm applying the champagne glitter
right on my lid and I'm blending it into
that white frosted pigment
taking this smaller brush and that black
shadow I'm then drawing right into the
crease of my eye and this is going to
help accentuate it and I'm gonna slowly
drag it out as you can see and this is
just going to be the first process of
darkening my crease so the key is to get
it nice and blended give it a nice faded
look and then now I'm going back with
the black to really make it stand out I
wanted to add some extra sparkle so I'm
using the loose glitter by the age these
sparkles are a bit bigger so they are
going to stand out a little bit more and
then mixing these two purple colors with
a bigger blending brush I'm going to be
blending that into my crease to give it
just a tiny hint of purple so now I'm
moving on to our face I'm applying Mac
strobe cream all over my face as a
primer for foundation I'm using one of
my all-time favorites which is the
Chanel in number 40 and I'm applying it
with my new Sigma 3d foundation brush
I'm taking a little bit more of that
black shadow and applying it in my
crease like I said it's a process and
sometimes I go out of order but if I
notice something I'll just go back to it
using the lighter brow bar to go I'm
taking the brown shade and I'm going to
start contouring my nose I like
contouring with this lip brush as usual
to contour I'm using this brown shade
from my Anastacio Beverly Hills contour
palette I'm applying this on my
cheekbones around my forehead on the
sides of my nose under my chin and also
on my neck do not forget to apply it on
your neck we don't want our faces being
different than our neck
moving onto concealer I'm using Makeup
Forever and number three and I'm
applying this with my mini Beauty
Blender
to highlight I'm using Mac prep and
prime in the color light boost and I'm
just applying some of this under my eyes
and I'm going to be blending it in with
this Mac brush as well as my Beauty
Blender
to set my concealer I'm using my Rimmel
these stay matte powder
picking up some more of that vanilla
pigment I'm applying that right into the
tear ducts of my eye as well as under my
brows
grabbing these two purple shadows with
the smaller brush I'm then lining my
lower lashline
to highlight my cheeks I'm using
mary-lou manizer by the balm I like to
apply this right along my cheekbones as
well as on the bridge of my nose and
also on my Cupid's bow for blush I'm
using this new one by Sigma and it's a
beautiful pink color and I'm just
applying it right on my cheeks I'm
grabbing a little bit more of that
contour shade to just darken up my face
a little bit for my birthday I had a
beautiful tan from my friend but now
it's all washing off so I'm feeling a
little extra pale so extra bronzer is
definitely a must for lipliner i'm using
the color world
and for lipstick I'm using one of my
favorites by wet-and-wild I'm not
exactly sure of the number but I will
list it below and the final step is to
add just a little bit more purple under
my eyes with a larger brush to give it a
nice smoky effect and that is it we are
finished with my makeup as far as my
hair I curled it for my birthday but you
guys don't need to see another video of
me curling my hair because you've seen
it so many times already so if you want
to see how I normally curl my hair I
will link all the videos below in the
description box so this is the final
result I hope you guys enjoyed this
video
to create the curls in my hair I'm using
the Bellamy 6 in-1 curler and I'm not
exactly sure what size this is but I
will link it below and I do have a
coupon code if anyone is interested in
buying it but this was how I did my hair
and makeup for my birthday I hope you
guys pull some inspiration from this
look and decide to get super glam for
your birthday because it is your one day
for the entire year so why not take it
on a little bit harder and feel extra
glam so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and until next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
