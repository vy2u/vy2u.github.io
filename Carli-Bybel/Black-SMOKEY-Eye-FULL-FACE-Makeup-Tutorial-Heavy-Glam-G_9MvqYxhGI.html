didn't need chasing relentlessly still
fight and I don't know I
is tragedy
are you my
if
and Saturday why
hi everyone thank you for watching I
hope everyone who celebrated Christmas
had an amazing holiday I'm sorry it's
been a little bit since I posted a video
I've been with family all week and just
kind of relaxing and been holiday spirit
but I wanted to get a video up for you
guys today I wanted to do something
really dramatic and sparkly and fun for
New Year's I don't think I've ever done
anything like all-black and dramatic
like this so I figured why not try it
out for New Year's I'm not really sure
what I have planned for New Year's yet
I'm probably just going to dinner and
then coming back to my house just to
hang out and relax nothing crazy
I've had my years of all the parties and
New York City and clubs and squishing
into somewhere where that you can't even
fit so yeah I'm over that whole scene
but what are your guys plans for New
Year's I would love to hear what you
guys are doing definitely comment below
and I hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
look it's definitely something different
and very dramatic so if you guys want to
learn how to get it please keep watching
to start off this look I'm just
moisturizing my skin with my Nerium day
cream
following that I'm using my Smashbox
photo finish primer and this one is for
color correcting and this is just going
all over my face for a foundation I'm
using by L'Oreal the magic nude and nude
beige when using this foundation you
want to make sure to shake it really
well before you apply it to your face
to fill my brows I'm using my brow bar
to go as usual and I just very lightly
go over my natural brows
so today I decided to do a cream contour
so I'm using my Ben Nye palette and I'm
taking this brown color and I'm applying
this all over the contours of my face
next I'm taking this foundation brush
and I'm just going to be smoothing in
all of the work I had just done so don't
worry we're not going to leave little
lines and circles all over our face
for concealer I'm using one of my
favorites the Laura Mercier and sc3 and
this is just going to go underneath my
eyes on the bridge of my nose and in
between my eyebrows also my chin and
yeah just basically everywhere you want
to highlight your face
next I'm just picking up some loose
powder to set my face
so start my eyes I'm using this Milani
eyeshadow pen and I'm just gonna be
coloring in my eyelid and this is going
to be like a creamy texture so I'm just
basically doing a little slopping lines
and then I'm going to take a I shadow
brush to smooth it in
with my blending brush and these two
light brown colors I'm just being mixing
the both of them and applying that right
into the crease of my eye and this is
going to help give you that faded look
later on picking up this black Sparkle
color called Eiffel by Sigma and my
blending brush I'm then going to start
blending in right into my crease and
then blending it down onto my lid
whenever I'm using really dark colors I
like to use an object with a straight
edge that way I can continue blending
and make sure it's a perfect straight
line
I first dip my brush into the mac fix+
to make the brush a little bit wet and
then I dip it into that same black
sparkly shadow and I'm just applying
this all over my entire eyelid eyeliner
is optional because it is such a dark
look but I'm just very quickly lining my
upper lash line with my Milani eyeliner
next comes lashes and mascara I'm using
these by Mac and my L'Oreal telescopic
next I'm taking this duel I shadow and
electrified and I'm using the lighter
color right on my lower lash line to
draw a nice sparkling line
I'm then using this gold eyeliner for
the inside of my eye and I've never used
this before inside but I thought it
looked really really cool and I figured
why not mix a little bit of gold into
this look I'm then going to take some
black loose glitter along with my fixed
plus and apply this right over my eyelid
just to give it a really shiny sparkly
finish
to line my lips I'm using neutral by
motives
I'm going to be mixing two lipsticks for
this look I'm using myth by Mac and then
I'm going to be mixing that with the NYX
orange soda lipstick as well
and to top this off I'm just applying a
really pretty nude gloss over the entire
look
for blush I'm using this new one I got
from motives and it's called
caramel and it's a mineral blush and
this is just going all over my cheeks
because you are the piece of me I wish I
didn't
chasing relentlessly
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I know it's
something very dramatic but I think it'd
be really fun to try out and for those
of you are like all black will not look
good on me try it out because you may be
surprised the key to this look is you
don't want the black to go too far off
you want to keep the really dark black
on your lids and then have it fade to
like almost a grey as it gets closer to
your eyebrows so I hope you guys enjoy
this video and learn something new and I
hope you all have an amazing safe
healthy Happy New Year and I'm gonna try
to get one more New Year's look up
before Tuesday so if you guys want to
see something please leave feedback
below let me know what you guys want to
see and make sure to thumbs up this
video if you guys want more New Year's
looks I love you guys so much and I will
see you guys next time
I dive into frozen waves where the past
comes back to life fight fear for the
selfish pain it was worth it every time
hold still right before we crash cause
we both know how this is
