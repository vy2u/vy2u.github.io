today I'm here with Danny
ah this is my cousin so just take a
second like look at this blonde hair
like isn't it crazy that we're cousins
where do you come from gray eye look
adopted I know yeah but look only blonde
let's just take a second for this
massive mane we call her Danny with the
hair today was I have her hair her
eyelashes she's just friggin perfect
doesn't she like a Barbie girl so I
actually did a blonde hair makeup look
with Danny probably like two years ago
to was a three it was like right when I
first started my channel so you guys
probably need to see that video since
you did enjoy me doing makeup on other
people I figured I would bring her in
for a fun blonde makeup look I would say
this is more for like a night out not
really a big time look because we did do
pretty heavy on the face but if you guys
want to learn how to get this look
please keep watching to start off this
look I'm going to be applying
moisturizer all over her face following
that I'm going to be priming her face I
like to apply my primer with my hands
that way I can make sure it's going on
evenly all over the skin
since it is summer we want to get for
that really pretty glow I'm applying
this Revlon highlighter all over her
face before I apply the foundation you
can really mix it in with your
foundation it's just preference I wanted
to do it this way at this time and with
a damp Beauty Blender I am using to your
nude skin foundation and this is in the
color 30 that I'm using on her so her
skin is gonna look really dewy and glowy
until I apply it with powder so don't
worry this is just the process that I
like to do so I'm also applying her
foundation on her neck and a little bit
on her chest just so everything is
blending nicely for concealer I'm using
the Tarte creaseless concealer in the
color light and I'm applying this
underneath her eyes I'm also applying it
right down the side of her nose because
it's going to help make her nose look a
lot more narrow especially since we're
gonna be contouring it so I'm also
dragging this line down over her smile
lines to highlight that area but playing
it on her chin in between her brows and
then a thin line right down the center
of her nose to blend out all of the
concealer I'm using that same damn
Beauty Blender that I just used
to contour her face I'm using the la
girl concealer and beautiful bronze and
I am just carving out where her
cheekbones are I'm applying this around
her forehead also around her jawline and
I'm gonna be contouring her nose as well
normally I like to stick with grayer
tones to contour but lately this one has
been one of my all-time favorites just
goes on so smooth and it blends really
nice so I'm blending out the brown with
another foundation brush and I'm slowly
dragging that into her hair lines make
it blend seamlessly
to blend out the sides of her nose I'm
just doing a tapping motion with my
finger I find that it keeps the product
on it's gonna help keep your nose
straight then with that same beauty
blender I'm just blending it in so if
the lines aren't as harsh and I'm just
blending in everything that I've done
all over her face to kind of again make
it all blend nicely to send her
concealer I am using my Laura Mercier
setting powder and this is going to
mattify the look so it's not going to be
so shiny and dewy and it's also going to
prevent your makeup from moving
now moving on to brows I'm using the
same out of sassy a kit that I used in
my last video I love this kit for people
other than myself because it has every
shade possible so it is a great
investment in my opinion if you are a
freelance artist to prime our eyes I'm
using this five in one base and I'm just
blending that in
then moving on to eyeshadow I'm using
this greenish gray shimmer color I
wanted to do something greenish because
her eyes are green and green and silver
look amazing on blonde haired people in
my opinion so I wanted to do that all
over the base and to brighten up the
green I'm picking up a little bit of
this green shadow and it's gonna give it
the perfect combination and then with
this L'Oreal palette and this tapered
blending brush I'm grabbing this light
brown color and I'm going to start
blending that in her crease originally I
wanted to do something a little bit more
dramatic on her eyes but she had an
interview after this so although I used
some color on the lids I kept it really
light
picking up this darker brown color I'm
blending that right in the outer V of
the eye just to give it a little bit
more depth then grabbing this dark
silver color I'm applying that on the
outer V of the eye the middle part of
the eye I'm applying the silver color
and then right in the tear duct I'm
applying the champagne color fall from
the same palette
then with that same darker gray color
and my pencil brush I'm just blending in
the lower lash line to blend into the
outer B so she didn't want any eyeliner
today so we're gonna move on right to
mascara I'm using my L'Oreal telescopic
mascara she has massive eyelashes so she
didn't want fake lashes of course if you
guys want to do a more natural look they
say that you should use a brown mascara
for blondes just so it's not so harsh
but I mean it's all about preference so
I would try Bowl to see which one you
prefer and then moving back onto her
face this one is just going to help get
rid of any dark shadows on the sides of
her nose so it's just gonna make the
look look a lot more flawless
moving on to the contour kit this one is
the Kat Von D I'm using the brown shades
and bronze up her face I'm applying that
everywhere I applied the cream contour
this is basically just gonna set the
cream contour it's going to give her a
little bit more color and it looks a
little bit harsh right now but I'm just
going back in with my damp Beauty
Blender and just blending it all out
four cheeks I'm using this beautiful
peach color this one's by Kiko and I
love peachy or pink tones for blondes I
think it just really goes great with the
complexion so I love how this turned out
I'm just very lightly going over the
contour on her nose with a big blending
brush and she barely needs her nose
contoured it's literally like the most
perfect nose in my opinion so just
wanted to balance out the contour on the
nose with the concert on the cheeks to
highlight her cheeks i'm using this
highlighter from Inglot actually it's a
body and face shimmer and it's first
time I'm using it and it's frickin
beautiful I love how sparkly it is for
lipstick I am using buttercup by Gerard
cosmetics it's the most perfect pink and
I love pink on blonds then for lip liner
I'm using by la girl
um+ the name again everything will be
listed in the description box as always
and then to top the look off I'm
applying a pink lip gloss also by Gerard
cosmetics and it's going to give it a
little bit of a gloss and it's also just
going to give it a little bit more of a
pink pigment
you
are you ready to see you I'm ready yeah
love it don't you look like a Barbie
idea I love your lips you have the lip
color I do you think so pretty okay so
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video

love it yeah so it looks gorgeous
so Danny actually has an interview in a
little bit so fingers crossed I bet
