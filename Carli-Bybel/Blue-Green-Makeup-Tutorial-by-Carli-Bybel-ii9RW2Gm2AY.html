how my makeup looks right now I suggest
you continue watching so you can learn
how I did this
first I'm taking a Mac shader brush and
my Revlon age-defy concealer and
applying that all over my entire eyelid
the first color I'll be using is aqua DZ
AK by Mac and I'm going to be applying
that in the inner part of my eye in this
look I'll be using four separate colors
on my eyelid so we're going to be
splitting it into four sections the
second color I'll be using is called
mutiny
it's a pigment from Mac and this is
going to go right next to that first
color right on my eyelid you want to
slowly blend in the colors to each other
so when you're applying the third color
which is cornflower by Mac this is going
to be going on the third section of your
eye
following this you're going to be taking
the color teal by Mac and also a
blending brush and applying this color
right in the crease of my eye I always
use whatever is on the lid first
I'm then using carbon by Mack and
applying this right on the outer forth
of my eye and blending it upwards into
the TL color I had place in my crease
taking the max shader brush and a pearly
white color from Mac I'm going to be
applying this on my brow bone using a
small angled brush by Mac I'll be going
back to that same teal color we had used
previously and outlining underneath my
eye to lighten this color up I'm going
to be applying the Mutiny pignon right
above this color
line your upper lash line with a black
liquid eyeliner
you
then apply your mascara thank you so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
