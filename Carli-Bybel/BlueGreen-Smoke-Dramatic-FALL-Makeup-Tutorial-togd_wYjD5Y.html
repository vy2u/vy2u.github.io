so happy to be back and filming for you
guys I recently went to the MAC store
and found and knew I showed all that I
was obsessed with so I wanted to use it
today to recreate this look and I think
it's super dramatic I think it's perfect
for the Fall
for a night out for a dinner date for a
night out clubbing really anything that
you guys want to do obviously this is
not a daytime look it's something more
dramatic I absolutely love how it came
out so I can't wait to share with you
guys how I got this look and please
comment below let me know what you guys
want to see this week I am filming two
more videos for you guys so I hope you
are excited because I'm super super
excited to finally be back in the swing
of things and back to my normal filming
schedule so I love you guys so much and
if you want to learn how I got this look
please keep watching start off this look
I'm just using whatever concealer is
left on my brush and I'm just using that
as an eyeshadow base to prime the outer
part of my eyes I'm using this Milani
shadow stick it's a dark black base to
help really bring out that black pigment
in the eyeshadow I'm just using
something with a straight edge and then
I am grabbing my blending brush and I'm
going to start blending out this cream
shadow
from my morphe palette I'm picking up
this black color just a tiny bit and I'm
going to start blending that in the
outer V of my eye depending on your eye
shape and how you prefer your smokey eye
you can apply this black a little higher
or a little lower I kind of do it right
in the middle so I'm just dragging this
out as I normally would and I'm just
going to keep blending it until I like
how it looks
so next I am picking up the eyeshadow
that I had mentioned in my intro this is
club by Mac I actually just got this
although I have known about it for a
while I just love how when you move it
from side to side it's either brown or
like a Bluegreen I have a pigment that's
really similar also by Mac it's called
blue Brown so I'm just applying this all
over my eyelid and I'm blending it into
the black on the outer corner as well
then grabbing my blending brush and
whatever is left on it I'm just shading
in the outer V and basically wherever I
had that black then I'm going back to
the morphe 35n palette I'm taking this
lighter brown shade and I'm just very
very lightly blending it on top of the
black just to give it a nicer faded look
then using this light pink shade from my
Carli bybel palette I'm applying this
right underneath my brows and also in my
inner tear-duct
then for liner I'm using my Kat Von D
tattoo liner to outline where I want my
liner I always use this first and then
I'll go in with a gel liner just to make
it a little bit darker I just find this
way to be a little bit easier for lashes
I am using the lash called winging by
the lower lashes going back to my
palette I'm picking up this dark plum
color with a pencil brush and I'm
blending this right on my lower lash
line as you can see I have these
gorgeous under eye wrinkles so I like to
do a thick lower lash line that way it
covers it so I'm grabbing the lighter
mauve shade from my palate as well and
I'm applying that right underneath that
darker cranberry line with that same
black color and a pencil brush I'm just
darkening the outer V and then I'm going
in with the blending brush and just
blending it again and then with a makeup
wipe I'm just straightening out any
lines making sure it looks good
going over the liner and just all those
little last-minute stuff so moving on to
my face I'm using the hoola bronzer by
benefit I just got it and I actually
really really love it so I'm kind of
applying it really sloppy right now I
just like to bronze up my face because
super pale from all of the concealers
and powders so I am just applying that
and then I'm gonna go to my blush and
then I take a clean brush and clean it
all up so don't worry if it looks a
little bit crazy at this point
for blush I am using the color for play
by NYX I also recently just picked this
one up and it's a really pretty peach
shade
using the same pink color that I
highlighted my eyes with I'm using that
with a small brush and just highlighting
the bridge of my nose I always like to
do this because it makes your nose
appear more narrow I'm gonna skip the
highlight on my cheeks today and I'm
just gonna blend this in really quickly
and then we're going to move on to lips
to line my lips I'm using subculture by
Mac it was a little bit lighter than I
had expected so at the end I'd go back
in with a different liner but I will get
to that when we get to that so after you
are done lining your lips I am using the
new liquid lipstick called resi by Umrah
and this is the first time that I'm
actually getting around to trying it and
it is the most beautiful nude color I
usually don't like to light up nudes but
it has a little bit of like a peach pink
undertone and I just think it's really
really really beautiful so
congratulations I think they're amazing
I can't wait to try the other colors
like going back in with my lip liner I'm
using the color stripped down just to
darken it a little bit
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video again remember
to comment below let me know what you
guys want to see this week I have a few
ideas in mind but of course I only want
to post what you want to see so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I love you
guys so much and until next time I will
see you guys later
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
