feel like I've had long enough with you
love that surely shifted my weight
hi everyone thank you for watching so
today I'm going to be teaching you how I
got this beautiful Bridal makeup look
it's very natural and I'm using a lot of
neutral colors but I think this would be
a perfect look for your big special day
I did use a lot of products that are
known to be long wear that don't have
SPF and I also use an amazing makeup
setting spray that really really holds
for special events so I just wanted to
let you guys know that I just got a new
szabo skirt discount yeah it's been so
long since I've gotten a code from them
but I will be listing it below this
beautiful white lace dress is from them
and it's funny because when I got this
in the mail I was like you know one day
when I get married I feel like I'll be
wearing this to some sort of event that
has to do with my wedding so if you guys
want to check out their website I will
be listing that below and these
beautiful earrings are from ludora boats
heat if you guys want to learn how to
get this look please keep watching to
prime my face I'm going to be using my
Smashbox the photo finish color
corrector this one is definitely my
favorite primer and I'm going to be
applying that all over my entire face
before this look I did wash my face and
use my moisturizer as I normally would
for foundation I'm using the Make Up For
Ever HD foundation and you want to make
sure you're using a foundation with no
SPF in it because that's going to give
you that white flash back and I'm mixing
this with the magic lumi illuminator and
what this is gonna do is just give your
skin a nice glowy look so I'm mixing the
two on my hand and then I'm going to be
picking that up with my foundation brush
next I'm gonna be filling in my eyebrows
with the brow bar to go and this darkest
brown color also I quickly contoured my
nose but that part was not on camera but
if you guys want to see how I do it I
will link below my highlighting contour
video and then following that I'm going
to be taking the gel part from the brow
bar and applying that just so my hair
stay up in place for concealer I'm using
by Laura Mercier this one is definitely
my favorites the secret camouflage and
sc3 and i'm going to be applying this
underneath my eyes and also on the sides
of my nose just to brighten up my face
and to blend all that and I'm using this
concealer brush from Sephora
whatever product is left on the brush
you're gonna then bring down the bridge
of your nose also in between your
eyebrows and on your chin and then
finish off your highlight to set my
concealer and foundation I'm using the
mineral finishing veil from Maybelline
this is just a loose translucent powder
and I'm going to be applying that all
over my face
to start off the eyes i'm using the BH
Malibu palette and I'm picking up this
cream color and I'm going to be applying
this all over my entire eyelid also in
my tear duct and underneath my eyebrows
next I'm picking up this tan color and
I'm going to be applying that on the
outer part of my eyelid over the cream
color we had just done
moving onto my 120 palette I'm picking
up this darker brown color and I'm going
to be applying that right over the outer
part that I had just done previously
with the tan color and this is just an
accentuated that tan color make it stand
out a little bit more going back to my
brow bar I'm picking up this dark brown
color again and I'm going to be applying
that right into my crease with my Mac
blending brush
then picking up this dark brown matte
color from the Malibu palette I'm going
to be applying this with a smaller
blending brush right in the outer V of
my eye and this is just going to
accentuate your eyes making them appear
larger
next I'm picking up this tan pigment
from Mac and this one was one of my
first pigments I ever got hence why it's
almost empty it is one of my favorites
but I'm going to be applying this right
on the crease and blending it down into
my eyelid and this is just going to give
you a really nice shimmery look to line
my eyes I'm going to be using a black
gel liner
you
and four lashes I'm using Bible or these
ones are definitely my favorite right
now I do have a coupon code which will
be listed below in the description box
and topping that off I'm going to be
using this mascara which is also by
L'Oreal but this one has a fluffier
brush so it's gonna prevent me from
getting spider-like lower lashes
following that I'm going to be lining my
lower lash line with that same tan
pigment from Mac for lips I'm going with
the Jordana tawny because I like a very
natural pinkish look for this
and following that I'm going to be using
this Mac lip gloss it's called talk
softly to me
the next step is going to be bronzer I'm
using the one I only use which is the
L'Oreal True Match in cocoa and I'm just
very very lightly going to be contouring
my cheeks but this is again gonna be
very very lightly in a very soft look
when applying your bronzer it's super
important not to forget your neck for
blush I'm picking up this light pink
color and I'm going to be applying that
to the apples of my cheek blending that
into the bronzer that I had just done
to give your skin that glowy highlight
I'm using by Mac it's called soft and
gentle and I'm going to be applying that
right onto my cheekbones and as you can
see it's really really shimmery and
pigmented
you
I'm also going to be picking up a little
bit with my finger and applying it right
on the Cupid's bow of my lips and also
applying a little bit right in the
center and if you saw my previous video
showing how to make your lips appear
larger this is one of my techniques
final step and the most important in my
opinion is to apply a makeup setting
spray this one is from model and a
bottle I got this right off of Amazon
and it's like hair spray for your face I
always say I love applying it because
it's guaranteed to stay on all night and
it's great for formal events and for
times where you need your makeup to stay
on all night
so this is the final result for those of
you trying this out for your wedding day
the biggest congratulations from me to
you that's so exciting and I definitely
need to see pictures so please hashtag
me if you decide to use my makeup look
and if you guys want to see any other
wedding looks maybe something more
dramatic definitely comment below in the
