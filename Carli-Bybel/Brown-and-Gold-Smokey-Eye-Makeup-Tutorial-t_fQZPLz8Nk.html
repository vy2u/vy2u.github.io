watching in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how I got this gold and
brown smokey eye first I'm going to be
using my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
and I'm going to be applying this all
over my entire eyelid and also
underneath my brow bone I'm taking my
ELF palette and I'm taking this gold
color and I'm going to be applying this
on the inner half of my eyelid
next I'm taking scotch tape I'm going to
be placing this right on my eye this is
going to prevent the eyeshadow from
falling all over my face you want to
take the tape and slide it from your
nose upwards and that's going to give
you a perfect line from your eye to the
end of your eyebrow the first color I'm
taking is by Mac this is a pigment it's
like a light brown color and also this
fluff brush I'm going to be applying
this on the middle part of my eyelid and
also in the crease
and then taking this chocolate brown
pigment and also applying this in the
crease of my eye blending it into the
two other colors I've used previously
then takings dark-brown mac pigment i'm
going to be applying this on the outer V
of my eye and blending it inwards
this is the darkest color I'll be using
the tape really helps when you're using
a lot of pigments because otherwise they
fall out all over your face so if you do
your foundation beforehand you're gonna
have to redo it which is always so
annoying
then remove the tape and you'll notice a
perfect line and it looks as if you had
just airbrushed it
then to line my upper lash line I'm
going to be using Maybelline eye studio
gel liner and also the brush that it
comes with
it's always easier to do your eyeliner
in steps I always do the outer part
first and then I open my eyes and I do
the inner part just connect the lines
afterwards
going back to my ELF palette I'm going
to be taking this white color and
applying this right under my brow bone
you then want to take the blending brush
and just blend in these colors
taking this bronze color and a small
brush I'm going to be applying this on
my lower lash line on the inner half
going back to the same dark brown color
I'm going to be lining the outer part of
my lower lash line as well
taking nyx glitter I'm going to be
taking a little bit of the school
glitter and applying it right on the
inner part of my eye this is just to
give my eye a little bit more of a shine
I'm using L'Oreal telescopic mascara and
applying it at this time for my lips I'm
using color your smile lip plumper from
whitening lightening and if you haven't
seen my previous videos I do have a
coupon code for 70% off so if you do
want to buy them you could check them

glosses are lip plumpers and they also

smokey eye look it's perfect for really

can even do it during the day thank you
