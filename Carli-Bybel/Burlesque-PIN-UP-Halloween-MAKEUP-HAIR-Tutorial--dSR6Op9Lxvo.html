Rebecca Co it's a provocative my address
today
and they by the way above Sunset Strip
Hills all the way my rings off my
Webster it makes that 12 they all like
what did you do for those furs
I am a good hi everyone thank you for
watching
so ever since I saw the movie burlesque
with Christina Aguilera I was dying to
recreate her makeup look she had the
coolest makeup looks and this one is one
that she wore while on stage it's very
very dramatic but it was when she was
wearing a bustier similar to this one so
I wanted to do the makeup inspired by
burlesque by Christina Aguilera and then
the hair is more inspired by 1920s
they're just the pin curls with the high
front and I figured this would be
perfect if you're dressing up as a
flapper if you're doing a pin-up girl or
if you're doing something from burlesque
or anything along those lines if you
aren't wearing pink feel free to switch
out the pink that I have in my eyes with
white and white glitter or even gold
really anything to match your outfit I
just wanted to show you the style on how
to do it
it makes your eyes look so much larger
and I love how dramatic this look is and
yeah I was going to without that Barbie
wig and cut it to make it look like
Christina Aguilera's hair in the movie
when she's wearing this outfit and this
makeup but honestly I didn't want to
scare anyone so really quick I just
wanted to say thank you so much to all
of you guys last Saturday when I was out
celebrating my birthday actually I hit 1
million subscribers and I was so blown
away I literally had a tear in my eye it
was so excited so honestly thank you
guys so much I really really appreciate
you and if you want to learn how to get
this burlesque slash pinup slash
whatever you want to call it look please
keep watching
my eyes I'm using this fantasy maker
palette by wet-and-wild and I'm using
this pink color and the reason I'm using
this is because it's a little bit sticky
so later on when I apply the glitter
it'll stick
next I'm going to be lining my upper
lash line and I'm going to be making it
a lot thicker than usual because this
whole look is going to make your eye
appear larger so since we are making
your eyelid space bigger we want the
line thick as possible
so for the next part we're recreating a
crease in your eye I'm using my pencil
brush from Mac and this black color and
we're just going to be drawing in a
crease as if your eyes were this big so
it's going to go right above your
natural crease and obviously my eyes are
a lot bigger to begin with but I wanted
to show you how to do this if you had
smaller eyes and you wanted to make them
appear a lot larger once you draw out
where you want your line you're then
going to take the same brush you use to
line your upper lash line and you're
going to be going over that line to make
it a darker line which is going to make
your crease look darker and a lot higher
up when you're extending this part out
you want this line to connect with your
eyeliner and you're just going to slowly
drag each line out until you have them
connect
then going back to the same pencil brush
and picking up a little bit of shadow
you're going to be blending in that line
to give it a more shaded look
then grabbing your blending brush you're
going to blend out all the work you just
did blending it upwards to give it a
nice faded look so normally for lashes I
never mentioned them but I've seen a ton
of comments of people asking what I've
been using recently and I've actually
been using since I'm at Vancouver the
velour lashes I stumbled upon their
booth because I saw all of them on
display and they just look so real
they're the hundred-percent mink hair so
they're a little bit different than the
normal disposable eyelashes these you
can get 25 to 30 wears out of as long as
of course you take care of them like
anything else but these ones are my
absolute favorite
they look amazing with little to no
mascara and again you get so many uses
out of them so I did get a coupon code
from them which I will be listing below
please excuse my horrible nails I am in
desperate need of a manicure to make
this look more dramatic I'm going to
apply lower false lashes and then I'm
going to be applying my mascara as usual
following that I'm taking the same black
color with my pencil brush and drawing a
line underneath my eye going over that
line with the same eyeliner brush just
to make it darker
I'm also going to be drawing in a couple
diagonal lines and from far away it's
going to make it look like dramatic
lower lashes once you created the space
in between the two lines you're then
going to take that same pink color and
just color in whole the white eye liner
is also going to make your eyes appear a
lot larger so I'm just applying this
right into the inner part of my lower
lash line just to be sure that the
glitter doesn't end up all over your
face I'm using fix+
on my brush and then I'm dipping it into
the glitter if you don't have that you
can also use eye drops as a cheaper
alternative and I'm just going to be
applying this all over the pink part and
just be very careful when you're doing
it but of course you're going to end up
going over all the lines with the black
eyeliner again just to make sure it
looks really neat in the movie christina
has a little beauty mark right under her
eye so I'm just drawing a little dot and
then applying a little black rhinestone
with eyelash glue
for lip liner I'm using more to love by
Mac and following that I'm using all
fired up by Mac as well and then on top
of that I'm putting the nude gloss just
to lighten it up a bit
I accidentally didn't record myself
doing those first two steps so this is
the final result
so now for the hair we're going to be
doing pin curls I'm going to be
splitting my hair into two sections and
tying the top part up for this look I'm
using the 19 millimeter one by new me
and I'm going to be curling all of the
curls towards my face if you guys want a
more in-depth tutorial on how I curl my
hair I'll list the different videos
below in the description box because
I've done a few and there are a lot
easier to follow what you want to do is
curl the curl back into place and then
pin it into place as well and that's
going to help the curls cool and also
help them stay in the same form without
falling by the time you're onto the top
part of your hair so after each curl
you're going to pin it up like this
you
you
I told you
are you kidding
ah
couple seconds once you get to the top
part of your hair you're going to want
to part it in a deep part and then
separate the hair you're also going to
want to separate the front from the back
you
once you have a malt pin you're then
gonna want to hairspray and let it sit
for a few minutes in the meantime I'm
going to be applying my pink blush from
the BH palette and once I've applied it
I'm going to be blending it in with my
foundation brush
you
you're going to notice once you pull out
the curlers that they're going to be a
lot of little curls so you're going to
take a brush like this and then just
brush right through a larger section and
it's going to help the curls all form
one bigger curl
next we're taking a teasing comb and
we're gonna be teasing the front piece
of your hair I like doing it in two to
three sections just to give it a lot of
height London eat the shitty lights
know where rules don't apply
after you've teased it you're then gonna
want to smooth it down just so when none
of that rat's nest is showing and you
can't
and then what I do is just tease around
the back part of my hair just to make it
blend in really nicely then what I'm
going to do is pin back the right side
of my hair and after I pin it back with
two to three bobby pins I'm going to be
applying a really nice sparkly clip
hey hey get a shoulder anymore
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial and hopefully
learn some new techniques again remember
if you're not wearing pink you can
always change the eye color to match
whatever you were doing but I wanted to
go straight from the movie so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and if you guys
recreate my look please tag me so I can
see it I love you guys and I'll see you
soon
