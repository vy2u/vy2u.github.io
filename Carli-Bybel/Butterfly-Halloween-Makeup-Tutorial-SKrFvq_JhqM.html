I created this butterfly makeup inspired
look first I'll be using my Jordana
liquid eye pencil drag the line towards
your nose and then up all the way around
until you get to the end of your eye
form a line where you would normally put
your eyeliner and connect the two lines
together
next using L'Oreal magic perfecting base
I'm going to be applying this right onto
my eyelid the first color I'm going to
be using is a pale yellow color from my
Celia makeup palette and I'm going to be
placing this on the inner thirds of my
eye next taking a lavender color also
from my Celia makeup palette I'm going
to be placing this color in the middle
third of my eye the last color I'm going
to be using for my eyelid is a dark
purple color and this is going to go
right on the outer corner of my eye once
you've added these three colors you're
gonna want to blend them all together
you may need to add a little bit more of
the shadow onto the colors to make it
blend evenly then we're going to go back
to the Jordana pencil and go over that
same black line just because whatever
the shadow covered you want it to be
darker
using my Mac pigment in frozen white I'm
going to be applying this right into the
tear duct of my eye
then line your upper lash line as you
normally would I'll be tying up one half
of my hair for this tutorial because I
am owning in me going the wings on one
side so whatever way you part your hair
if you wanted to pin one side up so you
can see this look better you can do that
right now I twist mine back and just pin
it with a bobby pin
your necks gonna draw the wing of a
butterfly on the side of your face
you're gonna start right where your two
lines meet and form a line going
outwards then create another line
starting where the other on line had
started dragging downwards forming
almost a triangle
then you're gonna create the bottom half
of the wing starting from the ends of
your lower lash line dragging it
downwards connecting it with the other
end if this does take a lot of patience
so do not try to rush this and if you do
mess up for whatever reason you can
always take a q-tip and smear away any
imperfections
then I'm gonna just create some detail
inside of the butterfly's wings
using my Maybelline gel liner I'm gonna
go over these lines just so the black is
extra dark using a small angled brush
and a black eyeshadow I'm just going to
do small Swift strokes right on the line
just to create a little bit more effect
in the butterfly's wing next I'm going
to be using a concealer brush and the
hot pink color from my Celia makeup
palette this color is gonna go on the
bottom half the wing and also the top
layer of the wing
I'm then going to pick up a purpley pink
shadow and leave this on the wing as
well going back to the same pale yellow
we had used earlier this is just gonna
finish off the wing I'm then taking my
wet and wild palette and taking the
white color and this I'm just gonna
place all around the side of my eye and
a little bit above my eyebrow using
eyelash glue this will help keep the
rhinestones that I'm going to be placing
inside the wing on my face without
actually hurting my face and they will
also come off super easily the
rhinestones that I'm using are just from
Michaels you can really get them at any
craft store I'm going to be taking the
bottom of a makeup brush and dipping it
into the glue putting the dots wherever
I want rhinestones placed I'm then going
to go through and add the rhinestones
wherever I put the glue
I'm applying a hot pink lipgloss by
Revlon and it's actually called hot pink
all over my lips so this is how I
created my butterfly inspired Halloween
makeup tutorial I hope that you liked it

have any other suggestions for me thank
