today inspire your day I feel like I was
making you guys wait forever but I am
finally here ready to show you guys my
brand new Carli bybel deluxe edition
palette so I posted a picture of the
front cover so you guys probably already
know all that but for those of you who
did and this is my left Edition this is
the size of my original so it's about
double in size and the original had 14
colors and the new one has 21 colors
funda clean it right into today's video
on the study guys a little bit about the
outside cover and I'm going to show you
all of the swatches and all that good
stuff so as you guys know my original
palette was a limited edition palette so
it was originally supposed to be done
for good on January 1st of this year
about a year ago I sat down the beach
and we decided to create a deluxe
edition of my palette and we decided to
keep it around for one more year so
instead of just keeping the original
around for one more year since you guys
were loving it I figured let's get a
couple more shades that way to keep it
for another year people can try out
something a little bit new and for those
of you guys who didn't get a chance to
get it maybe the first time around you
guys can try out the deluxe edition and
get some amazing new shades into your
makeup question really quickly I'll talk
about the price because you guys are
going to be blown away so the price for
my palette for the first 30 days is
going to be nineteen fifty so you guys
are going to get 15 iconic shades six
highlighter shades and that's all for
nineteen fifty and then after the first
30 days it's going to go up to 2250
which is still a bargain believe me this
palette is definitely worth at least 40
to 50 bucks in my opinion a lot of the
eyeshadow shades can use this
highlighter and a lot of the
highlighters can use this eyeshadow
shade so it is just the most amazing
talent and I know I'm going to be using
this every single day so as you guys can
see the design on the front is the same
design as
we know that that closes love with the
Pearl it's just a little bit brighter
and more white than the original and
then the writing is in rose gold instead
of the silver what's gonna know if you
guys can tell right now but I'm gonna
show you guys a close-up of it I'm going
to show you every single shade and with
swatch them and all that good stuff so
let's get into the colors and your
design you see the inside - without
further ado let's get into it
[Laughter]
so this bit this is my new palette is
pretty I'm so excited for you guys to
see it so this whole top row are all
brand new shades and then there are two
new eyeshadow shades as well and then we
have three new highlight shades so all
of the shades marked with this little
symbol are the new shades and the other
one can be found in my original palette
so let's talk about the brand new row
this row is so beautiful oranges and
pinks they're so perfect for spring and
summer this year these colors are really
on trend which is awesome so the first
shade is a beautiful matte light orange
shade then we have a light orange
shimmer with a purple sparkle and like a
purple undertone to it which is so
gorgeous especially when it hits the
light then we have a burnt orange matte
shade and the other two that I had
revealed in my last video the pink with
the yellow undertone and then the more
orange with a little bit of a yellow
undertone as well row number 2 we have
the mob shades all of them except these
second from the right are from my
original palette the new purple shimmer
shade is so gorgeous and I knew I wanted
to add like a shimmer to some of the mob
shades that I love and use the most and
then for the third row I have like my
Browns in my neutral row all of them
again are from the original palette
except for the middle matte brown shade
I felt like that was the one shade that
was really really missing for a brown
natural type of look a transition color
for the crease then we have the two
highlighters which are bigger pans the
one on the left is the original
highlight shade number two which was
your guys favorite I had done a Twitter
poll and that one seems to be overall
everyone's favorite so I made it into a
larger pan and the shade on the right is
a new highlight change is a beautiful
champagne e gold type of highlight I
felt like this color was really missing
from my palate as well and then we have
the bottom for highlight which all have
that beautiful flower on it the first
one is a beautiful icy white shade which
is brand new I wanted to incorporate a
lighter highlight for those with a paler
skin tone or for those that maybe a lot
of the shades in the last palette didn't
work for the second shade is very
similar to the original highlight number
one but this has a little bit more of
like a
alik see purple type of look like a
holographic type of look so I wanted to
keep something pretty similar because I
know a lot of people love that shade but
I wanted to add like a little bit of a
twist to it to make it a little bit more
fun so here you can see all of the
highlight shades next to each other but
again you can use some of the eyeshadows
as highlighters as well so I'm going to
show you two of the new highlighters in
action maybe I'll mix the three new
shades so I'm going to use the top right
shade and that's literally one light
just one and then I'm going to apply a
little bit of the white shade I use
different my eye shadow night in my tear
duct and then a little bit like right
here it is so pigmented it's ridiculous
like here look I just this is me
touching it once and like it's insane so
I'm going to use a tiny bit of that as
well right over that
insane okay so pretty
that is the gold che and then a little
like a little bit like I just lightly
tapped it because it's insane right over
that for my highlights on my note today
I used the white highlight shade and
then I used on the top row the second
peachy shade over it because that's what
I use on my list and then in my crease I
used the roll-on shadow bar and I use a
little bit of the mob shades as well so
if you guys want a tutorial on it let me
know but can we just take a minute
so this palette will go on pre-order one
week from today April 3rd and they will
begin to ship around the 18th of April
it might be a little sooner but we just
wanted to give you an approximate date
on when they will start shipping so you
will be able to purchase it on BH
Cosmetics calm it will be available on
Ulta and at the oval stores in a few
months but that's going to take a little
bit of time so my original palette will
be discontinued on Monday of next week
when this one goes first retail on BH
Cosmetics so if you guys didn't get the
original and you still want to try I
would go pick it up because some of
these shades from the original are no
longer in the deluxe edition I want to
keep all of my favorite shades and then
add a few more that I felt were needed
and necessary whenever I travel I always
bring my palette with me and it was
perfect palette for a daytime lover for
something more dramatic and yeah so I'm
super excited about it I hope you guys
love it as much as many like me just
take one more minute to just appreciate
this I am so obsessed with marble white
marble and I knew I had to incorporate
it in this next palette come on we
needed a white marble palette right I
feel like how is it not been down before
so I'm super excited about this it's so
pretty I hope you guys are going to love
it just as much as I do
we amps up the pigmentation for all of
the shades in this new palette so it is
even better than the original and you
guys are going to absolutely love it
so we also still have my little
am i with the penguin of course and it
comes with a little slip that way you
can protect your palate if you want to
keep it on they're totally up to you
guys but on the back you'll see a
picture of my palate a little bit about
it ingredients all that stuff for anyone
interested yes this palette is 100%
vegan and 100% cruelty free which is so
amazing and it's super affordable so any
of you guys can go out and try it and
yeah so that is I guess it for now I
think I covered everything and have to
do with my palette also very quickly I
just wanted to mention if anyone has any
questions concerns problems with their
order these funds medic has the most
amazing customer service team I know
anyone who purchase it the first time
around and had any issues you guys all
follow up with me and you were all a
hundred percent happy with the outcome
so again any issues you guys have if
you're not hearing back from them feel
free to tweet me that's the easiest way
to contact me and I will make sure I
send your order number and any problems
that you have directly to them and
everything will be handled so let's
probably have a smooth launch this time
around we don't break any websites I
think we got it covered this time they
had a much larger server and they should
be prepared this time so and it's so
excited thank you buddy
so much without any of you guys would
not even be possible but I really wanted
to keep the palette around for another
here and throw in some bonus shapes for
you guys because I mean if you want the
first ones a driver for sure to love the
deluxe edition so I love you guys so
