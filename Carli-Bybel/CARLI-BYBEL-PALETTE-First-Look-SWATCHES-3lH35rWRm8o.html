hi everybody thank you for watching I am
so excited to be making this video for
you guys if you follow me on any of my
social media you probably already heard
the big news that I design my own makeup
palette well it's eye shadow and
highlighters but this is my little baby
and I am seriously so excited to be
announcing this for you guys
I actually just hit my 4 year mark on
YouTube August 25th was four years since
I posted my first ever makeup video
which is honestly so crazy like so much
has changed in four years and I don't
know it's just weird to think about like
four years I've been making videos and
uploading them online like that's just
crazy thank you every single person that
has been with me since day one or anyone
that just found me yesterday you guys
seriously mean the world to me and I am
just so blessed and so excited to have
been given this opportunity to create
something for you guys
so I teamed up with BH Cosmetics to
create my 14 color eyeshadow and
highlighter palette one of the main
reasons that I wanted to team up with BH
was because when I first started
freelancing seven or eight years ago
they were one of the first companies
that I use I went out and I bought like
the 180 color eyeshadow palette I
remember thinking it was like the
coolest thing of life so BH holds a
special place in my heart because when I
wasn't able to afford any of the
higher-end items that's when I was using
and that's what I use to start my whole
entire career so when I came to me with
this idea it just only felt right
another main reason that I wanted to
work with BH Cosmetics for my first ever
palette is I wanted every single person
to be able to purchase it you guys are
going to literally die when you hear the
price I'm not allowed to say anything
yet because nothing's really finalized
but it's gonna be so affordable so I
feel like anybody can save up their
pennies and nickels and dimes and go and
get it if of course you want to so I put
so much hard work love and energy into
creating this palette for you guys and
not only are they colors that I
personally am obsessed with and I love I
feel that a lot of the colors that I use
will look amazing on any skin tone which
is awesome I wanted to create a palette
that could be used every single day it
can be used for daytime it can be used
for nighttime
something
we're dramatic or something just very
very very light so I'm so excited to be
sharing it with you guys I'm gonna do a
full review show you guys the inside
show you swatches of every single color
and yeah so I'm just gonna fill you all
in on my brand new Carli bybel palette
it will be launching in the beginning of
September I don't have an exact date for
you guys as of yet but of course I will
keep you posted so again I'm so excited
thank you all for the love so far I know
none of you have even seen the colors
yet and I've seen so much positive
feedback which is so amazing really
quickly before I get into the inside of
the palette I just wanted to let you
guys know that I wanted to create a
palette that looked nothing like
anything that I own or anything that
I've seen on the market I feel like so
many eyeshadow palettes are just black
or just plain and I don't want any
eyeshadow palette that's all white like
this so I thought it would stand out and
you guys wouldn't have to dig for it you
know that this was my palette and oh
another thing that I did is I have my
name on the side and a little baby
penguin a little pink penguin just so
you guys know that it's just me hanging
out on the back of the palette so the
front is like a cushion design with some
white pearls and just very very elegant
and chic looking I wanted it to kind of
match my whole Beauty room which is just
has a really shabby chic all-white vibe
to it
Oh
so this is my palette close up and
personal I'm going to go over the entire
outside and then I'm going to take you
guys through the inside so on the front
you can see the cushion design with some
pearls I wanted to keep the palette all
white and really chic and just really
beautiful so that's why I went with this
design on the binding of the palette you
can see my name and then a cute little
penguin I couldn't not include a penguin
so I figured that'd be a perfect little
hidden spot to keep it and I just wanted
you guys to think of me every time that
you saw it so here on the back the
cushion design transferred over also
there's like a really pretty border it
says a little bit about me on the top
and then it just has it in another
language and I also wanted to point out
that this palette is cruelty free so no
animals were harmed whatsoever when
creating it which is really really
exciting because I wanted to make sure
this time around that I did something
that was cruelty free for those of you
guys out there that only buy cruelty
free products so once you open up you
could see it says aspire to inspire
which I feel like has been my quote
since day one
it's also my poet on my Instagram
profile I think the main thing that I
have wanted to do and that I have done
since day one with this whole Beauty
career is I just wanted to make
everybody feel beautiful I wanted to
inspire you guys to step outside of your
comfort zones try new things and try
different makeup tricks that can help
you feel more beautiful on the outside
which in turn will of course make you
feel more beautiful on the inside so I
think that has really been my motto from
day one so that's why I wanted to
include that quote on the inside there's
also a nice little mirror this is my
palette I'm so excited to finally reveal
it to you guys here we have the ten eyes
shadow shades the first row is
definitely one of my favorites these two
shades right here I have been using
literally every single day you have your
neutral matte shade right here and then
we have a shimmer pinkish tone right
here then we have the two matte mauve
purpley colors that look amazing on
everybody one of the main reasons that I
wanted to pick these two colors is I
don't know if you guys know this but our
natural shadows of our faces have a
purple tone in it so instead of going
for your normal matte light brown shade
to just give you a very natural look try
using a shade like this and watch how
beautiful it looks on your
it's so gorgeous and it's so buildable
so you can keep it really natural or you
can build it up to be a little bit more
dramatic then we have the dark plum
right here which is just an absolute
gorgeous color that I think looks so
amazing on so many different skin tones
so many different hair colors I have
tested this palette out on a bunch of
people and I've noticed that just looks
amazing on everybody
then in the second where we have a
champagne shimmer we have a gold shimmer
we have a beautiful brown shimmer a
copper shimmer and then a matte dark
brown it's like a dark ash Brown which
is really really nice if you do wet this
shade it's going to give you an almost
black shadow so for those of you guys
that want to do a more dramatic look you
can really use this as either like a
medium to dark brown shade or if you get
your brush wet like I said it will give
you almost a black shade so this palette
is so versatile you can do so much with
it
for the last row these are the highlight
shades you can see they are pressed in
with a flower decal which is just so
gorgeous I feel like it adds to the
palette the first highlight shade is a
beautiful pink color then we have a more
champagne tone a gold tone and then this
one I actually use as a bronzer if you
use this as a bronzer you don't need a
lot of it but it's going to give you
that beautiful shimmery glow that
everybody is looking for it's a navy
that JLo glow so the best part about
these highlight shades is not only are
these four highlight shades but there's
a couple shades in here that can also be
used as highlighters when you first look
at the palette I know there's a couple
that look really similar for instance we
have this one that looks like this one
we have the two golds that look similar
and then these two look pretty similar
I'm going to show you guys the swatches
are the ones that may appear to be the
same they actually are very different so
I wanted to show you guys them side by
side so you can really see the
difference in them
so I just wanted to show you one of
these highlighters in action until I
actually get around to creating a
tutorial for you guys I'm going to use
the gold-tone for today and I'm
literally obsessed with these
highlighters they're so pigmented one
little dip and that's really all you
need and let's do like extra of course
so you could see that was literally just
one dip in and my biggest problem with
highlighters was I don't know if I was
doing it wrong or what the case was but
I would apply it and then I would never
get like that glow but these
highlighters they give you that glow
that I've always dreamed about so that's
just so exciting for me I'm also going
to apply the highlighter on the bridge
of my nose and also on my chin and above
my Cupid's bow so again that was
literally just one swipe if you guys
want to double it up and mix colors you
can do that as well here I'll pick up a
little bit of like that champagne and
I'll just throw a little bit over that
so pretty
sticking a lid on my finger and going to
highlight the nose I honestly can't even
like I'm barely barely touching them and
look at this talk about a bang for your
buck oh obsessed
and then I'm gonna take a little bit on
my chin I don't hurry
I hope you guys are as excited as I am I
hope you guys love the colors again a
lot of the colors that I chose I felt
would be great neutrals and earthy tones
for an everyday look and again a night
out look so this look that I'm wearing
right now it's pretty natural it's
definitely been my go-to I've been so
obsessed with the muah slash like purple
colors I think they are so gorgeous and
I think they look so great on so many
different skin tones I have used this
palette on all of my friends they've all
loved it and I tried so many different
looks with it so I'm so excited to start
creating some makeup tutorials using it
but for today I just wanted to give you
guys a full review of the palette show
you guys swatches show you every little
inch of it and I know I wrote a little
something on social media thanking all
of you guys but I just wanted to say it
again on camera that I'm not even
kidding you when I say like this all is
because of you I am blessed with these
opportunities because you guys found
something in me that you loved and that
you wanted to continue watching so thank
you guys so much you all literally are
my life and I don't think I go one day
without talking about some of you guys I
go through I read your comments and you
have no idea how much of a positive
impact evolve out of my life so I am so
so excited to finally be releasing
something of my own
that everybody can use and everyone can
purchase I'm so excited about the price
point I feel like anybody can afford it
and that was really my main goal so
again I saw some comments people were
like that's it she's making a palette
with BH like she couldn't done something
better and you know what that's fine for
some people if you feel you're too good
for cheaper or more affordable makeup
then that's fine you don't need to try
out my palette but this palette was
really for my everyday girl my
hard-working girl that maybe doesn't
have a lot of that extra money and they
want to try something out that's really
cool I hope you enjoyed and I will keep
you guys updated on dates of release and
all that stuff and yeah it's limited
edition so make sure you get it while
you still can
I love you guys so much thank you so
much for watching and until next
I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
