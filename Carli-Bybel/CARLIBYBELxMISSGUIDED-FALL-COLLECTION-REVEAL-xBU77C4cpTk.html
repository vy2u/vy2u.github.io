today it's finally the day I can show
you guys the clothing line that I
designed with misguided if you guys have
been following me you probably know that
I did a spring and summer collection
with them last year and I am super
excited to show you guys my fall and
winter line so since there are over 100
pieces like I didn't mention online I
figured to make life easier we would
split it into two drop dates so this is
the first drop right behind me right now
and then I have some more pieces that
will be launching I believe the date is
November 13th if I am wrong I will have
the correct date right here but I wanted
you guys to be able to pick out what you
wanted and not have like so much and be
so overwhelmed so there is a lot in the
first job I'm not gonna lie but anything
that does sell out we will be
relaunching for the second draw I am so
excited to show you guys the clothes
that I got to design this year they are
incredible a lot of embellishments the
fabrics are insane they're amazing
quality like the one that I'm wearing
right now this jumpsuit will be
available on the second launch for
holiday it comes in nude and black and
it's a fully embellished all the way
down to the floor but I'm gonna try and
keep the talking to a minimum I'm gonna
go through every single piece I'm gonna
say the prices and the sizes and again
I'm gonna try and keep it fast that way
you guys can see what you want write it
down and then be prepared for the launch
on October 17th so if you guys want to
see my fall and winter collection then
please keep watching so the first item
in my collection is this beautiful chain
top with rhinestones all over it I mean
do you guys see how shiny this is so it
goes over the neck like this okay the
shirt and then it has a tie or not a tie
it's like a little clip almost like a
necklace clip and then you clip it onto
the back like that so this is what it
looks like it has like that cowl neck
it's gonna be available in gold and
silver I'll show you guys the gold one
in a minute and this is gonna retail for
$45 so I just wanted to let you guys
know I wasn't in charge of the prices I
was in charge
designing and fabrics and all of that so
you guys know I tried my absolute best
to get these prices as low as humanly
possible but you guys can see the
quality it's not just like a silver mesh
it has rhinestones all over the entire
thing there's literally no editing or
anything on this right now and like look
at this so I'm doing everything in color
order these are a pair of super comfy
sweatpants very nice thick material
super soft on the inside so we did these
in three colors the white color is the
first and the white pair will be
available in u.s. sizes zero through
twelve they do run a little bit big they
stretch out just a little bit so if you
guys want them to fit more tight I would
go down to size if you like them a
little bit more baggy then you guys can
stay true to size or even go up a size
they do have the drawstring so you can
wear them super high-waisted tied up
tight and they will look really nice or
you can leave them untied and flip them
over where I'm a little low-cut up to
you I wore the two other colors actually
the past like week or so just because I
live in sweatpants probably like 80% of
the time so I new for this collection I
really wanted to throw in some comfy
everyday type of clothing the bottom is
tight as well for those of you guys
wondering and these soft hands will
retail for $35 so next up we have this
stone colored sweatshirt dress long
enough of course to wear it as a dress
you can wear leggings underneath it I do
have a couple of corsets in this line
which I will show you guys shortly as of
right now the sizes are 0 through 12 on
this particular item but I did follow up
trying to get this available in plus
sizes so the plus size will go all the
way up to size of us 20 but let me know
as soon as possible about this but they
are working their absolute best to try
and get this sweat your dress in the
plus-size as well it's the same material
as a sweat pants the inside is so silky
and soft so yeah you can wear it alone
with legging with the course that looks
super cute for my photo shoot I wore
this in the other color with one of the
corsets and I absolutely loved how it
looked and I also paired it with a pair
of thigh-highs and that's one shirt will
retail for 40 US dollars so next up we
have the same color sweatshirt it's a
cropped sweatshirt with the whole front
cut out
so I know a lot and will hate this style
I posted a picture in a similar type of
sweatshirt will months ago and
everyone's like what are you wearing but
I feel like it's gotten a lot more
popular and I personally wanted to
include it in my collection so I just
love it because if you want to show off
your outfit but keep yourself warm at
the same time this is the hoodie for you
and this retails for $30
so I mentioned that same shirt comes in
gold so what I would pair this with so
we would wear this as the top we would
put this hoodie on and then the white
sweatpants so I know it sounds a little
bit crazy but I'll show you guys a
picture of a model in this exact outfit
and I just think it looks so fabulous so
this shirt I still can't get over like
how it looks right now it's super fancy
you can wear with a pair of slacks you
can keep it super fancy or you can dress
it down and again with the sweatpants
and the structure and it's just a really
fun different style that I think is just
really cute for fall so next up we have
this beautiful dress it's like a cream
color and this is the one that I wore in
this photo
right here it's a ribbed fabric it's
thick enough that you won't see through
it but it's not like extremely extremely
thick but you'll notice if you guys
water it is the sleeves are a little bit
different so they're not perfectly
symmetrical and the reason for that is
because you can keep one up one slouched
I really wanted that slouchy look so
some people were like oh it doesn't fit
you right but that's how I made it I
made the sleeves longer so you can kind
of like bunch them up a little bit have
it like drink off of you and just give
you like that very like slouchy cute
comfortable look this dress fits like a
glove
I personally wore it in a size 2 it will
retail for $40 and this will be
available in u.s. sizes 0 through 20 the
next two pieces are sold individually
but they are two pieces it's a cute
little crop top in the same fabric same
color as that dress and then we have a
mini skirt as well to go with it these
both retail for 25 dollars each and they
are available in UF sizes 0 through 20
so next I want to show you 3 separate
pieces I actually took a photo in this
I'll show you guys right now I misplaced
the little banjo top I guess when I was
changing out of it I don't know where it
might be the Hamburg but we have the
high waisted knit legging same fabric as
the past two items they're available in
u.s. sizes 0 through 12 and they retail
for $25 the bando top is also available
u.s. 0 through 12 and it's $15 and the
choker that matches is $10 you can buy
that separately I know well not
everybody loves chokers so I wanted to
give you guys the options to buy it
separately you guys are going to see a
pattern of a lot of like matching
separates but I feel like for the past
five years
that has been my obsession I feel like
matching separates are so me and I
really wanted to keep this collection
really my style and things that I love
because although I want everyone to be
able to find something where and I want
everyone to love it I feel like the
reason that you guys love my fashion if
all my fashion is because you like my
style right I guess I mean maybe some of
the stuff is a little over the top but
birthday outfits
christmas is coming holiday parties New
Year's Eve like these are really fun
awesome times and I feel like you guys
should step outside of your comfort zone
a little bit try something new try
something embellished try something
maybe that you would not normally wear
and who might surprise yourself
so this skirt is the same fabric same
color as the two-piece this skirt will
be available in plus size so it will be
sizes 0 through 20 and this skirt
retails for $20 so next up we have
another two-piece we have these amazing
cropped leggings so they go below your
knee just mob fabric material everything
literally gives me life it's the most
perfect color and it matches the color
in my eyeshadow palette so you guys can
kind of see I'm wearing it today it just
looks so perfect together and then we
have the little matching bandeau top
both items will be available in u.s.
sizes 0 through 12 and the leggings are
25 bandeau top is 20 I know a lot of
these outfits maybe you guys might be
like how is this a fall outfit well
there's a lot of jackets in this
collection I would recommend wearing it
with the embellished jean jacket I think
it would look super cute together
there's also some other jackets that
will
launching on the second half of it that
would look great with it as well or you
guys can use a jacket that you already
own so next up is another one of my
favorites it's this beautiful muff silk
fabric they are trousers they're like
cargo trousers with a little pockets on
the side they have the tie to tie on the
waist they do fit a little bit
high-waisted and they do have the tight
ankle on the bottom so this is the first
color of three and these pants will be
available in u.s. sizes 0 through 20 and
I mean can we just take a minute to
appreciate this color silk like it's
incredible it's even more beautiful than
I could have ever imagined it would be I
did wear this and my photo shoot paired
it with a black lace bodysuit which I'll
show you in a minute and then I also
paired it with this insanely amazing
jacket so it is the same fabric you guys
can work together you can wear it
separately you can wear the mob leggings
with this and that little band so top
over it so this jacket has snaps all the
way down silver detail it has the
matching little pockets and the front it
has a tie around the waist it has
pockets down here as well and the
sleeves have these long ties on them so
you wrap them around and then you just
tie them and they kind of hang and I
feel like this jacket is replacing the
Palmer jacket this year so it's
lightweight super comfy I wore it like
three times in the Navy color when I was
out in LA I am just obsessed with it and
this jacket will be $75 this color will
be available in u.s. zero through 12 and
then the other color will be available
in 0 through 20 which I'll show you guys
in a minute so next up we have one of my
favorites I think I'm gonna say that
about basically everything but it's one
of my favorite two-piece outfits you can
buy it separately of course the first is
this lace crop top that comes with a
little pink bralette underneath this
pink top will be available in the US
sizes zero through 20 the top is 50 and
then are you guys ready to show these
pants I don't think you're ready
so these pants are going to be also us
at 0 through 20
at these pants so they are like a flare
leg lace pant with ruffles
they're incredible like look how they
like flow in the wind they do come with
pink underwear already built-in so if
you guys aren't into that see-through
look you're not gonna like these but I'm
daring you to try them because they're
so incredible and although they are
see-through the lace is pretty detailed
so it's not like you're just gonna like
seeing it right through it and just see
your butt I wore these in my photo shoot
in the Navy color that it also comes in
but these pants are 75 and the top is 50
so if you want to wear those pants but
you're not loving the shirt with it
I also have a bodysuit in the same color
the lace fabric this is the bodysuit
that I wore in black in this photo right
here it would look super cute with those
pants as well if I weren't gonna wear it
out I most likely would wear the pants
with this bodysuit like I may wear this
to the pop-up shop actually trying to
figure out what I'm gonna wear this body
C will be available for $50 in u.s.
sizes 0 through 12 this next dress makes
my heart skip a beat look at this dress
this fabric you guys it's like so thick
double line it's heavy as hell and I
mean just look at this velvet like
reflects light so beautifully I post in
an outfit in the very two-piece velvet
and you guys saw how insane the color of
it was now this is just as beautiful it
has like that bathroom type of vibe but
that's like really in this year so it
Criss crosses over it has a little ties
and it also has pockets so this dress
will be available in u.s. sizes 0
through 12 and it will retail for $85
and I know some of you guys may be like
oh well the fabrics cheap it's not worth
that this time around you guys like the
fabric is on a different level
we used all premium fabrics so once you
get it and you get to feel it and see it
you will appreciate it so much more
I would probably pair it with like a
pair of thigh high boots or maybe even
like ankle booties something like that
so next up we have the other sweatshirt
dress this is the one who wear my photo
shoots so it is that's hair
Sindhi hair on it
so there's like a little bit of like
makeup all around it from me I have to
wash it so next up we have a cropped
sweater in the same denim blue color
although it's cropped it's not like
super super crop I also have the
sweatpants in this color so if you wear
them together your stomach probably
won't even be showing because these are
super high waisted so the cropped
sweatshirt will be retailing for $30 in
0 through 12 and these sweatpants will
be 35 and 0 through 12 as well so you
guys know I had to throw in a jean
jacket obviously and I really wanted to
do something that I haven't seen yet so
we did a fully embellished ripped denim
oversized jacket so there are pearls
there's rhinestones there's silver studs
and take a look at this like look at the
back it's fully embellished it is
available in blue and black the black
will be launching on the second launch
so I feel like these are definitely
staples and everybody's wardrobe these
run very big this jacket will retail for
$95 in sizes 0 through 12 but like I
mentioned they are oversized so if
you're questioning if the larger cycles
that you try it out because they are
oversized and my mom fit into this u.s.
size 4 and she would normally buy like a
10 or 12 so I know in my last collection
you guys loved the rhibs mini dresses
and I think we had enough mint and like
a light pink this time around I wanted
to kind of do the newer style of that
version so here we have this little
square neck and mini dress it's in a
light gray ribbon to fabric it's super
90s this is like the new style for this
year can wear this with that cropped
stolen open hoodie over it pair of boots
you can really wear so many different
things you can wear it with a jean
jacket I love this color and I just love
how these dresses fit they're super
flattering and this will retail for $30
in u.s. sizes zero through 20 and that
Sam ribbed fabric we have the mini skirt
that we also had in the stone color this
will be $20 and u.s. sizes zero through
12 and then we have this really cute off
the shoulder Bardot style top that will
retail for 25 so it's going to be
that and then the sleeves are off the
shoulder but I live for these off the
shoulder Bardot top so of course with
this collection I had to create
something with that style yes why
another two-piece I know you guys loved
that baby pink crisscross suede dress
last year so I wanted to do like a newer
version of it and a two-piece and this
beautiful like icy blue gray faux suede
fabric again these fabrics are sick
they're nice they're great quality we
have the long sleeve crop top there are
ties down the front and also down the
side you can leave them hanging or you
can put them in a bow whichever you guys
prefer and then we have the matching
high-waisted skirt with the crisscross
is down the front and these will both be
available in sizes 0 through 12 for $45
each so just like the gray ripped mini
dress we also did it in this really cute
camel color it's super nice really girly
it's only $30 and this color will be
available in 0 through 12 are you guys
ready for this next outfit so this is a
1 and a half it's and I wore on my
billboard so if you guys didn't see
here's a little clip I went to visit my
billboard last night right in Times
Square such a surreal moment I'll give
you guys that clip really quick cuz my
sister and crazy and it's really cute
I hate you so we have a mini-dress can
we just take a minute so it's a
strapless mini dress with criss-cross
toes all down the side and ties down the
side as well like it almost looks wet
that's how amazing it is it has like a
bluish gold sparkle to it it almost
looks a little like a hint of purple
every way you move it just looks insane
so obviously I had to do a matching
choker
so the choker will be sold separately
for $15 the mini dress will be $70 it
zips up the entire back and this you
guys is perfect for your birthday for a
holiday party for New Year's it's just
so sparkly and amazing and I love how
the ties just like hang long it's so
funny because Kim Kardashian wore a very
similar like jumpsuit by Gucci which I
had this already designed before I even
saw her wear it but it's like a similar
type of look but this I think is even
better because it's not see-through and
it's just like incredible like look at
this not only did we do it in a dress
and a choker we also did a 2-piece so
the top which has criss-cross down the
front and down the sides kind of like
the suede outfit and then we also have
the matching skirt so the skirt has the
crisscross is down the front with the
long hangy pieces and you can even wear
this with that choker or you guys can do
a different choker with it that's why I
did the choker separately that way you
guys can kind of mix and match and we
just take a minute to appreciate so
these retail at $45 each and they will
be available in sizes at 0 through 12 so
you guys thought I was done right so we
also have this in a corset I was just
too in love with this fabric I couldn't
resist so this course that would look so
amazing with this sweater dress you wear
this in the middle and it kind of has
like that bluish tint you can also wear
it with the stone colored one I think
that would look amazing as well so you
could do either one and it looks
absolutely incredible one more thing I
have to show you so I was gonna show you
guys all the shoes last but we have them
in booties to match so yeah these are
literally like absolutely ridiculous so
these are lace-up booties with an open
toe and they have like this beautiful
like a grey silver lace on them so for
the billboard outfit I wore the tube top
dress the choker and these shoes and let
me tell you if you guys wear it all
together and it's such a statement it's
so incredible and it's so extra
obviously but I absolutely love it if
you guys love the fabric but you're like
I can wear a full outfit of the same
fabric you can do the sweater dress with
the corset and the boots I think that
would be amazing all of the shoes will
be available in u.s. sizes 5 to 10 and a
half these particular ones will retail
for $80 and that's because it has that
crazy expensive fabric on that the
corset belt will be available in a small
medium and a large
next up another one of my favorite it's
one of the first outfits that I posted
for you guys the army print all sequin
two-piece outfit I said I felt like a
spice girl in this outfit because of the
spice world movie winner and the camo
and the top will be retailing for $30
and the skirt will be $50 these are both
available in sizes 0 through 12 so you
can do the two-piece or you can do it in
just the mini dress which is incredible
as well it has that same square neck top
which is super in this year it has that
90's vibe which I absolutely love the
dress is $70 and it will be available in
sizes 0 through 12 next up we have a
really really really beautiful dress
it's a khaki silk fabric with black lace
details so there's black lace on the
sleeves there's black lace in the front
there's like a little slit in the front
and then it also comes with a black lace
matching choker so this one does come
with the choker you don't have to buy it
separately you don't have to wear it
with it either but I just think it looks
absolutely perfect altogether and it
will retail for $65
so we have the khaki silk in the cargo
pants again they have the tight bottoms
they have the pockets on them as well
they're high-waisted with a nice tie
this color will only be available in 0
through 12 and again they retail for $55
can wear this with the pink lace
bodysuit the black lace bodysuit you can
get to yet you can wear it with the army
print top look how cute that would look
together to with like a pair of black
booties which I got you covered on the
booties I'll show you guys them in a
little bit but this actually looks
really cute together like I might have
to wear this so next up we have another
one of my favorite two pieces I wore
this already these leggings are
life-changing they like suck you in all
kinds of way they're like Spanx honestly
they're amazing when I put these on I
was like why do my legs look so good
it's because they were being like sucked
in but they fit so nicely I'm obsessed
so these are Bowl available in sizes 0
through 12 the crop top is $25 and the
leggings are $30 honestly bester dollars
you'll ever spend and everything that I
have for me is a size 2 just to give you
guys reference so in that same fabric
with the same stripe detail we also have
this amazing sporty dress that does have
my makeup on it cuz I wore it for my
photo shoot I'll share that paint with
you guys right here but I just love how
sporty this is like look how cute this
is so next up we have the same dress
that I showed you guys in khaki in Navy
I'm not sure if I told you guys this one
does come in 0 through 20 in both colors
the khaki and the blue I don't remember
if I said it came up to 20 for the green
so if I said it wrong apologies but they
both do go up to size 20 so here is the
third color of the cargo silk pants so
we have the Navy obviously Navy is so
huge this year I'm obsessed with Navy
I'm gonna do like a navy smokey eye or
something like that to go with my line
but absolutely love these pants this
color goes up to a size 20 so it's us
sizes 0 through 20 and they retail for
$55 so these again you compare with
the black bodies to lake spotting suit
which I'm going to show you guys in a
minute
the black and pink lace bodysuit will be
available in navy for the second launch
so you can even do like an all Navy look
which would look so sick I can't wait
for the Navy at least body to come in
you can wear it with just that plain
stone rib top you can wear it with I
actually have a navy bandeau top which
you guys can wear with two I'll show you
guys that in a minute but super cute
these pants are literally everything so
as I was saying I have the Navy a
bandeau top in that same a slinky
material as the mob of two-piece that I
showed you guys like an hour ago in the
beginning of this video if I have to
show you guys everything this video
would be like two hours so it's better
off that I split it into two so we have
the Capri Navy leggings that fits so
nicely obsessed I love like the shiny
material and then we have the bando top
there are two pairs of shorts that I did
not get in time for this video the
reason that this video is so late
because I was waiting for them because I
love them they are bicycle shorts I wore
them in this picture right here in pink
they have rhinestones literally all over
them so they're see-through but you wear
them with the jacket that I showed you
in mob and then I also have it in navy
so unfortunately I didn't get them to
show you but there will be available in
pink and black in sizes 0 through 12 and
let me see how much they are on and they
will be available for $40 so the entire
things are rhinestone they're amazing
they look so cute on and I'm soaps that
I don't have them to show you guys these
leggings are $25 and the bando top is
$20 so you guys already saw the Mob silk
cargo style jacket I have it in navy as
well which I've worn this probably like
seven times already in the past like two
months and it also has the ties on the
sleeve and this colorway will be
available in sizes zero through 24
$75 guys we're in the homestretch here I
know this is a long video already I'm
trying to go like as quick as possible
so this next outfit I also wore during
my photo shoot so we have the lace
long-sleeve crop top with the bralette
underneath and then we have these
incredible pants and navy with the
frills on the side like I died over
these pants they're just they came up so
beautiful it's so detailed that it's not
like your bunch just add on
display but you're gonna see it a little
bit but I mean it's sexy it's for a
night out in the city or something like
that obviously we're not gonna wear this
grocery shopping I mean if you want to
that would be really cool and you should
take a picture because it's actually
really badass and yeah so a lot of these
outfits again our night out outfits
going out birthday holiday and the Navy
colorway will be available in sizes 0
through 12 the pants are 75 and the top
is 50 so that stone color dress that I
took a picture and we also have in the
Navy colorway but it's a mini instead of
the mini so it's a little bit shorter
same exact style so when you guys gotta
go notice the sleeves are a little bit
different it's not made incorrectly
because again I wanted like one off the
shoulder and I wanted to have like that
really slouchy look so that is why it
will look like that this will be
available for $35 and sizes 0 through 12
so next we finally have the black lace
bodysuit that I wore in this photo right
here and then I've been talking about I
wore a regular strapless bra with it and
it didn't show or anything this retails
for $50 in sizes 0 through 12 this next
dress is incredible I wore this grab my
photo shoot as well with the big faux
fur jacket over it so it's hard to like
hold up so you guys can really see it
Elise and self mini dress so these are
like the cups of it so it has a slit in
the front it has beautiful lace detail I
don't know if you guys can see it
perfectly but yeah it's super stretchy
fits amazingly I wear this in a size 2 I
probably could have went up one size so
next we have a pair of biker shorts
these are in the ribbed fabric and it's
in the black colorway but I wear them
alike with everything if you guys want
to wear them underneath the sweatshirt
dresses and last but not least we have
the sweatpants and there's a beautiful
plum color these will be available in
sizes 0 through 20 the sweatpants are 35
and the cropped sweatshirt is $30 so we
did this in the same colorway as well so
you can wear it together although it is
cropped like I said it's pretty long
sale so if you wear these high waist
your stomach doesn't need to show so you
can really make it show if you want but
it won't if you don't want it
this color is so gorgeous I'm obsessed I
have a couple other items in a similar
color for my second drop which I'm
obsessed with but for the first job
these are the items that we chose so I
hope you guys are excited these are the
pieces and my drop one of my Carli bybel
misguided collection I'm going to just
show you guys a couple of the shoes that
will be dropping with the first launch
as well and then I'll give you guys like
a quick little skim through of job
number two that way you guys can see
like all the fun super embellished
pieces that I have for holiday and all
that good stuff so you guys already saw
these amazing insane shoes we also have
them in the black silk lace would look
amazing with any of the silk joggers you
can really pair them with basically
every single out but I wanted to do kind
of a shoe that would go with basically
the entire range the black will retail
for $70 and the shimmer ones will be $80
then we have these amazing sandals in
pink and black these will be retailing
for $65 these are super on-trend right
now they have like the coil ankle so you
kind of like wrap them around your ankle
to get them in they adjust so they move
all different ways if you want to have
them like super high like that if you
want to keep them more low towards your
ankle they're very flexible and bendy
and sparkly so I mean come on look at
these we have some soft booties we have
them in black with two silver stripes it
also will be coming in nude with two
gold stripes and then also in grey with
silver stripes and these sock booties as
much as some of you guys want to hang on
them they are very in style very
on-trend and they're just super comfy
those booties will retail for sixty-five
dollars and last but not least I've been
wearing hats a lot lately like just to
run errands to run to go get coffee like
I roll out of bed and my hair is a mess
and I just wanna like throw a hat on so
I figured I would include two little
hats in this collection as well black
and we have nude and I don't know if you
guys can see but it says Bible on it so
it says my last name and gold studs but
I just think it looks super cool so
they're just like super cute little hats
and yeah I just figured they
a cute little add-in into my collection
just because I was doing some
accessories this year so that is it for
the first drop of my Carly Bible
misguided collection which will be
launching October 17th which is my
birthday so I'm super excited about it
crying all goes well and we don't crash
the site and everyone can check out
smoothly but guys know how these collabs
go sometimes there's a lot of people
there at once and it doesn't always go
as planned I hope you guys love these
items as much as I do
I spend so much time and energy and put
so much love into every little piece so
I cannot wait to see you guys wearing
some of my collection you guys know to
tag me and hash tag me so I can see it
because there's nothing cooler I love
