today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this classic holiday glam so
tomorrow morning around 5 a.m. I leave
for the airport I'm taking my mom to the
Bahamas for 55th birthday so it's a
special birthday this year so if you're
going to go all out and plan a really
nice trip for her so I'm super excited
but I wanted to get one more video out
before I left so I woke up like 6
o'clock this morning and I filmed this
video for you guys so I really hope that
you enjoy it so if you guys want to see
how I got this makeup look right here
and then please keep watching hi guys so
to start off this look I'm using my
Milani shadow eyes I want to apologize
in advance I'm kind of whispering right
now it's currently 1:30 in the morning
and my mom is in the other room sleeping
you're getting up in three and a half
four hours and I'm now finally getting
to edit my video I will fill you all in
in my vlog on what happened tonight but
moving on to the tutorial I'm using the
little palette by morphe and i'm picking
up that nude shade and i'm applying it
all over my eyelid I'm then going in
with this lighter brown shade and a big
fluffy brush and I'm blending that into
my crease for today's look I wanted to
do something really like simple on the
eyes so I know it's another look with
browns and nudes but for today's look I
really wanted to do like a classic
holiday look and I knew I wanted to do
like a bright red lip and I feel like
whenever I do a bright red lip I always
keep it more simple and neutral on the
eyes and I know I'll be wearing this
look a ton throughout the next month so
I am going in with this darker brown
shade and this smaller blending brush
and I'm applying that in the outer V of
my eye feel free to apply as much as you
want at first I was going to keep it a
little bit lighter but with the lights
and everything it kind of washes it out
a bit so I added a little bit more into
the crease just to give it a little bit
more depth into my eye
then I'm picking up my chart liner and I
am drawing on a super long wing cuz I
forgot to mention I feel like whenever I
do a red lip I need like a long wing
symbolise just like a classic look that
never gets old in my opinion so to
highlight in my inner tear duct and
underneath my brow I'm using the color
moonstone by Becca cosmetics I'm
applying a little bit more than usual
and I'm really brightening up the inner
corner of my eye and underneath my brow
and the reason I'm doing that is I
really don't like cheek highlighter and
I wanted this look to be glowy so I'm
just kind of adding a little bit more
than I normally would so how many of you
guys were like waiting for Brett's voice
as soon as this tutorial started
honestly I was out all day for hours and
I'm like oh I wish I saved this video
for the voice-over because it would have
been perfect and I almost had him do it
again but I was like you know what let's
not overdo it but I'm so happy you guys
enjoyed that video by the way I'm glad
you all got a nice laugh out of it so
I'm now applying my mascara and I'm then
going in with my pencil brush and this
brown shade and I am blending that on my
lower lash line
and then I'm applying a little mascara
on the lower lash line as well and I'm
applying a nude liner which is gonna
open up my eyes a bit there there what
are you thinking whoa think you could
jump in front of my camera on filming
next I'm bronzing up my face with this
NYX contour palette just applying it all
over my cheeks my forehead under my chin
and I'm also going over my contour lines
if you guys want to see how I did my
exact makeup routine I will link the
video below I posted it two weeks ago
and nothing has changed I did that exact
routine so if you guys want to go check
it out and then for lips i'm using the
color Evan ooh by color pop it was the
first time that I used it and I have to
say it was on my lips for like eight or
nine hours I ate everything and it
lasted really nice all day and it's a
very thin formula so it felt almost more
of like a stain although the color was
soso pigmented so I was so happy with it
and then I'm going to highlight the
bridge of my nose with that same
highlight and I'm also going to be
highlighting my boogers you know right
above my lip and then I'm using this
color pop blush I honestly do not know
the color offhand but I will list it
below for you guys and then to set this
entire look I'm using my NYX matte
setting spray so now I'm off to pack
wish me luck and I'll see you guys soon
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I will be away
until next Tuesday night so I will try
and get a new video up as soon as
possible I will be blogging while on the
way so I will have that to edit once I
get back as well I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
