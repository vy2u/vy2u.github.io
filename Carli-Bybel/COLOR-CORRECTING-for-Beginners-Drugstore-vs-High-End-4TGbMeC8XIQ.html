today's video I'm going to be talking
all about color correcting in my last
video I had mentioned possibly doing
this type of video and it seems like 99%
of you wanted to see it so I want to sit
down today and go through everything
that has to do with color correcting so
for those of you out there that I've
never heard of it or for those of you
who haven't are just a little bit
confused hold in this video will help
you out I did recently get a new mic so
I have that plugged in and I threw
blankets all over the floor to try to
get rid of that echo so hopefully this
video will be a little bit better so I
do apologize the echo has been annoying
in the past couple of videos I do
everything myself I film I edit I do
lighting that you sounded everything and
my previous two places that we were in
had carpet so I never ever had this
problem before so bear with me while I
try and figure it out in this video I'm
going to talk about all the different
colors what they're good for and then
I'm going to show you all the colors in
action so we did run to the drugstore
this morning so I can pick up a color
corrector that way I could do half of my
face drugs or half of a higher end that
way I can kind of for myself test down
see there is a big difference between
the products and then also for you guys
I can suggest whatever is best for your
budget so I'm going to go through and
show you some of my favorite products
I'm going to explain each of the colors
and then I'm going to show you the
demonstrations so if you guys want to
learn a little bit more about color
correcting please keep watching so for
all my beginners out there the number
one
thing to look at when you are trying to
learn about color correcting is the
color wheel so the color wheels and
explain everything whatever color you're
trying to get rid of you look directly
across the opposite end and that's going
to be the car you use to cancel it out
so if you guys ever get confused in the
future make sure to just google it and
you could see this picture pop up for
your own sake it's so easy once you
actually look at it I'm going to go
through each color now and just explain
which one does what and what I like to
use each one for so first I'm going to
talk about the bright orange color that
one is my personal favorite what the
orange color does is it cancels out the
blue tones underneath your eyes so if
you guys have really dark circles or if
you have like that blue purple tint
underneath your eyes the orange will
help immensely that is the color that I
find myself using the most I never use
the bright red I prefer the orange but
if you have a darker complexion darker
skin tones the red can be used in the
same area to help really get rid of
those dark circles before I go any
further I just wanted to mention before
you do any color correcting there's a
routine that I personally recommend to
help keep your makeup looking really
smooth and not cakey because sometimes
when we get color correcting it's adding
another layer to your routine so if
you're not blending it right or if
you're not doing it the right way it can
look a little bit more cakey it could
dry up on your face so what I personally
recommend and what I've been doing for a
really long time now is I always wash my
face every single night and morning so
perform doing my makeup I'll wash my
face after I wash my face I will use my
moisturizer the one that I'm using
currently is by Mario Badescu so I will
always apply the moisturizer and then I
go in with my primer so the primer that
I've been using the one that I love is
portion of Moore by dr. Brandt so every
single time
make up whether it's in the morning or
at night I always do the same thing I
wash my face I apply my moisturizer and
then I applied my primer there's a few
reasons that I do this and I just want
to explain for the beginners out there
who maybe don't understand or for some
people maybe don't do this every single
day the reason that I like to wash my
face beforehand is because you're
removing anything from the night before
so at night I like to apply my serums
and everything like that so you're
washing off all of the excess product
from the night before also I believe
makeup goes on so much better when you
have a nice clean fresh face to start
with I love applying a nice moisturizer
because the moisturizer is going to
really help lock in the moisture on your
skin then you apply the primer the
primer is going to act as a barrier to
protect your skin from the makeup so I
definitely recommend doing those three
things before you go apply your makeup
especially with color correcting because
it's going to help again give it a more
even a perfect flawless look at the end
so after the primer that's what all the
color correcting and concealing comes in
people get confused whether to apply
concealer before after foundation and my
tip for you guys is to apply the color
correctors and then to apply concealer
just to cover pimples or anything like
that before the foundation so the only
time I use concealer before my
foundation is if I have a pimple and I
want to cover it any concealing as far
as our circles or anything like that I
always like to do after the foundation
and then after I talk about
all this you'll see my routine
afterwards showing you guys exactly what
I'm talking about so moving on to the
next color I'm going to be talking about
minced green color the main green is
going to cancel out any redness on your
face whether you have pimples or if you
have some red things I know I have like
a broken blood vessel right here on my
nose so you can apply the green on there
to be perfectly honest on myself I don't
really ever use the green because I
never noticed my redness coming through
at the end of the day so again
everybody's different all of our skin
tones are different so what I want you
guys to do is look at yourself in the
mirror see what part of your skin you
want to correct whether you have that
redness or if you have those dark
circles and then you base my information
on that so the green again is for the
redness it's gonna cancel it out moving
on to the purple I think this one is the
most confusing for most people the light
purple color is going to cancel out any
yellow tones in your skin so if you have
like that sallow looking complexion a
little bit of a yellow tint that purple
is going to really really brighten it up
also if you guys have the beginning
stages of a bruise you know sometimes it
can look a little bit yellow if you
apply the purple over that it will
cancel it out I also personally love
using a purple powder to set everything
I recently picked up one my makeup
forever and then I also have the one by
Mac it's a purple tone and I like to
apply that actually under my eyes after
I've done everything it really really
brightens it up so I love the purple I
think it's a really great color for my
skin I normally never use the purple
concealer but at the end the video I
show you guys
in action just so you can kind of see
where I put it and everything like that
so next moving on to the yellow
concealer the elephant Caesar I think is
more Universal it's good for all skin
tones yell it's just gonna really cancel
out any purpley tones so we want to use
that under your eyes if you want to just
kind of even out your complexion you can
kind of apply it anywhere I personally
like to use either a yellow or a salmon
color concealer basically every single
day it really just brightens up your
face and it brings everything forward so
it really highlights it as well if you
guys are in the market for a good yellow
concealer those are a lot easier to find
you don't really need a Braille to bring
out the brightness you can use like a
pale pastel yellow or even a yellow
closer to your skin tone and that will
help really brighten it up so the next
color that I want to talk about is the
salmon color which is also one of my
absolute favorites I use this probably
the most other than the orange the
salmon concealer is also really good for
covering up dark circles so this is a
great alternative to use instead of the
orange another recommendation I have for
you guys is if you have severe dark
circles under your eyes try the orange
apply your foundation and then apply a
salmon color concealer over that and
that will just double the coverage and I
personally love the salmon concealers I
will list a bunch of my favorites below
that way you guys can check them out if
you are interested the last color that
I'm going to talk about I don't ever use
as a concealer I use mostly for powder
which I do show you guys again in this
video I have the Ben Nye pretty pink
translucent powder I also tried out a
bunch of different prints because I was
on like a huge kick of using pink
powders the pink powders are used to set
the concealer so if you find that you
have those at the dark dark circles and
nothing can cover them up instead
a translucent powder try to think powder
because that's gonna add a little bit of
color as well and the pink really helps
kids love that gray dullness so if you
find that ours gets you apply our
foundation in your concealer and your
color correctors and all of that you're
still noticing those colors coming
through try the pink powder as well and
that's just going to help lock in and
help cancel out any of that darkness
underneath your eyes so I use the pink
powder today and I actually realize how
much I missed it my under eyes are
literally so bright and they don't see
any of the color coming through what's
really cool is I did half of my face
drugstore and then half of my face
higher-end color corrector
so I did use my normal foundation
concealer powders and everything like
that but I did try a higher-end on this
side and then the drugstore on this side
and I have to say overall I don't see a
big difference whatsoever so if you guys
are on a budget don't go out and spend
all this crazy money on this higher-end
color correctors and you can get the
exact same results with something a lot
more affordable yesterday I tried out
this exact technique and it's exact
routine just to kind of see throughout
the day how it lasted and I kept my
makeup on all day and I didn't notice
that one side looks better than the
other so I think overall this NYX
palette is probably your best bet as far
as color correcting especially if you're
a beginner and you're just trying it out
don't feel like you need to go out and
buy a huge kit like this it's so
beautiful and I wanted it because I know
how to use each color umm I recommend
this kit if you are a makeup artist and
you are working on a lot of different
skin tones but if this is just for
yourself you definitely don't need to go
out and spend all this crazy money on
correctors I was very pleasantly
surprised to see how well that the
drugstore corrupters worked in
comparison to the higher-end so I'm
actually really
to share this news with you guys because
sometimes I will try some products when
the drugstore I'll be a little bit
disappointed but as far as the
correctors I think they're amazing so I
think that's really it as far as colors
make sure to check out the color wheel
again if you ever have any problems in
the future that way you don't have to
watch this entire video you can just
check out the color wheel see which
color is opposite and then that's how
you know how to neutralize the color so
if you guys want to see some of the
color correctors in action please keep
watching first up I'm using the orange
concealer to get rid of my dark circles
on my left side which is the right side
looking at the computer screen I am
applying my higher-end products and then
on the left side I'm applying my
drugstore products I just recently got
this becca corrector this was my first
time using it off hand i do notice that
the la girl concealer is a little bit
more pigmented and it's only three
dollars which is just ridiculous for the
green color i'm going to correct a
little bit of the redness on my face i'm
using the sephora Pantone palette for
the bright side and again i'm just
applying this on any pimples that I have
also I have a little bit of redness on
the sides of my nose
for the left side of my face I'm using
the NYX palette I'm picking up that
green shade and again applying it around
my nose and also on any pimples on the
left side of my face
next I'm using the lavender as I
mentioned previously I normally don't
use this color when I'm applying my
foundation overall I liked how it looked
in the end so maybe I will start using
it but I'm just gonna be applying this
on the high points of my cheeks I like
using a purple powder to really brighten
up my face so I figured I'll just apply
some on my cheeks just to brighten them
up a bit if you guys have any yellow
discoloration on your skin that is where
you would apply the purple but in this
case I just wanted to show you guys in
action so I'm not really covering up
anything yellow so as you can see as I
apply each color I'm using my Beauty
Blender which is a little bit damp and
I'm just pressing in the product that
way it's not leaving a thick layer on my
skin it's just a very very thin layer
for a foundation I'm using my makeup
forever
Ultra HD foundation in number 127 I'm
just dotting it on my face and then I'm
gonna be blending it in with my RT sovel
8 brush so as you can see I'm using a
very light hand and I'm not doing a lot
of rubbing you don't want to rub the
product in because then it's just gonna
completely take away the color corrector
so with a light hand blend in your
foundation and you will see it'll cover
perfectly you won't see it through the
foundation which is key
building onto concealer I'm using this
one by anastasia beverly hills it's
number 1.0 and i'm applying this right
underneath my eyes i am applying this in
a downward triangle if you are using an
orange corrector you want to make sure
you're using a concealer that's going to
cover the corrector and when you do it
in a downwards motion like this it's
going to really help bring that area
forward which is what we want because
when we have darker circles it makes
your eyes look more tired and this
technique will help brighten up your
face
I'm applying whatever concealers left on
my Beauty Blender on my eyes just to get
rid of the discoloration as well and
then I am magically contouring my nose
and then I'm going in with this pretty
pink powder by Ben Nye and I explained
why I like using this especially if you
have dark circles in the beginning of my
video after you let it sit for a couple
of minutes you just want to brush it off
and then I'm going in with this Mac
mineralized skinfinish
and I'm just applying that all over my
face just to set my foundation I'm going
to finish the rest of my makeup
off-camera but I wanted to show you guys
how to set the color correctors if you
want you can just leave it like this and
then go on with your day
or you can continue on with the blush
the bronzer and all of that good stuff
so I just finished up the rest of my
makeup and I'm extremely happy with how
the drugstore side held up as well as
the higher end so I think if you guys
are just starting out with school color
crafting thing try the drugstore try it
out and see that you really love the
outcome and you find that it's amazing
and want to try some other color
correcting palettes of course you're
like do what you want to do but I
definitely recommend the drugstore I
think they're great for anyone on a
budget as well as anyone who's just
trying to try these cool techniques out
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
love you so much and until next time I
will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
