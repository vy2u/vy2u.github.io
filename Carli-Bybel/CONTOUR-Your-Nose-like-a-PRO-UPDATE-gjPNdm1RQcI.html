today's video I'm going to be doing an
update on how I contour my nose or a
non-surgical nose job I have learned so
many new tricks so many new techniques
and I've also found some really great
products that I've been using lately and
I really have seen the difference
personally and I know you guys have too
so it's just all about contouring right
for your nose shapes so if you guys want
to learn some of my new techniques
please keep watching ok guys so to start
off the nose contour you're going to
need a brush though to that I'm obsessed
with to contour my nose and I'm only
ever using these two are the Sigma L 0 5
and the morphe 170 - 6 they're pretty
similar um they're both really really
good I only use these two I go back and
forth whatever one I see first is
usually the one that I grab um the next
thing that you're going to need is a
cream contour shade I prefer to contour
my nose with a cream contour and then
setting it with a powder that way it
lasts a lot longer and it just looks
more natural in my opinion there are a
few videos were I showed you guys how to
just do a contour with the powder so I
just prefer to use the cream first
so one color that I'm obsessed with when
my skin tone is lighter is the RC ma
palette and it's this color right here
you can see it has a very gray tone to
it again this one is perfect for when my
skin tone is lighter when I have a spray
tan
or when I'm just tan I like using coffee
walnut by Mac unfortunately this one is
discontinued I think they have a few
left on Amazon but they really hiked up
the price for these I don't know why
they don't have these anymore these are
the pro sculpting creams I know they
have the pro sculpting powders but I
prefer again the creams so today soon
my spray tan is basically washed off I
am going to start contouring my nose
before this video started I applied
primer foundation concealer under my
eyes and then I set the concealer with a
little bit of powder so now I'm going in
with this gray tone and I'm going to be
using the morphe brush today and you are
going to want to draw parallel lines on
the side of your nose so everyone's nose
is different everyone will be contouring
their nose different but for my nose
what I like to do is draw the lines down
the side I like to cut off the tip to
make it look shorter and I dragged down
the lines on the side just to really
accentuate my nose so depending on how
you want your nose to look I would look
directly straight in the mirror see what
it is about your nose that you want to
fix mine is kind of wide and then this
side I have a bump so I like to draw the
lines in closer making my nose appear a
lot thinner clearly I've gotten a lot
better at contouring my nose because
people have constantly been accusing me
of getting a nose job and I've never
gotten any plastic surgery so I just
want to say that for the hundredth time
that no I did not go to no shop thank
you for those who think that but no I
just know how to contour better um it's
all about angles I've seen all those
tape blogs where you guys want to all
sit around and talk and show old
pictures of my nose versus what it is
now but seriously it's all about the
angle when I first started filming
videos I was using my iPhone I had it
down below me at a at a lower angle
looking up which is gonna make your nose
look better it's gonna make your face
look bigger your chin look bigger so
yeah I did not get a nose job clearly ok
so again for my nose we're going to
start right here
I'm going to draw down and I always go
like this on the tip take a little bit
more product and do the same thing
a new technique that I just started
doing that I've been loving is instead
of connecting this line all the way to
the tip you draw your little tip and
then you go down the nose right here
like this so you basically just draw out
where you want your nose to end so I
definitely do an extreme contour to my
nose um I don't mind I become so
obsessed with it that I can't really go
without contouring it because I love how
my nose looks when it's contour but what
you're going to do next is just with
your finger start smudging out the line
when you are contouring your nose it's
really important that you're doing
basically a full face look you can't
just wake up contour your nose and walk
out the door because it's gonna look
really really silly you need to have the
contrast between the light and the dark
to really make it look as most natural
as possible I think my nose process is
definitely one of the longest because
I'm always trying to make sure it looks
blended and nice because sometimes it
could just look like lines in your nose
and I've been guilty of that many a
times so I've been working on it trying
to find the best technique as possible
so basically that's how I do it first
with the cream next I'm taking my NARS
creamy concealer and I'm just applying a
little bit right down the bridge of my
nose so R it usually I would do this
part first I honestly just forgot
because I have most of my makeup on but
you could do this part second it's not a
big deal um and you're just going to
blend that in
so another thing to remember is when
you're contouring your nose you don't
want to bring the dark too far down you
want to make sure that the concealer
under your eye is coming up all the way
up to the sides of your nose if you have
a wide nose and you want to make it look
Center so that step I did before the
nose but again I just applied my Mac
nw20
concealer and then I applied that same
NARS concealer under my eyes and just
kind of blended it out and you can
already see just by the way the shadows
are hitting it and the light is hitting
it it looks a lot smaller so that's a
first step I'm then taking a little bit
of my translucent powder with my Beauty
Blender and I'm just gonna set the nose
this is just so it doesn't go anywhere
and it's also going to lighten up it up
a little bit so I didn't finish off my
makeup so now I'm just gonna go in with
my powder contour on my cheeks around my
face just as I normally would obviously
this part has nothing to do with the
nose but I just want to finish off my
whole makeup look so you guys can see
the finished result I always tend to
skip or make it faster than nose so I
just wanted to talk you guys through it
so again the biggest thing is figuring
out what no shape you have what no shape
you want to transform into so if you
guys aren't sure I'm sure they have
different pictures online of different
types of noses and different ways to
contour it but again this is just the
way that I've contoured my nose so the
next thing that I do is I will add a
powder contour shade over the cream
contour shade just to really accentuate
it a little bit more I have a couple
favorites I love the Kevyn Aucoin medium
sculpting powder this is a really good
color to use for your nose because it's
grayish um I like to stay away from the
really oranjee shades because it doesn't
look as natural and when you're doing
something
kind of extreme like this you want it to
look natural if you guys are just doing
a tiny little contour and you want to
add a little bit of an orange you shade
and it looks good on your skin tone then
all the power to you go ahead and do
that but for me and my skin tone it's
always looks a lot less natural when I
was using a more warmer tone I also love
the color fawn which is the new shade by
Anasazi Beverly Hills it's this one
right here and another one that I love
is by the Kat Von D contour palette it
has a really great gray tone shadow as
well so it really just depends on which
one you guys want to get they're all
basically the same color so you don't
need all three of them I'm going to just
be using the anasazi one today just
because I have it out already and I am
going to be using a Sigma small tapered
blending brush this is the e 45 it has a
little bit of a pointed tip so it's
going to give you a little bit more
precision and you're just going to take
a tiny bit wipe some access on your
hands and then just go right over those
lines
and again this is just gonna accentuate
the nose a little bit more and then what
I always like to do as well is with the
powder is bring it in to my shadow
normally I'll have a shadow on when I'm
contouring my whole face so I'll just
bring it right underneath my brow and
right into the crease of my eye and that
way it's just going to blend it all
together and it's gonna again make it
look more natural next I'm taking a
clean blending brush and I'm just going
to very lightly do small circular
motions over not the top where the line
is but basically on the sides to kind of
blend it down my nose because we want to
keep these lines straight because I have
again a little bit of a bump here so
when you draw the lines straight over
it's gonna trick the eye into thinking
that it's straight so when you look at
my nose it looks straight it doesn't
look like I have a bump so we don't want
to blend right there too much because
then the bump is going to slowly come
out and then it's gonna make your nose
look crooked and I've had that happen
many a time so
sometimes I see people contour with like
such a dark shade and I used to do that
I used to use this dark dark dark dark
dark brown no matter what color my skin
tone was and I just figured with enough
blending it would look good but you
don't need to go that much darker than
your skin tone because if it's too dark
you're going to be blending too much
it's gonna just take away the product
and I don't know I just feel like it's
pointless so this out of every way that
I contour my nose because I've literally
tried a million different ways this has
been my favorite and it's also been with
stirring up so much controversy about my
nose so this is basically it as far as
the nose contour I'm gonna apply a
little bit of blush and highlighter and
I'll show you where I apply the
highlighter on my nose because that's
just basically the last gap so I'm just
going to take pedal power by Mac it's a
mineralized blush I'm just going to
apply that okay so now to highlight I'm
going to be using my still on the color
kit and it's just an eye shadow and I'm
going to take a little bit on my fingers
and highlight my cheeks and I'm also
going to take a little bit and highlight
right on the bridge of my nose and
that's a gun I'm gonna help bring the
light right to the thin skinny center
that we drew and it's going to help make
it look a lot thinner and more natural
and it's just going to give and it's
just going to really finish off your
whole makeup look so again I only do
this when I'm doing contour highlight
concealer all that stuff if I'm doing a
very natural everyday look I'll then
just go in with um that same tapered
blending brush a little bit of powder
and then just very lightly do the sides
of my nose and that's again if I'm doing
a more natural look just because I've
gotten so used to contouring my nose
that when I don't have it on I just feel
naked without it so that is really it as
far as what I do for my nose
on tour it definitely changed a lot
since about a year ago when I did in my
last video so I wanted to get an update
up for you guys because I've seen a lot
of people requesting it and I've also
seen a lot of people claiming that I got
a nose job so I figured it was time to
set the record straight and just show
you guys on my new awesome technique so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
love you guys so much and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
