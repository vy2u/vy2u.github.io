writing letters spend my evenings
singing song last five years hi
everybody thank you for watching today I
am back with another video for my color
series I had posted a status on my
facebook page as well as Twitter asking
what color you wanted to see next and I
think overall coral was definitely the
most requested I just painted my nails
like this light peachy orange color and
I was originally going to do that color
but then coral just seemed to be the
most requested video next so here I am
with a ton of coral products and I'm
going to go through all of them with you
and a swatch a bunch of them and then
instead of a makeup look I'm going to be
doing a fashion look and on my blog I'm
going to be putting more pictures as
well as my makeup look I'm going to do a
pictorial step-by-step so if any of you
guys wanted to see how I did this coral
makeup I will be listing all that out
for you guys as well so if you guys want
to hear some of my favorite products see
some swatches and all that good stuff
please keep watching
ready now so when I was looking through
all of my makeup trying to find some top
coral products I realized that there are
a lot of coral products that are like a
lighter coral and then some that are a
brighter coral kind of like my shirt so
I'm gonna have a ton of products for you
guys today but it's going to be
everything from lighter coral to darker
coral so first I want to start out with
lipsticks the first one and this is
actually the first coral lipstick I
probably ever got it's called coral
crush by Maybelline and this is a nice
bright coral color and then by NYX I
have this one in the color lollies and
it's more of a lighter coral color this
one is so amazing and I actually use
this along with a darker coral color
which I'll be naming in a second on my
lips for this look the next one is
called coral escape by BH and this one
is a hot bright coral as well and this
is what I use on the outer part of my
lips I kind of did like an ombre coral
look I was originally just going to use
this color but it was a little bit too
much since I did the bright coral on my
eyes as well moving on to my MAC
lipsticks I have coral bliss this one is
a beautiful coral shade and this one
again is a really light peachy coral
look and this one is amazing then I have
style surge also by Mac and these are
the mineralized lipsticks I don't like
these as much as the regular MAC
lipsticks but this color is a great
color and they are very pigmented the
last lip product is called melted coral
and it is by Too Faced and these are the
new melted lipsticks I really like them
they have a nice consistency if you have
dry lips these are great because when
they go on they leave your lips feeling
nice and moisturized
moving on to lip liners I have three
coral lip liners one is by Makeup
Forever and 24 C and this one can be
used for like a peach lipstick look like
a light orange or a coral it all kind of
blends really nicely together the next
one is called lasting sensation by Mac
and this one I showed in my lipstick
combination videos and the third one
that I actually used on my lips today is
called coral kiss and this one is by
motives for coral glosses I have two for
you guys today the first one is called
coral crush by Milani and this one is a
beautiful hot coral color and the second
one is by color your smile in the color
coral craze and you guys see me use
those millions of times I'm sure it's a
really pretty light coral color and
while on the subject of lips I wanted to
show you guys the makeup forever palette
I mentioned this in one of my favorites
videos and it has a beautiful coral
color in it and this is what I use as my
eyeshadow base the reason I love these
palettes is because you can use them for
your lips for your eyes you can use them
for foundation basically everything you
can ever think of you can use for these
little palettes also the gold line
underneath my eyes which I'll show you
guys a close up is from this palette as
well
moving on to blush I have by BH this 10
color palette this is the glamorous
palette so it's a little bit different
than the other one that is definitely my
favorite there are a few Coralie colors
this one is actually the one that I used
on my cheeks today to give it that coral
pop of color and these colors are so
pigmented I love these palettes they're
about eleven dollars and definitely my
favorite blush palettes
another coral blush that I recently
picked up is called tipsy by Tarte
cosmetics and this one is great as well
I just recently started trying the Tarte
products and I can honestly say I'm a
big fan so far then I have two drugstore
alternatives for you guys I have the
master glaze and coral sheen and this is
more of like a liquid I think every time
I say this I mess it up it's like it's a
thicker consistency blush you can just
dab it on your cheeks it's like a stain
you can also use it for your lips this
one is great I've used it a bunch of
times I love to use this in the
summertime just apply a BB cream and
then apply a little bit to your cheeks
and it gives you a beautiful look and
the other one is a very similar
consistency this one is by Revlon in the
color coral reef and again this is a
blush you can use it for your lips or
anything like that as well
you
moving on to shadows I have the color
Jupiter in my BH Galaxy Pro palette this
is what I used in the crease of my eye
and it's a really pretty coral pigmented
color
these colors are great I use them in a
bunch of my tutorials and again BH is
super affordable I have two coral
pigments one is by Mac and then one is
by Inglot I use this one by Mac it's in
the color neo orange and I use this
color on my lid this one I haven't used
yet but it's from the Inglot store and
they're very very similar in the colors
I will show you guys the swatches next
to each other so you can see the
difference
another coral shadow I have is by Sigma
and all our loose eyeshadows come in
these little white cases with like the
color sticker on top so what I like to
do is I have a whole bunch of them so I
have a whole draw when you pull it out
you could just see all the little
stickers so that way I can keep them
organized and see what colors I have so
this is a really pretty light shimmery
coral that I used on the inner part of
my eye
now moving on to some nail polishes I
have a bunch of coral colors that I
absolutely love starting with the hot
coral color this one is called Boogie
Nights by sinful colors and this is a
really really pretty
corely color the second one that I have
is by Maybelline Color show and coral
crush as well oh I think there was
something else called coral crush but
this is awesome I actually used the
bleached peach in this same brand for my
nails and they're like a really pretty
light orange color the next one is by
sinful colors again and this one is
called island coral and this is more of
a lighter coral color then by Essie I
have cereal shopper this I believe is
from their new spring collection and I
absolutely love this color Essie I think
is one of my favorite brands but yeah
this one is gorgeous and I absolutely
love this color and the last color is
called cheeky by Orly and it has a
really pretty gold shimmery finish so I
wanted to show you guys this one as well
so that is it as far as all of my coral
products I put together a full coral
outfit that I'm going to show you guys
or not fully coral but half of its coral
and it just incorporates this beautiful
color so I figured instead of doing a
makeup look every single time would be
cool to just include a fashion look and
what I'm also going to be doing is on my
blog I'm going to be posting a bunch of
different coral outfit pics that I
absolutely love I don't know if you guys
checked out my blog for my mint video
but I also listed a ton of mint outfits
as well so definitely check out my blog
for all the products mentions for a
direct link and also for more outfits
and fashion so really quickly I'm just
going to show you the outfit that I
threw together and there's gonna be more
pictures of it on my blog I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I love you so
much and until next
