today's video I'm going to show you some
of the new products that I've picked up
ex before recently this is like three
orders in one I did a little bit of
shopping the past couple of weeks and I
think that's some stuff from their new
section so I just wanted to show you
guys some of the stuff I picked up some
swatches and all that so if you guys
want to see them please keep watching so
the first part I have is this little
Beauty Blender set it has 5 different
color Beauty blenders in it so I believe
the light pink one is the only real new
one I've never had a purple or a red one
I don't think I definitely have the hot
pink and the nude but I thought this kit
was so cute and I love beauty blenders I
used them literally every single day and
I'm swearing to have so much more but it
Zoe always feels my beauties on there as
he plays with them and I find them all
over the house so I thought it I knew I
needed a scenic beauty butters anyway so
I figured why not get one of every color
the next product that I picked up is the
Too Faced hangover primer I know I was
using it in a lot of my recent videos
and it's so funny because I was looking
at the bottle and it said Tuesday's 2014
so that means the primer that I was
using for the past a year is from 2014
not to 2016 so I figured I think it's
time for a new one although basically
empty anyway but mine saw the expiration
date on it
normally I don't really follow
expiration days I think with certain
products you can get away with using it
way past an expiration date I feel like
for the primer since it is almost like
skincare that's like the one group of
products that I actually follow the
expiration dates so I had picked up
another one of these guys so this next
product I'm actually so excited to try I
wanted to keep everything like in its
packaging whom I just got them in like a
day or two both I really haven't even
desk tiny entities so this is the Josie
Maran Nirvana hydrating treatment as
soon as I tell the word Nirvana
hydrating I'm like done so I believe
this is just like a facial mist
ok so saying that is a post cleanse
hydrating treatment myth in
hours your skin to get the most of your
skincare routine so they're saying to
use this after you wash your face so I'm
not going to spray it right now my face
but I'm guessing this goes before you
even apply any of your makeup I think I
originally thought that it was kind of a
setting spread and makeup miss like some
of the other ones I have
but I'm thinking now that it's just like
another step for your skincare routine
it is a saturated supple baby soft and
perfectly prepped for moisturizer I'm
going to spray it on my hand just like
and see what it smells like it smells
like really fresh it kind of smells like
a little citrusy and also like a little
bit like coconut so I'm pretty sure
there's coconut extract in here but I'm
really excited to try this off keep you
guys posted on this one so that product
is by Becca this is the first light
priming filter and same complexion
refresh so it's a primer I was looking
for different cruelty free primers I
wanted to like branch out a little bit
and I saw this one and it caught my eye
at first cause it was like a lavender
purple and I figured it was just made
for like color correction for those
looks like more dull skin but I actually
read online that it doesn't apply purple
on your skin so let's see what the box
says if your insta-fix for a bad face
day if a lustrous lavender feed priming
filter that crap perks and perfects the
complexion is saying it's good for
fatigue dullness dehydration puffiness
and fine lines so I have yet to try this
one either only use it in my next makeup
video for you guys for sure but I'm
excited to try it some probably come a
little bit on the back of my hand that
way you guys can see yeah so it
definitely comes out like a lavender
purple but when I rub it in the purple
definitely it's still visible I
definitely a little bit too much ladies
see when you rub it in it just is a
really really pretty like hydrating glow
like look at that looks really nice
this is with nothing on it and then this
is with it so it just works what's the
light and looks like just gonna give you
like a really nice dewy finish so I
recently figured out that Urban Decay is
cruelty free which is really exciting I
also found out that Mary of the Dead Sea
was cruelty free which I didn't know
because I stopped using my friend
because I thought that they tested on
animals so when I found out that urban
decay was cruelty free I had to buy some
more of their shadows I love their
products and I had to leave them so long
so I picked up these two eyeshadows the
first one is solstice and the other one
is litora
I believe I have on a public space
cowboy
buy them is in the same exact container
it's the most beautiful color ever I
love it
but these one got a little more funky so
I figured I would get outside the box
and try something a little bit different
the first one is glitter rock which is a
beautiful light purple color I love it
it's so pretty matches my outfit today I
should
and then solstice has a like a turquoise
undertone so you can see it looks like
almost like teal from this angle but
then from that is almost like a magenta
purple even to that I picked off
definitely check out
space cowboy as well that's my number
one from those I chose and I honestly
haven't you get in so long the next
thing that I picked up in this NARS
palette it's a blush palette I'm always
a sucker for the NARS blush palette I
got it any other color as well but it's
sold out put any one show it in this
video but this is some really beautiful
blush shades in it the colors that are
in this one are conquest undefeated
power play hots and same and candid so
I'm not sure based on all of these
individually I do have a lot of the
individual blushes but I bought the
magnetic pans what happened in like a
big blush palette so I don't even know
have the name under them but again this
is what they look like it has some cool
tones and it has some warmer shades as
well so I'm going to use a little bit of
the power plan to see what it looks like
and you have a mirror
so the next product is also by Becca
it's soft light blurring powder it's
called golden hour so I don't know
normally it's probably just like a loose
powder but when I heard like blurring
powder I'm like let me try it so let me
open this up and see what it looks like
so I haven't even opened it yet okay so
it looks like a regular loose powder
it's definitely not can loosen it has
like a pretty oranjee tint to it
actually I'm going to apply a little bit
on my shiny forehead let's see what it
looks like
see if it blurs it out
I know it does almost like it like
mattified anything but I do have like a
liquid eliminator mixed in with my
foundation so that might be wise take a
little bit slower than usual but I will
try this out let me know what I think of
it I wonder if you can use it to set
your under eyes I was like the main
reason because I need to use a product
that's one thing cruelty free it for a
loose powder I didn't realize it wasn't
really free obviously it was from a
drugstore on husband leg in the market
for some new clothes a free powder
because I've always been using the Ben
Nye ones which are amazing but I think
it's good to branch out every once in a
while when it comes to blushes I really
always think I feel like with the same
kind of colors I love like a mob shade I
love with a light pink or even like a
peach so this one right here is video
which is more of like a nude peach sheet
then I have fetish which is like a Molly
pink and then the third one is rapture
which is definitely more like a purple
mob undertone so I feel like fetish is a
little bit more of a pink undertone this
is more of like a purple undertone
rapture first rapture and have a tiny
bit of a sparkle to it
like it almost gives it like a sheen
this one's a matte one and this is
reddish you can see they're pretty
similar so that is a little bit lighter
and a little bit more pink and then
video has more of like a peachy warm
undertone so you can see more nude pink
and warm of like I said those are just
the shades that I always gravitate
towards and the last few pots I picked
up I'm not sure I'm going to keep fold I
wanted to try them out and then I
figured I'd return one or Stableford
medial peoples but I got the new
Natasha's I don't know what they're new
but I'm pretty sure either I just heard
how time where they run the new section
venous oxygen on a body glow and I got
into medium and dark so this is actually
the first time they've been opening them
I'm wearing the one that I've been
wearing this past year from North Shama
what is it called I can think of the
name of it right now but
mix the color bronze &amp;amp; Glow and it's
like the perfect in-between so I'm not -
two hands come back to this one this one
is medium look at this so this is really
pretty it's like a beautiful gold and I
think this is a nice color
I guess not as light as find it so I'm
wondering what's the darker one it
smells like so yeah the dark one is much
darker definitely not good for my skin
tone now but I feel like with a nice pan
I probably would love it so you could
see the difference I'm thinking the dark
might be too dark for my skin tone even
with a tan like it might be to oranjee
although it is a big flaw so now that
I'm like kind of rubbing in the dark I
feel like it's not as look it's not as R
so it might actually be really good I
thought I actually might keep the dark
look at this a little bit nicer so yeah
you can see that's the light so it's
going to give me just like a really
pretty glow and then the dark one just
give me like a little bit of like a pan
with a glow so I think I'm going to
people they smell so delicious - those
are the reason things that I picked up
from my last two maybe three orders from
Sephora online I wanted to share that
some of the products as you guys I feel
like it's been a little bit since I have
done a Sephora haul I welcome you guys
updated on some of the products as I use
them I will use them in some of my new
tutorials my plan for this year was to
try out a lot of new products which I
have been and I found some new favorites
which is amazing so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and until next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
