today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this simple everyday makeup look
I've been working on makeup like this
for the whole weekend and I had taken a
picture and I had saw a lot of you guys
requesting that I do a look it's super
simple and it's very lightly on the skin
so I think it's perfect for the spring
and the summer time I'm also finally
announcing my new giveaway for you guys
so make sure to stay tuned until the end
of the video you guys want to hear how
to enter and what all the prizes are
gonna be and if you want to learn how i
got this makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
priming my face with the Too Faced
hangover primer this is the first time
that I'm trying it and you can see that
because it's scored it everywhere but it
actually smells really good so I'm just
applying this all over my face for
concealer I'm using the NARS creamy
concealer in the color see their mustard
or custard I don't know what it is I
always get it wrong but I'm just
applying a little bit under my eyes a
tiny bit in between my brows and a
little bit on my chin and I'm just
blending that in with a damp Beauty
Blender I think my next video I'm going
to just film in a different room because
I really miss doing talk-through videos
and getting to like chat with you guys
and update you guys on things so I want
to try a new location until this room is
filled up so next video I'm gonna try in
a different room and we'll see how it
goes
to contour my nose I'm using my la girl
Pro conceal in the color toast and I'm
applying this on the tip of my nose and
also on the sides of my nose and then
I'm just gonna blend that in with my
fingers so I've been doing the same
foundation routine the whole weekend and
it's definitely my new favorite I always
like trying new combinations and when I
find a good one I always want to share
with you guys because I'm constantly
switching it up just to try new products
out and I'm just really happy with this
combo once I blend that in with my
fingers I'm going in with this artiste
brush I'm not sure the exact number I
will list it below for you guys but I'm
just blending it in a little bit further
this brush just helps make it look
flawless for foundation I'm using this
Tarte powder foundation I am just
dipping my morphe brush into it and I'm
tapping off any excess and then I'm just
doing circular motions all over my face
so lightweight on the skin and it covers
really nicely if you guys do have any
problem areas on your skin that you want
to cover up make sure you're applying
the concealer beforehand like what I did
do the concealer first and then apply
the powder over it you want to do all of
your creams before you do anything with
powder
you
to set the contour on my nose I'm using
the gray shade from the Kat Von D shade
and light palette and I am just applying
that right over the lines that I had
done previously this grey or shade is
going to help make the nose contour look
a lot more natural since the original
shade that I use had a little bit more
of an orange tone once you set it and
then apply the grey over it it just
makes it look again more natural and
more like the shadows on your nose to
set underneath my eyes I'm using the
lightest shade in that same palette and
I'm just pressing the light powder
underneath my eyes and that's just going
to brighten it and help bring it forward
which is going to make you look more
awake feel free to skip this step if you
want the concealer should cover enough
but I always like to apply a little bit
of powder for extra coverage and then
I'm using the darkest peach colored
shade in that same palette and applying
it right over the sides of my nose and
this is just going to blend everything
together and make it look more natural
then I'm going in with the middle
bronzer shade and I'm just bronzing up
my face
for brows I'm going in with the
Anastasia brow Wiz in the color dark
brown I love this because it has the
brush on the end and the really thin
pencil so it's great for shaping so I'm
just brushing my brows up and then I'm
just filling them in and shaping them a
little bit nicer
then I'm grabbing my brow bar to go and
the darkest shade and I am filling them
in a little bit further I like using a
powder to darken them it makes it look
more natural so first I do the pencil
and then I just darken them with the
shadow
and then to set my brows I'm using the
UH Nastasia brow gel and I'm just
brushing them up so for my eyes I'm
picking up these two mob shades from my
palette they are my most use shades I
just absolutely love them especially for
a natural look I used to always just go
for browns in the crease but I love
using these two combined because I feel
like it gives it a little bit of color
and it just makes your eyes really pop
you
so next I'm picking up my favorite shade
in this palette which is the best shade
to highlight with in my opinion and I am
highlighting the bridge of my nose I'm
doing a line and then a little dot at
the tip I'm also highlighting in my tear
ducts underneath my brows and then on my
Cupid's bow and then right under my nose
as well
so for mascara I'm using lights camera
flashes by Tarte I've been using this
all weekend and I actually really like
it so far so good I love how long it
gets my lashes and it doesn't make them
too too clumpy so this is definitely my
go-to mascara at the moment so I put my
normal amount on the top and then I'm
just putting the tiniest tiniest bit on
my lower lashes if you get any of that
black on your eyes I used a little YP
and then just a plain brush with nothing
on it to just blend out any of the
smudges so for blush I'm using this
blush palette by BH and I'm mixing these
two colors together and it's like a
peach and a mob shade and it's just very
natural looking I absolutely love this
blush palette and I think it's only like
ten dollars which is amazing
her lips I'm using the lip liner called
Aquarius by colour-pop I do have a $5
off code if you use my link it was not
working for a couple of days so I do
apologize I know I saw a lot of people
asking on my previous video but the
coupon code is back up and running for
anyone interested I am just applying
this all over my lips I'm not going to
use a lipstick for today and then I'm
just going to use a chapstick that way
my lips they moisturize and then to
finish off this look I am using the drug
cosmetics setting spray in lavender so
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm now going to
announce the been so long since I said I
would be announcing it so I do apologize
I also apologize because I'm trying to
keep my voice level like as low as
possible so that echo is not there even
though I'm like super excited and I want
to like gel and like talk a little about
it like I always do like I'm going to
try and keep it very low just so you
guys can watch it and no one freaks out
about the echo so I vote all of the
prizes down so what I'm going to be
doing is a small acts of kindness part 2
giveaway so almost three years ago I
posted my small acts of kindness
giveaway and it was my favorite in Y
that I've ever done I love getting to
watch all of your video entries and for
me I love getting to see the face behind
the name
sometimes with YouTube and Instagram I'm
only really seeing your username or
sometimes your pictures and it's just so
cool to actually watch you guys and hear
you interact I just like when I get to
see that it's like I get to really know
you guys personally and get to bond with
you guys on a certain level so there's
going to be a total of seven winners
knowing me I'm going to end up picking
more people because every time I do a
giveaway and say a certain number I
always like double the amount of winners
because I just gone with so many of you
guys and I feel so bad but this summer
and I am going to be watching all of
your video entries and I'm going to be
hand selecting the winner for the grand
prize as well as the second prize
winners and then the five other winners
I'm going to pick my complete random
that way anybody has an equal chance of
winning so I'm not going to be judging
on how good the quality of the video is
or anything like that I just kind of
want to see you guys get out there and
do something really nice for somebody
else so if you guys aren't familiar with
the small acts of kindness giveaway that
i had announced three years ago i will
fill you guys in on what you have to do
in order to enter so all of the rules
are going to be listed below in the
description box anyway but I'm also
going to explain it for you guys so what
do you guys have to do is film yourself
doing something nice for somebody else
so something you wouldn't do on a normal
basis you guys don't need to go out and
spend any money to just be a kind
gesture to a stranger or someone that
you don't normally do nice things for
and just to film yourself doing it so
some of the ones that I remember at the
top of my head from last year was
someone making breakfast in bed for
their mom or for someone paying for
coffee for the person behind them or
just anything like that just something
that you wouldn't normally do so I want
to challenge you guys to go out of your
comfort zone and do something nice for
somebody else because you never know
what kind of day that person is having
and I feel like the whole message of
spreading love and positivity to a
stranger or to someone you don't
normally do just will help make a lot of
people's days and weeks and months so
much better so that is really all you
have to do you just gotta film yourself
doing something nice for somebody else

guys are going to be winning so for five
people you guys are going to be winning
a huge Beauty bag of mixed goodies worth
well over $500 each so as you guys know
I am switching over to completely
cruelty free makeup so I figured a good
way to get rid of some of my amazing
products that aren't cruelty free that
are brand new would be to do a big
giveaway so I don't have exact products
what I'm going to be throwing in but
it's going to be worth well over $500
with all the amazing brands that you
guys all love the designer brands maybe
some drugstore brands but just an
amazing box of goodies as they do start
to clean everything out and gather
everything together outpost little hints
on snapchat and on Instagram of some of
the goodies that you will be winning but
I also will be including a sign carli
bybel palette and all of those goodie
bags as well so it'll be a nice fun
makeup prize for five winners the
second-place winner is going to win like
a tech prize I'm going to include the
sony a 5100 camera which is the one that
i used to vlog and for my selfies i'm
also going to be including the suction
mount for anyone who is looking to vlog
and they couldn't find a good suction
mount i'm going to be including a ring
light which i use a ring light to film
and i'm also going to be including a
tripod so that way any of you guys are
looking to start a YouTube channel or
you're looking to get some upgraded
equipment this will definitely help you
guys out immensely so the second-place
prize is worth over like fifteen hundred
dollars and then the grand prize I'm so
excited about this grand prize I've been
thinking about the coolest grand prize
that I had to do and I thought this
would be a really really fun idea so the
grand prize winner is actually going to
be for us
unfortunately the rest of the giveaway
is going to be worldwide
so anybody where you're from you can
enter it but for the grand prize I have
to keep it for the US for now maybe in
the future we can do something worldwide
for the sticker prize but for now we're
going to keep it just in the US so the
grand prize winner I'm going to fly out
to your hometown and do a live
one-on-one makeup class for you and five
friends so I figured this would be such
a cool way to like its interact get to
meet you guys we could do lunch or
something like that or bring in lunch
and I can teach you a one on one makeup
class so you could bring your own makeup
of course I'll bring some makeup goodies
with me as well and then I can do a full
face tutorial just in a private class
for you and five friends so I thought
there will be so much fun I've never
done anything like this I mean wanted to
do like live makeup classes in person
throughout the US and maybe worldwide
but I just haven't actually sat down and
planned anything like that yet so I
think in the future that would
definitely be something I would love to
do because I've seen a lot of people
requesting it and also I just feel like
it'd be so fun to get to actually see
you guys in person I get to teach you
some tips and tricks in person instead
of just through YouTube online this
giveaway is going to go on for one month

video and I don't want you to feel
rushed or I don't know you feel like
