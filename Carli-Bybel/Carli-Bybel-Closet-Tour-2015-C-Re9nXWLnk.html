have seen this video requested for quite
some time we have been in this place a
little over a year and I finally have my
closet set up this is gonna be a
bittersweet video because I finally
finished it all and we're actually just
looking into buying a house for the
first time since we have been renting
for the past two three years so this is
my current closet but I just wanted to
take you guys through it show you how I
organize everything and hopefully give
you guys some ideas for maybe your
closet now or your future dream closet
so first over here I have all of my
rompers I have them in color order and
originally I had it set up differently
but I wanted to keep all the rompers in
one place and then all of the dresses in
one place that way if I was specifically
looking for a romper I could just go
right there and the same thing with a
dress so up here are all my rompers down
here are all my dresses I also have
matching separates in this section so if
they are matching separates with shorts
they are on the top half and then if
it's a matching separate set with a
skirt or something like that then it's
in the bottom half so in here I have all
of my purses my clutches they are
overflowing I'm actually gonna probably
be selling a bunch of these I have a lot
of stuff that I have put aside to sell
for my closet I had just done my first
round a few weeks ago and I will be
donating 50% of all my profits to
charity which is really exciting so now
in the middle here you have the jewelry
area and then some more shoe shelves the
Juliet area is my favorite I just love
it so here are some of my shoes I kept
mostly black on this side then moving on
to the jewelry all of the jewelry
holders I got from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
including these little C MBAs and these
cute little bunny rabbits they hold your
rings perfectly and I have a little
penguin here from one of my subscribers
up here I have my more expensive shoes
my designer shoes to be honest I don't
even wear these Louboutins anymore I
want to sell them they are just very
uncomfortable and very unrealistic so if
you guys are thinking about buying a
pair one I suggest you go in the store
try them on walk around make sure you
can actually walk in them because you
end up like me and just have them as
trophies on your shelf so in the middle
here I have some more jewelry they
actually sent me another ice box so I
figured instead of using it for my
makeup room since I already have two I
brought it in here and I decided to put
some earrings some jewelry I also have
different accessories and stuff like
that in there it's just a really nice
way to organize all your stuff and I
love that it's clear because you could
see right through it over here I have
another bracelet holder and I actually
have all of my smaller necklaces hanging
on the top part of that this is also
from Bed Bath and Beyond so I bought two
of these IKEA dressers they're meant for
jewelry the first two rows are thin so
you can fit your jewelry in there with
these little cases and then there's
three bottom drawers where you can put
clothes I have this one's pretty messy
it's all my tank tops so you could just
put pajamas or bras or underwear or
whatever in them it fits perfectly on
the right hand side of my wall unit I
have all of my white items over here and
then below that I have all of my black
items just basically anything that
didn't fit on the left hand side this
rack I have against my window is from
Bed Bath and Beyond on the top left I
have all of my button-down shirts all of
my long sleep blouses in color-coded
order and to the right of those I have
some more tops in the white section of
the closet is where I kept all the white
tops so this is why you're seeing all of
the colors over here to the left are
some strapless bustiers and strapless
tops and then to the right of those I
have all of my long sleeve tops which I
live in these that's why I have so many
of them they're just so comfy on another
rack from Bed Bath I have all of my maxi
skirts and my long pants so on the side
I have some longer hanging items as well
as a lot more shoe space I have them
basically in color order it's not
perfect it probably could have been done
better but this is as good as it's gonna
get
so down here I have all of my cropped
tops
and body suits I have them all on little
mini hangers these are actually kids
hangers and I thought it would be
perfect to store them because I actually
ran out of the bigger ones when I was
trying to organize everything in the
closet I only really organized the left
side on the left side I have all of my
skirts and then down below I have some
sweaters and you don't want to see the
other side it's a big mess so that is
basically it as far as my closet I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
