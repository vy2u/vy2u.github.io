stop in my room tour is this closet
there were some shelves built when I had
moved in and there's also a light so you
couldn't see everything a lot better but
I like to keep my Blazers my jackets
also some jeans and trousers right on
this shelf area and it's great for
storage I just picked up this amazing
new table from Ikea and I will list
below what it is called but it's perfect
because I needed a lot more storage for
my makeup and everything like that this
nail polish rack can be found on Amazon
I will link that as well below okay with
studded stars from the places where she
so I was on QVC the other day and I
found this amazing makeup organizer it
spins and it has all different shape
compartments so you can put all kinds of
makeup and everything in there this was
a perfect storage idea to put on my new
table I also picked up some of these
smaller acrylic organizers for some more
makeup or Islanders lip liners
everything like that but not anymore no
never on this girl she likes skittles
from London sipping on sunsets color
watch us please content use honor of the
people that she loves and suitcase quit
studied stars from the places my large
acrylic makeup case is from cherry
blossom you got something
these drawers are from Ikea and there
are the alux drawers they are so amazing
and they're perfect they hold basically
all of my stuff
that love makes no sense if
loving you now
so it's so funny because I just picked
up these ice cube holders and they fit
perfectly in the draw and it's awesome
because I can store some of my loose
eyeshadows in them so it's a really neat
different way to store some of your
makeup for those of you looking for new
ideas
my amazing vanity is from vanity girl
Hollywood I've had it about three years
now and I've been so amazingly pleased
with it and I've seen so many people
purchasing it and everyone seems to love
it so for anyone in search of a great
bandi I highly recommend at vanity girl
Hollywood now over to my custom-built
closet I had originally done a closet
tour when I had first got it but now
it's filled with some more goodies
I had this custom built from a company
called closet tech and they're in my
area and it's cool because I got to
actually help design it and help pick
what kind of storage I want and
everything like that so I love it and
it's super easy to store all of my stuff
that's true
so a girl can never have too many shoes
as I'm sure you've heard before I hope
you guys enjoyed my quick little room
tour and until next time I'll see you
guys later
all that it's true
