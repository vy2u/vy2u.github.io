feel like I've been traveling more the
past month and I have ever so I'm so
sorry that it's taken me this long to do
another makeup look so a lot of you have
been requesting a Catwoman look and I
apologize right now because my ears are
pretty lame I used a flower like flower
petals because I don't have like the
mask so if you do have the mask or you
have cat ears I highly suggest using
those instead of these because I guess
with this and then kind of like my shirt
has like vines on it and kind of maybe
looks makes it look a little bit not
like a cat but if you like how it's the
mask and how I did my sparkly eyes
please keep watching and I will show you
how also I just wanted to say thank you
to everyone because I hate a hundred
thousand likes on my Facebook page the
next video that I will be posting I will
be announcing another giveaway so
definitely stay tuned for that so if you
don't like how the mask looks don't
worry you could still try this look out
if your being maybe a vampire or even
maybe a burlesque type of look this look
is not limited to just a Catwoman look
you can kind of tweak it a little bit
make it your own or add a little bit and
change a little bit so I hope you all
enjoy and I apologize because my room is
a mess and it kind of looks like there's
no floor because I didn't unpack it from
Vegas I'm still running a little bit
behind so don't mind the mess to prime
my eyes I'm going to be using a
concealer and a small shader brush and
I'm going to be applying this all over
my entire eyelid
taking this white almost beige eyeshadow
in the same shader brush I'm going to be
applying this color all over my entire
eyelid and also underneath my eyebrows
then taking this light beige color and
my Mac 224 brush I'm going to be
applying this color right into the
crease of my eye blending it in towards
my nose and up towards my brow
next taking this darker brown color and
my Mac 217 blending brush I'm going to
be forming a diagonal line from the
outer part of my crease up towards the
inner part of my eyebrow again you're
going to be doing a diagonal line like
this from the outer part all the way up
to the inner part of your eyebrow
to line my upper lash line I'm going to
be using a Mac gel liner and also a
small eyeliner brush
next I'm taking a silver glitter - by
NYX and unfortunately when I was
applying this I was not focused at all
on my eyes so the video didn't come out
but I'm just taking a small angled brush
and I'm just gonna be lining right above
about halfway down my eye out towards
the tail with the glitter and I'm going
to be using the fixed plus you can also
use eye drops that will work as well
using that same glitter and the small
angled brush I'm just gonna be applying
the glitter also on the bottom lower
lash line throughout this look I'll
always go back to that same blending
brush and just kind of blend in all the
lines and I'm also gonna be dragging
this darker brown color down my nose
which is going to just emphasize the
contour so keep in mind I'm just doing
this look as I'm going I don't really
have anything planned out on my head but
I'm just gonna be dragging down this
color a little bit further down my nose
and also I'm going to be extending it
out past my eyebrows
next I'm gonna be applying my false
lashes miner by Mac I'll write the
number below to apply the rhinestones
I'm going to be using eyelash glue and
I'm just going to be using a bottom of a
makeup brush and I'll be dotting the
glue wherever I want to put the
rhinestones I'm using black rhinestones
that I have gotten from Michaels craft
supply so I never saw Catwoman with a
rhinestone mask before so I figured why
not try it now so I'm again using the
bottom of a makeup brush and the eyelash
glue and I'm just gonna be dotting
wherever I want to apply those
rhinestones also if you want to color in
the mass like once you've applied all
the rhinestones that would look really
awesome I just knew I was going out so I
didn't want to paint my whole face
because I wouldn't have time to
completely take it off so again these
are just suggestions so again these are
just suggestions taking a blending brush
and this black color I'm going to be
shading in in-between the rhinestones
and I'm going to be creating a mass it
looks really light right now but in the
end I'm going to show you how I go back
and I make it darker
you
so unfortunately I don't have cat ears
and the only thing that I could really
find was this black flower so these are
my cat ears for now and no other lame
but if you're being Catwoman I would
assume you already have ears so
definitely use those in place
you
to apply this I'm using eyelash glue as
well
taking my small pencil brush and black
eyeshadow I'm just going to be going
over the line in my crease just gonna be
accentuating it and making it a little
bit darker and I'm also going to be
taking this color and lining my lower
lash line
to line my lips I'm using plush poem by
georgeanna cosmetics you can get to set
any Walgreens
her lipstick I'm using hot passion by
covergirl as I was doing my lips I
decided that my mass was not dark enough
so I'm just taking my Mac pencil brush
that same black color and I'm just going
over the lines I had previously done
just darkening them to make it appear
more like a mass again you can fill your
mask in it would probably look maybe a
little bit more like Catwoman for the
outer part of my lips I'm going to be
taking this golden gloss number 36 by
YSL and it's a darker red color and I'm
just gonna be applying this on outer
parts of my lips and this is gonna give
my lips a little bit more of dimension
so the lighter color I'm using is my Mac
it's called driven by love and that's
gonna go in the middle part of my lips
how to add that sound effect alright
guys so I hope you enjoy and I will try
to post another one before Halloween but
if I don't I hope everyone has a safe
and happy Halloween and I will see you
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
