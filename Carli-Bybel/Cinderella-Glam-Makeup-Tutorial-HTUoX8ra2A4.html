missed you guys I'm sorry it's been a
little bit since I've posted a video I
got back from Florida on Monday and we
had such an amazing trip it went way too
quick but at least when I got back here
in Jersey it's been kind of warm I
actually had to turn the heat off today
I think it's like 50 degrees so hey I
will live with that before I went away I
got a bunch of the Cinderella collection
from Mac and I wanted to film the video
before I went away but I just didn't
have the time so today I decided to film
a princess glam makeup look using some
of the new Cinderella products also I
just wanted to let you guys know for
those that didn't get their hands on it
besides the eyeshadow palette and the
lipsticks don't feel like you're missing
out on so much because I mean the beauty
powder I loved for the highlight but I
also used one on top of it it's so
similar to opal it's similar to betty
loumanizer so just look for similar
colors to recreate this look if you guys
didn't go out and get the products most
of them weren't wow products but I just
love the packaging and I'm so excited
for the new movie to come out so I
figured let me do a fresh glowy princess
inspired makeup look so if you guys want
to learn how i got this makeup look
right here please keep watching to start
off this look I'm using this champagne
color and I'm applying it all over my
eyelids so with this eye shadow palette
I was really pleasantly surprised with
how pigmented it was I think out of all
of the Cinderella products this would be
the one I would recommend getting if it
is still available but a lot of the
colors you can definitely find similar
in other palettes
and then grabbing this color was a large
blending brush and I'm applying it right
into my crease
next picking up this elf
rose-gold shadow I'm applying that right
into the center of my eyelid
with a smaller blending brush I'm
picking up this shimmery brown shade and
I'm applying it on the outer V of my eye
and I'm blending it into the crease for
this look I wanted to keep it really
simple and really shimmery because I
mean when you think of a Disney Princess
you don't think of anything too crazy
next I am applying my tattoo liner by
Kat Von D and I'm just applying a Hotei
medium sized wing and I just wanted to
add because sometimes it looks like I'm
doing my eyeliner crazy I am kind of far
away from the mirror when I'm filming
this so it's always a lot harder for me
to try and keep myself in focus and do
the eyeliner so I apologize if it looks
funky at first but it always evens out
so now I'm moving on to my face
for primer I'm using by Smashbox this
one just completely mattifies my face it
blurs all the fine lines and all the law
pores so this one is definitely my
favorite at the moment for foundation
I'm using this new one it's the matte
and poreless normal to oily skin fit me
foundation this is the second time that
I'm using it and I was really happy with
how it lasted throughout the day last
time so that is what I decided to use
today I'm applying that with my Sigma
foundation brush
I believe it's f50 could be wrong so I
will list everything below in the
description box
for concealer I'm using this one by NARS
in the color vanilla I'm applying it
underneath my eyes and the bridge of my
nose also on my chin and then I'm going
to be blending it all in
to contour my nose I'm using this color
from my RC ma palette and I'm using the
lip brush also by Sigma
you
then I'm grabbing a damp clean beauty
blender and I'm just pushing in all that
product to really blend it all out
evenly and just kind of get rid of any
excess product um then just blending in
the sides of my nose with my fingers and
voila it's a nose job
I'm gonna do a light contour for this
look I'm using this darker shade from
the same palette and I'm just contouring
my cheeks I'm going to also contour
these sides of my forehead and also
along my jaw line just to really
accentuate my features
you
you
set my under eyes and to prevent any
creasing I'm using my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and I'm just
applying this with a Beauty Blender and
it's now look like way too much powder
but don't worry I'm gonna be brushing
off all the excess powder in a few
minutes
to settle the areas that are contoured
I'm using the max skin finish in the
color global glow this is not only going
to set the cream contour but it's also
going to give you a really really pretty
shimmer so I absolutely loved how that
turned out then with a brush like this
I'm just gonna be wiping off all that
excess powder for blush I'm using the
color for cube by Sigma and I'm just
using a big fluffy brush to apply this
right on my cheeks for highlight powder
I'm going to be using two the first one
is from the Cinderella collection and
I'm applying that with a fan brush right
on the high points of my cheeks and this
is going to give you a really subtle
glow if you want you can just leave it
as is but if you want to add some more
layers to make it a little bit shinier
than normal you can apply another one on
top of it I'm using mary lou manizer and
this one is definitely way more
pigmented so if you guys are looking for
a pretty highlighter with a similar
color again like I mentioned in the
beginning this one is really similar and
Becca opal is similar there's just a
bunch so don't feel like you guys need
to run out get these products if they're
not available with my pencil brush I'm
picking up this pinkish shade and I'm
just lining my lower lash line
you
speak my eyes look super around I'm
gonna be applying a white liner right in
the inner lashline and this is just
going to really open up your eyes and
again make them look more doll like for
lipliner i'm using the color dervish by
mac and this is gonna be a really pretty
pink --is-- color i didn't end up using
the Cinderella lipstick for this look
I'm gonna tell you why I use the color
angel by the way I accidentally ordered
two of the same shade on eBay which I
don't know if you guys saw my favorites
video but I mentioned that I had gotten
them so yeah that happened and I only
got the nude one and I didn't really
want to do a nude lip for this so that's
why I chose this pink look instead so to
finish this look off I am setting my
face with the best damn facial spray and
this is just going to lock in my makeup
and keep it on all day long so this is
the final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video comment below and let me know
what you guys want to see next on my
channel because I plan on filming one
more video for you guys this week and
then next week I'm gonna try and get a
three so I love you guys so much thank
you for watching and until next time
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
