today I'm going to show you two super
comfy somewhat casual outfits that are
perfect for back-to-school
the first outfit I am wearing a pair of
boyfriend jeans paired with these
awesome new wedge converse is so it has
a hidden peel in it so it gives you a
little bit of height which is great you
kind of reckless that should send me
Cara's necklace is from forever 21 and
as far as jewelry I have on a few rings
two of them are from Princess Pea and
the other one I don't even know where I
got but I also have on a pair of fake
diamond stud earrings which they were
real but they're not so here you can see
the whole outfit it's super cute I love
these bomber jackets for fall I think
they're awesome they have tons of colors
that I will be linking on my blog but I
chose to wear the pink bunting
and for my second out that I have this
monochrome t-shirt dress since we are
going to school I paired it with a pair
of black leggings that way we don't have
any mishaps and our tush doesn't come
out but I also have it paired with this
beautiful necklace that I got from Nasty
Gal it's a double necklace
and the black and silver chain clutch
not positive where I got that but again
everything will be linked on my blog
this outputs a little bit fancier at
first school but it is so comfortable so
I mean if you can look really really
cute and be comfy at the same time why
not so this is going to be a short
little video but I just want to sumit
together two outfits for you guys maybe
to get some inspiration for your school
wardrobe this is all one piece for the
dress but I love how it looks like it's
tied around the waist like that new
trend that you see all over the place
with the shirts tighter on the waist
so that is basically it as far as this
video I'm sorry it's super quick but I
mean you don't want to see me twirling
around for five hours so definitely go
check out my blog I will be listing
where I got everything as well as other
pics that I think are perfect for
back-to-school
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you guys soon the screen
let's go do something
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
