this video has been requested for quite
some time and I know I have a few
contour and highlight routine videos
which I will list below in the
description for any of you guys who want
to check it out but I wanted to do this
video today on just how I contour my
nose I think one of my most asked
questions is if I had gotten a nose job
and I wanted to post this video not only
to just clear that up but to teach you
guys my tricks because in a way it's a
compliment everyone thinking I got a
nose job because I never did I just
learned how to contour so thank you for
thinking my nose looks smaller
I appreciate it because my nose was just
always one thing I never really liked
about myself so if you want to learn my
technique on how I contour my nose
please keep watching so I did all of my
makeup I just did not contour my nose
and it's really crazy the difference in
my opinion a lot of people still
continuously try to tell me that I've
gotten a nose job and that I'm a liar
and then I just need to be honest but
scouts honor I've never got a nose job
and I hope you guys can see that by my
nose right now it's all about angles
like if I'm like this does my nose look
a lot smaller as opposed to straight on
or so it's all about really knowing your
angles especially in pictures and this
is what I would like to call a
non-surgical nose job because that is
one thing that I've always thought about
and I've really always wanted but
something I would never get so this is
my alternative and for me it's been
working pretty darn good so I go back
and forth between a brown powder and a
brown cream contour and they really both
work it's just depending on how much
makeup you're wearing or what look
you're really going for but the key to
all of this is blending it out
contouring your nose can do many
different things you can do this to get
rid of a bump you can do it to slim your
nose you can do it on the tip to make it
not look as long whenever I'm doing a
dramatic look and basically any look now
I love to contour my nose because once
you do it and once you do it right
you're never going to want to go back
because just looking at myself now it's
like those my nose pretty dang big so as
you can see without contouring at all
there's natural shadows on my nose all
you're gonna be doing is just drawing in
the shadows a little bit so that way
it's basically tricking the lighting for
this look I'm using the elf I brush this
is actually a lip brush by Sigma but I
love to use this because it has a very
small
Hiep and it works really well so I'm
just going to take a little bit of that
brown cream contour and I'm going to
start applying this right at the tip of
my nose now of course depending on your
nose everyone has different nose I like
to contour the tip to define it a little
bit I also like to contour the sides to
make it thinner but if you guys have
some sort of bump I'll show you also how
you can straighten it out so right here
I'm just adding it right to the tip of
my nose like that and then I'm going to
slowly do the sides and drag it up
towards my brows as I said before you
could see up here my nose is pretty wide
so by drawing the lines closer together
it's going to give it the effect that I
have a thinner nose
once you get it to your brows you're
going to go again with the natural
curves of your face and you're just
going to darken that line right into
here and by doing that up here that's
also going to make this appear thinner
at the top
now I have a little bit of a bump on
this side of my nose so one thing I
always do is I like to turn my head to
the side and you can see how it goes
like out so what I like to do is just
draw that line perfectly straight and it
just erases that bump
you
now I have some creepy looking lines in
my face what I like to do next is use my
small tapered blending brush this is e
45 and I like to just pinch it like this
and then blend out these lines
and the coolest part about this is if
you have a dramatic makeup look or just
brown shadow in your crease you're going
to connect it with your nose and it's
going to all blend together making it
appear more natural
next I'm taking my Beauty Blender and
this is what I use to apply my
foundation as well as my concealer so
I'm just going to very lightly go over
the brown lines
so when contouring your nose it's like a
long process because you want it to be
as natural as possible so after I
blended it in a little bit the beauty
blender you could see how the line kind
of went down a little bit and it's going
more towards my wider natural nose so
I'm just gonna take a whatsoever left on
this brush and just go over the
beginning line normally when I contour
my nose I do it before I apply my
concealer but before I started filming I
did my concealer beforehand but what's
really important to remember is when you
are contouring your nose it's important
to highlight on the sides of your nose
because it's going to get rid of any
other shadows that's making your nose
appear larger so I always like to use
the lightest concealer right on the
sides as well as right on the bridge and
this is going to help add dimension into
your nose and by highlighting the tip of
it it's going to really make it look a
lot thinner the last step is going to be
to apply a little bit of a highlighter
right on the bridge of your nose
so that is how I contour my nose I
basically do it every single time I do
my makeup if I'm doing a more natural
look I always tend to stick with a brown
powder as opposed to the crane base
which I use today also if you guys
watched one of my favorites videos I
don't remember how long ago it was
I mentioned this little nose huggy thing
and I honestly wear this every single
time before I do my makeup what I
normally do is I'll do my hair before my
makeup so for about 10 minutes I'll clip
this little bad boy on and I swear it
flattens out my nose the tip of my nose
is kind of round so I like to put it
right there and then it kind of just
deflate sit a little bit and I actually
forgot to wear this in one of my videos
that I recently posted and a lot of
people were like why does your nose look
swollen blah blah blah and I was like oh
my god it looks swollen because I didn't
use this little thing you can get these
for probably like a dollar on Amazon I
will link it for anyone interested in
trying it but I swear by it I've had it
for about two years now and maybe even
longer maybe like three years I always
used to wear it my mom would walk in on
me and she'd be like what the heck is
wrong with you girl that does not work
but I think it works so that's why I
continue to use it so I hope this video
helped for some of you guys I am not
against plastic surgery in any way but
just for me I don't find it necessary I
sit here and I preach about beauty and
inner beauty so for me to go get a nose
job kind of contradicts that whole
purpose so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video hopefully learn something new and
if you guys are not happy with your nose
don't worry because makeup can fix it
plus the surgery is not always the
answer I love you guys so much and thank
you for watching I'll see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
