you are watching this video right now
that means that my Carli bybel palette
is now available on the BH Cosmetics
website so pause this video head over
there right now you can click the link
right here or you can click the link
below in the description box and it will
take you to the website to go purchase
the palette but if it does sell out we
will add a pre-order page that way
everybody can get it so don't worry also
for the launch price it's only $12.50
which is absolutely crazy so make sure
to get it as soon as possible because
you really can't beat that deal $12.50
for 10 eyeshadows and for highlighter
shades and my opinion they are
absolutely incredible so I've seen so
many people posting about it and I'm so
so so excited that this day has finally
come I hope you all love it as much as I
do I also wanted to create another look
using my palette today so if you want to
learn how I got this dramatic fall look
please keep watching to start off this
look I'm priming my eyes with stay don't
stray then I'm picking up the number two
shadow in my new palette and I'm
applying this all over my eyelids also
underneath my brow
picking up this copper color with a
large blending brush I am applying this
right into my crease
with a small pencil brush and this plum
color I'm going to start filling in the
outer V of my eye I'm just using the end
of my eyelash glue to prevent any
fallout and also to give me a good
ending point where I should end my
eyeshadow so you just want to slowly
work in this shade
blending it slowly into the color on the
lid also blending it up into that copper
shade as well with a smaller blending
brush and a little bit of that same
purple shadow I'm gonna blend the two
colors in together then with a large
blending brush and a little bit more of
that copper shade I'm just blending this
all again together the key to this look
is to just keep blending that way they
all kind of fade nicely together next
I'm doing my eyeliner I am doing a rough
draft for this eyeliner at first and
then I'm gonna go in at the end and fix
it so don't mind how it looks for half
of this video I ends up going back in
later on for this look I am using my
Carlie lash then I'm going in with that
same dark plum color and I'm wetting my
pencil brush with fix+
first and I'm just darkening all of the
shades a little bit then with a blending
brush just repeat the same steps just
keep blending
for underneath the eye I'm using that
same plum color for the outer half don't
mind my under eye wrinkles I tried a
different concealer and powder today and
I didn't really like how it looked but
it's okay because we can cover it up
with eye shadow that's why I love doing
a thick lower lash line with eye shadow
because just covers up your under eye
wrinkles and if you're under 24 you
probably don't know about them but I'm
using the matte nude shade for the inner
tear-duct
so right after this I just started
adding more gel liner over it and then I
didn't realize but my memory card ran
out so I actually also applied a nude
liner in the lower lash line so now
moving on to my face
I am bronzing up with the Kat Von D
contour kit for blush I'm using like a
plum color by Mac I don't remember the
name offhand but I will list everything
below in the description box as usual
so the first lip color that I tried I
ended up not liking it also don't mind
the lips but I'm going in with this
Anastacio liquid lipstick and I am
lining them with my Mac plum lip liner
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video remember to go
check out my palette it is now available
on the BH Cosmetics website it's only
$12.50 for a limited time and I'm so
excited that the day has finally come
