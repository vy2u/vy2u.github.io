sorry it's been way too long since I
posted I have been moving and I'm
packing and there's still so many boxes
and I just feel like it is completely
taking up all of my time I also wasn't
feeling too well over the weekend so I
was laying in bed just kind of relaxing
taking a little bit easy so I do
apologize but today I am back with
another color series video I wanted to
do cranberry because I posted a picture
doing this exact makeup look and a lot
of you guys were loving it and asking
for a makeup tutorial so I figured
instead of just doing the makeup
tutorial let me do the whole color
series and include all of my favorite
cranberry products fall is coming and if
you guys don't already know if all is
one of my favorite season so I am ready
for it I know we still have a few more
weeks of summer so don't think I'm
rushing it or anything so if you guys
want to see some of my favorite
cranberry products and also learn how I
did this makeup look please keep
watching so to start off this cranberry
color series I figured I would show you
guys my new obsession and it just so
happens to be cranberry uhm this cup is
ridiculously large but the past two
weeks all that I've been drinking is
this passion fruit and green tea um I
see and it's just basically how I
ordered is half passion half green iced
tea it is so delicious and refreshing
it's really the only drink of the light
you get in a treinta cup and I've been
wanting trend to cup forever so yeah
this is so delicious so refreshing and
it was funny because last night when I
decided I'm gonna film this color series
I was like oh my god I have to get one
of these just I could show you but you
guys know me at all you know I love
Starbucks and you know that I love the
chai that's basically the only drink
I've ever gotten but when I used to work
at Starbucks that was a drink that I
made all the time when I was eat
because it's more refreshing it's not as
milky so yeah it's delicious if any of
you guys want to go out and try it let
me know how you like it because I think
it's amazing so to start off the color
series I'm going to be talking about
some of my favorite cranberry lipsticks
I didn't want to get you guys confused
because there is like a deep plum color
that's very similar to the cranberry but
I'm going to be doing that in a
different color series video so a few of
my favorites from last year that I
remember posting like sangria and Red
Bull those are more like a deeper plum
so that's why I'm not including them in
this video first I'm going to talk about
the three MAC lipsticks that I love that
are cranberry the first one that I
absolutely love is called sin and this
is a great cranberry color it's also a
matte lipstick I accidentally have two
of these I had one for a while and then
when I was recently in the store
swatching I picked up another one not
realizing that I had it
now I alphabetical lies alphabetical
eyes of abetik alized I organized my MAC
lipsticks alphabetically so I don't have
that problem again but this is an
amazing amazing lipstick this is
actually what I'm wearing on my lips
right now the second one is limited
edition by Mac and it's called Talk That
Talk
this was the Rihanna's collection and
it's a really really nice matte
cranberry color as well this was a
little bit darker than the sin and the
third one that I have is called darkside
and this one was one of my favorites
last year this is also a great cranberry
color this one has more of a creamy
finish so it's not that matte finish if
you're not looking to get a gloss to pop
on top of it so it really just depends
on what kind of texture you like for
your lipsticks I will be showing
swatches of all of them so you guys can
compare the different colors so now
let's move on to cheaper alternatives I
have for free guys the first one is by
NYX and this one's not as deep of a read
but it is a dark cranberry red this one
is called Mary Jane's and this one is a
really nice deep red color if you use
this alone without a darker liner it's
going to look more red but if you mix
and match you can always use the darker
lip liner have it fade in and then
to make it own bride to a lighter red
color that would look really pretty me
next one is by Maybelline and it's
called red revival this is also a deeper
red color then I have two by Milani one
is called Cabernet blend and this one is
an amazing duplicate for the lipstick
color that I have on now and they also
smell really nice and also dark cherry
this one's a little bit more of a deeper
cranberry but this one is really really
great as well for lip glosses I have 3
dark cranberries that I love the one
that I'm wearing on my lips right now is
called seduction by Gerard cosmetics
this one is so pigmented that you don't
even need a lipstick underneath it so it
just really depends on how deep and how
dark you're looking to go but the Gerard
cosmetics lip glosses are normally
around $25 a pop and for a limited time
I have 5 for 40 so you can get 5
different colors for $40 and base to
clean every single one of my videos I
mention a different color of them they
really are just the most pigmented
non-sticky amazing glosses that I have
and that's why I always continuously
mention them for you guys so a lot of
people have been really excited about
this new deal 5 for 40 so I will link
all those details below if any of you
guys are interested another one also by
Gerard cosmetics is called jewel this
one is more of a shimmery cranberry it's
not as mad as the seduction one and the
third one is by the balm and it's called
boom-boom but these ones are awesome I
got a little care package in the mail
from the balm and they send me some
really awesome stuff and these lip
glosses are amazing moving on to liners
I have three for you guys the one that I
use today is by Milani and it's called
sugarplum so this is this one an exact
duplicate of that is by Jordana and this
one's called Cabernet this one you could
find at Walgreens so just depending on
wherever you
you see either of these brands are
literally the exact same color and the
third one is by Mac this was also from
the RiRi collection and top it's called
Talk That Talk which I think I think the
other one was called Talk That Talk so
it's just a liner to go with the
lipstick next moving on to cranberry
blushes I have a few for you guys the
first one is by Tarte and this one is
called shimmering poppy this one is
amazing I really love the consistency of
the Tarte blushes and this is a great
cranberry color the next one is by Mac
and it's called peachy keen and this is
like a nice peachy cranberry color this
is actually the one that I've used on my
cheeks oh and then in the North pout
there's a cranberry blush in here as
well I don't think it says what name it
is but this was a limited edition
palette that's falling apart at the
seams but it's a really nice cranberry
color I'll find out the name for it
because I'm sure they sell them in the
individuals as well moving on to shadows
I have two pigments that I wanted to
share with you guys these ones are both
by Mac one is called heritage Rouge and
the other one is called rose this one is
more like a bronze cranberry mixture and
then this one's a just like a cranberry
pigment but I am in love with the Mac
pigments I think I have almost every
single color and what's awesome about
them is I use them all the time and it
looks like they've never been touched
they just will never run out I feel like
these will last you forever so that's
why I always recommend some of the Mac
products um not too fond of their skin
care or their skin your foundation and
stuff but their I shadow is the pigments
are amazing the next shot I was also by
Mac this one is called smoked ruby and
this is like a mineral eyeshadow so
these ones look really nice if you dip
your brush into like fix+ first or
something just to get your brush wet
it's going to really really bring out
the pigment this is going to be a really
really deep cranberry color but this is
awesome and I have an idea of a makeup
look that I want to do I'm probably
using this another cranberry shadow that
I love is from my galaxy chic palette
this palette is probably one of my most
used palettes I love how they're like
the baked mineral eye
shadows the color that I love oh my god
this thing is falling apart isn't
getting a new one
it's called Aphrodite and it's a really
beautiful cranberry color the next item
is in a cranberry casing so I figured I
would include it this is a L'Oreal
miracle blur I believe I included this
in one of my favorites videos or I
believe I included this in one of my
favorites videos or a drugstore haul but
I really love this this is great to use
as like a primer or if you want to do a
no makeup makeup look I don't know what
it is inside of it that really mattifies
your face but you put it on your face
and it kind of just blurs out all your
pores your fine lines it gives you just
like a matte finish so a lot of people
I've seen loved it for a no makeup
makeup look you can also use a fro
primer so this is the cranberry color I
wanted to include with this video as
well next I have two cranberry and nail
polishes that I'm loving the first one
is called lost on Lombard this is by OPI
and I was planning on painting my nails
before this video and I completely
forgot to be honest so I will be using
this on a lot for the fall time and
another one is like a sparkly cranberry
that I love by Essie and this one is
called toggle to the top so I had thrown
this little cute baby because he sits
right on my vanity um Nicole Guerrero
sent me a little care package a few
months back with some goodies in it and
this was one of them and it's a little
cherry chapstick like how cute is that
so and it's cranberry so I had to of
course include this so thanks to Cole
love you girl so the last two cranberry
items are going to be what I use for my
hair actually the six in one Bellamy
curler is actually a beautiful cranberry
color and this is what I use to curl my
hair I'm not sure what head this is I
will list it below to let you guys know
and I also use it for hairspray by the
balm it's hairspray flexible hold and
root it's called I guess but it has a
little buffs on it that's also cranberry
and this is the hairspray that I've been
using recently so I wanted to include
that as well I have a 160 dollar off
code for this
- non curler and this is the only thing
that I use when I wreck around my hair
now and I absolutely love it I've had it
for over a year and it's still gone
strong so I have no complaints on that
and also for my hair I'm wearing the new
Bellamy 24 inch I like to call it
mermaid hair my natural hair has gotten
so long that the Lily hair is the same
length as my hair so I wanted to add a
little bit more length today so I
decided to use the longer extensions so
yeah I think that is it for now
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you are in the search for some cranberry
products I hope this video helps also
stay tuned because I'm going to show you
guys how i got this makeup look and
definitely go check out my blog because
I'll have all my products use all
products listed and so much more and
yeah guess that's it for now and I hope
you enjoyed the makeup section of this
video to start off this look I'm priming
my eyes with my pursuade eyeshadow base
by sigma then grabbing my Kiko eyeshadow
and number 208 I'm applying this color
all over my eyelids I'm first dipping my
brush in fix+
to really bring out the color of the
shadow then from this BH pad I'm taking
this brown shimmer color and I'm
applying it with a big blending brush
right into my crease I'm blending this
in my whole crease and out towards my
eyebrow
using the newsstand out eyes by Sigma
I'm using the black gel liner and the
eyeliner brush as well and I am just
winging out my eyeliner then I'm
applying false lashes these are the
whispies by Ardell I'm not cutting them
I'm just using the full strip and I'm
applying my L'Oreal telescopic over that
picking up that same color I used in my
crease with this pencil brush I'm lining
my lower lash line then using this Stila
shadow I'm applying this right
underneath my brows and also in my tear
duct next I'm applying my bronzer this
one is by Mac it is in the
limited-edition packaging but it is just
the refined Boldin bronzer
for blush I'm using peachy-keen by Mac
and then to highlight them using the
same shadow that I used right on my eyes
the Kiko highlighter and number 208
align my lips I'm using by Milani the
color Sugar Plum
the lipstick I'm using is called sin by
Mac and as you can see I'm applying it
just on the outer parts of my lips first
and this is going to help give it a
little bit of an ombre look so start out
putting it heavier on the outer part and
then just by dabbing your lips together
it'll all blend in your lip gloss I'm
using by Gerard cosmetics the color
seduction and I'm doing the same thing
where I'm applying it just on the outer
part and then I'm going to give it
almost like an ombre look
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
I love you guys so much thank you for
being patient with me during this crazy
move of mine I promise to have more
videos coming for you guys and until
next time I'll see you guys later
