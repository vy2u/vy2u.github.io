watching
wondering what
you should kiss me
you should
hi everyone thank you for watching so
this video I'm going to be showing you
how to make your own liquid eyeliner so
if you have any eye shadows at home or
even if you want to go out and buy it
the eye shadow that I'm using this video
is only $7.99 and you can get it at any
drugstore so basically if you can see I
just created an eye liner using an eye
shadow and I'm going to teach you how to
do it so if you want to learn please
keep watching and I will show you how in
this video the lipstick I'm wearing is
called impassion from Mac I also did
find one called coral crush by
Maybelline that is cheaper and it is
very similar in color for this look I'm
going to be using L'Oreal h IP cosmetics
and I'm going to be using it in the
color show e I'm going to be taking a
little cosmetic knife and I'm going to
be scraping the dark blue color right
onto the bottom of this glass
after you scrape it you can just tip it
over and you'll see the powder just fall
right out and you're going to do the
same thing with the turquoise color this
is going to be what you're using for
your liquid liner
next I'm going to be taking my mac fix+
and I'm going to be spraying a small
amount also on the bottom of this glass
this fix+ is going to turn the eyeshadow
into a liquid form and then to be a lot
easier to slide right on as a liquid
liner I'm dipping my Mac 210 eyeliner
brush into the fix+
swirling it into the dark blue color and
I'm going to just show you exactly how
it's going to come out right on my hand
and as you can see in one little stroke
it comes out pretty dark and it's a nice
blue shade I'm also going to be using
the turquoise color for underneath my
eye also as a liner
first I'm going to be lining my upper
lash line with the dark blue color as I
had just shown you previously when
you're doing this it's easy to do it if
you have a very close mirror and you're
going to want to do it in small sections
once you finish lining your upper lash
line you're then going to apply your
full slashes at this time if you choose
to do so minor by Ardell and their
number 105 and you can get these at any
drugstore then you apply your mascara
I'm using my all-time favorite which is
L'Oreal telescopic and carbon black next
I'm going to be taking my next we're
going to be taking that turquoise color
and applying this right underneath my
lower lash line you want to drag it out
to extend it to the dark blue line on
top and you're just going to go along
your lash line
this part is optional but if you do want
to apply the turquoise color inside of
your lower lash line you can do so also
sometimes when you apply lashes the
color might feed a little bit so you can
just go over the top blue line one more
time
August 25th will be one year officially
on YouTube so I'm going to be doing lots
of giveaway so keep checking back and I
will talk to guys soon Rennes do the
back to your front door
PAP scared
death can catch my breath all these
