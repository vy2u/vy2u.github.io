it's been quite a bit since I have done
a current favorites video so I figured I
would talk about some of my favorite
products at the moment I have some
makeup products well a lot of makeup
products some fashion and I also have a
little bit of a home decor involved so
you guys want to hear some of my
favorites please keep watching so I
would say over the past year year and a
half I've been ridiculously obsessed
with highlighters I've been trying all
different ones trying to find the best
ones out there and I came across a
couple recently that I wanted to mention
the first ones are by angel Marino the
artist whoo okay so these are the artist
Couture diamond glow patterns and they
are so awesome I am wearing the color
gold digger I can never really get the
lighting right to get like the perfect
highlight pic so let's try here can you
see it yeah so that is the one that I'm
wearing today and the other one that I'm
loving is called conceited conceited is
more of a beige color while the one that
I'm wearing today is more like a silvery
color I figured with this silver shirt
that I just got from ASOS actually it
would go perfect with this highlighter
so I've been using these all the time
and they are just so amazing I love how
their loose powder so I just like to use
a little bit with my finger and then
just put it right on my cheekbones so I
actually go to Walmart to get my nails
done they have a nail salon in the
Walmart by my house so usually I'll go
get my nails done and then Brett will
either go to the gym or go somewhere in
the mean time and then come back and get
me so if there's time in between I
always end up walking around Walmart and
finding all kinds of stuff that I
definitely do not need but I actually
recently picked up the bronze booster by
Physicians Formula
and this is what I'm actually wearing
now for bronzer it's a bronzer and
highlighter in one it's so pretty I love
how pigmented it is and I've tried a few
highlighters from this company
and I wasn't too fond of them but this
one I love it's more of a highlighting
bronzer
I know people tend to stay away from
highlighter in the fall / winter time
but for me I don't know I just can't
seem to get rid of them every time I
finish a look I just always end up
adding some sort of highlight because
just like being nice and glowy another
favorite that I've been using the past
month is the forever nudist salt and
glow palette by BH so it has contour
shades it has blushed shade that has a
highlight to put over your concealer and
it also has a highlighter so I love this
palette it's super affordable as
everything is on BH but I love that they
came out with something like this
because I've been loving the anastacio
kit but this is definitely a cheaper
option for those of you on a budget
looking for something similar and the
next highlighter is a1 by Chanel that is
amazing I think it's a limited edition
for the holidays but I'm not sure I will
double-check for you guys but it says
gorgeous pearly white color and I think
this is such an amazing highlight it's
so pigmented this one is definitely more
pricey so I wanted to show a few of the
options that I like they're kind of all
over in the price range for those of you
guys looking next moving on to lip
products I have a bunch this fall I've
been gravitating a lot more towards the
Browns and the plums as most people are
I honestly was never really into the
Browns I remember back in the 90s when I
wasn't allowed to wear any makeup I
would sneak and steal my mom's lipstick
and put them on and they were always
like a brown shade and I haven't seen
that in so long but it's so cool to see
them back because I think they're really
cool and it's something different it's
different from the typical red or
cranberry look that we tend to go for in
the fall so I have a few favorites that
I wanted to share with you guys that
I've been loving on my lips today I'm
wearing the draw a cosmetics plum crazy
and it's so pigmented that I didn't need
a lipstick underneath it I'm wearing the
lip liner plum by Mac as well another
one is cocoa bean by drawing cosmetics
and again these ones are really
pigmented so you don't need the
lipsticks if you guys want like a glossy
finish these are a great alternative the
next two you can find right at your
drugstore one of them is wet and wild
bear at all which is 902
and the other one is NYX simply simply
mood simply nude in exposed so this one
I got it Alta but you can also find NYX
at I have a Harmons by me that sells NYX
I don't know if you guys have a Harmon
site you but I'm sure you can find the
NYX products somewhere but these ones
are nice and affordable and this
lipstick was like two dollars by Wet n
Wild I've been wearing this a lot lately
and it's this beautiful nude / pink /
Browns / beige color that I've been
loving and the final two are these new
lip pencils they're both by Sigma 1 is
called indulgent and the other one's
called gold Dutch and these are cool
because they're like thicker lip liners
so one thing I like to do constantly is
and if I'm in a rush or if I'm just
feeling lazy I'll just use a lip liner
and then color in my lips with that same
liner so these ones you can you do the
exact same thing but since there's so
much bigger it's easier to fill them all
in and you can use it as just a nude
look or to put as a base for something
else next I have two skin products all
kind of skin products the first one is
the million dollar tan shade upgrade I
just started using this I would say the
last month or so but I've had it for a
little bit longer I just hadn't tried it
out cuz I wasn't exactly sure what it
was but this is what you mix in with
your foundation to give you like a nice
bronzy look I like to do spray tans all
the time so it's hard to have a
foundation that's gonna match like every
single skin tone because I'm like 12
different skin tones throughout the year
so this is awesome if you just put a
pump of it along with your foundation
it's gonna give you that really rich
brown color so it's gonna match your
body I know a lot of people always
complain that my base number matches my
body but it's because I would like to
wear a lot of concealer and I guess with
the flash sometimes makes it look a
little bit more white but this is
awesome again to add with your
foundation the next one is by Jergens
it's called it's called soft shimmer I
think there's just a tag in front of it
skin radiance moisturizer and this is
actually my second bottle of this I used
to use this all the time especially when
I was in convocation or whenever I was
ringing like a bathing suit cuz it gives
your skin just like a really pretty
shiny finish
there's no self tanner in it or there's
no color in it so it's not gonna give
you a tan but it's just gonna illuminate
your skin and it goes on just like
lotion and it's not sticky or anything
like that it's just gonna give you a
nice little shimmer so I'm loving this
as well even though it's not summer I
just feel like with the winter and the
dull skin this is just gonna give you a
little bit of a nice glow another time
that I've been loving is the Burt's bee
facial cleansing towelettes they smell
so delicious and I actually picked these
up when I was at Whole Foods there was a
few things that I actually picked up
when I was at Whole Foods because
everything there just is like organic
and good for you these were one of them
because the makeup wipes that I was
using apparently weren't good for your
eyes and I used to use them on my eyes
all the time because what I like to do
at night before I wash my makeup off if
it's a lot of makeup I'll use a wipe to
get all my makeup off and then I'll go
and wash my face afterwards just so I
want to use like regular soap and I
don't have to do a couple extra
processes but this one I'm loving so far
it smells delicious and it really works
well and apparently they're better for
you so I'm all for it so I I think some
of you may have seen my post on my
birthday at 12 o'clock on October 16th
which was the day before my birthday or
actually well 12 o'clock was now then my
birthday Brett surprised me with some
cards and a few like little gifts and he
wrote in one of the cards that we are
gonna go to Short Hills Mall and go to
the Chanel store and I could pick out
whatever I want so I was like that was
like the coolest gift ever I've never
had anybody spoil me in that way so I
was so excited and went to the store and
I found the most perfect bag and there
was a girl there that was actually gonna
be buying it cuz she worked there and
she decided to just give it to me so it
was just so exciting was the only one
left and this is it isn't it so pretty
I like felt so bad when he was buying it
I just kept saying like are you sure you
sure it's just I don't know I have I
have my Jumanji bag but I don't really
have many other designer bags but I'm so
excited so I just wanted to show you
guys this because it is my favorite at
the moment it's the boy bag by Chanel
I'm not sure what size it is but um
on the box let you guys know but those
of you who want to see it this is it so
I'm not sure what video was that I had
mentioned that I have eczema and dry
skin and sensitive skin and all that
stuff so I saw some people asking like
what I do to help it and I mean nothing
really makes it go away unfortunately I
wish there was just something you can
apply to it it never comes back because
I hate eczema so annoying and especially
in the winter months and the colder
months it's just getting a lot worse but
what I always use is the Eucerin
it's called skin coming dry skin body
wash and the reason I like this is
because I found when I was using
different body washes with some sense in
it or that we're more like creamy it
just would make my eczema a lot worse
and it would make it a lot more itchy so
this is probably my like sixth or
seventh bottle of this I just started
using this I don't know maybe six months
ago seven months ago and I wish I found
it sooner because it's amazing and it
really does help so if you guys have
eczema psoriasis or just dry itchy skin
this definitely will help and especially
now that winter is coming we need stuff
to keep her skin nice and moisturize so
I like to use this and then over that I
use the user and body lotion I have
literally if you saw my cabinet you
would laugh I have like six bottles of
them I have the eczema cream which brett
actually got me is so cute on my
birthday the night of like I was telling
you he came with five OK's of flowers
five cards a little cane it was called
the Carly Kap commitment cane so when
I'm old I'll be nice and stylish with my
little cane because I was like a leopard
cane he's so cute but he also went to
Walgreens and like picked out what he
thought was some of my favorite stuff he
got me like a hairbrush she got me
lotion got me hair spray he just got me
some goodies and it was just so cute but
in that bag he knows how much I love you
strength
he got me uterine eczema cream it's a
body lotion but it's for when you have
eczema and I actually didn't have that
one I usually use the dry skin one so
I've been using that one lately and I'm
loving it so thanks babe for thinking of
me and just knowing what kind of stuff
in like such a cutie now that it's
getting cold
one thing I'm obsessed with our slippers
I got these cute little bad boys they're
little hippos I got them recently and
I'm wearing them all the time because
with the hardwood floor downstairs my
feet are always freezing and I just have
bad circulation in my hands my feet so
these are a must I got these and I also
picked up these and they're both from
ASOS and I think they're both still
available but are these just so cute so
I definitely needed these because my
last pair I wore way too much and I
sometimes would wear them outside and
they were just a big mess so I need a
new pair so those are definitely my
favorites and will be my favorites the
entire winter I wanted to share two
candles with you that I'm loving and
then I have burning in my house at all
times
I have Yankee Candle salted caramel and
it also smells a little bit like
chocolate and the mix of all that which
is just ridiculous when I was shopping
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond to decorate my
house and to get stuff for my house I
saw these and I bought like five of them
I then went back and bought like five
more so I'm obsessed with these this
one's almost empty and it's my last one
but I also have golden maple waffles oh
they are so oh my god they're both of
them they're just so ridiculous this one
I think I got from Walgreens
yeah I'm almost positive but yeah I love
my house smelling nice and yummy and I
think these flavors are perfect for the
fall time because I mean I guess any
time of year they would be good because
they just smell so good but normally I
would like vanilla or the cupcakes but
these ones are my favorite at the moment
so one more product and I wanted to
share with you guys because it is the
coolest invention ever and I just had my
downstairs done what it is is it's
called temp paper and it's temporary
wallpaper my mom actually works for the
company and she was the one who
introduced me to it and she was like you
have to check this out it's basically
just
huge sticker that you put on your wall
and if you get bored in a month two
months a year you could take it down so
for me since me and Brett are renting at
our new place now I couldn't really do
anything permanent because we're not
gonna be living here forever
so when we moved in there was a red wall
which I originally really liked and I
was gonna keep but my old place had wall
red and it just was very dark and what I
wanted when we moved into this new place
was just like a very bright open airy
house because I felt like I was in a
cave in my last apartment so I was
looking on their website they have so
many different designs and I picked out
the one that I liked best and I just did
the wall so it's super easy it's
basically a do-it-yourself project which
is really cool and again it's perfect
for temporary youth so dorm rooms if
you're renting if you maybe want to
decorate a room but you not sure if you
want to keep it that way
I'm also gonna be doing a few walls in
this beauty room as well as my closet
friends and I actually chose it's not
available yet so I will definitely show
you guys when I update both my video
room and my closet because it's just the
coolest invention ever and I'm just
gonna show you guys a clip of my
downstairs and no I'm not finished
decorating so don't judge me yet I will
be doing a house tour I mean it's like a
town house a town house tour once I'm
done decorating but it's just been kind
of a slow process so as you can see on
this wall the top is like a grayish when
we moved in at the bottom half was all
this deep red so we just put the temp
aper on the bottom half of the wall as
like an accent wall which I thought was
really nice and then I picked up these
chairs right here from Pier one which
matched the temper a little bit it's
like more of like an accent piece so I
just did the to end chairs with that
chair and then I got these beige
cushions because see cherrywood table so
I wasn't sure how well it would match
but I got the beige cushions so I'm
gonna just show you guys really quick
how easy see if when I peel down do you
see how there's the red underneath so
basically like I just said it's just a
sticker
there you go so that is how I did the
whole red part of the wall and I thought
it was a really awesome new product that
I had to share with you guys and it's
just such a beautiful print they have
all kinds of prints online so I will
link it below for anyone interested also
tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. I'm leaving
for Nashville because I'm going to the
Country Music Awards I'm so excited and
I can't even believe that it's real I
got invited to go this year so I'm just
so excited and I was wondering if you
guys wanted me to vlog I was thinking
about vlogging the trip I will only be
going for two full days I'm coming home
Thursday super early but I think it's
gonna be such a cool experience and I
can't wait and thinking maybe I'll do
like a get ready with me video if I have
time but if not I'm definitely gonna
vlog if you guys want to see it it's
been way too long since I have done
anything for my second channel and also
yesterday I had my meetup in New York
City so I just wanted to say thank you
to everyone who showed up it was so much
fun and I swear just having those
meetups just makes me remember why I'm
obsessed with what I do and how lucky I
am and it was just so much love in one
room and I would love to start planning
more meetups all around the country and
all around the world one day because I
need to travel more and it's just so
much fun getting to meet you guys so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I
probably won't have a video up until
later in the week but I will definitely
get one up as soon as I'm back from
Tennessee I love you guys so much and
until next time I'll see you guys later
