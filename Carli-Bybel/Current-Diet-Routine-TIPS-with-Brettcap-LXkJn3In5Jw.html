can already see by the title what it is
titled like I could do it no I'm doing
like I said make sure just getting
quality food into your body you're just
so smart I can listen you tackled a cool
hi everyone thank you for watching today
I'm here with Brett and we wanted to sit
down because I've seen so many comments
and so many questions asking about what
I do on a day to day basis as far as
what I eat what I do to at the gym how I
workout blah blah blah blah so I figured
I would bring Brett in with me because
he is my personal trainer / motivator /
tells me everything I need to be doing
so right so some of you guys may not be
as lucky to have a live in personal
trainer so we're just gonna go through I
guess okay no I know why you're going
out yeah it's the only reason that's why
were together two years almost Oh - Make
A Wish Make A Wish so if you guys want
to hear a little bit more about it
please keep watching your eyelash one on
my iPhone in your face when you blew it
yeah it's crazy is that like a double
one hear it blow it off here it's on
your nose no I'm just kidding
hey okay so why don't we start out by
telling them what we love to eat for
breakfast okay
because breakfast is so important right
when you're sticking with it right so
basically if anybody's watching my
videos you know when you get up in the
morning your body's been fasting a
little bit obviously depending on how
long you've been sleeping for so you
want to get like a nice cold glass of
water and that will wake you up more you
know have you feeling refreshed
rehydrate you and which will give you
more energy because your body's been too
hydrated of water one of the most
important things your body could have so
you want to wake up a cold glass of
water and then for breakfast you want to
stay healthy whole grains you know
oatmeal we do egg whites oatmeal as you
guys know is one of my favorite meals
she loves it as well with blueberries
you want to put some super fruits on top
okay what's your best no you're doing
want to put some super fruits on top
like blueberries raspberries
blackberries all those types of berries
are so good and go so go with oatmeal
mix fruit some day some days I'll just
make a smoothie for us and we'll have
like a protein smoothie with maybe I'll
throw some granola in there
Greek yogurt it's a good thing for
breakfast it all depends on your
macronutrients micronutrients and we'll
get into that on my channel but for
today for Carly boat meal egg whites all
right stick with healthy unfried foods
and if you're going to be using any
types of oils make sure they're healthy
when you're making those eggs and you
have tons of cooking videos
oh so many cooking videos but um plenty
more to come too one thing that I always
did wrong before we started dating was I
would always skip breakfast that was
like one of my things that I would
always do I would go get coffee and then
I'd be set till about 12:00 1:00 o'clock
and then I would have my first meal of
the day and that was I think one of the
biggest problems that I had because
before you I thought oh well if I eat
breakfast and I get really hungry like a
lot quicker I think that's like one of
the things why though I know because
you're starting up your metabolism bah
bah bah so that's I think one of the
biggest things that we recommend is to
have breakfast because I've done it I
never ate breakfast even before school
because if I ate breakfast I'd be
starving by like a second period
so also if you take vitamins in the
morning it's good to have them on food
with your breakfast so there's someone
who's taking vitamins why don't we go
through the list of the vitamins that we
take every morning some mornings I'm
like I can't take that money I'm gonna
die all right so with vitamins like I
said you want to do it in the morning
with your breakfast just because you
don't wanna take them on an empty
stomach so if you're someone who's
taking a fish oil pill or krill oil pill
or something like that make sure you're
eating with food and that's something
that me and her both take alright we
also take probiotic pills probiotic
pills you guys know from few of my
videos if you watch them you know
they're just going to really boost your
immune system boost your digestive
system help put good bacteria back into
your body to break down those foods that
maybe might harm our organs stuff like
that that produce acid in our body so
probiotics is a very important thing
she takes iron because the doctor
recommended that to her so I don't take
the iron although maybe I could but my
iron levels are pretty good well you
guys should monitor that some people if
you're fatigued it could be because you
don't have enough iron in your body so
maybe that supplement is something that
you'd want to go with we both take men's
and women's multivitamins she also takes
the Garcinia cambogia lately she's been
doing that as a dietary supplement those
of them out
that may not have anion problem so you
recommend everybody to take a
multivitamin and no soil I don't want to
I'm not a doctor I'm not gonna set up
here and recommend you this is what's
gonna work for you and make you feel
better what I tell ya what I suggest is
that you guys take it upon yourself a
little bit just to figure out what's
gonna work for you what might help you
reach your goal whatever it is that much
faster help you feel better about
yourself in the morning help your body
feel better you know there's things out
there for us other than egg mcmuffins
and hash browns and coffee to have in
the morning that'll help us start our
day energize our body and every single
person in this world is different and
yeah what works for me might work for
you what works for her might work for
you but it's really important you find
what works best for you
we also take glucosamine pills which
keep our joints lubricated you know if
you're sore after you workout it's a
good supplement to take because it gives
your body all that lubrication and it
really helps you feel better when you're
sore and loosens you up while we're on
the subject of breakfast another thing
that we started doing also is try to
replace coffee with tea tea is so much
better for you
we've both been recommending the mate'
Fit tea forever now they have the detox
tea they have the metabolic boost which
is good to boost your metabolism they
also have the goji powder which we like
to throw in our smoothies so those are
also really good supplements that you
can include in your diet that are going
to help boost your metabolism if you
want to detox your body they have that
tea stalks which i think is like how
many days long that you take it all
depends they have like a couple
different have a couple weeks cycles but
it really you know if you're go on a
vacation and you've been drinking a
little bit and you just want to really
get all that crap out of your body
without going to a steam room or going
into one of those types of things
detox tea is a great great option yeah
and he has a 10% off code which we will
list below okay so why don't we move on
to lunch options snack options will let
me tell you guys without sitting here
all day talking about it which we can
you know I can do because I'm rambles
McRonald rambling Ronald alright um it's
really important you guys break your
meals into smaller meals like if you're
someone who's been only getting two or
three meals a day make sure you're
breaking it in turn it into six and just
like she said before when she eats in
the morning she wants to eat again in a
couple hours because I met about you
know engine is running you know you get
your body moving and I promise you
you're going to be one to eat more so
you guys
break those meals away don't over eat
all right for snacks after your
breakfast you know something like stay
with fruits stay with things that are
natural from our earth so it's really
important that we kind of stick to the
natural stuff you don't want to go with
a lot of stuff with preservatives in it
all that added sugar or whatever
fat-free sugar-free we talked about it
it's all bad
so for snacks in between meals Carly
usually will go with something
nutritious like fruit with some
hard-boiled eggs or maybe a smoothie I
know one of my favorite snacks is the
coconut fire
brew yo yo yo little high in fat but
it's a really good meal it fills you
yeah it's really really me all right
it's got good protein in it and it's got
probiotics in it which is really good to
prefer something we you know dairy we
don't really like to go crazy with
lately though like as a healthier like
dessert we've gotten some coconut
milk-based ice cream which is organic
nothin dairy about it that's been really
really good for us after dinners and
stuff but as far as dairy goes we kind
of stay away from cheeses we'll go
organic only if we are using it you can
get protein from your dairy and lean
sources of protein is the best thing for
you guys and that's what I kind of give
her she loves my chicken she loves fish
I've been making salmon a lot lately
what else do you like that I make a
ground turkey whoo organic and it's all
I try to cook all the stuff he's
mentioning that he cooks for me it's
literally the same time over and over
again then he'll always cook then he has
videos on this channel showing how to
make the specific things which
ingredients go in it like how to really
prepare it it really is definitely go
check those videos out um but yeah
that's something that we've been doing a
lot with lunch like I'll make your salad
you know like a chicken or Italian
turkey organic turkey bacon all the
mixed greens the more green is in your
diet the better I promise you guys
remember that so just stay away from all
of like processed foods like proper
granola bars right like the packaged
granola bar tomorrow real healthy like
all of them are yeah a few questions
from you guys about Clif bars she
doesn't really eat that what do we put
in our cabinet no we'll get the organic
fig bars like there's these fig bars
that are really good but honestly only
in moderation I really try to stay away
from packaged stuff especially in the
last year I've been like neurotic about
it not really into like the canned pack
anymore with her at least well you hear
me say I definitely recommend but don't
forget it's also what she eats
throughout the day too so so how would
you say like percentage is like for if
someone's trying to lose weight or
maintain weight like is it more
important to have like a better diet or
is it more important to have a better
fitness plan like what is it or is a
half-and-half um it's really the one
thing I can say is that no fitness plan
will work without a good diet you know
and they heard me some of them heard me
say before it was important diets
everything you know you could really hit
some goals die wise with a good diet and
not a fitness plan as opposed to having
a finished playing with no diet you know
you could really do bad if you go to the
gym and still eat like crap you're not
really going to get your goals you might
get them over a longer course of time
but it will come faster if you do it the
right way but always remember what good
healthy fitness plan is only going to be
successful if it's backboned with a good
healthy diet plan that's the most
important thing so I know one thing
you've always said to me also is that
eat more at the beginning of the day and
then as it starts getting later eat less
because you have your metabolism is
gonna be working all day long to burn
off the food that you eat right earlier
but once you get once it's later on you
have to slow it down a bit right isn't
she so does she listens hey listen books
I really do um what did we say yeah he
like a king in the morning he like a
prince in the afternoon and you like a
servant at night something like that one
of those types of quotes I remember I
said I've always taken that quote and
kind of assessed it towards my diet her
diet and it's important you guys got to
know it's eating heavy at night you're
not worried you're gonna sit in bed and
eat chocolate in all that bad stuff
because you're just laying there and
it's all just gonna stick to the sides
of your hips and your thighs and when I
was in school I remember high school
some person came into our health from I
remember I'll never forget cuz he was
like his hair was nuts and he comes in
and when I was like what the hell's this
guy doing here and he was talking to us
about our digestive system and basically
tried to tell us that when you eat late
at night and your body's asleep your
diet you want to digest that food right
your food wants to go and be processed
throughout your body it's the same thing
a guy used the same quote he said
imagine somebody comes into your room
wakes you up out of your dead sleep and
tells you to go more the long
are you gonna want to go mow the lawn
hey B is it going to be efficient you
know are you going to do a good job so
that in correlation to your body is what
goes on when you eat late at night and
your body wants to digest in the middle
of the night is that it might digest
that food but it's not going to do a
good job and like I said before it's
important that you protect your organs
and you know if your liver can't do that
work fat's going to start building up to
protect you from the acids from the food
you're eating but Bart digesting well
and you don't want to build up fat
because it really does protect organs
rather than anything else don't eat late
at night we don't want acid building up
in our body we don't want the goop in
the morning we just want it Oh big goopy
we just want and for dinner what we
always eat like I said before lean
sources of protein good fats quinoa good
whole grains are a lot of quinoa a lot
of brown rice whole grain brown rice all
right
cooking with healthy oils coconut oil
refined coconut oil stuff like that
avocado oil it's just important that you
guys get in good fiber good fats
all right healthy carbohydrates a lot of
good greens and a good lean source of
protein into a good dye and that's what
I try to base her diet around that's
what I based my diet around obviously
she's half the size of me half the
weight of me so I'm eating a lot more
than she is but you know we both enjoy
the same things and that's the best
thing is when you have a girlfriend or
you have a boyfriend who enjoys a single
when you have a girlfriend or boyfriend
who enjoys the same thing as you life is
easy when you have a girlfriend when you
have a partner who enjoys the same stuff
as you life is easy so well I I enjoy
makeup and beauty and I wanted to bring
him in here I know it's not the typical
video but I thought he could spread some
knowledge likes to be typical nobody Hey
oh my alright so for now that is going
to be it we are going to do a part two
that will be posted on Bret's channel

of lately and all that stuff it's been a
while since we've done a video together
