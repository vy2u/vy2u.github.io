at your door tonight if you need help if
you need help I'll shut down the city
lights a lot cheat I'll beg and bribe to
make you well to make you well with
enemies a ratchet door carry hi everyone
thank you for watching so it's honestly
been so long since I posted a favorites
video
I know a lot of people do the monthly
favorites and if you guys are interested
in that I can start doing that each
month but I figured since it has been a
long time I would just put together some
of my favorite things that I have been
using that I have been happy with and
show you guys since again it has been
too long so again comment below if you
guys do want to see a monthly favorites
video and I hope you guys enjoy so the
first thing that I wanted to talk about
because I know so many of you have been
asking and it actually did change I know
a lot of you are wondering what my new
hair color is and the past two times
that I dyed my hair I used I'm gonna try
and pronounce it right it's by Guarnere
but it is the olia I believe I want to
link a picture of it next to it because
I don't have any on me now but I did mix
medium brown and dark brown together and
that's how I got my hair like this so
also for anyone who's asking what color
my extensions were from the Bellamy I
did get the dark brown but I dyed them
again with the olia just to match my
actual hair so I am so happy with it it
really makes my hair feel smooth and
shiny afterwards so I probably will be
using this for I don't know until I find
a better one but that one did replace my
Revlon or my L'Oreal ones that I have
used in the past so for those of you who
asked that is the one that I am
currently happy with I'm pretty sure I
posted this in my drugstore haul it was
the Olay cleanser the one that moves
like this and I said I would let you
guys know how I liked it and
maybe that was three months ago that I
posted that video but I have been using
this and I personally loved it I ran out
of the Olli cleanser that it comes with
but I actually went to Rite Aid and they
had a Rite Aid brand for like five
dollars cheaper and it's called renewal
exfoliating cleanser this is what it
looked like and yeah I haven't tried the
someone that everyone uses whatever the
other one that everyone uses I haven't
tried yet but apparently it's like one
of the best ones so again I don't really
have that to compare it to but I'm very
happy with this one this one I think is
lying like $29 and again you don't have
to buy the Olay cleanser you can buy the
generic brand and it works just as good
so I've been using that for the past
three months I use it probably every
three nights I don't use it every night
and I again have been very happy with it
so I do recommend that you can go to CVS
Walgreens Rite Aid they sell it
basically everywhere while on the topic
of cleaning my face I also wanted to
just recommend this morning burst clean
and clear cleanser I use this every
morning because I just have such a
problem getting up in the morning I'm
always so tired and this I don't know if
it's just the name that sold me in the
bright yellow container but honestly
when I use it I really do feel more
awake after in the morning so like I
said I do use the O light every three
days but this I will use almost every
morning unless I use a makeup wipe but
usually I'll use this on days that I'm
super tired the next thing that I'm
gonna mention is something that I used
to use all the time and I lost it and
usually when I lose things I forget
about them and I don't replenish them if
I forget about them so I did end up
finding my skin renew anti dark circle
roller and that's by Garnier and this I
used to use all the time because it has
caffeine in it so when you roll it under
your eyes you literally feel it tingling
and I just started using this again and
I honestly love it if I'm really really
tired
just unscrew it put a little on and it's
a nice tingly feeling and you can get
this in any drugstore you have to get
this in the aisle where they have the
face wash and the lotions it's not in
the makeup aisle so just go to this
brand and
see you in that ion all time favorite
argument oil is the argon onyx by nume
and I've mentioned this in a couple of
videos I've been using this for a while
now but this thing I use so much I
always put a little bit of my hand put
it in my hair and then whatever is left
over I literally rough wipe on my body
and it's so amazing because I don't know
if it's just me but my skin gets dry
super super quickly so one thing I also
do is sometimes put lotion on when I get
out of shower and I'll mix the oil with
the lotion and then just put it all over
my body and I swear your skin feels so
soft and so amazing so I don't know
obviously if you want to buy this for
your hair it's expensive so you can just
use it for your hair but if you have a
little extra on your hand and you don't
want to wipe it off I recommend putting
it all over your body because it feels
fabulous
and I do have a coupon code for the
argan oil as well so that will be listed
below
so I've recently discovered a new
affordable makeup website that I'm
absolutely obsessed with and it's called
BH Cosmetics so one thing that I wanted
to show you guys where is this is this
new palette that I got and it's called
BH day and night and it's one of my
favorites and I've been using it a lot
and it's really cool because it comes
with some neutral colors and more like
pretty summery spring colors and then it
has like the more darker colors for a
night out so if you guys want to see
like a day to night look I was thinking
of doing a video of something like that
so many of you guys have been asking for
so long and I'm sorry it's taking this
long but I've been using this for the
past 3 or 4 months and a lot of you have
been asking what my tanning secret was I
didn't want to mention anything until I
tried it out and liked how it looked and
how it faded because I have done a lot
of self tanners that I wouldn't
recommend and kind of work block G and
the one that I use is my million dollar
tan this is what it looks like and it is
a spray and it comes with like a little
sponge brush I can't find mine right now
but all you do is you spread on the
brush and you just apply it
if you guys want to see a video on this
I can do a full video showing you how I
do it and how it will come out as you
can see I am a little bit more pale now
so I am due for a new spray tan so if
you guys want me to film it so you can
see how I do what I can definitely do
that for you guys and I do have a coupon
code as well for it but what's good
about this is that it does last for
about a week maybe even a little bit
longer and it fades really naturally so
you're not gonna see any patches or
you're not gonna see any like blotchy
marks as long as you do put it on of
course the correct way and of course
there are some steps if you have not
gotten a spray tan before I do recommend
exfoliating before and after you do
apply you have to wait six to eight
hours before you can shower I usually
wait like eight to ten just because I
wanted to see fit as much as possible
and then I layer will come off on your
skin so it's gonna leave the color
underneath a very nice brown color so
one thing that people I've noticed would
say is that when they first apply it
they look really really really tan and
they're not sure how they like it
but once again once you wait six to
eight hours you just wash it off and
then it has a nice base tan underneath
and yeah so I definitely recommend the
million dollar tan and again comment
below if you guys do want to see it
maybe a tutorial on it or how I
personally use it and the final thing
I'm going to talk about today is one of
my absolute favorites of all time not
just my monthly favorite or whatever and
I'm actually gonna be showing you a
quick demonstration with Brett so I'll
get him in a minute let me just tell you
a little bit about the product this is
by whitening lightening and it is a
20-minute dial a smile kit and what you
do is there's a few different steps it
comes with a gel and a UV light which
are these and you keep it on for 20
minutes and it makes your teeth like
seven to ten shades whiter and I wanted
to show you this in action because I
don't think I have showed you how to use
this kit yet and I don't know if any of
you have purchased it but I have gotten
amazing reviews from all of you guys and
I personally use it before any kind of
effect so I actually made Brett try this
before it was before he did my makeup in
that tutorial his teeth went literally
nine shades whiter and I'm not being
dramatic so that's why I'm pulling him
into this video so you can see it before
and after because maybe my teeth are
pretty white like my top ones my bottom
teeth are which get a little bit yellow
or quicker so
I will show you before &amp;amp; after pictures
because it's gonna be such a crazy
change and it's gonna be awesome to show
you so definitely stay tuned for that
and we'll show you how to use the
products and I didn't have the little
line from like 17 to 7
there's not even a 79 here so what's
cool is it comes with a dial and it
shows you the whitest teeth number one
two all way to 16
so before you whiten your teeth you hold
it up and you see which number
represents your teeth and then you do it
you leave it on for 20 minutes and then
once you're done you can measure it up
again and it's so crazy how much of a
difference right yours was like crazy
how much of a difference so instead of
me showing you how to do it I figured we
would have Brett show you because yeah I
think coffee yeah he drinks a lot of
coffee
so what it comes with are these little
q-tips and you just open the q-tip I'm
soaping up but you're out of the crack
yours and you'll see it one side has a
red stripe on the end so what you do is
you snap off that end little red end
there's gonna be like a liquid inside
and that's gonna come all the way down
through the q-tip and what this ya don't
see it it's filling up and what this
does is this you're gonna want to put on
your or on your gums and around your
lips so the whitener doesn't burn or
sting any of your gums or lip so it's
fine you can use that you're gonna put
it oh look around your lips and all on
your gums actually the first step that
you do is you get these little deep
cleaning teeth wipes and I'll let you
use these but one side is blue you just
stick your finger in it and this is
gonna wipe your teeth because you want
them dry before you apply the product on
it I do yeah so you just go like this
keep your mouth open and then do like
small circles to dry off your teeth
we're gonna apply the cute to gel all
over your gums and your lips no not here
in your lips with okay better safely
artery I know would have wherever the
jump might hit it I'm gonna hold this up
and we're gonna see which one he is so
style I'm gonna show you saw you're like
a 10 or 11 so we're gonna try and get
you up really whatever wait so okay so
now that we've done that it comes with a
little syringe and that has the
whitening gel in it and it does normally
come with a little black brush and I
lost that brush so sorry it beeps
where's that q-tip you were just orange
to use a q-tip it we're gonna put the
gel or a pizza on you it for you yeah so
you just not painted on your stuff like
this
okay I started shaking we go
peccato are gone okay so now that the
gel is applied the last step is it comes
with this little UV light there's a
button and you're gonna there's a little
Ridge so the Ridge is gonna go on the
top and you just turn it on and look in
and yeah and you just put your lips over
and then you wait 20 minutes so in 20
minutes we're gonna come back and see
what shade what he's saying is he loves
me so much and he would never be able to
live a single minute cuz I wasn't in his
life
you start eating jello
so we just finished let's see how white
they got smile ups
yeah they're definitely six six yeah on
the bottom now we here so just a quick
demonstration of the Dallas milk and I
