was going through a bunch of your
comments and your video suggestions and
I've seen so many people requesting what
I'm currently using for hair care
products so I know I recently did a
video talking about how I grew my hair
and all that good stuff but today I'm
just going to get into what I use as far
as shampoo conditioner argan oil is all
that stuff to really keep my hair
feeling nice and silky and healthy so if
you guys want to hear some of my
favorite products at the moment please
keep watching you guys have been
following me for a little while you
probably know that I've gotten a few
keratin treatments in my hair my hair is
naturally really thick really coarse
really curly super frizzy basically just
very very hard to manage and I was
getting Stern hair treatments done
throughout my whole life just to kind of
tame the frizz try new things and a lot
of the ones that I tried just completely
ruined my hair I don't want to get too
much into detail because I feel like
I've told you guys this a million times
but I've gotten the Japanese training
I've tried a few other keratin
treatments and just everything I always
tried killed my hair the Japanese
training was so strong that it fried my
hair and it just prevented it from
growing anywhere past like right here so
I stopped doing that in high school and
I just kind of was like you know what
forget it
I'll just deal with the frizzy hair I'll
take that extra hour in the morning to
blow out my hair and blah blah blah blah
but then one of my friends who has a
salon in her basement told me a little
bit about this thing called the GK
keratin and that is the treatment that I
got in my hair the first treatment that
I got was back in March and then I
believe I got one over the summer and
then another one in October I'm pretty
sure I've gotten three maybe two I think
three though but it definitely was one
of my favorite things I've ever done to
my hair the treatment that I personally
got done was called GK keratin and ever
since I
gotten that done I've been using the
shampoo and conditioner that goes with
it because it helps keep your keratin
locked in and it just prevents anything
from stripping it so ever since I did
get my first treatment back in March of
last year I have been using the GK
shampoo and conditioner these ones are
the moisturizing shampoo and these I
personally buy myself off of Amazon it's
a lot cheaper on Amazon than it is in
the beauty supply stores so I just want
to let you guys know that I'm not
sponsored in any way by GK it's just
what I got the keratin treatment I
wanted it to last as long as possible
because it literally transformed my hair
it made it from thick curly frizzy to
kind of wavy more straight a little
weave into it no frizz silky shiny it
literally just transformed my hair and I
feel like my hair has been healthier
grows faster ever since I've done it so
again that's why I've been using these
shampoo and conditioner to go with it
just to really keep it locked in keep
the keratin treatment for as long as
possible my roots have been growing in
so I probably will get another one right
before summer I'm thinking maybe in like
June when it starts to get really hot
around here because I have a sweating
problem like no other and the first
thing to go is my hair start sweating
and then my roots start frizzing and
then I get the little curly roots so
that is my pet peeve so I probably will
be getting another one right before
summer but that is the shampoo and
conditioner that I've been using again
I've been buying them on Amazon they
come in like a double pack and I think
it's like 25 bucks so for me this has
been the only thing I have touched with
my hair for a few months I was actually
also using the deep conditioner also by
the GK but I found that it kind of
weighed down my hair a lot and it was
making it very very flat so I dropped
the deep conditioner as soon as I got
out of the shower before I even brush my
hair I also use the argan oil also by GK
the reason that I used argan oil by the
as well because it has ingredients in it
that again is going to help lock in your
treatment so I think this is the second
bottle that I've been through in the
past a year this one's great I mean you
don't need this brand I feel like any
argan oil you pick up is going to be
great I definitely recommend adding it
into your routine if you guys don't have
the keratin treatment that's fine still
use it I've always used an argan oil
like my entire life I love applying it
right when I'm out of the shower onto
the ends of my hair I just start at the
bottom
I usually go like this to make sure it
really gets in the bottom by my split
ends and everything and then I slowly
just bring it up I don't ever bring it
up higher than probably like right here
so I don't have it bring it close up to
my root I just focus on the ends and
that's something that I do again every
time that I get out of the shower so
lately what I've been doing to also help
my hair grow and to just keep it really
healthy is I'll shower at nighttime
apply the argan oil on my roots I will
braid my hair go to bed and then when I
wake up my hair is dry so at that point
I either leave it in the beachy waves
other times I'll just go and I'll
blow-dry it from there and that way I'm
not using as much heat on my hair
because it's basically already dry so
that is just a technique that I've been
doing ever since I've gotten the keratin
treatment so that's just another trick
that I've been doing for at least a year
now it not only helps save so much time
but it also protects your hair from
using way too much heat because I think
when my hair was just super crazy frizzy
curly I would blow-dry it and straighten
it and I would use so much more heat on
it because it would just take so much
longer sorry my chair squeaking um yeah
it would just take so much longer so I
think that has helped immensely another
extremely important step when you guys
are trying to have really healthy silky
hair is to use a heat protectant spray
as I just mentioned I have tried to cut
down on the heat a lot ever since I've
done the keratin and I guess mostly the
main reason why I can do that is because
it's very it's so much more manageable
but one thing I always use before I use
heat on my hair is a heat protectant
spray the one that I've been using for
about five months now is the one by
Schwarzkopf I mentioned this and a
couple of videos already for you guys
and I know the past two videos that I
did for them it was sponsored but I just
want to let you guys know that as usual
I only talk about products that I
personally use on an everyday basis and
that I actually really love so this one
I really do love and I really do use
before I glow jar my hair and also
before I use a curling iron so I just
wanted to mention this as well because
you guys have to protect your hair when
you're using the heat so one thing that
people don't realize it's something I
did not realize for the longest time
because I was not using it along with
doing so many other bad things for my
hair and I was wondering why the heck it
wasn't growing so ever since I started
taking care of it a lot better using
less heat it's grown so much this right
here is all my hair um I just wanted to
show you guys that I'm not wearing
extensions because I know I know 90% of
you believe me but then there's always
those naysayers that say I'm still
wearing extension say I'm still wearing
contacts and that I got no job no stuff
so I just want to show you there's no
extensions in here it's all my own hair
so I mean I don't know how I can really
show you but look scalp literally goes
so much past my boob right now do you
see that I feel like I'm gonna be one of
those people that has their hair down to
the floor I had so many issues with my
hair growing up if you guys saw my how I
grew my hair video you guys probably
heard all the struggles that I went with
but um if you guys didn't check out that
video I will link it below if you guys
want to go see that let's move on to
some other products that I use one that
I've been using for ever my mom actually
introduced me to this product years ago
is the batiste dry shampoo this one that
I use is for dark deep brown hair so I
personally don't ever really see a hint
of dark brown like it says so you can
really use the original or this one
depending on your hair color but this I
always use on like day three when maybe
my hair is looking a little bit greasy
but I don't want to wash it
professionals always say that it's
better to wash your hair less so that's
something that I've also always really
kind of done because my hair just never
really got greasy the next product that
I wanted to mention I
just started recently using its by foci
it's called galanga root it's a intense
anti faded color complex anti-fade
topcoat so many different things but
I've just been using this to kind of
finish off my hair to add to the bottoms
of my hair to give it a little shine and
to just kind of lock in my hair color I
mean who knows if it's really doing that
but it's just a product that I recently
picked up that I've been using I know
some people are gonna ask about my hair
color um you can see it's kind of like
really dark brown with a few Brown
pieces my friend who does my keratin
treatment also does my hair color I know
she uses I believe it's called like
Wella hair color um I can text her and
find out the color for those of you guys
who want to ask your hairdressers but
basically I feel like my hair is super
simple all that I told her that I wanted
was a deep brown base and a dark brown
and then I just wanted like medium brown
pieces kind of throughout my hair so she
did like the front piece you can kind of
see it's just so subtle it's just to add
a little dimension in my hair so you can
kind of see throughout my hair I don't
know if you can see on camera but I know
my black post the pictures come out a
little bit brighter when I'm out in
natural sunlight but I just have like a
few brown pieces throughout just to kind
of lighten it up a little bit but I
think I dyed my hair last when did I zai
it I dyed it back in February I think
those February was the last time I
colored my hair but she's been doing my
hair as well I no longer use box size at
home something I don't recommend them
anymore it's just that I wanted a few
lighter pieces and the times that I
tried bleaching my hair at home it was
just never what I wanted so I've just
been having her do my hair color as well
so that is the update on my hair again I
will try and text her and find out the
exact colors that she used so as far as
haircare products that is what I've been
using at the moment again most of these
products I've been using for over a year
since I've done the keratin treatment I
recommend any of you guys who have some
of the same problems that I had to go
out and try the treatment it is a little
bit pricey but it is freaking amazing
and I back it up 100
and again I was not paid in any way
shape or form to create this video I
just wanted to share with you guys what
I've been personally doing and if
anyone's in the Jersey area I will also
link my hairdressers info if you guys
want to go check her out she has a salon
in her basement and she's amazing um so
yeah that's basically it for now I think
this has been the most requested video
that I have seen please keep commenting
below what you guys want to see because
I'm constantly going through trying to
find video I guess on what you want to
see and not just what I want to post so
I love you guys so much thank you for
watching and until next time I'll see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
