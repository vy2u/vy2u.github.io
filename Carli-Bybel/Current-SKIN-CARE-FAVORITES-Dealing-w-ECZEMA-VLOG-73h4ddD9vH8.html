today's video I'm going to be talking
about a couple different things I'm also
going to be showing you guys a blog so
first I'm going to talk about some of my
favorite skincare products at the moment
the ones that I use on my face what I
use on my body also what I've been doing
to help calm down my eczema I've
mentioned it in a few videos I've had
eczema really bad for the past I don't
know maybe like six seven eight years
past three years it's been the worst um
I used to be able to use some sort of
ointment and then it would go away and
then maybe come back in a month but now
I've gotten to a point where it just has
not gone away so I've been meaning to
get to an allergist for so long it's
just when life gets in the way and you
have a million other things to do you
kind of just put stuff like that on the
back burner so I was going through my
emails like two weeks ago and a girl
from a doctor's office in New York City
had emailed me asking if I would be
interested in having an allergy test and
it was actually perfect timing because I
was getting to a point where my x1 has
just been so bad and I've just been
dealing with it and I feel like with
something like that like you shouldn't
have to deal with it there should be
something that's gonna help get rid of
it or help calm it down or just help
make it bearable so once you email me I
was like perfect timing we set something
up and I went into the office on Monday
and I got full allergy tests and I just
wanted to let you guys know that in no
way shape or form was I paid or sponsor
to do anything mentioned in this video I
just wanted to share my own experiences
with you guys because having eczema and
having allergies sucks to be real I
figured if I could share my experience
with you guys maybe some of you can go
out and try some of the things that I
did and it'll help you guys deal with
these problems so first I want to go
through some of my favorite skincare
products and then we will move into the
vlog part of this video so if you guys
want to hear all about it please keep
watching so first let's talk about some
base favorites
I am always using something with an
exfoliator in it
the reason for this is my skin can
handle it and I wear a lot of makeup
during the day so I will use my face
wipes to get off all the excess makeup
and then I'll go in with either like a
bar of soap to get any extra makeup off
and then I will use my exfoliator I was
using one of those brushes for a while I
have not been using those the two face
washes that I've been back and forth
with that I just always use and had no
problems with are the vur a poor
unclogging scrub and then the acne
stress control the I need Regina so
these both have like the exfoliating
beads in them I like these they do the
job in my opinion I have not had pimples
in a while sometimes I'll get one or two
here there when it's the time of the
month but I think that's kind of
inevitable um so for face wash I think
it doesn't really matter what I'm using
you don't need to go out and get exactly
what I'm using it depends on your skin
type if you guys have pimples or if you
have dry skin or if you have oily skin
there's all different types of face
washes that will work for you I've
always just bought the ones right at the
drugstore because they've always worked
and I've never had a problem with them
so those are the two that I've always
used to me it's more important what
you're using after you wash your face so
that's where I spend
it's a plane Thunder so for me it's more
important what I'm using after I wash my
face the face wash part again feel free
to use whatever you want the next couple
of steps I've noticed have really helped
transform my skin so I've been going
once every two months to go get a
professional facial there's a place
right by my house that I've just been
going to that I really love so what she
does is she deep cleans my face she uses
um like electrotherapy I don't know what
it is really but it just kind of kills
all the bacteria on your face and then
she uses like these LED lights to help
with anti aging so that I think has
really helped transform my skin in many
ways but again so back to the products
that I use this toner has been my
favorite I think this is my third bottle
you can get these right on Amazon I
think it's about like 30 bucks maybe a
little bit cheaper but it's by Rhonda
Allison and it's the purifying lotion
antioxidant toner this is a toner that
they actually sell at the place that I
got my facials but I found that it was a
little cheaper on Amazon so that's where
I've been getting it um so after I've
completely washed my face I use a cotton
ball with a couple pumps of this and I
just wipe all around my face in my neck
and even after I use a makeup wipe soap
and face wash sometimes there's leftover
makeup so this is going to help really
clean your skin and it's going to help
get rid of any excess makeup that you
have so this is amazing I've been loving
this and then what I use next is a serum
to be honest I have a couple serums and
I'm always switching between them so I
don't really know which one is the best
but this is the one that I tend to grab
the most it's by Estee Lauder
it's the wrinkle lifting / firming serum
and I'll use this right after I use my
toner I only use this at nighttime after
that what I use and I've been using for
like 4 years is the Nerium night time
face lotion this stuff is incredible
everybody in my family all my close
friends everyone is using this it's just
the best lotion in my opinion it's like
an instant facelift you put it on and it
just like tightens up your face it's
good for pores it's good for acne it's
good for scarring it's really good for a
lot of things
sorry I keep seeing someone walk back
and forth outside so I will use this
every single night like I don't ever
forget to use this so that is my
complete nighttime routine I will also
talk about what I do in the mornings
sometimes I slack I'm not gonna lie but
um whatever I'm about to apply my makeup
I'll always apply a lotion before my
primer anyway the lotion that I'm
literally obsessed with is it's by image
skincare and it's the hydrating Repair
Cream you can also find this on Amazon
um where I go and get my facials they
sell this there as well but like I said
it's cheaper on Amazon so that's why I
restock all my products I have been
using this you can see it's literally
empty almost empty um I have been using
this for I'm gonna stay like four or
five months and it's just so refreshing
it smells like oranges yeah it just
smells like like an orange and cream
smoothie which is incredible and I have
the most sensitive skin of life so at
first I was a little worried because
anything with a fragrance can really
affect my skin and this I've had
absolutely no problems with it's all
antioxidant it has vitamins A C and E
and it also has anti-aging ingredients
in it so this has been my daily face
cream I again try and use it every
single day somedays I forget but most
days this is what I'm using um I also
forgot to mention that I have an eye
cream that I apply at night too I apply
the eye cream before I apply the Nerium
this is lemare eye cream and I've heard
just so many good things about it so
I've been using this again I have a
couple different eye creams that I go
back and forth with this is just the one
that I tend to use the most it is really
really pricey so I don't recommend this
for your young girls out there that are
still have perfect skin this is for the
girls out there that want per vent aging
and they want to prevent those dark
circles and everything like that so this
is what I will use so just in case
anyone's
use because I kind of did out of order
at nighttime what I will do is I will
use a makeup wipe then I will use a bar
soap then I'll use my exfoliating
cleanser then comes the toner the serum
the eye cream and then the night cream
so it took seven steps but that's just
something that I do every night and it
makes seem like it takes a lot of time
but it really doesn't so I am super
careful about my skin because I want to
prevent aging I wanna prevent wrinkles
as long as I can
I am only 24 but I started all of this I
would say probably around like 1920 they
say that it's good to start with the
anti-aging stuff around 20 years old so
that's kind of why I started with this
whole thing but that is everything that
I use as far as my face and my neck um
next let's move on to the body because
that's where I have all of my issues I
have my eczema that's really bad and I
just have really dry skin first let's
talk about body wash this one's
completely empty I actually picked it
out of my garbage to show you guys the
Aveeno Skin relief body wash it's
fragrance free and it has like soothing
oatmeal in it so I used this entire
bottle and I didn't really I mean see
any of a change just from a body wash I
was gonna read by it but after my trip
to the allergist on Monday I decided I'm
gonna try what she had recommended so
this is empty I would say it definitely
keeps your skin soothed I recommend not
using anything with fragrance I know
they have all those amazing smelling
body washes and believe me I wish I
could use them but I just can't um I
actually used to use the one from
Victoria's Secret it was like this
purple one and it smelled so freakin
delicious but every time I would use it
either I would get hives or my nose
would start to bleed so I stay away from
anything with a fragrance also the
laundry detergent that I use is Tide
free and clear has no dyes no fragrance
that's another thing that's really
important also if you guys have really
bad eczema or itchy dry sensitive skin
don't use um what are they called dryer
sheets don't use them because they have
all kinds of chemicals in them and they
irritate the skin so this is also
something new that I learned I stopped
using those and
has helped a lot the new body wash that
I've replaced with is by survey I think
it's either survey or Sarov this is the
hydrating cleanser for a normal to dry
skin this brand is accepted by the
National eczema Association so that is
why this is my new baby I haven't used
it long enough to let you guys know if
that it's like Holy Grail must-have but
I just started using this and so far so
good talking about lotions I wanted to
mention this one because I thought it
was good but it actually is not good for
my type of skin the M locked in I think
it's like a newer brand I had tried a
sample of it and I actually liked it
when I applied it over my eczema it
would burn and at first I was like okay
if it's burning that's like a good thing
it'll help like clear it that's what I
just thought so when I applied it I was
like okay I like that feeling I like
that it's burning I feel like it's
really working but when I went on my dad
had told her about my theory and she was
like no no no that's completely wrong
you do not want to use anything that's
burning your skin that does not mean
that it's working so kind of like
halfway full but I won't be using this
one anymore and what I actually replaced
it with is the CeraVe moisturizing cream
and again it's also accepted by the
eczema Association I never actually even
heard of this kind so I've tried like a
million different prescription-strength
pointment and none of them cleared my
eczema so I had told her that and she
prescribed me it's called cloak tube
better soul rope pn8 pointment
so Bettis all phlebitis all propionate
pointment this I mean you only need to
use for a week I've only been using it
three or four days and my eczema
already clearing up on my hand it's
usually always bright red you can't even
see from here but now it's like skin
color and it's starting to fade so I am
just like blown away I'm so excited that
hopefully this is really working I will
give you guys an update in like a week
or so and let you know if it really does
work but what she recommended to do and
if you guys out there don't want to get
a prescription and or can't afford the
prescription this is what your
that you do so for me what I've been
doing is applying that point meant
Oliver wherever I have eczema then I
apply this to reveille cream all over my
entire body and she recommended getting
like the ones in the jug like this
because they're more like a thicker
cream they're not like that thin cream
so then I apply this all over my entire
body and then what I do is I put the
Aqua for to really lock everything in
wherever I have the eczema so it goes
the ointment and then it goes the cream
and then I apply aqua for over the
eczema and the reason that she said to
do this is because one of the main
reasons that eczema continues to flare
up is your skin is just super super dry
and by adding these layers it's going to
help really lock in the moisture
another thing that she recommend is
getting those cloth gloves which I just
haven't gotten around to getting them
yet and sleeping with all of these
ointments on your hands overnight and
that's going to help really absorb all
the product and make it work to its
fullest potential so these are all new
tricks that I've never learned before I
have always been the type where I would
Google everything and find out a million
tricks and I've tried literally
everything and so far this is what's
been working again I will keep you
updated because sometimes some things
will work for a couple days and then it
won't work but I also wanted to take you
guys along and show you guys my
first-ever allergy test experience they
did a full test to see what exactly I
was allergic to it was so crazy because
she put like little needles it was like
this little try and they put like little
holes in your skin and then when you get
hives that's how you know what you're
allergic to so everything that I
mentioned some of them have been
longtime favorites some are newer
favorites but I just wanted to share
with you guys what I've been using
because I know a lot of people suffer
from eczema or if you suffer from dry
skin some of these products may help you
out I definitely recommend going to see
a doctor or a dermatologist if you guys
are having any severe skin problems
don't take what I'm saying
and just think I know exactly what I'm
talking about I'm not a doctor but these
are just products that have worked for
me and my skin so yeah that is basically
it as far as products now I'm going to
show you guys the vlog from Monday I
hope you guys enjoy and
see you guys there
to me to me
hi guys so we're sitting in traffic on
our way to New York City we are going to
the allergy doctor I've never been
before so I think they're going to give
us a good test me intense
and kind of scare
I think they have to like bricky with a
million different things to see what
you're allergic to but I had a girl
email me about coming in and I was
looking into finding doctor anyway so
I'm not sponsored by them they're not
paying me or anything but they offered
to do a free test so we figured Blasi
experience for any of you guys maybe who
are thinking about getting one but
you're kind of scared
you guys can witness what is about to go
down so we're supposed to be there in 25
minutes we are running late because
there's always traffic going to your
accessible in a shirt right here did you
know
ah woman with a pilgrim soul anaphase
online format on
Charcot onions
Oh stomach hurts
you're not even currently 802 we were
supposed to be there already
nav says 15 minutes yes I already go a
quarter mile gotta love me
pretty boy a more efficient and da
never had an allergy so I don't
understand that like I feel like I've
heard that they like use like a little
needle and I prick you with like each
type of yeah I don't know and then we're
done it before have no idea you'll be
all right that's nothing bad I chose a
lot everything goes away I supposed to
know they have it
I think about you're in a dive shop and
save everything there to help you yeah
like I'd be pen
Island traffic my favorite thing of life
just inching up little by little it
north on 20 man
Kansas City all film tonight in the lake
Wow it was fireworks
you
you
from the dish
I'm looking into like finding an
allergist and then I thought you man I
was like perfect
yeah exactly I've been wet alert
everything my legs fruits vegetables
every single animal hospital pollen
grass and then lastly I don't know three
years I started getting epic I had eggs
my here and there but it's been like
that don't go away
it's a cat just like on my hand the
elbows and legs like flares up and then
I don't know what I did something I'm
eating some days it's fine and I'm not
an issue where other days of light I am
and it's just believing because bitching
so much something to eat on Monday won't
trigger your eczema till Wednesday or
Thursday yeah smoking though that you're
linking we were like what I have to say
that made it for everything days you can
be armed days before so X is what can
happen at any time we used to think it
was just a childhood disease but now
we're seeing more and more adults just
developing it out of the blue if you
have seasonal allergies you're more
likely to get you're at higher risk for
eczema on the same thing a food
allergies your entire us right and
because eggs milk delayed reaction it's
so hard to think with air and the issue
with eczema is that you have an impaired
skinnier
proteins of your skin is a certain
property form moisture can move down
into you're losing moisture at a higher
rate than someone else without eggs so
you have to moisturize more frequently
than someone without exercise and so the
key is moisturizing 2 to 3 times a day
if you can I'm not a big fan of the
ocean so once that you pump out about I
don't necessarily think right I kind of
like the cream once you get that tub
yeah
about and you want to put that on and
then I also like layering my creams and
go ahead so I like to do a layer of it's
a CeraVe cream which I actually think is
probably one of the best that's out
there there's also a Fanta cream and I
can show you online okay and they're not
expensive these are all your programs
and so you put a layer of the cream on
and then for the patches if you have an
excellent catch and cream on you guys
seal it with either like Vaseline so you
told me that you get itching of your
mouth ish and you're probably at
peaches pears plums melons does it
happen with nuts like almonds yeah right
so I'm not I'm not just making guessing
what food allergies you are they all run
in the same family okay so if you have
seasonal averages you could be allergic
to certain foods so two apples the
peaches of pairs of protein and group
very similar to power so Palmer proteins
we're taking a bite of that at wall or
using a vitamin page your body thinks in
you're eating pollen the automatic as a
reaction it doesn't have a reaction the
most common reaction is just pitching up
your lips right if you're down
yeah did you have your throat and that's
usually about it if you think that's why
I was asking like with an apple pie to
definitely scissors blessing it up high
but like I know branches and carrots
yeah when I have them cooked and put on
problems and then he was like old is it
the pesticides of the cookie with like
what is it that I learned you why raw a
lot of people think that it is yeah
they're spraying so the animals don't
mess up at the farm what I have to spray
no of course they cook but sometimes
when you cook it then don't you cook the
nutrients away from what the food has
oral energy system so if you cook the
carrot or you cook the Apple the protein
denatures or breaks down and it's no
longer recognized right so honestly I
never tell patients to look anything up
but look this up okay if you're allergic
to tree pollen you're more likely
to almonds apples cherries just pears
any of these are closing the foods that
you're using and same things you're
allergic to fastball you're more likely
to be allergic to melon and whenever I
hear patients we have oral allergy
syndrome it's just a sign to me that you
probably have seasonal allergies that
are worsening than they were before I
buy that but it's all related and some
of these foods could definitely trigger
let's do some food allergies heading and
LLC so I'm going to get caught up so
it's just going to be a quick coke so
there are any point you feel
uncomfortable you let me know this sure
plus I'm on camera so I have to be at
the head of the table might be and if
you're allergic a little itchy that's a
quick poke not too bad
so each individual poem has a different
or individual allergen
just like puree of every like little
thing like what is this ah only liquid
already extra yeah they extract the
protein from the food or the pollen that
causes the allergen feel like a little
tingling like a little I put a control
on your right arm that should cause some
itchiness so there should be one that
cause the solution oh yeah feel it you
feel it yeah rich I mean not gonna itch
look at your poor thing starting um
flare it okay yeah this arm feels like
tingly Sorby it's like getting ready
know the song so fast fine but it looks
like again yeah could see the
blotchiness and you're right
not crazy I just got poked as you seen
feels really tingly it's really cool
though they literally like did how many
different tests that wanted to do so
close over pursued on TV that's at 10 20
30 40 50 different things 60 different
things it's crazy
salt water this is a control this is
just a siesta and usually intercalating
ripens now then we did a quite thank you
milk these look good peanut and we
create everything zero before usually
what we do is we measure how big the
hive is I'm going to also measure how
they meet the flare or the redness
well this is the one thing I just want
to say that I just think it's fantastic
that you're going to do a piece on
eczema purpose there are so many young
men and women who have eczema they have
no idea what triggers it they don't know
how to treat it
yeah and for me when I look at eczema
it's a whole lifestyle issue it's about
finding what the root causes and trying
to get to the problem of it's just for
training steroid creams right and then
the eggs book comes back and then it's
frustrating so I think it's fantastic
that were able to share some information
and oh you're welcome
if there's anything that I can say for
anyone who's suffering with eczema see
your allergist see if there is a
potential energy that's triggering your
eczema because it absolutely could be it
could be a food allergy it could be an
environment while allergies to something
like pollen then it could be a
combination of things and then also just
things that you're doing with in your
daily routine your daily lifestyle they
could be making wrexham or worse the
more people that talk about eczema food
allergies allergies it's just beneficial
yes they don't think that
I don't think that the public is really
aware I know and people just deal with
it like for me for so long I was just
dealing with it and then I was like I'm
not doing what can I do to change it so
I came to try out some of these screens
yeah I'll put it over yeah definitely
all right don't don't watch just so nice
to meet you too I appreciate everything
right bacteria kissing
most common spots Berg bacteria will
get through kissing
consecutive kissing that supposedly
there's so much material
keyboard well right keyboard
that I just see that fly well I swear I
think I just saw the fly
thank my thoughts away
right literally wonder why stay in
Tirupati guys read this is now today's
OB passes fly
like where does he go for
I'm in at that time
you know the phrase
how much have you hated this way you've
been cursing I don't hate you guys
you're the prettiest Neil stressed out
yeah I like taking it to be you were
opening up your door and going like this
and airing out yeah he was flying around
my ankles number one or even annoying
maybe he just likes labels actor
on things
to realize it or a million times size of
this thing a fly doesn't have anything
to do it a little bit of horsepower
which is not what this guy is it's got
just a regular stay in the house one if
it could be like right now like crawling
on my head the fact that I don't know
about that like that excuse me out
I'm not aware so when I see it I just
freak out there that's right
ABC News in front of us wasn't as bad as
I thought the prick parts kind of hurt
abut I basically found out that I'm
allergic to everything that I thought I
was allergic to she recommended some new
lotions
really cool because
I'm going to try those what else did she
recommend no dryer sheets which we do
use so that could be another cause for
my eczema
and then she also got me a prescription
cream that's hopefully int my eczema way
I've talked about my eczema problems in
other videos and I've never really found
anything that worked so that's why I
kind of got this point where I wanted
she did so I'll try them out and I will
keep you guys updated on if it works for
me so it does stop making that face
Nikolas
