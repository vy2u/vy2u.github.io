watching in today's video I transformed
myself into the nearest Targaryen I was
so excited to do this video because the
first time that I filmed my Daenerys
look I actually didn't even see any of
the episodes yet I had a few people
telling me I looked similar to her I had
similar features to her so I created it
not even watching the show so now three
years later watching the show two times
over I figured I would redo my Daenerys
look just in time for the season finale
she is so badass in this season and I'm
just obsessed with her so hopefully this
time around I did her a little bit more
justice and if you want to see how I got
this look right here then please keep
watching and bend the knee so start off
today's look I'm using my cover effects
blurring primer and for foundation today
I'm mixing number four number five from
Fiona Stiles I was originally gonna use
the lighter shade but I was a little bit
too light for my body and I didn't want
it to stand out too much so I just mixed
the colors and I'm just gonna apply that
all over my face and on my eyelids for
concealer today I'm using this one by
rodeo and I'm applying that underneath
my eyes and I'm gonna drag that out far
so when you are doing your own makeup
and you want to transform I like having
a photo right in front of me so if you
guys notice your face shape is a little
bit different my techniques may not work
exactly for you I wanted to make my face
look a little bit wider so I'm dragging
out the concealer and then throughout
this video I'll give you little tips on
what you can do to help transform your
features a little bit more into emilia
clark so now I think the most important
feature are the brows I'm starting off
with the Anastasia brow pomade in the
color blonde and the reason I'm doing
this I know she has darker eyebrows but
mine are pretty dark naturally so I
wanted to kind of mute them a little bit
to get them all one shade and then to
thicken them all one shade and then I'm
gonna go in with some darker shades
afterwards so I'm just using the pomade
first again to kind of letting up my
brows and to start the shape of her
infamous brows so again looking at a
photo will help make this a lot easier
her eyebrows start a lot higher than
mine and they almost like swoop down a
little bit so this is really trial and
error with eyebrows if you screw it up
it's okay you could just wipe them off
it's not a big deal just do a little bit
at a time and you'll start to see it
transform so next I'm going in with the
soft brown brow is also by Anastacio I'm
gonna start filling them in a little bit
more you want to do soft strokes so it
really looks like hair and you want them
to look obviously natural so she also
has a very straight brow so again I'm
just doing little bits at a time I'm
then picking up the brow pencil that I
actually use in the color evany which is
like a dark brown and I'm just gonna
fill in any of the gaps
and then for powder I'm going in with
the soft brown powder and I'm just gonna
fill them in a little bit more to set
the concealer under my eyes I'm using my
Kat Von D setting powder you just want
to smooth away your wrinkles with the
Beauty Blender and then set the eyes and
while that's setting I'm gonna go in
with my shade and light palette and I'm
picking up the grayer tone and I'm gonna
be contouring my nose just a little bit
so again depending on the type of nose
you have I needed to make mine a little
bit shorter so I am cutting off the tip
by applying it right on the tip and then
I am NOT going in as close with my
contour lines because I wanted to keep
my nose more similar to her and you guys
know I always like it like super thin I
noticed right in between her eyes I get
the bridge of the nose that's where she
has a lot of darkness so I'm dragging
that up into there as well so then
you're just no wipe away all of the
powder and we're going in with my Carli
bybel deluxe edition palette we're using
the lightest mob shade and I'm gonna be
applying that in my crease and then I'm
also gonna drag that down onto my eyelid
she does always have a very very natural
eye look so I'm gonna just start with
this and then in a little bit I'll add a
few more colors you just want it to be
very very natural and look like natural
shading on your face if you want your
eyes to look larger you can apply the
shadow a little bit higher I'll show you
in a little bit how I also try and make
my eyes look more round like hers as
well so then I'm picking up a little bit
of a mixture of the contour and the
bronzer shade and I'm just gonna contour
my cheeks my forehead and my chin a
little bit just to add a little bit of
warmth and also so my face matches my
body
and then I'm taking a little bit more of
that gray or tone and I'm applying it
underneath my lip just to add a little
bit of shadow and this will help you
later on when we apply the lip liner
it'll help make them look more full to
set my brows I'm using the clear
Anastacio brow gel this will help keep
the hairs upright which will make them
look more real and more bushy so here's
what I was talking about we're gonna
pick up the darker mob shade from my
palette as well as this light matte
brown shade and I'm gonna be applying
that underneath my lower lash line so
instead of just going right along the
lash line I'm gonna go right where if
you touch your eye you'll feel where
your eyeball ends so you're gonna shade
right around where your eyeball is it'll
help make your eyes look rounder so try
this technique out it actually really
really works and even try it out if
you're not trying to do this video it's
just something that I personally like to
do almost every day because I like to
have my eyes look larger so if you guys
want to apply eyeliner this part can
help you also change your eye shape I'm
just gonna leave it as is and I'm just
gonna apply some mascara so if you have
smaller eyes and want them to look even
bigger you can apply a false lash which
always helps open up your eyes and make
them look a little bit larger so that's
just a little tip I wanted to give you
guys as well for lips I'm using this
amazing like $2 lip liner I believe it's
the color rock and rose and it's just a
really pretty matte color it's very
natural so I'm just using this for my
lips I'm going to line them first and
then I'm just gonna fill in my lips with
this if you do want your lips to look
even bigger you can apply a little bit
of lip gloss into the center and then
highlight your Cupid's bow a little bit
and that will help make them look larger
so next I'm just applying a little tiny
bit of blush and then I'm going back in
with those two colors that I use on my
lower lash line the darker mob and the
matte Brown and I'm just applying that
into my crease just to accentuate my
crease even more and to make my eyes
really pop
so I'm grabbing that brush that I use to
wipe away my powder and I'm just kind of
diffusing it a bit and just making sure
there are no harsh lines and that is how
I transformed myself into Daenerys
Targaryen
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial I had so much fun
we creating this for you guys today my
head is pounding right now because of
how tight this wig is I tried to make it
look as real as possible I don't know
how she does it for the show because I
had to take three advil in my head is
still pounding I hope you guys enjoyed I
can't wait to see the episode this
Sunday who's gonna be watching with me
be sure all of you guys and until next
time I'll see you guys later
