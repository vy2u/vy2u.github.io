today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here it's
super dark and fancy and I figured I
would do something a little bit more
dramatic for my next Valentine's Day
inspired look so I knew I wanted to do
like dark scary colors for this look and
although it's probably very dramatic
from some of you I saw a lot of people
requesting a more dramatic look so this
one is for all of you guys so if you
guys want to see how I got this look
right here then please keep watching for
today's look I'm using the modern a
renaissance palette by Anastasia Beverly
Hills with a large blending brush I'm
picking up the color golden ochre and
I'm just blending that right into my
crease next I'm grabbing the color red
ochre and also a little bit of the color
love-letter with a smaller blending
brush and I'm applying that on the outer
half of my eye when you're working with
darker colors always be careful you
don't need to use a lot of products
right away you can build on it that way
you don't end up getting fallout all
over your face also if you guys are new
to a more dramatic look I would
definitely recommend doing your eyes
before your face makeup that way if you
get any fallout you won't ruin your face
makeup that you had already done so I'm
just grabbing something with a straight
edge and I am just applying that right
on my outer V and I am blending that
shadow right up against that line to
give it a really sharp neat look I
always like to do this when I'm doing
something more dramatic that way I don't
bring the dark shadow too far down with
eyeshadow it's all about placement you
can make your eyes look more lifted or
you can make them look a little bit more
droopy so if you are placing the shadow
in the right place it should either open
up your eyes or make them look more
cat-like depending on the look that
you're going for so I'm just going to
keep blending that out and then I'm
going in with a smaller brush and those
same two colors and I'm applying that
right on the inner third of my eye so
for this look I wanted to keep the matte
shadows on the inner third and on the
outer third and then I'm going to go in
with a shimmery shadow I'm going to
apply that right in the center so don't
worry if it ends up getting all over
your lids the other shadow is pigmented
enough
cover so then you're going to go back
with your blending brush and just kind
of blend everything together then I'm
grabbing this dark brown shade and I'm
applying that right on the outer V just
to darken it up a bit then with a large
clean fluffy brush I'm just blending
again I like to go back and forth
between the small and the large that way
it gives it a really nice faded look I'm
grabbing this pressed pigmented shadow
by morphe and I'm applying that right in
the center and this is going to really
make it these look pop I'm starting off
with a thinner line and then I'm going
to slowly blend it out into the matte
shades you want to just keep it right on
the center of your eye that way it looks
matte on the edges and then super
shimmery in the middle then I'm grabbing
the color Vermeer and I'm applying that
right over the cranberry shimmer just to
brighten it a little bit and to make it
pop a little bit more then I'm picking
up that same dark brown shade and just
darkening up the outer V of my eye for a
liner I'm using the so fine liner by
Tarte I've been using this one the past
couple of weeks and I actually really
like it so I'm just going to be doing my
eyeliner as I normally do I know I'm not
the best at eyeliner but you know what
it's really hard to film yourself
putting eyeliner on and staying in tokin
so that's all I'm going to say going
back in with these two shades I am going
to start lining my lower lash line for
this look I'm doing a super dramatic
lower lash line as well so I'm going to
be dragging it a little further down
than I normally would I'm going to start
with those two colors blend them out and
then I'm going to go in with the dark
brown shade and I'm going to darken it
as close to my lashes as possible and
it's going to give it a really pretty
faded look so what I'm also doing is I'm
going to be extending my lower lash line
up to where my eyeliner is and I'm going
to drag my outer crease to match up with
all of that as well you're going to go
back to something with a straight edge
to help you a little bit draw out and
then smudge it out with a blending brush
or a pencil brush or whatever works best
for you
I'm going back in with my two blending
brushes to make sure that it all looks
nice and blended then I'm going back in
with my liner just to go over what the
shadow had already covered and what I
like to do is I like to hook straight in
the mirror with like my chin up and
looking down at it so I can make sure
that my eyes are even especially when
I'm doing one and then I'm filming the
other one and then I'm going back in
with that same highlight color I'm
highlighting under my brows and also in
my tear duct I wiped my brush before I
did this I'm just blending the inner
corner that way the highlight doesn't
look like it was placed just right on
top it looks like it was blended in with
the entire look and for lashes I'm using
these ones by Ardell I cut them in half
and I'm just applying them on the outer
half I really like how that looks I've
been doing that a lot lately as well and
then for liner I'm using this one by
color pop it's like a pretty cherry red
color and has a little metallic in it as
well so I figured well I'm eyelashes
with a red liner today I having never
done that before and I actually really
loved how it came out so for bronzer i'm
using this BH matte bronzer and I'm just
bronzing up my face feel free to use
something with a little shimmer on top
of that as well
for blush today I'm using this cream
blush by Ashley Tisdale it's from her
illuminate cosmetics makeup line so I'm
just taking a little bit on my finger
I'm smudging it on my hand and then I'm
just going to like dab my finger into
the product and then start dabbing it on
my face when you're using a cream blush
you never want to just go straight from
the products right to your face because
sometimes it could just be too much and
it's going to be a little harder to
blend out so I always like to use like a
little bit at first and then you can
always add on so give it a little bit
more pigment in color
to highlight my nose I'm using the same
color that I use throughout this look
and I am just applying that on the
bridge of my nose also on my lips and of
course you guys know I cannot forget to
draw my snot in with my highlighter I
know you guys love it oh so much so
today I'm gonna do the dark cherry lips
that's really what inspired this whole
look and I'm doing a technique that I
had done like way before I even started
on YouTube when I was real ancing I had
actually done this trick for the first
time at a 1920s photo shoot very random
but I just wanted to fill you guys in so
I'm grabbing the new anastacio lip
palette and it's still amazing I was so
excited to try it and I'm taking the
pure black color and I am just applying
this on the outer parts of my list so
for this look I want my lips to be
hombre I want it to fade from a dark
dark red to a lighter red so the trick
of using the black first will really
help make this look a lot easier for you
guys so then I'm grabbing the bright red
shade and I'm applying that in the
center part and slowly blending it into
the black so the next part is all about
patience you just have to sit there and
just create the hombre and I promise you
if you just give it a little time it
will start to look amazing at first it's
going to look a little weird because
there is a lack on your lips but again
you just slowly blend it all into each
other and it's going to give you a
beautiful faded ombre lift
I'm just going to keep blending back and
forth and I'm adding a little tiny bit
of this like magenta color as well so
it's really all about preference what
type of red that you're going for the
beautiful thing about this new kit is
you can mix all different colors
together and create your own concoctions
which is so much fun
so this is the final result I absolutely
loved how it came out it's definitely
super dramatic but I think it's an
amazing love for a night out for a
dinner date if you're going on city or
going out to a club really whatever
plans that you have normally from me
when I do like a dreaded I'll stick with
a neutral lip or if I do like a dramatic
lip stick with a neutral eye but
sometimes it's really fun to spice it up
and try something different and
something outside of your comfort zone
so I hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
tutorial thank you so much for watching
and until next time I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
