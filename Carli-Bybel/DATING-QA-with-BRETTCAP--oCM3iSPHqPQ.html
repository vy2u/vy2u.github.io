Oh wrapped up in my arms I'm
yours if you are mine
to ease no more
I wanna deal
the right way
now one of all
then wake up
hi everyone thank you for watching so
I'm here again with Brett and today
we're going to be answering some of your
questions I posted a status on Facebook
and Twitter asking what you wanted to
know from a guy's perspective on dating
I know
dating can be crazy and the way men
think and the way women think is
complete opposites so we're just gonna
go through a couple questions that you
guys had and we'll let him do most of
the talking but I'll fill in on anything
that I suggest as well so if you guys
want to hear them then please keep
watching you look great though love your
makeup thanks bull
so before we answer some of these
questions Brett you're gonna have to go
into single guy mode and it's gonna be
so whole I know
but majority of your life you were
single so before me of course all the
rules and exceptions change but um so
yeah we'll just go through some of these
so I'm gonna be single Brett today guys
so Carly's not my girlfriend right now
so I am single for the next 12 minutes
well it's pugging to me like a half hour
and then we're gonna cut it thirty
minutes okay let's get started
so Michelle what a cool name Michelle
I've heard that Michelle wants to know
do guys actually enjoy the cute little
gifts we give them ie
cards single Brett says towards getting
gifts and not being in relationship
that's a little bit too clingy in my
opinion I think for the girl to give a
guy a present before you guys really
make it serious it just seems a little
just unorthodox I feel like the guy
should get the girl at present and if
you you know if you um smother a guy
with presents too quick it might scare
him away so that's just my opinion but
if you're in a relationship of course I
would I love gifts from her and I'm just
like thoughtful stuff doesn't have to be
looked at as a gift it could be just as
simple I love you you make my world or
anything okay so I'm gonna come up for
one thing until like let's say I mean
cuz when we first started dating I never
you surprised me with a few gifts which
was okay but I think like if the
holidays are coming or if it's your
birthday and you're kind of just talking
to someone don't you think that
it'd be well yeah that's an exception
yeah and obviously if you want to
exchange gifts but it would be awkward
for the one person because if that one
person got the person a present and the
other one didn't then you would be in a
weird situation yeah I don't think
anybody would want to be in but make
sure before you buy a guy a present if
you're not in a relationship with him
that you try to get a good read on
whether you think he would appreciate it
or get you one back so that's just the
way I would go about it but other than
that I think being thoughtful is a great
thing for not for someone to look at
that as a negative it's just that you
shouldn't waste your time as far as with
that guy you know what I mean I'm gonna
just add a little something in here so I
you said about cards so from a girl's
perspective you think oh my god if a guy
got me a car that's like the cutest
thing and I want to get them card to
tell me I feel I personally don't think
that's the best option for guys like
cards I mean girls love cards he knows I
love cards and in a relationship it's a
different story but I think if you're
just dating or if you're just starting
to talk to somebody maybe if you feel
the need you want to pick up something
small for them maybe maybe he mentioned
once that his favorite candy was Kit
Kats or Reese's and you just stopped by
the store and picked up a bunch of
things but that's it yeah that's my
favorite so maybe like swittel yeah like
maybe like little little things if you
guys are actually like talking but if
he's a jerk to you and it's just really
new I wouldn't even bother buying them
gifts say that let them bite you get x x
Kristina wants to know this is a good
one Kristina why don't men know they
have something good in front of them and
decide to go have their cake and eat it
too I think that's one of the biggest
questions why do guys never why are they
never satisfied with what they have I
think maturity is so big because me and
him we first couple times around it
never worked out because he wasn't ready
and I think for a while
in my opinion I think it's starting to
change a little bit but for a while like
every single song on the radio was about
getting mad bitches and going to strip
clubs and going out with my boys and
having such as a million people and
influency yeah it is it's influences and
like girls go and see Rihanna in Ke$ha
all these girls half-naked and I go well
if I do all these things that's what's
gonna make a guy like me when
turn in reality that's complete opposite
if a guy is actually ready for a
relationship a guy wants a good girl guy
doesn't want a girl that's going out
every night partying drinking taking
shots posting pictures half wasted half
naked you know what I mean so I think
there's like a line where if you are
looking for a relationship and you're
looking for a good guy you have to be a
good girl yeah baby right yeah of course
no she's right I mean it's a guys don't
wanna um guys never want to be satisfied
is the way from keep us on our toes um
unless you're in deep love like me I'm
obviously everything every day is on my
toes but it's it's like when you're
single you don't want it to be one time
and then it's like I well I've got my
fix I'm done you know that's what you
want to avoid but it's also knowing what
the guy possesses his characteristics
stuff that matches with you you know you
can't foresee you're you know good
relationship with him don't waste your
time make sure you know you're getting
stuff until you know what you deserve
stuff like that yeah and um if you're
with somebody who isn't interested in
you feel like you have to keep doing
things to try and keep him interested
maybe you're not with the right guy and
that all comes down to you as an
individual knowing what you want in a
relationship knowing what you deserve in
a relationship and not settling for
something less than that because you're
just wasting your own time because yeah
he might not be the right guy for you
but he might be the right guy for
somebody else so I think everyone can
change if they're with the right person
and I honestly I don't think if you
start dating when you're really young it
could never work out but I think when
you're younger your view on
relationships and your view on what you
want is so different and you have to go
through a bunch of bad relationships so
to say to learn what you do and you
don't like so if you're young and you're
like why is every guy an asshole just
wait it out just have fun for now work
on yourself because I promise you it
takes a while for our guys to mature
sometimes they never do it really
depends on what you surround yourself
with as a person your friends everything
so preserve your pride no I mean as a
girl don't let anybody walk all over
your product and ladies I'm gonna say
this right in the beginning because it's
that important do not sleep with a guy
on the first date or the second date we
waited a really
long time until we did anything because
I just think you need to work on your
emotional relationship before it gets
physical is a nice Tucker no babe you
know what I'm saying it like it was your
finale mystery and it makes you be able
to form an emotional relationship on a
deeper level because if you just go
right into the sexual stuff then you
form a relationship just well let me be
the yang and it all stems back to the
person really you just gotta make sure
you find a good person make sure the guy
you have is a good good egg because you
know I mean a lot of you know little egg
was he's a good little egg love acceptor
and that's a long a long long minutes
sorry we had a lot to say this one is
from Cynthia there's a lot of likes on
it but she's saying it's not really
related to this video but I like this
question she wants to know not relating
to this topic but I've really been
wondering how you both deal with
jealousy and social media it's a
constant issue with my boyfriend and I
um I saw another comment like this where
someone was like well how do you put up
with your boyfriend liking and
commenting on other girls pictures on
Instagram no no your first of all he's
your boyfriend he should not be liking
or commenting any other girls pictures
like why why would you be doing that
because you're interested in other girls
like honey like why are you with me then
like that's not yeah he died mean he
knows better
he wouldn't say I'm you know our
situation is a little different because
I'm not commenting on girls pictures to
be like oh you're hot I'm coming on
girls pictures to help them you know any
means yeah we have a mutual
understanding and we both know II mean
like it's you just gets the way ship you
know you know so there's no um if ands
or buts as far as that goes and I you
know I would never do anything like that
anyway but I think if you are with
somebody and there's a guy and you see
him send it out snapchat you see him
coming to an Instagram you see him
Facebook liking its it's just red flags
yeah all it means is that he's like I
said not satisfied and he's looking for
another way to wet his whistle
you know another ship to dip in to dip
another chip that dip into his dick he
just looking yeah he's just looking he's
just looking for another notch on his
belt of course guys
can have celebrity crushes or certain
girls that they think are hot but
obviously you know they won't get with
so that's a little different I think if
it's like someone who's like more
well-known or someone I said something
to Cynthia if you and your boyfriend go
through that means and you're both
jealous that means that you both have
love for each other find a way to work
through it and you'll be fine you're
just gonna make sure that he knows what
you want and you know what he wants you
guys keep catching yourself commenting
in other people's pictures and stuff
like that then obviously something's
wrong you have to work it out but that's
what a relationships about you know you
don't just do it because it's fun to say
oh I got a girlfriend oh I got a
boyfriend
yeah I mean it's a uphill battle for a
long time and if you're committed and
hundred percent in love and about it and
real and stuff like that shouldn't be
big you know hurdles you should be able
to get through stuff like that so he
loves you you know jealousy stems from
from having a love I feel like you know
yeah yeah I get jealous sometimes I mean
it's hard to walk around you know what I
mean with her with her not that I don't
appreciate it because it kind of like a
compliment but there's situations you
know we're out and there's alcohol being
drank at the place we're at and some guy
wants to be slick you know what he means
stuff like that I will step in you know
and something um if you see your
significant other doing these things
instead of maybe the natural reaction to
just be like well he's gonna do that I'm
gonna do the same thing with guys don't
do that if you have a problem like we've
talked about in our videos multiple
times like it's all about communication
you go to them be like listen like I saw
you liking this girl's pictures and
commenting on it like I personally don't
appreciate it and I would like if you
don't do it anymore
say calmly don't freak out don't flip
out and if it continues to happen then
you know you have a problem there and
that something obviously isn't right and
in that case honey break up with him and
move on because you're better than that
and he'll learn eventually if it wasn't
from you it'll be from somebody else but
now granted it's easy for us to sit up
here and tell you guys I know it's a lot
easier said than done
yeah of course you know got to get
through it and you got to really take
the necessary action that you think is
best and I consider and stand behind
everything I'm saying because I mean yes
I found the perfect guy but I literally
I always was dating you know I always
was looking for
love and the right guy and I've met a
bunch of assholes and I've seen what I
want and what I don't like and that's
how I got to the point I am now and
that's how I got to the point where I
was when I first met him and I mean once
you realize what you want what you don't
want even write it down make a list of
things you don't want so you don't
settle and you don't allow people to
treat you how you don't want to be
treated that's as simple as it is and I
think this day and age girls are too
used to being treated horribly by guys I
mean you have Rihanna for instance who
gets beat up by her boyfriend and then
is back with him publicly which i think
is just absolutely horrific and listen
like this is an age of women being very
powerful and I stand behind all of you
guys and even if it means you're single
till you're 50 years old so be it don't
settle for a guy just because you want
love find it elsewhere within yourself
within activities within your family and
then the right person will come along
and if they don't just keep looking you
know keep going out having fun and a
guy's an asshole to you don't worry it's
not the end of the world like there are
so many assholes out there it's just
life but there are good ones so you got
to go through the bad ones to find the
good ones Monica I love you too she
wants to know is it okay for the girl to
call first after a date that went really
well or does that look desperate this is
this is a really good one I want to hear
your opinion and then I'm gonna get my
opinion in my opinion I don't think the
grocery called should be the guy
pursuing and if he doesn't call you then
wasn't nothing was there that's just my
opinion cut-and-dry nothing else needs
to be said like that opinion plus if you
started with me like that
and he did so I don't know if you guys
have heard of the book called he's just
not that into you but if you haven't I
highly recommend reading it because I
read it like five times and there's also
a movie out and it's really really good
and it answers a lot of questions I
think that maybe we won't get to but um
I don't know I guess I'm kind of old
school I personally think that you
should wait til the guy reaches out to
you I told ya just because I don't know
like trust me if they're interested yeah
exactly if a guy if a guy's into you
like he's gonna be thinking about you
he's gonna want to make plans and if
he's not maybe the spark wasn't there
yet and maybe like for you and your own
head jerk hope I got that date went so
well like we're gonna be in love and oh
my god I can't wait and in his mind it
was like yeah it was a cool girl like
whatever and like that's it but I mean
not saying that something can't come
from that but wait to hear from him
that's my time listen if you if you're
one of those people that you need to
text him you know wait a few days yeah
and then get a feel from that but a good
way to realize would be if you texting
him a few days later and you're not
there's nothing then you knew it wasn't
really just depends on situation when
you a girl should talk cuz what if the
guy's really shy or like yeah you know
guy could be shy but you you need to get
these types of clues when you're in
person with them yeah that's why I like
all you see all these people being
catfished United mean like in your
interpersonal conversation is it a word
yeah I think sensor person I get you
like that's yeah we're yeah talking to
somebody and saying things and seeing
how they react genuinely is very
important very important which is why I
like a lot of these online relationships
don't really last because X in the phone
and talk to any girl for a year and I
could make it out like I'm the best
freaking guy in the world I could be the
next George Clooney and I ain't but if
you're in front of the girl and you
wanted to talk like that I guarantee you
find out a lot about each other and
you'll get those clues that you need
whether you make the text that next day
or you should expect one or stuff like
that so these are all things remember
like we said preserve your pride as a
woman need to preserve your product you
can't come out desperate because that's
just that really like will it make scary
guy away because a guy doesn't want that
guy wants a chance
you know when a guy knows that a girl
knows the guy wants a challenge
it makes him that much more like I got a
really try you know any means so give
him a challenge guys need challenges the
right guys do I was challenged heavily
and not not like a Soviet like something
or like what kind of twisted games can i
play oh yeah don't play the game I don't
don't how to start with the games you
don't if you want the games played back
to you like don't dish it out you mean
yeah unless exactly if you unless you
like games if that's something that you
then that's great bionics I hate games
and I know she does too and she wasn't
like that at first though she did a very
good job at making it realize that she
wasn't gonna come on a silver platter
you know any mean it was step up your
game I had to really know what I wanted
and it took me a little while but it
definitely you know I'm not not getting
any decisions so amber wants to know is
it appropriate to still talk to your ex
when you're in a new relationship what
is the man's view on that one know if
you're I mean if it's your ex-wife and
she has your kids you know anyway quiet
but uh no X's but X's I mean like X is
pulled to anything to put their ex into
trouble too so if something happens make
sure like we said you know what's going
on you know the situation because you
don't want to make any harsh judgments
too fast so if your counterparts
deliberately talking to your to their ex
somes going on and we hear this a lot
you know you're hear about people going
back to their acts and talking and we're
like catching them yeah you need to make
sure that if you see anything involving
the ex that you figure out what the
hell's going on right there alright so
this way um you could really make the
right judgment because that's gonna be
important you know you don't you don't
want to write them off immediately you
just want to figure out what's going on
if they're talking to me like oh how's
everything going you know how you doing
how's everything I'm so happy you know
it could be a good good conversation but
then you know if he or her is fooling
around that's something you got to find
out and then you make the necessary
action but as far as talking to your
excellent necessarily think it's
terrible if you guys are just seeing how
you're doing you know if there's like a
friend dang I just think it's like I
mean it's kind of stupid but yeah it's
stupid but like if it's like a what's
you know if
they just want to see how you're doing
like I could see why you know any mean
but like as far as make keeping friends
with your ex when you have a girlfriend
or boyfriend no I wouldn't think that
was right Betty wants to know how to
overcome trust issues how can I trust my
ex again when he has let me down so many
times I mean it depends what did he let
you down with her did he cheat on you
because I don't think cheating is ever
acceptable and if he did cheat on you
then you deserve a lot better and unless
he's doing a million-in-one things to
prove how much he messed up and it was
only one time and it'll never happen
again in yada yada yada maybe give him
another chance but I mean really like
once a cheater always a cheater
that's how that's what I think at least
right for now that will be all for the
questions it's kind of fun going through
all of these and giving our advice and I
think the main thing learned hopefully
from this video is that if you want to
be in a great healthy relationship you
really need to focus on you first and
you need to set your own goal set your
own restrictions what you want what you
don't want what you'll accept what you
won't accept and you're probably like
you still keep saying like hang on to
your pride because you will find someone
right out there for you and even if you
feel like you're with the right person
and they're treating you horrible that's
what that's not the right person you
deserve more you're better than that and
if you're going through a breakup right
now don't worry it will get better and
it's these hard miserable times in life
that make you a better person that teach
you life lessons and I don't know
there's a sprinkler going off outside
hope you guys can't hear that but you
have anything to say pups no so this
girl
thanks Tamil Indian I'm just happy that
you know I had all those miserable
experiences because then again it made
me set a like an expectation so to say
like he knew he had a lot to do to prove
that he was a good person and he does it
every single day and that's what I
wanted and that's what I did I set my
expectations and he's been going above
and beyond ever since so best of luck to
all of you guys out there hopefully this
video helped a little bit and
you guys want more videos like this feel
free to leave some questions below and
maybe we will do another one but till
next time see you guys later mine
don't we smile or die
so I want to live
you
right we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
