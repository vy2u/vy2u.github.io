so cute I can't stand gonna help me you
like that video we want to pick which
socks it's the first thing that you're
going to need is a plain pair of pumps
doesn't matter which color if you're
going to use a lighter colored sock I'd
recommend using either a white or a nude
pair if they're a little darker then you
can use black or any dark shades as I
was sitting here filming this bear made
it a little bit difficult for me and he
keeps popping out he thinks it's a game
he's such a little cutie but what I'm
doing is I'm taking a pair of socks and
I'm putting them over the heel I'm going
to stretch them over the heel and pull
them up you want to make sure that the
sock is super tight underneath your feet
I did this with about four or five
colors just to show you guys different
color options and this gray one was the
first pair that I did also for this I
just poked my hole right through since
the sock was really thin if you do have
a thicker sock you can use a scissor
which I will show you guys another color
on how I did that as well
so once you pull it up you create a
little hole at the bottom and then you
pull them tight and then there you go
those are your little boot socks so if
you're just wearing them around the
house or you're wearing them like one
time you could just leave them like this
they might be a little bit slippery so
if you do actually want to wear them out
I'm not sure exactly how many uses you
can get out of them but you can do this
option as well what you have to do is
just get some sandpaper I picked this
one up from Michaels I got the hot glue
gun as well from Michaels and I think
for everything it was like under 20
dollars so it's definitely way more
affordable to do this then go out and
buy a pair Easy's so I'm just cutting a
piece of sandpaper in the shape of the
front part of my shoe and I'm going to
hot glue that on that way it's going to
add a little traction to the bottom of
the socks so if you want to wear them
out you can actually wear them out
without slipping all over the place so
you just want to cut it make sure it's
going to fit perfectly and then
why the hot flew all around the edges
then just going to stick that on to the
bottom of the shoe and make sure you
press down firmly and that it's all
sticking down if you have to glue the
little edges a little bit do that that
way you don't see it when you are
wearing them and then you're gonna
repeat that with the other shoe and
that's as simple as it is so it's really
cool I went out and I bought a couple
different colored socks because I wanted
to try it out with a couple different
colors I don't have boots all these
colors so it was definitely a really
cool alternative it was super easy to do
and I originally saw this idea from the
new vogue on Instagram as soon as I saw
it I knew I wanted to try it out so I
went out and picked up some affordable
socks and I recreated it today for you
guys and I absolutely loved how it came
out so if you guys do decide to try it
make sure to hashtag me so I can see
what color socks you end up using but I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys in there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
