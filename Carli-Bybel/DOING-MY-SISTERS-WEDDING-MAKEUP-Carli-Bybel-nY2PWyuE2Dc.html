those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and this is my big sister manza
everyone and she's getting married in
less than three weeks which is so crazy
I'm so happy for you believe how fast
that way no I feel like we just started
planning it don't you just got engaged
it was over a year ago yeah quick ring
shot today I was doing her trial for her
wedding because I am doing her makeup so
I figured I would film it for you guys
because I know a lot of you have
requested a bridal makeup look so do you
like have a keen eye I love it I was
cried yeah she was cuz she's an artist
so yeah this is how we're gonna do her
makeup for the day of and her hair we're
not gonna tell you what it is but I'm
gonna blog everything so you'll get to
see her and her dress and everything cuz
it's literally the most amazing dress
I've ever seen but if you guys want to
learn how i got this makeup look right
here then please keep watching was that
by or should we do it redo it i think
it's cute anything you want to see to
start off today's look i'm using this
eyeshadow primer by Too Faced cosmetics
I'm then grabbing my Carli bybel palette
and I'm picking up this nude matte shade
and I'm applying that all over her
eyelid grabbing the morphe 35 K palette
and this light brown shade I'm grabbing
my Sigma e-40 brush and I'm applying
that right into her crease just the tip
for anyone who's doing someone else's
makeup one thing I always like to do
when I did do freelance work was I would
always start off maybe a little bit
lighter than what they requested that
way at the end if they want to add more
and add more darkness you can do that
it's always harder to lighten up the
look as opposed to adding more darkness
to it grabbing this darker Brown cool
shade and my Sigma e25 I'm going to
start blending that right into my crease
below the lighter shade grabbing that
same color with my Sigma e30 I'm just
gonna start blending that right into the
crease as well this is gonna really
accentuate the crease and make your eyes
appear larger so I'm gonna slowly drag
that up and then I'm going back to my
blending brush and I'm just gonna blend
it all out I asked her to show me a
couple pictures of what kind of look she
was going for and she really wanted to
keep it pretty neutral on the eyes with
a little bit of shimmer she doesn't wear
a lot of makeup on a day-to-day basis so
I thought champagnes and browns would be
perfect for her for her wedding day
picking up the pigment called clove from
obsessive-compulsive cosmetics I'm
applying that on the outer half of her
eyelid so for the lid I wanted like a
really pretty shimmer ombre so I'm then
grabbing this highlight shade from my
Carli bybel palette I'm applying it next
to it and then I'm going back to my
palette and I'm picking up this white
highlight shade and I'm applying that in
the inner part of her eyelid so it's
gonna give it a really pretty ombre look
then grabbing this medium matte brown
shade I'm just gonna apply that a little
bit on the outer part of the lid for
liner I'm using this one by Physicians
Formula I basically ran out of it and I
tried to reorder it and it's sold out so
my second recommendation for you guys is
the Kat Von D ink liner I like that one
a lot too for lashes I'm using the
Christina lashes the WSP they're my
favorite moving onto her skin I'm first
applying the climate control which is by
sentence I'm using four pumps and I'm
applying that all over her face I'm then
going in with four drops of the non-gay
oil she's as these two products every
day as well and she really likes how it
works on her skin so that's why I am
doing that first to mattify her face I
am using the cover FX primer and you
guys can see how it instantly mattifies
her for a foundation I'm using the
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation I
originally went in with number 5 but I
added a little bit of number 4 as well
just to match her perfectly and I know
we're a little late in this video to
bring it up but I wanted to apologize in
advance for my nails in this video I
know they do not look cute at all I got
a manicure today but she didn't have
time so don't judge me grabbing this
part foundation brush and one pump of
number four and number five I'm then
gonna apply this down her neck to cream
contour her today I'm using this
graftobian palette I'm using the second
darkest shade and I'm going to apply
that on her forehead her cheeks and then
I'm gonna
and contour her nose so to contour her
nose I'm going to apply that on the tip
and I'm also gonna apply it on the sides
of her nose now if you guys are used to
seeing me contour my nose I always
extend the lines up into my eye shadow
but since her nose is a little more
narrow on the top of her nose I'm not
gonna drag those lines up any further
I'm also gonna be applying the contour
shades in between her Cupid's bow under
her lip and also her jaw line then for
concealer I'm picking up the shade light
neutral and I'm going to be applying
this under her eyes on her smile lines
her chin and also in between her brows
then I'm gonna start blending out all
the contour shades if you guys want you
can blend the contour before you apply
the concealer I just wanted to show you
guys where I was placing everything so
that's why I left it all on to blend out
the concealer I am using a damp Beauty
Blender this is my absolute favorite
product for concealer one trick that I
like to do is when I am blending out the
concealer on my smile lines if you blow
out your cheeks and then blend it and
then when you set it do the same thing
it's gonna help prevent those smile
lines from coming through so just a
little trick
to blend out her nose contour I'm
applying a little bit more of that
concealer right on the sides of her nose
and then with this tart brush I'm gonna
do like a patting motion and I'm gonna
blend it upwards towards the darkness
then to set her under eyes I am making
her look up I'm gonna blend out all of
the creases and then I'm gonna go in
with my Kat Von D setting powder so as
you can see I'm just gonna blend out any
areas that will usually crease with the
concealer and then when I said it's
gonna help prevent all those lines from
coming back then moving on to brows I am
using the Anastasia brow Wiz in the
color evany for her and I'm just gonna
first use the pencil to shape out her
brows make sure they're even and then
I'm gonna go in with the ebony brow
powder and just fill them in a little
bit more to set her nose contour I am
using a little bit of the two lighter
shades in my Kat Von D palette then I'm
just taking the same brush that I used
to set my under eyes and I'm just gonna
do circular motions to remove all the
excess powder to set her brows I'm using
the Anastasia clear brow gel and then
I'm just gonna apply a little bit of
this model in a bottle setting spray
onto her face
going back to my shoot and light palette
I'm grabbing the middle bronze shade and
I'm just gonna bronze up everywhere that
I had used the cream contour then
grabbing my Kat Von D foundation powder
and this smaller Sigma brush I'm just
gonna apply this underneath her eyes and
on the sides of her nose it's gonna
really brighten up the middle of the
face and it's gonna help lift up that
area which in turn is gonna help make
the nose contour look better as well
going in with my pencil brush and the
darkest cool brown shade I'm gonna start
applying that on the outer half of her
eyelid then picking up this lighter
matte shade I'm gonna apply that on the
inner half of her eye
going back to my white highlight shade
I'm going to apply this right in the
tear duct of her eye and just brighten
that up as well and then I'm grabbing
the brown shimmer shade from my palette
and I'm applying that right on the inner
half of the lower lash line I'm applying
a little bit of setting powder under her
eyes while I apply her bottom mascara
this is just gonna help prevent any
darkness from appearing under her eyes
grabbing this pink champagne highlight
color from my palette I'm then gonna
highlight her nose I always like to
highlight the nose like an exclamation
point so a little dot at the tip and
then up the bridge for lip liner I'm
using Lolita by Kat Von D and then for
lips she's using some of her favorite
lip scents products these products don't
wipe off so that's why she wanted to use
it for her wedding
she did one layer of first love and then
two layers of pink champagne it ended up
being a little bit too nude so we added
a pink layer in a minute which I will
show you so the key to using these are
applying very thin layers and then
sealing it off with a gloss and it's
smudge proof all day which is really
cool
moving on to blush I am using my BH nude
blush palette and I'm picking up this
pink color once we put on the blush
that's when I realized like I wanted the
lips to be a little bit more on the pink
side so I'm adding one layer of the
color goddess and then I'm putting the
gloss back on it that way it seals it in
and we both agreed that it was like the
perfect pink color for her so I am
finishing off her look by spraying a
model in a bottle all over her face
which is one of my old favorite setting
sprays and that is it like a lip color
the lip color is perfect yeah yeah I
think we did that extra layer pink is
perfect yeah very shot really awesome do
you think mom I love it where am I gonna
picture look at me you're amazing so
this is the final results how gorgeous
you look so you love it I love it would
you change anything I wouldn't you just
no sorry we have mom in the background
trying to keep the toy away from Cindy
and she's making it go off more than
cindello
so this was her trial so I was prepared
to maybe like do a couple different
things but she really liked talking
about the first time around
I'm done yeah I think it looks so
amazing on you so beautiful when you
guys see her dress you're just gonna die
so well thank you for being in this
video with me today of course and so
next time see you guys like hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
